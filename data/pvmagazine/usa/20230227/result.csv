Total solar generation was up 25%, breaking through 200,000 GWh for the year.
The record deployment volumes of 2020 and 2021 are the main factors behind this increase. If it were not for ongoing solar panel import difficulties and general inflation, solar’s contribution to electricity generation might have reached 5% in 2022. The data was released by the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) in their Electric Power Monthly. This release includes data from December 2022, as well as the rest of the data from 2022.

Solar as a percentage of monthly electricity generation ranged from a low of almost 3% in January, to just over 6% in April. April’s production marked a new monthly record for solar generation in the US.
Total generation of solar electricity peaked in July, at 21,708 GWh. Over the course of the year, solar production reached  202,256 GWh, and total U.S. electricity generation reached 4,303,980 GWh. Total US electricity generation increased by 3.5% over the 4,157,467 GWh produced in 2021.

In 2022, wind energy contributed 10.1% of the total electricity generated in the United States. Wind and solar together produced 14.8% of U.S. electricity in 2022, growing from the 13% recorded in 2021. In April, when solar power peaked at just over 6%, wind and solar power together reached a peak of slightly over 20%, a new monthly record for the two energy sources.
In total, emissions free energy sources such as wind, solar photovoltaic and thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, and geothermal, accounted for 37.9% of the total electricity generated in the U.S. This value is barely higher than 2020’s 37.7% – but represents a return to growth after 2021 saw a decrease in emission free electricity to 37%.
Nuclear power was the most significant contributor to emission free electricity, making up a bit more than 45% of the total emissions free electricity. Wind energy ranked second at 26%, followed by hydroelectricity at 15%, and solar photovoltaic at 12%.
PV Intel
Emissions free electricity is a different summation than the EIA’s ‘Renewable Energy’ category. The Renewable Energy category also includes:
Nuclear produced 17.9% of the total U.S. electricity, a value that has generally stayed flat over the years. However, since nuclear facilities are being retired faster than new facilities are coming online, nuclear production has fallen in the past two years. After multiple long delays, we will probably see reactor three of the Vogtle nuclear facility come online in 2023. Reactor four is officially scheduled to come online later this year.
Hydroelectric production also declined in 2022, due to drought conditions in the southwestern United States. With rain and snow storms in California and the southwest, hydroelectricity generation may rebound in 2023.

Coast Energy, a private equity-backed commercial and industrial (C&I) solar and storage developer, announced the acquisition of an 8.6 MW brownfield solar project located near Brookhaven, N.Y., in Suffolk County, N.Y., from i.on Renewables, a White Plains, N.Y. solar developer.
The brownfield solar project site spans 35 acres of limited use, capped landfill where over 16,000 solar panels will be constructed using a fixed-tilt, ballasted installation. The solar facility will feed into utility Public Service Enterprise Group – Long Island’s (PSEG-LI) grid.
Coast Energy will own, operate and perform ongoing maintenance on the Brookhaven solar system upon completion.
“This project is a perfect illustration of how we work with our development partners to make distributed solar power generation a reality,” says Kip Perry, chief development officer at Coast Energy. ” Co-development opportunities play a big role in our continued expansion throughout the U.S., and we’re looking forward to completing the late-stage development and breaking ground in Brookhaven.”
“The collaboration between the Town of Brookhaven and Coast Energy is another big step toward creating the energy park at our Yaphank waste management facility that has been our goal for many years,” said Ed Romaine, town supervisor of Brookhaven, N.Y.
In April 2022, Coast Energy received a growth investment from Houston-based investment firm Crosstimbers Capital Group to accelerate its commercial solar development and power purchase agreement financing platform.Following the investment, Coast Energy managed just over $400 million of solar, storage and other distributed generation assets across the U.S.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s federal landfill database, the Brookhaven landfill site is a 90-plus acre landfill site in Yaphank, N.Y., opened in 1974 and closed in 1990 at capacity of 8.1 million tons of landfill waste.
Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) estimates there are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the country, enough to power 7.8 million homes with clean energy. RMI said more than 63 GW of solar power plant capacity could be located at less than half of US landfills, generating 83 terawatt hours of electricity each year across all 50 states. The plants also could generate more than $6.6 billion annually in electricity revenue. 
According to the EPA, around 428 MW of utility-scale landfill solar across 126 projects had been installed at the end of 2019. Notably, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are home to 73% of all US utility-scale landfill solar projects.
CEP Renewables recently completed work on the largest recorded landfill solar project in the U.S., the 25.6 MW Mount Olive, N.J., facility. The development company has 16 landfill or brownfield solar projects under development.
The Inflation Reduction Act includes a $3 billion carveout called the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, which provides investments to community-led projects that address disproportionate environmental and public health harms related to pollution and climate change. Various funding mechanisms of the IRA will provide incentives to landfill redevelopment into clean energy projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/27/lithium-battery-recycler-loaned-375-million-for-new-york-hub/,"BATTERY,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 27, 2023",Lithium battery recycler loaned $375 million for New York hub,"Lithium-ion battery recycler Li-Cycle announced the successful close of a $375 million conditional loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Technologies Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program, supporting the buildout of its Rochester, N.Y.  recycling facility hub. 
The planned facility encompasses a 65 acre, 14-building hydrometallurgical or wet chemistry hub plant that refines battery-grade materials from battery “black mass.” Once complete, it will be the largest of its kind in North America and Europe, while the company expects commissioning for the facility to begin in 2023, with engineering, procurement, and construction already underway.
Black mass is generated from pre-processed retired lithium-ion batteries at the company’s distributed local “spoke” facilities. The black mass is then transferred to a “hub” facility like the Rochester plant, where it is reclaimed as usable battery materials. The company said its process has an up to 95% recycling efficiency rate.
The Loan Programs Office conditional loan follows extensive technical, market, financial, and legal due diligence evaluating the company’s first lithium-ion battery resource recovery facility in North America. The DOE loan will have a term of up to 12 years from financial close, and interest will be based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Rates from the date of each advance for the loan. 
“Our process is a submerged shredding process,” said Tim Johnston, executive chairman, Li-Cycle. “There’s a number of key benefits to this, one being that we can process all form factors of lithium-ion batteries. It doesn’t matter the size; it doesn’t matter the chemistry: from the smallest format lithium-ion battery all the way through to the largest electric vehicle module.”
The Rochester Hub is expected to become a significant domestic source of battery-grade materials, including lithium, nickel and cobalt, and will be the first-of-its-kind commercial facility in North America.
“$375 million will now supercharge Li-Cycle here in Rochester, with 270 good-paying jobs, to become one of America’s largest suppliers of recycled materials for batteries,” said Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY). “Last year, I stood alongside Li-Cycle’s powerhouse workforce and promised I would push to deliver federal funding to spark more growth, and now thanks to the investments I secured in the Inflation Reduction Act, Rochester will help power America’s drive to lead in battery technology.”
A stable supply of lithium and other critical battery materials considered by DOE to be a matter of national security. The materials are needed to support EV battery demand and energy storage ranging from residential to grid-scale. While the U.S. is making strides toward manufacturing batteries, it is limping behind in the race for raw materials. China currently has over 80% of the world’s lithium refining capacity, over 60% for cobalt, and more than a third of global nickel refinement, said the report.
(Read: “Recycling: a key in the U.S. quest for lithium-ion battery supply chain relevancy”)
A Wood Mackenzie report projects a need for a 70% rise in U.S. production of nickel by 2040; 200% for cobalt; and 600% for lithium. China has positioned itself well for the future of these resources, increasing ownership of cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, lithium in Chile, and nickel in Indonesia.
“This DOE investment in Li-Cycle will reduce our reliance on China and strengthen America’s battery supply chain. And once the facility is at full steam, it is projected to be the biggest source of lithium carbonate in the United States. That means the heart of hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles, which will soon dominate our roads, will be made with battery components from right here in Rochester,” said Schumer.

First Solar’s Series 6 Plus modules are designed and developed at the company’s research and development facilities in California and Ohio, and manufactured in Ohio.
The deal expands upon the master supply agreement between the two solar businesses that includes a 4 GW transaction announced in April 2022 and, more recently, a 700 MW commitment announced in October 2022. Whereas the prior agreements will supply Silicon Ranch projects through 2025, the 1.5 GW follow-on order will serve projects in 2026 and 2027.
Silicon Ranch has demonstrated a commitment to support domestic manufacturing and to lower the carbon impact of production through large supply agreements with First Solar and Nextracker, as well as a partnership with SOLARCYCLE.
“Through this thoughtful collaboration, we have gained not only the tools we need to best serve the communities where we locate our solar projects, but also the opportunity to further strengthen the domestic solar supply chain and to bring more manufacturing jobs to the U.S.,” said Reagan Farr, co-founder and chief executive officer at Silicon Ranch.
Over the last year, U.S. module supplier First Solar has procured additional multi-year orders from Intersect Power (7.3 GW), Arevon Energy (2 GW), Swift Current Energy (2 GW) and National Grid Renewables (1.6 GW) and Origis Energy (750 MW).
The company recently named Alabama as the site for its fourth manufacturing facility. The Alabama factory is part of the company’s plan to scale its U.S. manufacturing footprint to over 10 GWDC by 2025. The factory represents an investment of approximately $1.1 billion and is expected to be commissioned by 2025, with a planned annual capacity of 3.5 GWDC.
For 2023, the developer is nearing completion on two near-term solar facilities for social media giant Meta, the 125 MWAC DeSoto I Solar Farm in Lee County, Georgia, and the 70 MWAC McKellar Solar Farm in Madison County, Tennessee.
In response to global solar module supply constraints, developers like Silicon Ranch are seeking U.S.-made solar modules and hardware. Import tariffs, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and the domestic content adder in the Inflation Reduction Act are a few of the market forces behind the push for domestic procurement.
Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar will report its Q4 2022 and full year 2022 earnings after the market closes tomorrow, February 28, and hold a conference call at 4:30pm ET.

Sono Motors has decided to terminate the development of Sion solar electric vehicles, so it can focus on a capital-light, “solar-only business.” The Munich-based company, which went public in November 2021, said on Friday that it is laying off 300 employees due to the change in its business model. COO Thomas Hausch is also stepping down from his role.
The company’s decision to end the Sion program appears to be driven by the high cost of its business plan, coupled with “depressed capital market conditions.” Sono Motors said an estimated 90% of its funding needs for 2023 were dedicated to the solar car program.
Sono Motors first publicly presented its plans for the Sion solar electric car in 2017. The Sion was marketed as the world’s first affordable solar EV, with a price tag of about $26,000.
Sion’s outer shell featured 456 monocrystalline solar half cells to extend the time between charges and enable self-sufficiency on short journeys. Its 54 kWh lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery would allow for a maximum charging capacity of up to 75 kW (DC) and 11 kW (AC). The vehicle also had an 11 kW, on-board bidirectional charger.
However, pre-series production of the Sion remained beyond reach, as Sono Motors has repeatedly failed to secure enough funding. In December, it launched the #savesion campaign to offer customers €3,000 ($3,180) discounts in exchange for advance payments. It aimed to secure €100 million ($106 million).
Sono’s plan was to start production of the Sion car in Finland in the second half of 2023. However, “given the resource-intensive nature of the Sion program, including personnel requirements, the company is now implementing a significant cost reduction program,” it said in a statement.
“It was a difficult decision and despite more than 45,000 reservations and pre-orders for the Sion, we were compelled to react to the ongoing financial market instability and streamline our business,” said Laurin Hahn, the CEO of Sono Motors.
The company said the success of its 18-vehicle series-validation program proved the viability of its solar electric vehicle concept. This is why it will continue to use its proprietary polymer-based vehicle-integrated solar technology, but only by retrofitting and integrating the tech into third-party vehicles.
It also plans to sell its Sion program. In addition to the passenger car program, it will offer PV solutions for buses, e-vans, and refrigerated vehicles. It will launch its Solar Bus Kit retrofit solution in the second half of 2023, the company said on Friday.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/27/california-adds-4-gw-of-solar-to-mid-term-reliability-order/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 27, 2023",California adds 4 GW of solar to mid-term reliability order,"Through 2027, California will now add 35% more solar energy to its grid than previously planned. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) ordered an additional 4 GW to be interconnected by load-serving entities.
The addition of 4 GW brings the state’s mid-term reliability procurement requirement to 15.5 GW by 2027. To date, California has nearly 40 GW of capacity installed, meaning the procurement plan alone would require roughly 40% growth upon cumulative operating assets.
The call for more solar came as a result of updated load forecasting from the California Energy Commission that suggested electricity demand is increasing faster than what was observed during the June 2021  procurement order for 11.5 GW of new capacity. The CPUC said additional capacity is needed to address “the increasing and accelerating impacts of climate change, [and] the likelihood of some additional fossil-fueled generation resource retirements that were not anticipated at the time.”
The Commission added that the likelihood of project delays beyond 2026 in the procurement of long lead-time resources led to a raised procurement order. It also projected that California will not be able to rely on electricity imports from other states, particularly from the Pacific Northwest, a region which the state currently taps for meeting seasonal demand.
The original 2021 order called for 2 GW of resources in 2023, another 6 GW in 2024, and installments of 1.5 GW in 2025 and 2 GW in 2026, and now brings another 4 GW in requirements throughout 2026 and 2027.
“We believe the conclusion to be consistent with our internal analysis on system reliability needs,” said Paul Doherty, spokesperson for utility Pacific Gas & Electric.
Doherty said PG&E shares the commission’s urgency regarding the pace and effects of climate change and supports the commission updating its reliability assessment with higher load forecasts, volatility and increased assumptions of fossil fuel plant retirements.
Longer-term, the CPUC estimates that the state will need as much as 35 GW of new resources on the system to meet both reliability and emissions goals.
In response to the increased procurement order, the California Community Choice Association said that interconnection costs and delays stand in the way of these goals. “The commission should work with the CAISO to improve the interconnection study process, urge transmission owners to shorten interconnection times, and reevaluate the deliverability methodology as the current method is too restrictive,” it stated.
CPUC responded that it is not within its jurisdiction to control interconnection, and that while it is “sympathetic” to load-serving entities’ desire to interconnect more quickly, “shortcuts” should not be taken so as to avoid reliability issues.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/27/thermal-battery-offers-fast-efficient-performance-at-low-cost/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 27, 2023","Thermal battery offers fast, efficient performance at low cost","From pv magazine global.
Thermal energy storage systems use temperature shifts to store energy for later use, or for use at other locations. The most commonly used ways to capture energy are based on latent and sensible heat transfers.
The former heat method uses the amount of thermal energy needed for a phase change – which is a change in physical state, such as from solid to liquid, or liquid to gas – without altering the temperature of a material. This technique is associated with large energy densities. The latter is the thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a material without causing any phase transitions. A major advantage of this heat transfer method is its low cost.
Now, engineers at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, with support from the U.S. Department of Energy, have developed a new thermal energy system that combines the best of both techniques. The Lehigh Thermal Battery consists of engineered cementitious materials and thermosiphons in a combination that enables fast, efficient thermal performance at low cost. The technology can operate with heat or electricity as the charging energy input.
The team has announced that, after three years of research and development, the Lehigh Thermal Battery is now market-ready. The process involved integrated system testing at 3, 10 and 150 kilowatt-hours thermal (kWhth) in a relevant environment.
The 150-kWhth prototype built at the Energy Research Center is a fully instrumented structure containing 22 finned thermosyphons. The 150-kWhth prototype has been tested extensively using compressed air at 896 F, producing an energy-to-energy charge/discharge efficiency of the solid media of more than 95%, uniform temperature distribution in the solid media during charging, and consistent cyclic repeatability.
The average power rates achieved during charging and discharging were 16.4 kWth and 19.8 kWth, respectively, with a very fast energy gradient of the thermal battery of 0.51 kWhth/min during the first hour of discharge.
Co-principal investigator Sudhakar Neti, professor emeritus in the Department of Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering at Lehigh, claimed that the technology is innovative on many levels.
“It is modular, designed for independent energy input/output streams during charging/discharging, which is feasible with the help of the thermosyphons, and the two-phase change process inside the thermosyphon tubes allows rapid isothermal heat transfer to/from the storage media at very high heat transfer coefficients and heat rates,” said Neti.
Carlos Romero, co-principal investigator on the project and the director of the Energy Research Center at Lehigh, said that the concrete plus thermosiphon concept is unique among heat energy storage concepts.
“The technology offers the potential for adaptation over a broad range of temperatures, and heat transfer media and operating conditions,” said Romero.
These qualities make the Lehigh Thermal Battery suitable for decarbonization opportunities in energy-intense industry sectors, the flexibilization of conventional power plants, and advancements and penetration of concentrated solar power.
“Another opportunity for the Lehigh Thermal Battery to play an important role in the decarbonization effort is the integration of thermal energy storage in a system that includes heat pumps and Organic Rankine Cycles, working with surplus renewable electricity,” said Neti.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/27/credit-renewables-and-storage-fairly-for-their-capacity-value-says-esig/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 27, 2023","Credit renewables and storage fairly for their capacity value, says ESIG","Looking toward the next phase of the energy transition, when renewables, storage and load flexibility will increasingly be used to ensure grid reliability, a report from Energy Systems Integration Group (ESIG) considers how individual resources should be credited for their contribution to resource adequacy. ESIG is a nonprofit educational organization whose mission is to chart the future of grid transformation and energy systems integration.
The report uses the term “capacity accreditation” to describe this process, and says that other common terms are capacity credit, capacity value, capacity contribution, effective capacity, or firm capacity. The resource adequacy metric aims to ensure that a system has enough resources to serve all customers at all times.
Capacity accreditation “is often applied only to wind, solar, and storage,” says the report, even though “large portions” of thermal generating capacity can go offline simultaneously due to extreme weather and fuel supply disruptions, citing Winter Storm Uri and Winter Storm Elliott.
These omissions “at best over-compensate gas and coal resources for their reliability contributions; at worst, they pose an unrecognized reliability challenge for the grid,” says a fact sheet accompanying the report. To address this problem, the report’s first recommended “pillar” of resource accreditation is that it be non-discriminatory, and its first “key consideration” is that accreditation should be expanded and applied to all resource types.

The second key consideration is that “there is a need to link simulated accreditation” based on power system modeling “with actual operations.” An accompanying fact sheet puts it more bluntly, saying “pay resources for what they do, not for what they are.”
As the grid transitions to increasing shares of variable renewables and energy-limited resources, such as 4-hour batteries, the report proposes that the method for crediting capacity for any resource should be robust, and ultimately should credit the expected capacity and energy available from resources during periods of high risk.

The report describes two options for simplifying the capacity accreditation process: the marginal reliability improvement process, and a loss-of-load probability (LOLP) capacity factor approach.
The LOLP capacity factor approach “only requires a single resource adequacy simulation” to set the unserved energy hours and “does not require iterative modeling for each resource type,” the report says. As a result, “it can easily be applied to all resource classes and even individual resources in a consistent, non-discriminatory manner.”
The report, titled “Ensuring efficient reliability: New design principles for capacity accreditation,” was produced by ESIG’s task force on redefining resource adequacy, and prepared by Derek Stenclik, the task force chair and a founding partner of Telos Energy. The report concludes with six recommendations.

A new program will focus on developing power grid technologies that improve control and protection of the domestic power grid, helping to increase efficiency and reduce outages, which are estimated to cost the U.S. economy $150 billion annually.
The new effort by DOE will fund projects that enable utilities to more effectively control grid power flow to avoid disturbances, and quickly isolate and route around disruptions. Modernizing the nation’s grid infrastructure with improved efficiency and resilience against extreme weather events is necessary to support the increasing amount of clean energy sent to the grid.
“A reliable and resilient grid is the key to protecting our power supply from outside threats and expanding America’s clean energy and transportation options,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Federal investments in tools and analysis to modernize our grid will put the nation on a path to meet President Biden’s climate goals and extend the benefits of a decarbonized energy and transportation sector to all corners of the country.”
The rapid growth of solar in the U.S. is calling attention to the need to modernize the grid. According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) monthly update,  projects listed as actively under construction currently total over 25.4 GW in capacity. This adds to the 107.5 GW of solar that exists on the U.S. grid today.  Managed by DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), the “Unlocking Lasting Transformative Resiliency Advances by Faster Actuation of power Semiconductor Technologies” (ULTRAFAST)” program will support the development of faster, more capable power electronics for enhanced resiliency, reliability, and control of power flow at all grid interfaces. Successful ULTRAFAST project teams will develop device concepts that target:
