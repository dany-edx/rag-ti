Completed in 2019, the facility was among the largest module manufacturing plants in the US, providing jobs for some 160 plant employees and 60 contracted workers. According to LG, those employees will be offered transition support and severance packages commensurate with their tenure with the company.
A representative with LG shared with pv magazine that the solar decision does not impact other LG operations and investments in Huntsville, as LG also has technical call center and service training center located at the Huntsville campus.
In exiting solar, the company explained that the decision came due to increased material and logistics costs, as well as severe supply constraints. The company said it will now focus on energy storage systems and home energy management.
(Read: “LG exits solar module business“)
In November, LG announced a partnership with Sunverge to develop a residential virtual plant project with customers in Northern and Central California. The project is intended to explore ways in which intelligent and dynamic load control and solar/energy storage can be aggregated as dynamic multi-service and multi-asset VPPs to create value on both sides of the meter and helping utilities transition to more resilient and flexible distribution grids.
In its latest financial results, LG reported a slight increase in revenue for the BS division despite the “sluggish performance” of its solar module business. However, the most recent Solar Market Intel Report, released by EnergySage, LG was shown to be the third-most quoted manufacturer in the US, trailing just REC and Panasonic. Moreover, Industry analysts Roth Capital Partners suggest that LG represents 14% of U.S. residential solar module supply, with data from Ohm Analytics supporting this claim and showing a roughly 13% market share. 
In transitioning to energy storage systems and home energy management, LG has made significant advancements in those fields in recent history. LG is the battery supplier for  Vistra’s Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in California, providing more than 4,500 TR1300 battery racks for the installation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/23/polysilicon-price-reaches-39-3-kg-the-highest-since-2011/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 23, 2022",Polysilicon price reaches $39.3/kg — the highest since 2011,"The global solar industry’s supply chain issues that have been triggered by the Covid-19 crisis may continue during 2022 and the expected price drop for polysilicon and solar products may not materialize.
This is, at least, the outlook of Chinese solar module manufacturer JinkoSolar, which in a statement to pv magazine said the polysilicon and international freight costs may stay elevated for a few years before normalizing again.
“The latest announced price of solar-grade polysilicon jumped 10% month-to-month on Tuesday, February 15, sitting at 249RMB/kg (39.3US$/kg), the highest since 2011,” the manufacturer stated. “It’s up more than 400% since the start of June 2020 and 280% YoY growth. It is opposite to most predictions that polysilicon costs will decline in 2022.”
According to the panel maker, polysilicon producers are currently recording very high margins, which make them reluctant to reduce prices. “The lasting shortage gives a renewal excuse for polysilicon makers to keep the price at a high level, and the pricing environment for solar modules is continuously nervous after China’s Spring Festival,” it further explained. “Strong demand and the effect on inflation jointly create a destructive mix in the solar industry.”
The company also claims that the current polysilicon shortage will push module manufacturers to reduce silicone consumption per wattage and seek to increase efficiency, in an effort to further reduce costs. “Adopting higher power and higher efficiency technology and products could be the only possible way for downstream project developers as well as cell/module producers to navigate the risk of logistics and raw material price fluctuation,” it emphasized, noting that efficiencies over 22% may become crucial to achieving economies of scale benefits and a reasonable LCOE in large scale projects.

The company provided a combined 4,229MW of solar and battery inverters in the calendar year.
At the utility scale, Ingeteam supplied solar inverters for 11 PV facilities with capacities of 100MW or more. One of which was the Francisco Pizarro, one of Europe’s largest solar facilities, with a capacity of 590MW.
Ingeteam also signed 1.5GW of operations and maintenance contracts for solar PV plants in 2021. The company’s O&M team is present in 24 countries and has more than 18.5GW of renewable energy under management, including 9.5GW of solar PV across 570 sites. The company said it is distinguished for its ability to deliver multi-technology services with a multi-brand scope.
In addition to PV plant O&M, the company offers services for revamping, commissioning, and technical asset management.
Ingeteam said it also is in position for “considerable development” in the short and medium term for battery energy storage system inverters, both at a residential and utility-scale. In 2021, the company contracted for 400MW/1000MWh of battery converters, principally in the US, Spain, Australia, Chile, and UK.
In total, Ingeteam has supplied more than 25GW of solar and battery inverters, 54GW of wind converters.
In December, Inverter maker Ingeteam Inc. said it supplied battery inverters for the Johanna 1 & 2 energy storage projects in Santa Ana, California, which entered service in October. The 20MW / 80MWh grid-connected project is owned and operated by Hecate Energy and was built by Mitsubishi Power.
The energy storage project was conceptualized as a Southern California Edison preferred resource pilot program project. Both Southern California Edison and Clean Power Alliance signed contracts to use energy from the batteries. For this project, Ingeteam supplied 20 units of its INGECON SUN STORAGE 1245TL U B480 inverter. These inverters include 1,500Vdc technology and will develop grid support functionalities, such as frequency regulation.

The company announced it plans a limited beta release of its Halo wireless charging station this year, with wider availability in 2023. WiTricity has already been providing top EV automakers with factory-installed EV wireless charging, and now plans to make a consumer-level aftermarket product.
The Halo can deliver 11kW wireless charging, enabling 35-40 driving range per hour of charging time, a speed and efficiency that meets today’s Level 2 AC plug-in charging rates. The system consists of three key components, including a power receiver installed on the vehicle, a wall box that connects to wired power, and a charging pad installed on (or in) the ground.
The system uses core magnetic resonance charging to power an EV. WiTricity’s charging system, peripheral systems, and controlling software have been awarded over 1,200 patents. The technology is has been instrumental in developing global wireless charging standards, including SAE International, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Standardization Administration of the People’s Republic of China (GB).
A pilot Tesla Model 3 has been running fully on wireless charge in Watertown, Massachusetts since last October. The vehicle can be charged in full in less than six hours, just as fast as plugging in at home. The team is also actively upgrading a Ford Mustang Mach-E, among others, for wireless capability.
“Our successful upgrade of the Tesla Model 3 is resonating with consumers as an easier, more convenient way to charge their EVs,” said Alex Gruzen, CEO. “With the WiTricity Halo solution you just park and walk away, knowing you will return to a fully charged car. Day to day, it’s as if your car had infinite range, which will help accelerate EV adoption and propel us to a greener future.”
The company said it is currently evaluating which models to offer wireless upgrades for, basing the decision on customer demand, technical feasibility, and automaker support. Those interested in the beta program can follow on the WiTricity website.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/23/solar-support-in-coal-country/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WEST VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 23, 2022",Solar support in coal country,"When West Virginian Senator Joe Manchin stated that he could not support the current administration’s proposed Build Back Better Act (BBB), an economic and climate bill that required his support for it to pass in the Senate, it sent shock waves through the US Capitol building. The impact reverberated from the stock market all the way to the coal mining territory of West Virginia, Manchin’s home state and the second-largest coal producer in the nation.
The Biden administration is currently working on a revision to the proposed legislation, but the original BBB had environmental support for utility-scale and residential clean energy, transmission and storage, clean passenger and commercial vehicles, clean energy manufacturing, technology development, and more.
These investments would help transition the United States to clean energy while smoothing supply chain issues, promoting American industries such as steel manufacturing, and generating jobs for Americans.
The potential of the BBB is felt in southern states hardest hit by the downturn in the US coal industry, and the bill is supported by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Mine workers are in favor of this legislation because it has items that will support its members and communities including extending the current fee paid by coal companies to coal miners who suffer from black lung disease. BBB also has language that supports the UMWA’s principles for a true energy transition, which they believe will enhance opportunities for miners, their families, and their communities.
Downward spiral
At the end of 2011, nearly 92,000 people were employed in the American coal industry. US coal production topped a billion tons for the 21st consecutive year; thermal and metallurgical coal were selling at premium prices, and companies were making record profits.
Everything changed when the economy slowed, foreign competition increased, and fracking increased production of natural gas – making it a low-cost fuel preferred by utilities.
The impact of these economic factors on coal production were exacerbated by new environmental regulations. The result was that by 2016, 51,800 people were employed in the coal industry. Since 2012, more than 60 coal companieshave filed for bankruptcy or liquidation. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic delivered another shock, with a further 7,000 jobs being shed by the coal industry that year.
In comes solar
The Environmental Protection Agency has long recommended that Superfund sites, such as abandoned mines, are appropriate for renewable-energy projects. Investing in renewable energy can lead to strengthening and diversifying West Virginia’s economy, according to the report West Virginia’s Energy Future, issued by the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at the West Virginia University College of Law. The report concludes that continued dependence on coal has many downsides economically, environmentally, and from a health standpoint, while a move to renewables has many benefits, just a few of which include job creation, a diversified economy, and health.

The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, sees West Virginia as a prime location for future solar development. Currently West Virginia is ranked No. 48 in the country for solar energy generation and receives
only 0.03% of its electricity from the sun, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “As the world transitions to a low-carbon future, solar energy is an important opportunity for West Virginia
to continue serving as a domestic energy powerhouse,” Eriks Brolis, the director of TNC in West Virginia’s Nature and Economy Programs, told pv magazine.
TNC’s West Virginia team has been working for the last few years to promote economic diversification through conservation-compatible solar energy in this historically coal dominated state. TNC developed a Roadmap for Solar on Mine Lands in conjunction with Downstream Strategies and the West Virginia University College of Law’s Center for Energy and Sustainable Development.
According to the Roadmap, there are up to 400,000 acres of former mine lands and other brownfields that could be suitable for large-scale solar across central Appalachia. If this land area were harnessed for
solar development, it could double the total solar capacity installed in the US to date, according to the 2019 report. “Prioritizing solar siting on former coal mines, brownfields as well as rooftops around the state would help bolster the economy and steer energy development away from lands important for clean water, wildlife, and other important economic sectors such as forestry and nature-based tourism and recreation,” Brolis said.
Coal ambitions
TNC and Dominion Energy Virginia announced in 2021 a plan to convert roughly 1,200 acres of the former Red Onion surface coal mine and surrounding properties into the 50MW Highlands Solar Project. Another project under development in coal country is the 200MW Martin County Solar Project. It is being constructed on 1,200 acres of the former Martiki coal mine site in Martin County, near the Kentucky-West Virginia border. Renewable energy momentum is already picking up in coal-mining areas of the country, including Manchin’s home state of West Virginia United Mine Workers of America International President Cecil E. Roberts said that the union urges Senator Manchin to “revisit his opposition to this legislation and work with his colleagues to pass something that will help keep coal miners working.”
