Broad Reach plans to install these systems in six of its projects in Texas in 2023.
“This battery purchase continues our focus and progress towards the scale Broad Reach plans to achieve in ERCOT and other markets in the US. Our mission is to keep the grid clean, affordable and reliable,” says Doug Moorehead, Chief Operating Officer at Broad Reach.
Broad Reach Power owns a 21 GW portfolio of utility-scale solar and energy storage power projects in Montana, California, Wyoming, Utah, and Texas.  In Texas the company operates 17 energy storage resources representing a nearly $200 million investment, providing energy reliability services to the ERCOT, electric cooperatives, retail electric providers, and municipal utilities. This recent transaction is its second large procurement from CATL. In 2021, Broad Reach installed 200 MWh of CATL equipment in its Bat Cave and North Fork projects, both now operating in ERCOT.

“By further leveraging CATL’s innovative battery technologies and Broad Reach’s capabilities and network in the renewable energy industry, we will further facilitate the energy transition and the drive toward carbon neutrality in Texas and the US,” said Tan Libin, President of Energy Storage at CATL.
CATL is a Chinese energy storage specialist. The company recently opened its first battery manufacturing plant outside of China in Thuringia, Germany. The German plant is expected to begin production by the end of 2022, with an anticipated production capacity of 14 GWh and the potential to create 2,000 jobs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/20/survey-finds-commerces-anti-circumvention-case-cuts-bidens-solar-goal-in-half/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 20, 2022",Survey finds Commerce’s anti-circumvention case cuts Biden’s solar goal in half,"The Department of Commerce announced its plans last month to investigate alleged antidumping and anti-circumvention violations in four Southeastern Asian nations that are suspected of shipping Chinese-made solar goods that are dodging tariffs. Tariffs levied on goods found to be in violation would be as high as 250% of the value of the goods and would be retroactive to all goods shipped April 1 or later. The four nations are responsible for 80% of the US supply of C-si solar panels, which is particularly important to the utility-scale sector.
The American Clean Power Association (ACP) began surveying major US solar developers two weeks after Commerce made the announcement of launching the investigation, and found, perhaps with little surprise, that the impacts of this case have had a devastating effect. The survey was a sample of numerous top utility-scale developers representing over 150 active projects.
Solar, across all sectors, is tasked with installing about 81 GW through the end of 2023 to stay on track with federal goals. The survey respondents have led ACP to estimate that 47% of that goal will be compromised by the investigation of a federal agency, in direct contrast to publicly state goals of the White House.
The investigation has led to an estimated $30 billion in lost economic investment, and billions more in lost contributions to local communities, landowners, and philanthropic endeavors, said ACP.
Prior to the investigation, market researchers projected utility scale C-si solar to contribute 17 GW of solar in 2022 and 20 GW in 2023. Now, at least 65% of those projects were reported to be at significant risk of cancellation or delay.
The most common issue already being reported is a lack of module availability.
With this comes an estimated job loss of 38,000 American jobs. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates this number could be as high as 70,000 jobs. ACP said this case will also likely lead to energy bill increases for Americans, as utilities and energy purchasers replace their planned solar resources with higher-cost fossil fuel sources of energy.
“The results from this study are more than just numbers on a page. Behind each data point are proud men and women that power clean energy in America, who are rightfully questioning why President Biden’s own administration is imperiling their livelihoods. President Biden and the Department of Commerce must swiftly dismiss this inquiry for what it is – a self-serving attempt by one lone company to game the system to the detriment of the domestic solar industry.” Heather Zichal, CEO of the American Clean Power Association. 
The energy storage industry is expected to get hit by this investigation, as well. Today, a large number of utility scale solar projects are co-located with battery energy storage, and ACP estimates as much as 50% of the utility-scale storage market will be similarly at risk of delay or cancellation.
SEIA recently released a survey of 600 or more solar businesses on the same subject, and found similar damning results. In a statement, SEIA said that the “baseless petition will make it impossible for the solar industry to meet President Biden’s climate goals”.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/20/sunrun-says-better-policy-is-needed-to-add-vast-amounts-of-distributed-solar-and-storage/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 20, 2022",Sunrun says better policy is needed to add “vast” amounts of distributed solar and storage,"Distributed solar will need to provide 27% of California’s electricity in a 100% renewables grid, and could provide 40% of Hawaii’s projected demand, according to studies noted by the Sunrun policy team in a new paper.
Without distributed solar and storage, “utilities will need more power plants, lines, and poles” as demand increases due to electrification, the authors say. Those utility investments “will be funded by charging customers higher electricity rates,” burdening “those who can least afford it.”
In the near term, state regulators seeking to integrate “vast numbers” of distributed resources could follow the policy lead of Vermont and Hawaii, the authors say. Longer term, an appropriate role for utilities “might be that of a distribution system operator.”
Berkeley Lab published the paper by Sunrun Chief Policy Officer Anne Hoskins and Director of Public Policy Christopher Worley, in a report on innovation in the electric utility sector.
State progress
Vermont utility Green Mountain Power has provided a circuit-level hosting capacity map since 2017 that has enabled more distributed solar, the authors say. A utility program to promote battery adoption has “unlocked millions in utility cost savings” and has been a model for similar utility programs around the country. And an alternative rate plan proposed by the utility that “decouples its financial interests from electricity sales” has been approved by state regulators.
In Hawaii, the authors say, integrated grid planning across generation, transmission and distribution lets distributed resources compete fairly. The state also granted some parties access to Hawaiian Electric’s capacity expansion model, who could then assess the feasibility and costs of adding distributed resources, in a practice known as transparent utility modeling. Understanding the inputs that the utilities use to run the model “can reveal any bias toward solutions most favorable to the utility,” which can then be remedied, the authors say.
Hawaii can also incentivize both distributed resource deployment and the utility’s interconnection speed through a new performance-based regulation approach, the first in the nation to “completely break away” from the traditional cost-of-service model.
Flagging the importance of leadership by a state’s public utility commission, the authors said regulatory authorities around the US “should look to the Hawaii PUC as an example of leading the way to a modern power system.”
Hawaii ranks first in the nation for small scale solar per capita, while Vermont ranks sixth.
Connecticut, the authors say, is considering allowing non-utility actors to propose pilot programs for utilities, with the goal of quickly identifying and scaling successful projects. Michigan also has a framework for pilot programs.
Despite these promising examples across the four states, most utilities that are regulated under the cost-of-service regulatory model “lack sufficient incentives to innovate,” the authors say.
Role of utilities
Under the traditional cost-of-service regulatory model which the authors see as a problem, “the utility’s profit is based on the size of its investment and the approved rate of return,” they say. “Utilities usually respond to load growth, clean energy mandates, or calls to increase resilience by building more infrastructure, adding to their rate bases, and then recovering those costs through higher customer rates.”
The authors call for “a fundamental rethinking of how utilities make money and the role of customers and third parties in the generation and consumption of energy.” If regulators shifted the role of utilities to being distribution system operators, each utility would become “a platform provider for both hardware and software systems,” the authors say. The role of providing distributed resources “will be held by third-party vendors,” which “should result in lower prices.”
New York State considered shifting the role of the utility to that of a distribution system operator, under the state’s Reforming the Energy Vision regulatory docket, but did not do so, the authors report.
To encourage customer investment in solar and storage, state regulators should ensure that utilities fairly compensate customers for the grid benefits their systems provide, the authors say. State regulators can use a framework to account for grid benefits such as the National Standard Practice Manual for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Distributed Energy Resources, they say.

The Palomino Solar Energy Project is proposed for construction on roughly 2,650 acres in Highland County, Ohio, just east of Cincinnati. The project is being developed by Canadian-based Innergex, developers of the nearby 200 MW Hillcrest Solar Farm, one of the first utility-scale solar projects to complete the OPSB permitting process successfully and the largest currently under construction in Ohio.
Innergex shares that Highland County was selected as the project location due to an abundance of clear, flat land that allows for straightforward project design and construction. If all goes well on the approval front, the project is expected to begin construction the second half of 2022, last 12 to 14 months, and be completed some time late in 2023. While project hardware specifics have not yet been decided upon, the Hillcrest Solar Farm is being constructed with First Solar’s Series 6 modules, a likely choice for Palomino, too.
The hearing for Palomino Solar is scheduled for: June 29, 2022, at 5 pm in the Wharton Building at the Highland County Fairgrounds in Hillsboro.
Entirely independent of the Palomino project, EDP Renewables is proposing a 200 MW standalone battery energy storage system to be constructed on 15 acres along the south side of Jug Street Road in Licking County, just northeast of Columbus. According to EDP’s application, the Flint Grid battery energy storage facility will consist of approximately 360 battery containers, each holding approximately 24 lithium iron phosphate batteries. The battery containers, which will be approximately 32 feet long by 5.5 feet wide by 8.5 feet high, will be connected to inverters, in groups of five containers per inverter. EDP has not yet finalized the battery’s duration, but the application points to four hours, meaning the battery will likely be 200 MW/800 MWh.
EDP has also shared that is has no plans to bring any form of generation to the project’s area, meaning that the battery will be fully standalone. If approved, the Flint Grid battery energy storage facility will become one of the largest battery storage systems installed in the Eastern US.
The hearing for the Flint Grid battery energy storage facility is scheduled for July 12, 2022, at 6 pm at the Courtyard by Marriott in New Albany, Ohio.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/20/california-utility-sdge-sees-utility-scale-solar-growing-greater-than-10x-by-2045/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 20, 2022",California utility SDG&E sees utility scale solar growing greater than 10X by 2045,"California utility San Diego Gas & Electricity (SDG&E) has released new projections for meeting California’s decarbonization goals. The study, The Path to Net Zero: A Decarbonization Roadmap for California, predicts that in order to reach the mandated carbon neutrality by 2045, the state will need to quadruple its electricity generating capacity from 85 GW to 365 GW, add 40 GW of energy storage, and integrate 20 GW of green hydrogen – while also adding 4 GW of fossil gas with carbon capture and sequestration technology.
The utility said that they believe a mix of resources will be needed to “maintain electricity system reliability in the SDG&E service area” as total consumption increases by an estimated 100%, and peak demand grows by 85%.

Overall generation capacities for the whole of California are projected to be 356 GW in 2045, up from 85 GW in 2020, and 136 in 2030. The SD&G service area is projected to almost double its capacity from 9 GW to 16 GW. In total, wind and solar power are projected to comprise 58% of instate generation capacity, totalling 205 GW. Utility scale solar specifically is projected to grow to 183.6 GWac, from 38.2 GWac in 2030 — and as of the end of 2020 — 12.3 GWac.

By 2045, 44% of electricity is projected to come from solar, 16% from wind, 14% from hydrogen, and 17% from imports.
The San Diego GAS & Electric company sees their fossil gas capacity falling to 3.8 GW in 2030, and 2.8 GW by 2045, while California’s fossil capacity will decrease from 44 to 37 GW. There is also the suggestion that 4 GW gas coupled with a carbon capture technology will be able to assist with the extraction of 68 million metric tons of GHGS.

However, none of the gas capacity is to be used for electricity generation as — of course — electricity is required by law to be 100% fossil free by 2045.
The study does see serious challenges outside of the electricity industry. Of the 68 million metric tons (MMT) of GHGs generated by the state, 25 MMT will come from the industrial sector, 19 from agriculture, 13 from buildings, and 11 from transportation.
The utility also explores the financial viability and societal equity of this transition. It is estimated that, in general, this transition will actually save money in the long term. The volume of capital needed to invest will be a “relatively small percentage of the state’s GDP.”

However, the transition might end up creating a wider gulf between haves and have nots.
The study includes an analysis of “Adopters” of electrification – and that they are, by necessity, higher-income than “Non-Adopters”. In the long game, higher-income consumers who can afford electrification technologies (cars, heat pumps, and induction stoves for example) will eventually save more money on household energy costs, which will potentially compound existing inequities.
On average, it’s projected that households with relatively equal energy consumption bills in 2022 will see no bill growth through the next two decades. However, “Non-Adopters” will need to find 23% more income to spend on energy. This is driven by a shift from almost a third of energy coming from gasoline and fossil gas, to “Adopters”, who will get 80% of their energy from electricity.

In its own territory, SDG&E notes the transition is underway. The utility has built 3,200 EV chargers and are planning to construct larger charging networks for medium and heavy-duty vehicles like trucks and buses. They are on track to double their owned energy storage capacity to 145 MW by the end of 2022, and have another 284 MW under contract.
The researchers conclude that “in order to ensure an affordable and equitable outcome, policymakers, regulators, and SDG&E must consider how changes across the economy will affect different households, especially those of average- and lower-income customers.”

Since that time, the US solar industry has been in turmoil, and a recent statement from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) says, “the American solar industry has ground to a halt, all at the behest of one, self-interested company that filed an anti-circumvention petition.”
SEIA estimates that the 231,000 Americans and 10,000 businesses that power the US solar industry are “the ones that will ultimately be shouldered with this burden”.
In April SEIA launched a survey for solar workers that aimed to quantify the damage caused to the industry. SEIA encouraged companies of all sizes that work in any space, from residential to utility-scale projects, to complete the survey in order to get a qualitative sense of how solar industry workers expect the anti-circumvention investigation to impact their businesses and workforce. Alongside the general survey, SEIA encouraged developers of larger-scale projects, 1 MW and above, to submit project-level data.
The numbers are in
To date more than 600 clean energy US companies responded with stories about how this investigation affects the industry and their lives. The consensus is that solar business owners and employees are concerned about their livelihoods and their ability to support their families as a result of the investigation. A single mother that has worked in the solar industry for more than a decade wrote that the decision “puts me in a state of panic about how I will survive and provide for my child.”
Another survey respondent cited that they started their solar business so they could do the right thing for their kids’ future. Just when they felt that they could grow their business to help build a clean energy future, this decision has put their hopes on hold.
Another business owner said the threat of tariffs “puts a complete stop in our workforce, our business model, and is sure to destroy the careers and livelihood of all of us here. These are hardworking Americans trying to provide for their families, but a single company’s self-interested petition has jeopardized their ability to make a living.”
In addition to jeopardizing business profits and careers, the investigation is putting projects on hold—including projects aimed at providing low-cost electricity to low-income communities. One company reported that they “put all of our existing business on hold until there is clarity.”
SEIA sees the investigation also affecting local businesses that partner on community-based projects. One company believes this decision will hurt local subcontractors that provide everything from fencing to civil engineering work on project sites. In New Mexico alone, another company expects that 1 GW of solar capacity will be cancelled, sacrificing 1,400 construction jobs.
SEIA estimates that the solar industry will lose 70,000 jobs, and that it will raise the already high prices in the solar industry.
“This is wreaking havoc on our business,” says one survey respondent, who reported a 35% increase in solar module prices and significant inflation on other materials. To make matters worse, manufacturers are cancelling their purchase orders because they do not have inventory to ship at the agreed-upon prices. Another company anticipates that their profitability will nosedive, “which has already taken a huge hit due to price increases across the board in the last 6 months.”
Small businesses in the solar industry are especially vulnerable given the challenges already facing the industry.
“This situation is devastating to every small business in the industry,” writes one survey respondent. Another mom-and-pop sales organization fears, “this will completely destroy my business.”
In summary, SEIA reports that the US solar industry is mired in uncertainty as a result of this “baseless petition will make it impossible for the solar industry to meet President Biden’s climate goals”.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/20/new-steel-dynamics-manufacturing-plant-will-have-dedicated-nextracker-tracker-production-line/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TRACKERS,TEXAS",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 20, 2022",New JM Steel manufacturing plant will have a Nextracker tracker production line,"Nextracker and JM Steel, a division of JENNMAR USA, have announced a partnership under which a dedicated solar tracker production line has been built on the campus of a new Steel Dynamics manufacturing facility near Corpus Christi, Texas.
According to Nextracker, the new facility manufactures next-generation, low-carbon tracker components to be used in solar projects throughout the southern US. Facilitated in part due to the uncertainty of the global supply chain and rising international shipping costs, Nextracker made the strategic decision to focus on manufacturing in the United States. The new Nextracker production line will support about 50 new local direct jobs and provide multi-GW of solar tracker capacity annually, and is set to begin operations today.
While low-carbon steel manufacturing reads like an oxymoron, Steel Dynamics utilizes electric arc furnaces in its manufacturing, which have been described as a “next-generation” process for steel fabrication, one which can lead to electric arc furnace facilities being up to 75% less carbon-intensive than traditional blast furnaces.
“All of the steel being used to make Nextracker’s products will be made with SDI’s newest electric arc furnace technology, which utilizes recycled or scrap steel as a raw material for a lower carbon footprint which is a perfect fit for Nextracker’s solar products,” said Tony Calandra, CEO of JM Steel and JENNMAR USA.
Securing steel fabrication to alleviate supply chain concerns and shipping volatility is an emerging trend in the tracker and racking space, one that could hold momentum if the aforementioned market concerns persist. Another prominent name in the space, Terrasmart fabricates its own steel structures in house. In a prior interview with pv magazine, Terrasmart President, Ed McKiernan said that such an approach allows his company to switch up their operations “on a dime,” and to accommodate design and timeline changes for customers.
One issue that Terrasmart has run into, however, is sourcing the steel to enable this process, as steel supply markets have had historically high demand, and can be difficult to navigate as a somewhat-newer entrant. In partnering with an existing name in the industry, Nextracker should be able to forgo some of these sourcing concerns, while still keeping overall costs down and product innovation flexible.
“Customers want protection from steel and logistics cost volatility, and logistics delays associated with shipping, containers, and ports,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “We are migrating to domestic production to stabilize pricing and achieve superior on-time delivery for our customers.”
