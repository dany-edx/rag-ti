The resort giant said the array is capable of providing 90% of its daytime energy needs. This equates to about 35% of total energy use by buildings that typically have significant nighttime demand. 
The Invenergy-developed project is structured through a 20-year power purchase agreement. Earlier this year, Invenergy sold 75% of its stake in the project to AEP Renewables, a unit of Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power. 
The 323,000-module system sits on 640 acres of land 30 miles north of Las Vegas. MGM said the location was selected with attention to environmental impacts on landscape and biodiversity in the location. 
MGM paid $87 million in 2016 to divorce itself from Nevada utility NV Energy and buy power on the wholesale market. This project marks the completion of a first step toward its plan to target increased renewable energy following the breakup. 
Around 938,044 metric tons of CO2 equivalent were emitted by MGM Las Vegas Resorts in 2019, and the company said it targets a 50% absolute cut in emissions by 2030.
Among the properties to be powered by this project will be Bellagio, Aria, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, and The Mirage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/28/the-electric-utility-anti-rooftop-solar-playbook/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 28, 2021",The electric utility anti-rooftop solar playbook,"Many groups see an enemy in homeowners installing rooftop solar power.
Now, the Environment America Research & Policy Center, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, and Frontier Group released a report which unmasks the organizations who have been attacking rooftop solar and describes the techniques they’ve employed.
The paper, Blocking Rooftop Solar, includes seven case studies from around the nation exposing the specific actions taken, which sometimes were illegal, and quite often were manipulative.
The four organizations named in the report include:
It should be noted that it was an EEI executive who expressed the group’s fear of net metering in a report by the NYTimes:
“Years ago, I think a lot of people said, ‘[Net metering is] not going to come to our area. And now we see it in each and every state. E.E.I. is happy to come to any state at any time, we have two dozen states we are working on.”
By “working on” the organization meant funding political campaigns, writing new legislation, and in general pulling out all the stops in an effort to destroy rooftop solar.
At the heart of the document are seven case studies outlining the groups’ most nefarious stunts, including Ameren’s “fake math,” FirstEnergy and an Ohio political scandal, and Florida Power & Light in an act of “political jiu jitsu.”
In the case of FPL and political jiu jitsu, this author has conflicting emotions. FPL’s parent company – NextEra – is among the world’s largest renewable asset owners, and is pushing some of the most advanced projects in the industry.
Unfortunately, however, it’s not always sunny in Florida, as the study pointed out.
FPL donates tens of millions of dollars to politicians across the state during election years. Whether elections or legislation related to energy are up for a vote, the company will still “donate” millions while employing “90-100 lobbyists, more than one for every two state senators.”
And in 2016, the company – along with the broader political-energy industry – revealed their disdain for the common person.
A group of companies, including FPL, contributed $26 million to a front group for an amendment designed to trick consumers into voting against net metering for solar power. And while a skeptic might argue that the motives for this political action were not known, some great investigative reporting from the Miami Herald exposed the shady intentions behind the legislation:
“To the degree that we can use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu and take what they’re kind of pinning us on and use it to our benefit either in policy, in legislation or in constitutional referendums — if that’s the direction you want to take — use the language of promoting solar, and kind of, kind of put in these protections for consumers that choose not to install rooftop.”
The trick occurring here is that the electricity utilities believe they can word legislation in a certain way to trick voters into believing that a solar law is good for them. And since solar is generally quite popular – carrying a lot of weight in the public mind – by calling your group “Consumers for Smart Solar” means you can use that weight (a fundamental technique of jiu jitsu) against the best interests of the general public.
The law failed, but the corporate beast never sleeps.
In what may be the most egregious of all recent actions taken by an electricity utility, it is Ohio that has born the brunt of monopoly power and large volumes of money.
Let’s remember that it was an Ohio coal baron who most famously hugged a disgraced public servant at the Department of Energy, before presenting the government with a fossil supporting honey-do list. This coal baron later died of black lung disease, applying for the same benefits shortly before his death that he had attempted to deny from his employees throughout his career.
The above image is a flyer which was distributed to Ohio voters as part of a campaign to push a piece of legislation called HB-6. The main goals of HB-6 were to gut renewable energy requirements before eliminating them entirely after 2026, while also bailing out four failing coal and nuclear facilities to the tune of $1 billion.
Some have suggested that it is “the worst energy bill of the 21st century.”
As it turned out, in order to get that legislation passed, the electricity utility spent over $61 million to bribe various state politicians. The FBI raided multiple high level officials’ homes and offices, and multiple individuals have pled guilty to related charges.
Among those charged is the now former Speaker of the Ohio House, Larry Householder, who was indicted for conspiracy to commit racketeering.
In a small victory, portions of HB-6 have recently been repealed. However, as a reminder that there is no rest for the wicked, the coal power plant incentives – to the tune of tens of millions per year – are still in place.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/28/four-ways-to-make-your-solar-pv-project-appealing-to-acquisition-partners/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,GUEST POST,LEGAL,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 28, 2021",Four ways to make your solar PV project appealing to acquisition partners,"Knowing how to make your solar assets more appealing to acquisition partners can not only make or break a deal, but also determine your company’s success.
After a record-setting 2020 for the solar industry, PV project developers can truly make their mark in the coming years with a sound strategy for ensuring their projects are acquisition-ready.
1. Understand your timeline. It’s important to anticipate a race against the clock with any solar project that gets deployed, but a developer can remove a lot of stress and uncertainty by understanding what the development process and requirements look like.
The idea is simple in concept and complex in application. As soon as the project is far enough along in the development process, you want to be ready to sell. That means that a developer has met all necessary asset-related criteria and every detail has been accounted for, like incentives (federal, state and community solar), property tax, or payment in lieu of taxes (PILOTs), and the development path to Notice to Proceed is clear.
To be ready, a developer should already be in negotiations with a larger solar company with strong financial backing and a track record of successful acquisitions.
Once initial terms for a sale have been agreed upon, the project buyer and seller will sign a letter of intent with an exclusivity period of 30 to 45 days, during which the buyer will conduct preliminary diligence. They’ll estimate engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) costs and complete preliminary design and production analyses to determine the value and if there are any red flags. This period might be extended to address issues, but ideally, the deal will be signed and closed within two to three months.
So while it’s important to engage potential buyers early on, a developer must have enough development work underway. If you don’t have a path to interconnection, site control, permitting, or incentives, you will be fighting an uphill battle to get to a viable solar project.
2. The proof is in the paper. There are dozens of permits and contracts that allow potential buyers and financing parties to determine the value of a solar project and commit to the transaction. Accuracy is important, but many documents need to be recent as well, so it’s critical to be aware of how long documents are considered up to date and when it will be necessary to refresh them.
Documents dealing with site control, including any leases, easements and interconnection permissions and agreements, are required to provide a deep understanding of how the project will interconnect with the grid and how access will be provided. Environmental documents, like the Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), require sound expertise to ensure compliance.
3: Teaming up with the right partners makes all the difference. Selling a solar project should be classified as a team sport. Whether you’re an energy company or a developer, you need many types of expertise, so ensuring you have good partners is critical. Find those consultants and employees who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get down in the weeds.
Unreasonable delays and insufficient subject matter expertise can significantly push out transactions and put project schedules at risk.

In your partner line up, you’ll also want to ask yourself if each partner has what it takes to put you in the best possible position when it comes to execution. Unreasonable delays and insufficient subject matter expertise can significantly push out transactions and put project schedules at risk. It’s important to have the kind of partners who can provide the right documents at the right time to the right entities, so the buyer and financing parties are comfortable with the project terms.
4: Think in volume and aim to create your own ecosystem. The larger potential buyers in the space who deal in well-capitalized solar will have megawatt targets and other metrics to achieve every year. They also want to conduct efficient transactions, so the more high-quality projects you can bundle together to create a portfolio, the more value you can deliver. Legal diligence and transaction costs are very high, so if you are selling portfolios of five to 10 or more projects, you can spread the transaction costs across all the projects in the portfolio.
Similarly, as you close deals, smart developers will look for ways to keep feeding projects to the same buyers. Repeat business is always faster and smoother, and the transaction costs are lower. With each acquisition, a developer can get a feel for what the buyers are looking for and this can inform what the developer focuses on. If you find a buyer whom you work well with, keep bringing them good projects to secure a pipeline for your development business.
With a clear time horizon, a developer can look out over several years and begin to establish an ecosystem that feeds itself on past success, trusted partners and processes, and sound completed projects that deliver value.
Getting a project acquisition-ready involves a commitment to being a good partner, efficiency and success. Many large solar players are not interested in taking on development risk. The developers that can deliver the best expertise, timeliness, accuracy, and value when their project is ready to sell will see their business grow. And the teams will enjoy the process a whole lot more.

As an individual resource, solar output during the month was 29.9% greater than April 2020 and it has seen a 26.1% gain in the first third of 2021 over the same period 2020.
Wind output made comparable strides to solar during both April and the first third of 2021, with both of these resources stepping up to help shoulder the renewable load, as output by hydropower, biomass, and geothermal all decreased to start the year.
As could be expected, with solar and wind climbing their way up the generation shares, nuclear and fossils have fallen in their shares. Electrical generation by natural gas during the first third of 2021 fell by 8.4% compared to the first four months of 2020. Natural gas’ share of the nation’s electrical generation during the first third of last year was 39.1%, but diminished to 34.7% this year.
Coal  generated 2.2% less electricity than renewables during the first third of 2021 and 29.2% less in April alone. During the month it provided 22.0% of the nation’s total generation.
Nuclear electrical output decreased by 2.9% to 19.7% of the April total, enabling renewables to further solidify their lead. Collectively, renewables outpaced nuclear power during both the first third of 2021 and the month of April alone by 14.2% and 33.5%, respectively.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/28/renewables-up-to-90-by-2050-would-cost-less-than-current-generation-mix-nrel-study/,"MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 28, 2021",Renewables up to 90% by 2050 would cost less than current generation mix: NREL study,"Increasing renewable generation up to 90% by 2050 in the contiguous United States would yield lower system costs than maintaining the current generation mix, according to a research paper published in the journal Joule.
Those lower system costs do not count public health, environmental, or climate benefits from increased use of renewables, say the study’s eight co-authors. Seven of the authors are with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Assuming no new federal or state policies beyond those in effect as of June 2020, the least-cost system would reach 57% renewables by 2050, with average levelized costs of $30/MWh, or 3 cents per kWh.
Moderately higher system costs of $36/MWh would result from a requirement to reach 90% renewables a decade earlier, in 2040. Reaching 100% renewables by 2050 would be possible with existing technologies, yielding costs of $39/MWh, the study said.
The results are largely driven by the use of updated cost projections for utility-scale solar from NREL’s 2020 Annual Technology Baseline. Those projections were well below the prior year’s projections. The “moderate” cost projections used in the study showed a cost of about $24/MWh for utility-scale solar in 2030, versus the prior year’s projection of about $38/MWh in 2030.
The study found that incremental costs of the system would rise steeply for the last few percentage points of renewable generation, as the system approaches 100% renewables.
Stanford University energy researcher Mark Jacobson said in a LinkedIn comment that annual costs would be reduced even more compared to fossil fuels by “including electrification of transport, buildings and industry; eliminating energy in mining and refining fossil fuels and uranium; and accounting for demand response and heat/cold storage.” He cited a new Stanford study for each of the 50 states presenting those results.
Jacobson added that in 2009, when his team first published modeling of 100% renewables, “utilities claimed that 20% renewables on the grid was infeasible,” and that in 2015, “critics claimed that 80% was infeasible.”
With the new NREL study, he said, “their claims are now debunked.”
The NREL study found that reaching high renewables levels sooner than 2050 would cost more for three reasons. First, because the study discounted costs at 5% per year, costs incurred earlier had a higher discounted cost. Second, capital costs for renewables were expected to continue declining through 2050, yielding lower costs for later deployment. Third, retiring fossil generators before they were fully paid for was modeled as “resulting in additional costs from stranded assets.”
To model its base case results, the study used mid-range assumptions for capital and operating costs of generators, and for electricity demand. The research team used NREL’s ReEDS model for capacity expansion analysis, and the commercial PLEXOS model for production cost modeling. Scenarios were run on NREL’s high performance computer.
To ensure resource adequacy, the study team modeled seasonal firm capacity requirements equivalent to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation reference reserve margin levels.
The study also considered 22 additional sets of assumptions, including low costs for renewables and batteries; a near-doubling of electricity demand due to electrification with 34% of total demand available as flexible resources; or no new transmission. These other sets of assumptions were modeled only with the ReEDS model.

The merger combines 1366’s Direct Wafer process and Hunt’s printed perovskite solar photovoltaic technology and aims to advance the adoption of tandem modules. The new company will receive $25 million in funding from Hunt Energy Enterprises, First Solar, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures. North Bridge Venture Partners and Polaris Partners also joined in funding the new entity. Hunt Energy Enterprises will join the Board of Directors.
The companies said that tandem technology, also referred to as multi-junction, layers two light absorbers into one device, and can boost the power output of the end panel by 30% compared with current technology.
JinkoSolar Holding Co. announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2021 and said a “sharp rise in the price of polysilicon” has driven up the price of modules, which has affected downstream demand in the short term.
It said that lower demand has kept the materials’ prices from rising more. JinkoSolar said that as the prices of polysilicon stabilize, downstream demand is expected to resume in the second half of 2021.
The company reported total revenues of $1.21 billion for the quarter. Gross profit was $207.3 million, down 18.0% year over year.
Gross margin was 17.1%, compared with 16.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 19.5% in the first quarter of 2020.
The company reported that it invested in Inner Mongolia Xinte Silicon Materials Co. to better secure its polysilicon material supply. And it also entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with China COSCO Shipping Corp. to handle transportation logistics.
JinkoSolar said that after taking into account supply chain and market conditions, it reduced its capacity expansion plan for 2021. It currently expects its annual mono wafer, solar cell, and solar module production capacity to reach 30 GW, 24 GW (including 940 MW N-type cells) and 33 GW, respectively, by the end of the year. That is down from previous guidance of 33 GW, 27 GW, 37 GW, respectively.
Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) will be the dominant form of road transport by 2050, accounting for 56% of all vehicle sales that year, according to new research from Wood Mackenzie.
By the middle of the century, some 875 million electric passenger vehicles, 70 million electric commercial vehicles, and 5 million fuel cell vehicles will be on the world’s roads.
Wood Mackenzie said that more than three out of every five vehicles on the roads will be electric vehicles in China, Europe and the U.S. by 2050. Almost one in two commercial vehicles will be electric by the same date in those regions.
New York State officials issued final siting permits for Riverhead Solar 2, LLC and Morris Ridge Solar Energy Center, LLC.
Riverhead is a 36 MW solar facility in the Town of Riverhead, Suffolk County, on Long Island. Morris Ridge Solar Energy Center is a 177 MW solar facility coupled with 83 MW of battery energy storage in the Town of Mount Morris, Livingston County, south of Rochester.
