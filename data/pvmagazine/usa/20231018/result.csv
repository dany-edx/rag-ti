The product, called the enblock S, is a stackable, modular lithium-ion battery that the company said is designed around flexibility of design and ease of installation. 
The battery has the option of stacking three, four, or five battery module assemblies along with a battery control unit. The smallest size, the S 10, has three module assemblies and 10.6 kWh, the S 14 has four battery module assemblies with 14.1 kWh, and the largest, the S 17, contains five battery module assemblies, carrying 17.7 kWh. The enblock S also supports the parallel connection of two matching units for a maximum power output of 14 kW. 
LG said customer can increase energy capacity based on their energy consumption patterns by purchasing additional modules. As homeowners continue to electrify appliances and purchase EVs, flexibility in battery capacity offers a way to meet growing demand. 
The company said the battery is easy to install, with no bolts to fasten, and a “plug and play” connector. It said that a single installer can complete an enblock S installation in 15 minutes. Both wall-mounted and standing configurations are supported, and the battery can be used in both indoor and outdoor settings. 
The company reports that the battery has met rigorous safety standards to ensure prevention of thermal runway fires, a problem in some lithium-ion home batteries. It has passed UL9540A testing. 
Later in the year, LG will introduce the enblock S+, which will enable customers to purchase the enblock S battery along with the company’s new AC-coupled inverter as a bundled solution. The coupled option is offered in two configurations, backup power and energy arbitrage, and can be retrofitted to an existing PV system. 
With an LG Energy Solution Monitor app, battery owners can track energy consumption and production real-time. 
“LG Energy Solution enblock S is a versatile, expandable, and simple to install Energy Storage System (ESS),” said Matthew Unverferth, residential ESS sales manager with the LGES ESS team in North America. “To offer the highest level of product safety, LG Energy Solutions enblock S was laboratory tested and proven compliant, receiving the industry standard UL9540A fire safety rating.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/18/will-solar-overtake-natural-gas-by-2030/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 18, 2023",Will solar overtake natural gas by 2030?,"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released its Energy Infrastructure Update report, noting that solar holds the largest share of capacity additions in the energy mix in the United States. 
In 2023 through August 31, just under 9 GW of solar capacity was added, representing 40.5% of all capacity additions. This represents 36% growth year-over-year. 
Wind power provided an additional 2.7 GW, about 12.5% of new capacity additions. When including solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass, renewable energy sources contributed 54.3% of capacity additions. 
Much growth lies ahead for decarbonized energy to push out fossil fuel sources. For total available installed generating capacity, natural gas remains the leader. Over 44% of available electricity generation capacity comes from natural gas, followed by coal (16.4%), wind (11.6%), hydropower (8%), and solar (7.2%). 
FERC forecasts strong growth in solar for years to come. It expects over 83 GW of “high probability” solar capacity additions through August 2026. This dwarfs the 4 GW of natural gas additions expected through that date. 
FERC said that the 83 GW of “high probability” solar additions may be quite conservative. There is over 214 GW of solar additions in the three-year project pipeline. 
Natural gas has 564 GW available installed capacity today, while solar has 92 GW. Looking ahead three years, if solar were to add all the projects in the pipeline to the grid, it would reach 306 GW. The data suggests that with a healthy ramp-up of projects, solar could feasibly push out natural gas as the number one provider of electricity by 2030. 
Investment 
Reaching status as the number one provider of electricity will take significant funding. A report from Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) showed that the United States’ total investment in clean energy, clean transportation, building electrification and carbon management reached $213 billion over the last year (from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023). 
The $213 billion invested represents a 37% leap over 2021/2022 investments of $155 billion. Clean investment continues to strongly increase each year. In 2018/2019, total investments reached $81 billion, and it has climbed each year since.  
Domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies has become an increased focus in recent years, and rich tax credits and incentives have served as an attracting force. Manufacturing investments totaled $39 billion in 2022/2023, more than doubling the $17 billion invested in the previous report period.  
Solar represented the largest energy and industry investment category in Q2 2023, attracting $8.62 billion. This was followed by storage with $4.08 billion, and wind with $2.03 billion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/18/global-inventory-map-of-floating-photovoltaics/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 18, 2023",Global inventory map of floating photovoltaics,"A group of researchers led by China’s Nanjing University has created a global-scale inventory map to determine the spatio-temporal distribution of floating photovoltaics.
“Existing statistical reports on water-surface photovoltaics (WSPV) only provide aggregated summary statistics but lack spatiotemporal information, which hinders the environmental assessment and policy management,” the research’s lead author, Shanchuan Guo, told pv magazine. “We developed a new and adaptive workflow for identifying WSPV using satellite imagery and integrating multiple spectral indices.”
In the paper “Mapping global water-surface photovoltaics with satellite images,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review, the research group explained it combined multi-source data and mapping results to assess the geographic distribution and characteristics of WSPV s and produce an an up-to-date spatial database.
The water mask was based on the global surface water dataset (GSW) created by the European Union’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), which provides the annual spatial distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2020.
“WSPVs are spectrally distinct from most land cover types and can be identified by remote sensing once they are larger than the satellite pixel size,” the scientists specified. “We used Google Earth images and Sentinel satellite imagery from 2019 to 2021 to examine and modify the type changes of WSPV validation samples over three years, and finally obtained the annual correctly labeled validation samples.”
The academics claim that the proposed approach enables the mapping of WSPVs over large areas at high resolution. They found that the water areas covered with floating PV installations increased from 187.0 km2 to 272.0 km2 between 2019 and 2021. They also estimated estimated a global installed WSPV capacity of 12.9 GW.
“The results advanced the understanding of the global spatial-temporal dynamics of the recent WSPV development and will be useful for informing future global and regional renewable planning and management for policymakers and project stakeholders,” they stressed.
The research group also hosted scientists from Michigan State University and the Shanghai Jiaotong University.

The milestones include the deployment of the first commercial-scale centrifugal particle receiver for on-sun testing and the completion of the design verification of the prototype particle receiver for Capella. The next step is for the particle receiver to be deployed in the project.
The Capella Project is a 5 MW commercial concentrating solar power plant to be built by Heliogen in Kern County, Calif. It will be constructed on a 117-acre field of computer-controlled heliostat mirrors focusing solar energy on receiver apertures on top of an approximate 330-foot-tall, centralized power tower. It includes an ancillary half-acre solar array. Heliogen reports that Capella will be the world’s first fully integrated Generation 3 CSP plant that achieves unprecedented efficiencies by combining solid-particle thermal energy storage and supercritical CO2 power .
A collaboration with Woodside Energy, an Australian energy company, the Capella Project received a funding award from the U.S. Department of Energy. Upon completion, the project will add to Heliogen’s portfolio of commercially ready technologies and will broaden the space of potential applications to include variably sized power projects and improve economics for many customers.
“By using Heliogen’s next-generation solar energy technology, industrial energy users will be able to improve their bottom line while doing their part to mitigate climate change,” said Christie Obiaya, chief executive officer of Heliogen. “Completing these two Capella milestones brings us one step closer to helping industries move into high-value, solar-powered processes and reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuels.”
The completed project milestones move the project closer to harnessing heat from the sun to produce electrical power.
Heliogen’s particle receiver works is by particles directly absorbing solar radiation and achieving rapid heat transfer and high receiver efficiency. The solid particles, such as sintered bauxite, are routed into a centrifugal receiver. As the receiver turns, the particles absorb concentrated sunlight and heats to temperatures of up to 750 C (1382 F). That heat is then transferred to an insulated silo for industrial use and energy storage.
“These milestones represent exciting progress in our collaboration to demonstrate the potential of Heliogen’s innovative, concentrated solar energy technology,” said Jason Crusan, vice president, New Energy Growth and Solutions at Woodside. “They also advance the development of a technology solution that supports our commitment to building a low-cost, lower-carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio.”

Last year Heliogen announced the opening of its first full-scale manufacturing facility, located in Long Beach, California, within close proximity to the Capella Project site. The facility houses assembly lines, a test facility, and rapid development center for the production of heliostats and other components in the company’s concentrated solar energy system. Heliogen said the manufacturing facility will bring 250 full-time jobs to the region by 2025.
The Capella Project remains on track with its previously disclosed development schedule, with front-end engineering design expected to be complete in late 2023 and groundbreaking planned for 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/18/qcells-completes-expansion-of-georgia-solar-manufacturing-facility/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,GEORGIA",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 18, 2023",Qcells completes expansion of Georgia solar manufacturing facility,"Qcells announced the successful completion of the expansion of its solar module factory in Dalton, Georgia where it added 2 GW of solar capacity, bringing the factory’s output to more than 5.1 GW.
The company said its Dalton factory is the largest manufacturing plant of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and the first solar panel plant expansion since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The expanded factory will manufacture nearly 30,000 solar modules a day, focusing on the new Q.TRON G2 residential solar module and a bifacial module for the commercial and utility markets. The company expects both products to achieve an ecolabel known as EPEAT, which is intended to help customers identify sustainably made products. QCells says the expanded factory will create 510 new jobs.
“Completing this factory marks the third expansion we’ve made in Dalton, and it’s just the beginning of Qcells’ larger mission to build a fully integrated solar supply chain in America,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Qcells. “The Inflation Reduction Act and the efforts of Georgia’s economic development team helped make these ambitious plans possible, and with it thousands of careers in clean energy. As we build new solar technology from Dalton and prepare for the start of Cartersville, it is critical that our local to federal leaders continue to work not only with us, but the larger industry to ensure our collective investments deliver for communities for decades to come.”
In January, QCells announced that it would invest more than $2.5 billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the U.S.. Considered the largest investment in U.S. solar history, it also made QCells, a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions, the first company to establish a fully-integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the U.S.  Qcells intends to break ground on a new, state-of-the-art facility in Cartersville, Georgia, where it will manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells and finished modules.
By 2024, between the Dalton and Cartersville facilities, Qcells anticipates its solar production capacity will reach 8.4 GW a year, or enough to power 1.3 million homes annually with clean energy.
Qcells opened its first factory in Georgia in 2019 and hired 750 people to manufacture 1.7 GW of solar. This initial investment was made possible in part by the Section 201 tariffs imposed on solar cells. Last year, Qcells announced a second expansion, which would add 1.4 GW to its manufacturing output and hire 535 more people. This now completed third expansion as well as the new facility that will manufacturing cells, wafers and ingots, follow the passage of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act (SEMA) within the IRA and are made possible with support from Georgia’s economic development team.
Upon completed construction, Qcells estimates that its production in Georgia could avoid more than 12 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year while expanding domestic manufacturing of solar products amidst the push for Made-in-America clean energy solutions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/18/vortex-energy-university-of-alberta-partner-on-hydrogen-energy-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"OCTOBER 18, 2023","Vortex Energy, University of Alberta partner on hydrogen energy storage project ","Vortex Energy Corp, a company focused on acquiring, exploring and developing mineral properties in North America, is partnering with the University of Alberta on research into hydrogen and energy storage at its Robinsons River Salt Project.
The company has committed $300,000 to a research team at the university that is working on designing and implementing the first field trial of hydrogen storage of domal salt in Canada. The partnership is expected to run for two years. 
While hydrogen is a clean and useful energy source, it is complex to store because it is light and can easily escape, Paul Sparkes, CEO of Vortex Energy, told pv magazine USA.
“This is where salt caverns come in. These are natural underground formations created by salt deposits. Scientists have found that these caverns are able to hold on to hydrogen gas for a prolonged period of time,” Sparkes added.
Caverns can be created in salt domes by drilling into them and injecting the rock with water, which dissolves the salt, and the resulting brine is extracted, leaving a large cavity, Sparkes said. Hydrogen electrolyzers can convert water into hydrogen by using renewable energy and this can be stored, and reconverted to electricity when needed over long periods of time, making it more suitable for seasonal or long-term storage needs, Sparkes added. 
Vortex Energy is working on its Robinson River Salt project, which has two of the largest salt caverns discovered in Atlantic Canada that have the potential to be developed for hydrogen or energy storage, Sparkes said. The two salt structures are estimated to hold at least 800,000 tonnes of hydrogen within more than 60 caverns, according to the company. The company plans to begin drilling at the project this November, after which it will re-evaluate further development and field trial application. Pending funding, Vortex Energy hopes to advance toward cavern storage in approximately two to three years, Sparkes said. 
The University of Alberta research time will conduct proof of concept experiments on core samples, to design and implement the first field trial of hydrogen storage in domal salt in Canada, according to Sparkes. The project is expected to last two years, comprising four research phases: optimizing the depth interval of the proposed storage caverns; evaluating the possibility and extent of hydrogen loss through the proposed cavern wall; evaluating the extent of hydrogen contamination; and evaluating the mechanical stability of the proposed caverns, Jason Latkowcer, in corporate development with Vortex, told pv magazine USA. 
Clean hydrogen could play an important role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries. But the more we rely on the resource, the more we’re going to need storage to preserve it, Latkowcer said. 
“The potential market for hydrogen storage in salt caverns is substantial. Green hydrogen storage in salt caverns has a number of advantages, including an indispensable chain link, flexibility, safety, and small footprint,” he said.

Hawaii-based startup Wavr LLC has developed a wave energy converter (WEC) that could be used for low-power marine applications.
Wavr developed its first prototypes for consumers, such as boat owners. The company claims that the system is particularly suitable for water surfaces with weak waves, as its modular design is able to increase the required power output by integrating more systems in an array configuration.
The technology can be used in low-power marine data buoys and internet of things (IoT) devices, according to the company, which claims its technology has no intermittency issues found in some other renewable energy technologies.
“The system is also designed to be scaled up and integrated with other renewable energy technologies,” the company said, noting that future prototypes may also be combined with photovoltaic panels installed on top of the floaters, small wind turbines, mini-hydropower systems or other tidal energy technologies.

“We feel the hybrid unit with solar panels is the next most important prototype for us. We are currently developing it with a group called Infrgy,” the company’s founder, Clyde Igarashi, told pv magazine. “We’re using conventional PV panels rated at IP68 to handle conditions out at sea. The panels are placed directly on top of the WEC modules and cables are protected by rubber seals. Micro inverters under the panels are used to synchronize with the frequency and amplitude of our wave energy converter.”
The standalone system is made of 3D-printed plastic and has a weight of 4.5 kg. It embeds an internal battery to store energy and is linkable to external batteries, the manufacturer said. It features a power output of 3 W per square foot (0.09 m2).
“After we perfect the hybrid Wavr with solar panels, the next step would be to link arrays together,” Igarashi said. “Currently we are targeting a price of around $2,300, which would include five 40 W solar panels. The 200 W solar system with inverter accounts for approximately $800 of the cost.”
He also stated that the price should decrease significantly with scale. “We haven’t yet done an LCOE calculation for any specific location,” he added.
Wavr is based in Mililani, Honolulu County, Hawaii.
