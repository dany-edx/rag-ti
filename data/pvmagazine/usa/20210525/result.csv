There are two versions of this credit: the Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit for private persons, and the Investment Tax Credit for business.
Residential solar purchasers should follow IRS guidance here, and fill out IRS Form 5695 when submitting annual taxes. Commercial entities will follow this guidance and complete IRS Form 3468.
Now, pv magazine USA is not a tax advisor, so seek professional advice before filling out these forms. The tax implications of solar construction should be part of a well-vetted solar contractor’s field of expertise, but here, too, solar contractors aren’t tax specialists, either.

With those caveats in mind, here are a few of the important aspects of the current version of the federal tax credit.
First, in order to take advantage of a federal tax credit, there must be a federal tax liability to apply the credit against.
There are many reasons that taxes might not be owed in any one year. Perhaps there were a lot of write-offs (more kids), or maybe you are retired and living on nontaxable income. If you don’t have a tax liability, then you can probably stop reading this article right here.
Residential solar power projects cost roughly $3.00 per watt, with a national average size of around 7,000 watts. That gives us an average project price of $21,000. The 26% tax credit in this scenario would provide a $5,460 credit to apply against what’s owed to Uncle Sam.

As you can see, it is very important to look closely at your tax liability to understand how this credit may fit into your finances.
Second, you’ll only get cash back if the taxes you already paid for the year are greater than what you owe.
For example, let’s say you paid $5,460 in federal income taxes over the course of the year. As noted above, a $21,000 solar power project would offer that exact value of tax credit. After verifying that your solar tax credit is worth $5,460 via the tax forms above, you’ll get back exactly that amount after filing your taxes.
However, if you happen to have paid $2,730 this year in federal income tax, and another $2,730 next year – you’ll get $2,730 back each year. The 2020 IRS form above allows taxpayers to carry unused portions of the tax credit into their 2021 return.
Third, the tax credit will fall from 26% to 22% in 2023. After 2023, the residential tax credit ends. For business customers, it continues indefinitely at 10%.
Next, battery systems charged by the solar power system are included in this solar tax credit. Whether batteries make pure financial sense is a different calculation entirely.
One final thought: solar tax credits are not set in stone. Incentives scheduled to vanish at the end of 2023 may soon renew. There’s even a chance that the incentives could increase.
In March, three senators introduced a bill that would temporarily allow businesses to get the tax credit back as cash, regardless of whether they owe the IRS. In May, a second piece of legislation was submitted which would make the cash payback permanent, not only for businesses but also for individuals.
The Biden Jobs Plan would increase the tax credit to 30%, both expanding the credit to those with little or no tax liability, and extending the credit for 10 more years.
If and when the laws do change, pv magazine USA will cover the news, and this author will update our Solar 101 series.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/25/isun-reports-a-wider-loss-but-seeks-to-grow-with-recent-acquisitions/,"FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 25, 2021","iSun reports a wider loss, but seeks to grow with recent acquisitions","Vermont-based iSun reported a net loss of $3.1 million, or ($0.41) per share during the first quarter of 2021. That compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, or ($0.15) per share in first quarter of 2020.
It reported first quarter 2021 EBITDA of ($1.4) million, compared to ($0.34) million during the same quarter a year earlier. It said the year-over-year decline in EBITDA was due largely to higher general and administrative expenses and lower gross profit due to the impacts of Covid-19-related shutdowns and higher-than-expected costs on certain projects in progress.
The company expanded its geographic range during the quarter with a $25 million micro-grid solar project in Tennessee, the company’s largest to date. It also entered the utility-scale solar market with its acquisition of OCS in April.
The company reported revenue of $7.3 million in the first quarter 2021, an increase of 82.2% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Revenue growth was driven by project awards in the second half of 2020 and in early 2021, including multiple projects in new regions and the continued ease of pandemic-related restrictions in key service areas.
Gross profit was $0.1 million in the first quarter 2021, compared to $0.3 million a year earlier. Gross margin during the quarter was 1.6%, compared to 7.9% in the first quarter of 2020.
The company said that the lower gross margin was mainly due to several Covid-19 related project shutdowns which drove higher costs and impacted productivity.
The gross margin in the first quarter also was impacted by what the company described as a “significant material issue” on
one of its out-of-state projects. Material that did not meet the design requirements were delivered to the job site. The company’s quality control team identified the issue at inspection and notified its procurement group. That group found replacement material that did not require a change to the design, but did require material modification on already installed equipment. The change resulted in additional material handling expense, material modification expense, and labor expense.
The company said that due to the nature of the material issue, it had to make the necessary changes without additional revenue to offset the unplanned expenses.
The operating loss was ($2.6) million in the first quarter, compared to ($0.5) million in the same period of 2020. The company said the year-over-decline was mainly due to lower gross profit and higher general and administrative costs related to the iSun, LLC acquisition, and to fund growth.
Total backlog rose to $81 million at end of first quarter of 2021, versus $61 million and $41 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020, respectively.
In March, iSun made a $1.5 million strategic investment in Gemini Electric Mobility Co., an electric vehicle and charging company for the gig-driver, and a $1.0 million strategic investment in Nad Grid Corp., an electric vehicle software and network provider. These investments are expected to drive incremental demand for iSun’s Energy & Mobility Hub.
In April, iSun acquired all of the intellectual property of Oakwood Construction Services, a utility-scale solar EPC company, and its affiliates. Total consideration was $2.7 million, with $1.0 million due immediately and the remaining $1.7 million contingent upon certain milestones, which have not yet been met.

The project was developed in partnership with EMCOR Services. Mesa Energy Systems and Standard Solar is funding and will own and operate the portfolio of solar canopy systems. Of the 21 projects, 14 haver been completed, with the other seven set to come on-line by October. In all, the portfolio totals just over 4 MW in capacity.
For LBUSD, the portfolio is expected to help the district achieve achieve its sustainability goals, offsetting the CO2 equivalent of approximately six million pounds of coal burned in their first year of operation.
Both Standard Solar and LBUSD said that the canopies will help reduce the urban heat island (UHI) effect often generated in dense, urban areas, a phenomenon seen at many of the schools included in this initiative.
An UHI is an urban area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities. The solar canopies can help minimize summer peak energy demand, air-conditioning costs, air pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions.
UHIs were also the partial focus of a Department of Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory study which found that urban landscapes and man-made aerosols have the potential to accelerate hail storm formation, make their winds harsher, and direct these storms toward cities. It said that when storms form on the borders of urban and rural areas, the warmer, drier air in these areas can amplify the power of the storm and direct it toward urban areas.

The tool provides a free, publicly accessible, open-source platform for calculating, understanding, and optimizing the value of DER based on their technical merits and constraints. DER-VET was developed in collaboration with the California Energy Commission. The source code for DER-VET is available here.
An extension of EPRI’s StorageVET tool, DER-VET supports site-specific assessments for energy storage and additional DER technologies. Applications include valuations and impacts of energy storage, solar, wind, demand response, electric vehicle (EV) charging, internal combustion engines, and combined heat and power in different configurations, such as microgrids. Site conditions, load, and other data are used to determine the optimal size, duration, and other operational characteristics for maximizing DER project benefits.
StorageVET helps decision makers determine where to place and install energy storage, the optimum size, and which controls to include. StorageVET also aims to improve energy storage project planning by enabling rapid scenario analysis with different storage sizes, costs, and value streams.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/25/california-poised-to-order-11500-mw-of-new-electric-capacity-mostly-from-renewables/,"POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 25, 2021","California poised to order 11,500 MW of new electric capacity, mostly from renewables","The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is set to consider two plans that would order utilities to procure 11,500 MW of new electricity resources to come online between 2023 and 2026, with most of the resources to come from zero-emitting sources.
The Proposed Decision of a CPUC Administrative Law Judge and the Alternate Proposed Decision of Commissioner Clifford Rechtschaffen, are on the CPUC’s June 24 Voting Meeting agenda for consideration. The CPUC’s five commissioners will vote to approve one plan or the other.
The resources are needed to respond to more extreme weather events and replace electricity generation from more than 3,700 MW of retiring natural gas plants and 2,200 MW from Pacific Gas and Electric’s retiring Diablo Canyon Power Plant.
Both proposals order at least 2,500 MW of zero-emitting resources to replace generation from Diablo Canyon. In 2019, the CPUC ordered new renewables and storage, which will result in a tenfold increase in batteries coming online this summer and next summer.
The Proposed Decision requires that approximately 90% of the generating resources come from non-fossil sources with an additional 1,000 -1,500 MW from efficiency improvements, upgrades, expansions, or re-powering at existing or mothballed fossil-fueled generation sites. Projects located in a disadvantaged community are limited to capacity that will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions by requiring specified amounts of green hydrogen or by adding storage.
The Alternate Proposed Decision requires around 95% from non-fossil resources, with an additional 500 MW from efficiency improvements, upgrades, or expansions at existing fossil sites, and requires all fossil improvements to increase efficiency and reduce the rate of GHG emissions.
The Alternate Proposed Decision also precludes any fossil-fueled projects in disadvantaged communities, and would not allow re-powering at mothballed or retired sites. The Alternate Proposed Decision also authorizes but does not require utilities to procure an additional 300 MW of fossil-fueled capacity at existing sites with a commitment to fuel with 30% green hydrogen by 2026 and 50% green hydrogen by 2031.
The procurement ordered in the two proposals is in addition to the 3,300 MW that the CPUC ordered previously to come online in 2021-2023, the 1,325 MW of energy storage required under Assembly Bill 2514 (2010), and an estimated 1,500 MW that will be procured under two recent decisions adopted to address extreme weather events and summer reliability.
The procurement would also add to the 4,000 MW from resources already contracted to come online between now and August 2024 associated with other state energy programs such as the Renewables Portfolio Standard.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/25/acciona-gets-a-green-light-for-kentuckys-largest-solar-project/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,KENTUCKY",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 25, 2021",ACCIONA gets a green light for Kentucky’s largest solar project,"Regulators in Kentucky have given their approval to ACCIONA to develop and construct its first solar installation within the state.
Set to clock in at 188 MW, the Fleming County project is one of four in Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois that were part of a power purchase agreement with Amazon announced last year, a portfolio totaling 641 MW in capacity.
The project will sell power into the PJM regional wholesale electricity market via an existing East Kentucky Power Cooperative transmission line that crosses the property. A state siting board directed the developer to use anti-glare panels and operate the array to eliminate any glare. The developer was directed to submit the outcome of a glare study by mid-June, and the final decision for the project was conditioned on the siting board’s approval of that study.
That 188 MW capacity makes this project the largest in Kentucky history by a significant margin, as that total is more than triple the state’s current installed solar capacity of 60 MW. The Fleming County Solar Farm will create up to 300 jobs during construction. In addition, the project will be part of ACCIONA’s Social Impact Management program, which reinvests a portion of the project’s annual revenue into community efforts to improve education, wellness and environmental stewardship.
Outside of the Fleming County project, construction is expected to start later this year on the Illinois portion of the Amazon portfolio, set have a final capacity of 100 MW. The other two projects are in review with state permitting authorities. Construction the portfolio will help to put ACCIONA on track to achieve its goal of building 1,200 MW of new solar capacity by the end of 2023.

U.S.-based First Solar said that its membership aligns it with RBA’s vision of creating a coalition of companies driving sustainable value for workers, the environment, and business.
First Solar said it pledged to support the group’s mission to collaborate with other members, its suppliers, and stakeholders to improve working and environmental conditions and business performance through standards and practices. The company’s membership gives it access to the RBA’s due diligence tools and programs. First Solar said it would leverage RBA’s Validated Assessment Program (VAP) for onsite compliance verification and audits.
Mike Koralewski, chief manufacturing operations officer, said in a statement that “As the solar industry struggles to address issues like forced labor in the absence of credible audit programs, the VAP illustrates the fact that there is no need to reinvent the wheel in the search for a robust and reputable assessment framework.”
Power plant developer rPlus Energies broke ground on Graphite Solar I, a 104 MW solar project owned by Greenbacker Renewable Energy in Carbon County, Utah, in the east-central part of the state.
Graphite Solar will be one of the largest solar plants in Greenbacker’s portfolio of renewable energy projects and will deliver power to a new Facebook data center in Eagle Mountain, Utah, near Salt Lake City.
The project has a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with utility PacifiCorp on behalf of Facebook. The contract was developed under a green energy tariff, which allows large customers like Facebook to buy renewable energy generated on their behalf.
Sundt Construction will serve as the engineering, procurement and construction lead for the project. Greenbacker bought the pre-operational solar project from rPlus Energies in December and hired rPlus to continue to develop the project through construction.
Competitive Power Ventures said that Maple Hill Solar, a planned 100 MW solar facility in north-central Pennsylvania, has begun construction with the support of Gemma Power Systems. The solar farm is located on the site of a former coal mine and is expected to enter service in May 2022. Maple Hill Solar will consist of 530+ Watt bi-facial solar panels from Talesun. The project will use single-axis tracking to maximize energy production.
Yabin Xing, president of Talesun North America, said the project will strengthen the company’s expansion in U.S. markets.
CIM Group said that its 250 MW Aquamarine solar project in California closed on debt and tax equity financing with Deutsche Bank acting as lead arranger of the debt financing. A spokesperson for CIM Group declined to reveal the dollar amount of the financing.
The solar project is slated to enter service this fall and is contracted to provide 50 MW of capacity to Valley Clean Energy Alliance. Valley Clean is a locally governed electricity provider for the California cities of Davis, Woodland, Winters and unincorporated portions of Yolo County.
Aquamarine also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the City of Santa Clara to sell renewable energy credits associated with 75 MW of capacity.
