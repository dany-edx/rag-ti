The DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office tapped EPRI to look into how residential and commercial utility customers make decisions related to the co-adoption of solar power with other distributed energy resource (DER) technologies, such as energy storage and electric vehicles. The research is expected to help utilities determine future needs of the electric grid.
In collaboration with the DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, EPRI will assess residential and commercial customer preferences, influences, and decision-making. The play among these distributed energy resource technologies can provide consumers and businesses new flexibility in the way they use energy.
The researchers said that without a clearer understanding of customer motivations for owning and operating multiple DERs, utilities may not fully anticipate and prepare for the grid impacts of DER co-adoption.
The project is also expected to aid long-term forecasting tools, such as NREL’s open-source dGen adoption model.

(NIPSCO) signed a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and a Build & Transfer Agreement (BTA) for two renewable energy projects in Indiana.
The BTA will allow construction of the 200 MW Indiana Crossroads Solar Park in White County, roughly halfway between Indianapolis and Chicago, which is anticipated to become operational in 2022. NIPSCO will enter into a joint venture once construction is complete.
The PPA will enable construction of the 204 MW Indiana Crossroads II Wind Farm, also in White County. That capacity is expected to become operational in 2023, and NIPSCO will buy the project’s full capacity.
NIPSCO has been  increasing its commitment to renewables over the past year, having announced or contracted for hundreds of megawatts of new capacity, a shift in a state that has less than 500 MW of active solar thus far.
Last July, the utility announced two new projects totaling 300 MW that are set to come online by 2023: the 200 MW Brickyard Solar project and the 100 MW Greensboro Solar project. The Greensboro project will also include 30 MW of battery storage. Both projects will be developed, constructed, owned, and operated by a unit of NextEra Energy Resources; NIPSCO will buy the power through 20-year PPAs.
In October, the utility said it would bring  900 MW of renewable capacity on-line by the end of 2023, across three projects: the Dunns Bridge I, Dunns Bridge II, and Cavalry Solar Energy Centers. Cavalry Solar will be a 200 MW installation coupled with 60 MW of battery storage. It will be located in White County and is expected to be operational in late 2023.
Underlying this development spurt is NIPSCO’s plan to become coal-free by 2028.

In December, NIPSCO signed a long-term PPA for 280 MW generated by a greenfield solar project called Gibson Solar. The project is being developed by Capital Dynamic’s Clean Energy Investment unit in Gibson County, in the state’s southwest corner. Arevon Energy Management and Tenaska are co-developing the project.
Underlying this development spurt is NIPSCO’s plan to become coal-free by 2028 by adding cleaner energy sources to its existing portfolio of natural gas and hydroelectric generation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/23/commercial-trucks-are-ripe-for-electrification-if-policies-back-ev-adoption/,"BATTERY,EV,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 23, 2021","Commercial trucks are ripe for electrification, if policies back EV adoption","A new report said that a lack of policies around adoption incentives, charging infrastructure, and electricity pricing prevents the widespread electrification of commercial trucking fleets.
Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Los Angeles made the case for prioritizing public policy to help move long-haul trucking from diesel to electric.

The study analyzed the total cost of ownership of an electric long-haul truck compared to a diesel long-haul truck. It said that at the current global average battery pack price of $135/kWh, a Class 8 electric truck with 375-mile range and operated 300 miles per day offers about 13% lower total cost of ownership per mile, a three-year payback, and net present savings of about $200,000 over a 15-year lifetime.
The report said these modeled results were achieved with a 3% reduction in payload capacity. It said this penalty could be reversed through light-weighting.
The report estimated that the average distance traveled between 30-minute driver breaks is 150 miles and 190 miles for regional-haul and long-haul trucks, respectively. It said that 30% of charging using 500 kW or megawatt-scale fast-chargers would add sufficient range without impairing operations and economics of freight movement.
In February, Romeo Power and battery developer Ecellix Inc. said they would work together on technology to trim the weight of a 1 MWh battery pack by up to 9,900 pounds. That reduction is equal to cutting the weight of a battery-electric Class 8 truck by up to 25%, adding as much as 660 miles of range on a single charge.
Nikola Corp.
The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to cooperate in the development, validation, and launch of Ecellix’s battery technology, which aims to replace lithium-ion technology in commercial vehicles.
The partnership will combine Ecellix’s eCell technology with Romeo Power’s battery packs, modules, and battery management system. Exellix’s technology is claimed to add up to 50% more energy to current-generation lithium-ion batteries.
The Berkeley Lab report said that, as with almost any clean technology, higher upfront capital costs of both vehicles and charging infrastructure are “major barriers” when electric trucking is in its infancy. Without strong policy support, coordinated investments in both vehicle manufacturing and fuel infrastructure will not be forthcoming on the scale needed to harness the true potential of battery electric trucks, the report said.
Higher upfront capital costs of both vehicles and charging infrastructure are “major barriers” when electric trucking is in its infancy, the report said.

Berkeley Lab scientists said that diesel trucks are responsible for almost one-third of motor vehicle CO2 emissions. The transportation sector ranks as the largest contributor of CO2 emissions associated with the U.S. economy.
Berkeley Lab said that long-haul trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells are on the horizon, and battery-powered electric trucks have seen “the most dramatic improvements” in technology in recent years, making battery costs more affordable and competitive.
Earlier this year, Hyzon Motors, a supplier of hydrogen fuel cell-powered heavy vehicles, said it planned to build a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) plant near Chicago.
The Hyzon plant is expected to produce enough MEAs to supply up to 12,000 hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks each year.

At full capacity, the Hyzon plant is expected to produce enough MEAs to supply up to 12,000 hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks each year. The facility is expected to start producing in the fourth quarter.
Refuse-hauling trucks are gaining attention as one class of trucks that could be readily electrified. For example, XL Fleet Corp. partnered with Curbtender, a provider of Under CDL refuse trucks, to jointly develop a series of battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric commercial trucks for use in waste management.
The companies said they plan to develop and launch within the next year a battery electric refuse vehicle equipped with an XL Electric propulsion system and a Curbtender Quantum rear loader refuse truck body. The agreement also includes joint development of plug-in hybrid electric versions of the vehicle, as well as a range of Class 3 to Class 8 vehicle offerings for the waste management industry.
Also, in late January, Romeo Power and Republic Services entered into a strategic alliance agreement to develop Romeo Power’s battery technology for use in Republic’s electric garbage trucks.
The companies said that a single refuse truck travels roughly 25,000 miles annually and that the segment contributes around 1.4% of the transportation industry’s overall fuel consumption. That makes refuse trucks an attractive application for electrification as well as a “high-impact opportunity” to drive decarbonization within the commercial sector.

The two plan to deploy 450 MW of distributed solar and storage projects across the U.S. Assets will be owned by the partnership and operated by Soltage.
The first investment is a 14.5 MW portfolio of solar assets representing $30 million of project costs. The projects are expected to finalize construction and enter service this year, and include five sites in Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Power purchasers include utilities, corporates, and community solar off-takers.
Soltage has developed more than 100 solar energy projects with more than 400 MW total distributed generating capacity under construction and management. It is backed by investors including Prudential Capital Group. Harrison Street has roughly $32 billion in assets under management.
Twelve newly trained solar installers who also live in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments are helping to deploy around 1 MW of rooftop solar on NYHCA buildings across the city.

Con Edison’s Community Power program helps apprentice installers develop skills to work in the solar industry. The lead development partner, Solar One, provides training and education to make sustainable energy and green jobs more accessible.
Green City Force, WE ACT, and NYCHA recruited applicants for the apprenticeships. The apprentices work for Accord Power, a solar installer and certified Minority Business Enterprise. The rooftop solar effort is financed by Sunwealth.
At least 400 low- and moderate-income Con Edison customers will be able to sign up for electricity produced by the arrays. Annual bill savings are estimated to reach $120; revenue from the leased roof space will go to the host NYCHA developments.
Nevada regulators approved the $2.5 billion Greenlink Nevada transmission and renewable energy initiative, which was proposed by utility NV Energy. The line is expected to enable development of around 5,000 MW of renewable energy projects across western and northern parts of the state.
NV Energy will start design and permitting work for two planned segments of Greenlink Nevada. Greenlink West, the first  segment, is a single 525 kV line stretching about 370 miles northwest from Las Vegas to Yerington, and two 345 kV lines covering around 70 miles from Yerington north to the Reno/Sparks area. Greenlink West could enter service in December 2026.
California fire officials determined that a deadly wildfire in September 2020 started when a pine tree came in contact with electric lines owned by utility Pacific Gas & Electric. The Zogg Fire burned more than 56,000 acres, killed four people, and left one person injured. It burned in Shasta County in far northern California.
An incident report that the utility filed with state regulators said that wildfire camera and satellite data on Sept. 27, 2020 showed smoke, heat, or signs of fire in an area served by a 12 kV PG&E-owned distribution line. According to utility records, a smart meter and line recloser serving the area reported alarms between 2:40 p.m. and 3:06 p.m., when the line recloser de-energized the circuit.
The most recent Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) quarterly auction earlier in March resulted in a clearing price of $7.60 per short ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). That topped the previous high price of $7.50 per short ton reached in December 2015. States can reinvest proceeds from the auctions in programs to improve energy efficiency and speed deployment of renewable energy technologies.
The Energy Information Administration said the RGGI agreement was the first in the United States to place a cap on power sector CO2 emissions. Original RGGI member states are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. In January, Virginia became a full participant. New Jersey withdrew from the program in 2012 but rejoined in January 2020.
