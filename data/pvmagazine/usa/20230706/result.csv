The facility, owned and operated by contract manufacturer Flex, is one wave in the record-breaking tide of clean energy investment announcements that have come over the last year.
“Today Enphase is shipping their first microinverters made in America,” said Biden.
Biden celebrated the $497 billion in manufacturing investments that have been announced since the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure laws were passed. Over 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since Biden took office. He highlighted the $11 billion in clean energy investments in South Carolina alone, where he delivered a speech on his new brand of economics dubbed “Bidenomics.”
Biden’s economic model is one focused on bringing middle-class jobs back to the United States, particularly manufacturing jobs, and restoring good-paying jobs to communities that were “sold out” to overseas operations during the end of the twentieth century.
“Trickle-down economics represented a time when we walked away from how this country was built,” said the President. “Bidenomics means restoring the American dream.”
The South Carolina facility is owned and operated by contract manufacturer Flex and will produce Enphase microinverters, the leading provider of inverters of this type.
The inverter provider said it expects to add a total of three contract manufacturing facilities in the United States, producing over 18 million microinverters per year, equivalent to meeting the needs of 1 million U.S. solar homes. The facility will bring 600 jobs to South Carolina, with 1,800 jobs in total being added across the three contract sites.
Enphase estimates it will invest nearly $20 million per manufacturing facility in the U.S. for a total of $60 million in capital investment across all U.S. manufacturing lines in addition to significant capital investments from its contract manufacturing partners.

“Enphase shares our commitment to accelerating the world’s transition to clean energy through advanced technology and strategic regional manufacturing,” said Revathi Advaithi, chief executive officer, Flex.
Manufacturing clean energy components in the United States has become much more attractive following Biden’s largest-ever $369 billion investment in climate and energy via the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act contains tax credits for producing clean energy components, as well as domestic content tax credit adders for projects that contain a certain threshold of U.S.-made parts.
A survey by the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) found that 100% of its respondents perceive the U.S. market to be increasing in attractiveness relative to other major countries in renewable energy investment. The response, made by executives from 43 leading companies with $100 million in annual revenues or investments, is the first time in the ACORE survey’s history that the United States has unanimously been perceived to be increasing in relative attractiveness to other nations.
By 2030, it is estimated the IRA will drive the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery facilities.
“By 2035, all electricity in America is going to be generated by clean energy,” said Biden.

The Investing in America agenda intends to bring manufacturing back to America after decades of offshoring, which will relieve the U.S. dependence on foreign countries for imports, but will also create new, good-paying jobs.
The funding to bolster manufacturing for the solar sector supports the Biden Administration’s goal of reducing carbon emissions in the U.S. by roughly 40% in 2030. Specifically, it will support the development of new dual-use solar technologies such as agrivoltaics and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) to create new markets for American products.
“President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has led to a surge of solar manufacturing announcements and has created thousands of good paying, union jobs in solar deployment,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “With these innovative, made-in-America technologies, the Biden-Harris Administration is powering the clean energy transition, lowering electricity costs for hardworking Americans, and protecting the future for our children from the impacts of the climate crisis.”
Agrivoltaics, BIPV, floating PV, and vehicle-integrated PV are all examples of dual-use solar in which solar is generated in an application that can serve a secondary purpose. By integrating solar energy systems into existing landscapes, such as in agrivoltaics, which pairs solar with agricultural use, dual-use PV has the potential to minimize land-use challenges.
To date there have been 63 domestic manufacturing announcements across the solar supply chain since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, according to the DOE. More than 40 of these have been announced since the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act just about one year ago. One these facilities are operational, they will contribute important domestic components needed for the build out of a clean energy industry in the U.S. while also creating jobs, simplifying shipping and logistics, and reducing supply chain uncertainty.

The North Carolina utility said it expects about $259 million of net proceeds from the transaction.
The deal represents the second solar divestment of the year for the utility. In early June, Duke reached an agreement to sell its utility-scale renewables business platform for $2.8 bilion to Brookfield Renewable. The company expects to finalize the sales for its utility and distributed-generation solar businesses by the end of 2023. It said it plans to use sale proceeds to lower balance sheet debt.
The two divestments support Duke’s focus on the growth of its regulated businesses, including investments to enhance grid reliability and incorporate over 30 GW of regulated renewable energy into its grid by 2035.
The distributed-generation business being sold includes REC Solar operating assets, development pipeline and O&M portfolio, as well as various fuel cell projects managed by Bloom Energy. Employees of the distributed generation business will transition to ArcLight to maintain business continuity for its operations and customers.
Duke initially acquired the REC Solar commercial DG business in February 2015 for about $225 million.
“The sale of our commercial renewables businesses streamlines our portfolio and provides the resources to support the long-term needs of our customers in our growing regulated territories,” said Lynn Good, president and chief executive officer of Duke Energy. “Over the next decade, we plan to invest significant amounts of capital to fund the critical energy infrastructure necessary to serve our customers and support our clean energy transition.”
“This transaction leverages ArcLight’s deep experience in investing across the renewables infrastructure sector and utilizing our value-added approach to help drive asset optimization, which allow us to further build upon the portfolio and advance brownfield development opportunities,” said Dan Revers, managing partner of ArcLight.
The sale is subject to closing conditions, including a waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, as well as approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the sale of Bloom Energy fuel cell assets.
Bank of America Securities is financial advisor and Mayer Brown LLP is legal advisor to Duke Energy for the divestment. Scotia is financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis is legal advisor to ArcLight Capital, a Boston-based energy private equity firm invested in $27 billion of transactions since 2001.
Earlier this year, Duke Energy sold its utility-scale solar development business to Brookfield Renewables, which includes a 3.4 GW pipeline of wind, solar and energy storage assets in various stages of development. The utility had previously put a $4 billion valuation on its broader utility-scale renewables business.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/06/active-grid-scale-energy-storage-projects-across-the-u-s/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,VERMONT",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 6, 2023",Active grid-scale energy storage projects across the U.S.,"Energy storage is paired with renewable energy to balance the grid, match intermittent supply and demand, and provide reserve power for when it is needed most, among other functions. Over 82% of actively planned capacity additions in the United States are solar, wind, and energy storage, with solar representing over 50% of all planned U.S. generation capacity.
A report from American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie project that the nation may add as much as 75 GW of energy storage between 2023 and 2027 to meet the needs of an evolving grid.
Energy storage has been ramping up considerably in recent years. In 2017, only 288 MW / 645 MWh was added. Five years later, in 2022, 4.8 GW / 12.1 GWh was brought online. The 2022 total for deployment was nearly equal to the totals in 2020 and 2021 combined, as deployment rates continue to heat up.
“Grid-scale installations account for approximately 60 GW, 81% of the new capacity added [through 2027],” said Vanessa Witte, senior analyst, Wood Mackenzie.
Here are three recent project announcements that are contributing toward the rapid ramp up of energy storage nationwide.
Major utility project
California utility San Diego Gas & Electric announced it has completed two energy storage facilities totaling 171 MW / 684 MWh. The storage facilities hold enough electricity to power the equivalent of 130,000 homes for four hours.
The storage was added across two projects: the 131 MW Westside Canal project in Imperial Valley and the 40 MW Fallbrook project in northern San Diego County. The utility’s total storage portfolio is expected to reach 345 MW of capacity by the end of the year, capable of meeting over 15% of its customers’ demand on a typical day and 7% on a peak day.
“The beauty of energy storage is it can help California solve two problems simultaneously. It can soak up surplus renewable energy during the day, so solar and wind farms don’t have to cut off production when demand on the grid is low,” said SDG&E’s Vice President of Energy Innovation Miguel Romero. “By extending the availability of clean energy to peak evening hours, energy storage can also help California achieve its clean energy goals by reducing reliance on conventional power plants to meet peak electricity demand.”
National lab collaboration
EVLO Energy Storage, a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec, announced its first storage project in the U.S., adding a 3 MW / 12 MWh project in Troy, Vermont.
The project includes a $2 million cost-share partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy Sandia National Laboratory. It will provide data to the laboratory to support analysis of how batteries can support export of energy from the region.
The company will install EVLO 1000 unit batteries, power converters, and its energy management system. The project will be commissioned by the end of 2023 and EVLO will maintain and monitor for 20 years.
“With this project, we’re excited to demonstrate how it can benefit utility customers and the New England grid,” said Sonia St-Arnaud, president and chief executive officer, EVLO.
Gas plant storage
Energy storage is sometimes used as a replacement for natural gas peaker plants that are fired up during the highest-demand times on the grid. A new project in California by Ameresco will instead opt for co-locating storage with gas facilities, allowing stored renewables and gas peakers to operate in concert.
Four co-located battery projects at gas plants owned by Middle River Power, an independent power producer, will add 379 MWh of capacity to the grid. The storage duration was not disclosed, though most projects of this type opt for four-hour duration.
The work is expected to kick off in Summer 2023 and reach completion in Q3 of 2024.
“The energy storage assets allow for the shifting of solar energy from the middle of the day to supply the grid during evening peak hours, while maintaining our natural gas facilities as a flexible, reliable backstop,” said Mark Kubow, chief executive officer of Middle River Power.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/06/grassland-agrivoltaics-show-minimal-difference-in-forage-yield-to-traditional-growth/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JULY 6, 2023",Grassland agrivoltaics show minimal difference in forage yield to traditional growth,"Agrivoltaic systems, where solar photovoltaic arrays are co-located with crop or forage production, can alleviate the tension between expanding solar development and loss of agricultural land. However, the ecological ramifications of these arrays are not yet well known.
Agrivoltaics bring notable benefits, including creating microclimates for crops, shade to grazing animals, improved forage quality, and increasing farmer income and income stability. While the installation of traditional solar arrays tends to increase soil compaction, reduce soil carbon and nutrient content, and reduce water retention, care can be taken during the installation phase to minimize the impacts on soil and vegetation. Agrivoltaic solar arrays may be better able to maintain crucial ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water retention, and habitat quality.
A new report by Colorado State University used field measurements and a plant hydraulic model to quantify carbon-water cycling in a semi-arid perennial grassland growing beneath a single-axis tracking solar array in the Rocky Mountain State.
Although the solar array reduces light availability by 38% during the day, photosynthesis and above ground primary productivity were reduced by only 6–7% while evapotranspiration or the evaporation of water from soil into the atmosphere decreased by just 1.3%.
These minimal changes in carbon-water cycling occurred largely because the sample plants’ photosynthetic traits underneath the panels changed to take advantage of the dynamic shading environment.
The test results indicate that agrivoltaic systems can serve as a scalable way to expand solar energy production while maintaining ecosystem function in managed grasslands, especially in climates where water is scarce compared to sunlight.
Agrivoltaic systems are promising in water-limited regions such as the Western U.S. due to their capacity to moderate thermal environments and reduce plant water-use and soil evaporation. Semi-arid and arid grasslands are a favorable location for such arrays given their short-statured vegetation and relatively flat topography, the CSU report found.
The U.S. is home to close to 40 million acres of grassland for hay production and non-alfalfa forage. It has been estimated that close to 10 million acres of high-density photovoltaic systems are needed to achieve statewide decarbonization goals by 2050. Thus, the report notes that managed grasslands have the potential to house an increasing amount of collocated agrivoltaic systems at a meaningful scale while concurrently increasing land-use efficiency.
However, the CSU report affirms certain unknowns still exist about the long-term impacts of agrivoltaic systems, including the degree to which reductions in light availability will limit plant photosynthesis, and thus forage production.
Water retention in grassland agrivoltaics could also translate into enhanced ecosystem resistance to weather extremes such as droughts or heat waves.
Overall, many uncertainties remain regarding the highly dynamic microclimate within agrivoltaics, the physiological responses of plants to microclimate variability, and how solar arrays impact carbon and water cycling at decade-level time scale.
Jack’s Solar Garden
In the U.S., where the CSU study was undertaken at the first widely studied agrivoltaic project, Jack’s Solar Garden, a 1.2 MW, 3.5-acre solar field in Longmount, Colo., with new crops grown underneath since 2020, studies have been undertaken for just the last few years.
Widespread adoption of agrivoltaics in managed grasslands will depend, in part, on the degree to which ecosystem function within the array can be maintained despite reductions in light availability.
At Jack’s Solar Garden, the CSU study used plant hydraulics and soil hydrology to simulate grassland growth and hourly carbon-water fluxes over a 23-year time period forecast. Using single-axis tracking panels, common smooth brome pasture grass grows underneath and between the solar panels in 17 foot spaced rows.
The CSU model was measured with plant traits and driven by a combination of measured and reanalysis-derived weather data. The study group partitioned the agrivoltaic system into four locations:
The impact of agrivoltaics on grassland function will likely differ across climates and species. While reductions in productivity are commonly observed in more moderate moisture ecosystems, drier regions may experience increases in plant growth under solar arrays due to more acute water limitation in those environments, the study found.
The CSU study was undertaken using C3 type grass, a cool season grass type found in cooler temperature environments and less sunlight requirements, with high moisture retention and high frost withstand. Future studies by the group will focus on C4 grassland plots, which are warmer environment, high light factor grass with lower moisture requirements.
The report was led by Steven A. Kannenberg of West Virginia University, with participation by Matthew Sturchio and Alan K. Knapp of Colorado State University, and Martin Venturas of Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/06/the-rapid-expansion-of-small-scale-distributed-generation-solar/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,CHINA,UNITED STATES",,"JULY 6, 2023","The rapid expansion of small-scale, distributed-generation solar","From pv magazine 06/23
Two of the biggest solar markets, the United States and China, expanded their distributed-generation capacity by more than 65% in 2021 and 2022, against a 4% fall and an 18% rebound in utility scale PV. That means a qualitative shift in financing, in particular to back the integration of mass, networked, distributed-energy resources (DER) under virtual power plants (VPPs) and traditional utilities. Rethink Technology Research believes that utilities, especially in the U.S., plan to participate in mass distributed-solar rollout. We think they will offer to partner with residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) property owners and act as a bridge to finance.
While net metering payments and reduced electricity sales might spook utilities, electric companies have tremendous balance sheets to borrow against and can recruit “full scale” distributed-generation (DG) customers, equipped to their maximum solar roof and energy storage potential.
First mover
The first power company to embrace this change will be imitated by others because the alternative is to be abandoned by customers wealthy enough to go full scale distributed alone, free from grid reliance. Utilities that rent roofs back to customers unable to purchase PV arrays outright will open the market to more solar customers and safeguard themselves from falling energy prices while retaining control of power generation.
With half of the world’s electricity to come from solar in future – and half of that DG arrays – utilities will have to embrace the VPPs expected to become widespread in the US in the next two years, and later in Australia, parts of Europe, and, potentially strong DER markets such as Japan.
VPP outlook
The Rocky Mountain Institute, a sustainability thinktank, announced a virtual power plant partnership in January with General Motors. It also announced agreements with Ford, Sunpower, Sunrun, home-automation specialist Google Nest, and the OhmConnect energy-efficiency program. In addition, it started working with Olivine, an energy demand-response specialist, and SPAN, which provides home energy-consumption panels. It also collaborates with VPP developer SwitchDin and Virtual Peaker, a residential electric demand software platform.
Utilities in the United States and elsewhere are already obliged to enable VPPs on their grids, meaning they must track and model VPP grid participation. More than two-thirds of U.S. electricity meters at the end of 2021 were smart devices, with 120 million now installed.

Independent aggregators are now pushing VPPs, meaning more generation and storage is taken out of the hands of utilities until they join the market. If more than 60% of solar capacity is small scale, a similar volume of storage capacity can be expected, paid for by homeowners or whoever paid for the systems, and will be attached to a revenue-generating VPP.
Despite rising solar prices, Rethink Energy estimates the global PV industry grew 30% last year, with 221 GW added, and will rise 50% this year and in 2024, based on 330 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity last year, plus 45 GW per month more this year.
Distributed outlook
We estimate rooftop panels accounted for 57% of the solar added last year and will stay above 50% through mid-2025, with DG numbers rising in the U.S., China, and most other big markets. While high module prices and other supply chain issues affected utility scale plants, war in Ukraine prompted people and businesses to go solar to safeguard energy security.
Rethink Energy expects the pendulum to swing back to utility from 2025 to 2030, as manufacturing bottlenecks ease and module prices – which make up around 40% of project costs – return to the price decline curve which prevailed until mid-2020. Prices topped $300 per kilowatt of generation capacity in late 2021 but have now subsided below $240/kW, before shipping, and will reach $200/kW in 2025.

DG systems will retake the crown from 2031, to hit 63% of all new installations in 2050. Both will boom and while hundreds of gigawatts of capacity in Australian and Chilean deserts alone will power green hydrogen, DG’s potential will be even greater, driven by energy prices.
Distributed solar has so many cost factors that the price spike in polysilicon – which still accounts for more than 25% of module costs – barely changed the financial formula, enabling small-scale PV to dominate. Many countries have boosted rooftop solar with new policies but these are simply riding the wave, not causing it.
In 2027, utility-scale solar will, for a brief moment, once again enjoy the 57% share of new installs it held before the pandemic. From that point on, multiple long-term trends will work in favor of distributed PV – with one of them being the “next big limiting factor” of the solar industry – transmission. In 2031, the two sectors will return to parity, as distributed prepares to take over for the second time.

Peter White founded Computerwire in 1984, launching tech publications such as “Computer Business Review” before evolving into a market research and consulting firm. White founded Rethink Technology Research in 2002 to publish strategy bulletins and market forecasts. The company has a focus on the technology inside video, cable, satellite, and digital homes, along with solar, energy storage, hydrogen, and wind power.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/06/michigan-energy-storage-bills-can-serve-as-a-model-for-the-nation/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,MICHIGAN",,"JULY 6, 2023",Michigan energy storage bills can serve as a model for the nation,"There is broad consensus that the transition to clean energy is going to require lots more energy storage than we have today. How exactly that should happen is less clear. A handful of states have set storage procurement targets of varying ambition. At the federal level, the Inflation Reduction Act has created the biggest incentives for storage yet, but more work needs to happen at the state level. State policy will ensure that storage investments spurred on by the federal legislation happen at a big enough scale and quick enough pace to match the deployment of renewable energy needed to meet emissions reduction targets.
The Michigan Legislature recently introduced some of the boldest state-level policies for energy storage in the entire country. Passing these bills would make the state among the most ambitious in the Midwest when it comes to growing storage capacity and encouraging business models that unlock the full potential of this technology, like the “virtual power plant” model.
The first bill, HB 4256 would establish a state-wide target of 2,500 MW of grid-scale energy storage by 2030 and require utilities to achieve that goal by competitively procuring storage systems. These targets would set Michigan on a path to achieve the emissions reduction timeline set by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan. That plan aims to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 and 52% by 2030 and ultimately achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050.
A separate set of bills, HB 4839 and HB 4840, would stimulate the market for behind-the-meter generation, help consumers make the decision to install their own storage systems and increase access to backup power for low-income customers who experience the worst consequences of rolling blackouts and power outages. One bill would provide rebates to residential electric customers who install rooftop solar and behind-the-meter storage systems, including extra support for low-income households. The other bill would require the development of statewide programs to create virtual power plants.
Virtual power plants are created by aggregating resources such as behind-the-meter customer solar and storage. On their own, these devices empower customers to generate and store their own power, ensure backup power, and save on their electricity bills. Bundled together through virtual power plants by the hundreds or thousands, these devices become even more powerful. They can be called upon to supply vast amounts of power to the grid to reduce peak energy supply constraints and add reliability to the grid, reducing costs for all ratepayers.
The recently introduced energy storage bills will collectively serve as a model for other states. The amount of storage HB 4256 targets would be transformative, especially for a state in a region of the country that has not deployed as much storage as elsewhere–there is only about 78 MW of utility-scale battery storage capacity in the region of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the grid operator for most of the Midwest including Michigan, compared to 317 MW in the region of the New England Independent System Operator and 295 MW in the region of the Mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM, according to the most recent U.S. Energy Information Administration data.
The residential storage bills would also help Michigan catch up to other regions of the country when it comes to behind-the-meter storage at homes and businesses. Utility customers in states from California to Texas have been able to receive compensation for their home storage systems by enrolling their systems with other distributed energy resources in a local area as aggregated virtual power plants.
The fact that these proposals surfaced in Michigan is particularly significant. The only Midwestern states that have enacted storage-related policies are Illinois, Minnesota and Missouri, according to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Energy Storage Policy Database.
Michigan is also facing significant electric reliability challenges. If this legislation passes and makes the state a leader in energy storage development, it can also be a model for other states seeking to improve distribution grid reliability. Michigan has long been one of the worst-performing states for reliability, and recent severe power outages following an ice storm illustrate this vulnerability. Lawmakers are calling for investigations into the major utilities’ stewardship of the grid, while the largest utility in the state, DTE Energy, is proposing some of its biggest rate increases ever to try to cover the costs of more grid maintenance. Storage, however, can make the grid more reliable and resilient while deferring the need for utilities to perform as many expensive grid upgrades, ultimately saving money for ratepayers. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy’s (EGLE) Energy Storage Roadmap, the document that informed the storage targets found in both the MI Healthy Climate Plan and the new legislation, identified several benefits from storage relevant to reliability: transmission congestion relief, distribution upgrade deferral, shaving demand to help meet peak load requirements and enabling virtual power plants.
To confront Michigan’s reliability and resiliency challenges, several things need to happen. First, low-income customers who are hit the hardest by power outages need to be provided with affordable options to purchase solar plus storage systems. HB 4840 would provide this much-needed assistance. Second, customers who are interested in installing storage for the sake of making their homes or businesses more resilient need to have assurances that if they install such a system, they can utilize those assets to their maximum potential, justifying the up-front costs. HB 4839 would ensure that customers are compensated for any benefits they provide to their neighbors, the grid and the utilities.
Third, as more of the state’s electricity is generated by renewables, utility-scale storage is becoming increasingly important to ensure that power is always available. HB 4256 would help preserve Michigan’s long-term electric reliability by making utility-scale storage more readily available wherever it is needed.
Finally, Michigan needs more storage that can discharge energy for longer periods. HB 4256 has a provision that could help encourage new technologies to meet the long-duration storage needs that are so critical for grid decarbonization goals. The provision requires the Michigan Public Service Commission to complete a study to determine how much long-duration energy storage is needed in Michigan and to establish targets to procure the needed long-duration storage.
U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm recently described Michigan as a “hotbed” for clean energy development. The state’s role in the electric vehicle space is known, but these bills would grow Michigan’s standing as a hotbed for battery storage and distributed energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/06/new-guidelines-for-inter-row-spacing-of-pv-power-plants/,"RESEARCH,CANADA,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 6, 2023",New guidelines for inter-row spacing of PV power plants,"From pv magazine global
Researchers at the University of Ottawa in Canada have defined a series of formulae for ground coverage ratios (GCRs) in utility scale solar power plants.
In the study “Optimal ground coverage ratios for tracked, fixed-tilt, and vertical photovoltaic systems for latitudes up to 75°N,” published in Solar Energy, the scientists said the new guidelines are applicable to projects based on both monofacial and bifacial modules that are located at latitudes between 17°N and 75°N.
They selected, in particular, 31 locations in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
“Where possible, the locations represent multiple diffuse fractions within a given latitude range, with diffuse fraction defined as the annually-averaged ratio of diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) to global horizontal irradiance (GHI),” they specified. “The analysis we have presented has been conducted for North American locations, but covers a wide range of operating conditions, including diffuse fractions between 0.23 and 0.55, average GHI-weighted ambient temperatures of −4 C to 31 C, average GHI-weighted albedos between 0.10 and 0.65, and city elevations between 1 and 1600 m.”
The Canadian group used PV performance prediction software Duet, an open-access cloud-based solar project designing tool developed by the University of Ottawa itself, to create 3D models including mounting structures and multiple rows.
“Optical calculations are then completed considering direct beam radiation, anisotropic diffuse sky radiation, and ground-reflected radiation by segmenting the modules, ground, and diffuse sky-dome into patches,” the researchers explained. “A shading algorithm is implemented using a deterministic ray intersection method to capture the effect of objects in the 3D scene.”
The academics said that Duet software is able to translate the irradiance profiles into per-timestep cell I–V curves through a temperature and irradiance-dependent single-diode model, noting that they calculated the effect of ground coverage ratios between 0 and 1 on both monofacial and bifacial fixed-tilt and horizontal single-axis tracked (HSAT) systems.
The research group found that GCR may vary consistently between 0.15–0.68 for fixed-tilt systems and less significantly between 0.17–0.32 for HSAT systems, and said for both cases values depend strongly on latitude. “Similarly, the optimal tilt of fixed-tilt arrays varies widely from 7° above latitude-tilt to 60° below latitude-tilt, depending on the latitude and GCR,” it highlighted, adding that vertical systems are less sensitive to latitude.
The scientists also found that bifacial PV systems require GCRs up to 0.03 lower than monofacial GCRs. “Since latitude was the dominating factor affecting inter-row energy yield loss, our results should provide an estimate of the performance of equivalent PV arrays across the globe,” they concluded.
