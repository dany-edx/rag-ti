A recent report from Intersolar North America and Energy Storage North America (ISNA/ESNA) breaks down the successes of the federal law, some of its challenges in implementation, and what to expect over this critical decade of energy transition.
The legislation contains numerous provisions to support the U.S. solar industry, among other clean energy technologies, including a long-term extension of the federal investment tax credit, significant domestic manufacturing incentives, labor standards, energy production tax credits and more. 
Since passage of the IRA, over $240 billion has been invested in clean energy manufacturing and infrastructure projects, according to a White House report. This includes over $86 billion invested in nearly 300 new solar, wind, and battery energy storage projects. 
Along with this tide of investments has come a wave of “green collar” jobs, said Intersolar. Over 170,000 direct jobs have been created since IRA as the industry adds positions in engineering, business development, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and more. The Intersolar report forecast as many as 1.5 million new jobs in clean energy can be expected by 2030. 
For the solar industry, which is already the fastest growing energy source, the IRA has created long-term stability and clarity. The 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) was extended through 2032, creating a long-term subsidy that breaks the boom-and-bust cycle that used to caused by shorter-term ITC extensions.
Solar added a record 36.4 GW of utility-scale storage and 14.3 GW of battery energy storage in 2023, which together add up for more than 80% of new capacity additions for the year. Solar, storage, and wind energy combine for nearly 95% of the capacity added to the grid in 2023, and 2024 is expected to build on this monumental year.
The first steps toward the federal goal of 100% carbon pollution free electricity by 2035 have been made, but much work is needed to ensure the vision becomes a reality.
Remaining questions
The ISNA/ESNA report raised a few outstanding issues to resolve as IRA continues to roll out. One issue relates to the domestic content bonus, a demand-side adder to the ITC that adds another 10% tax credit for projects that include a certain threshold of U.S.-made components, bringing the credit to 40%. 
ISNA/ESNA said the domestic content bonus credit eligibility rules pose challenges for U.S. solar projects.  
“If even one minor component of a solar panel is foreign-made, the entire U.S. manufacturing portion seems ineligible—and most solar panels have up to eleven components,” said the report. “If just a single bypass diode in a domestically produced panel originates abroad, the U.S.-based manufacturer’s whole value-add could be excluded from the formula’s numerator and inappropriately counted against overall project eligibility.”
Furthermore, the industry is looking for clarity around the distinction between “manufactured products,” which must meet 50% domestic content thresholds, and more generic “construction materials,” like foundation posts, that must be 100% American-made
“Project developers have so far faced an uphill battle in obtaining the detailed data from manufacturers that is required to calculate domestic content fractions,” said the report. “Developers need more transparency on wages, payroll taxes, and materials costs to accurately determine what share of their major technology components qualify as truly domestic.”
The ISNA/ESNA report also raised questions about the potential challenges to IRA under a Republican presidency, highlighted the need for improving access to the tax equity market for smaller-scale project developers, and other finance roadblocks related to debt issuance and credit.
It also highlighted the fact that the IRA’s spending has expanded beyond its initial projections. The ten year spending plan was initially valued at $369 billion, but has now increased to $526 billion, with room to grow higher.
“Deficit hawks may use soaring price tags as justification to scale back clean energy credits and subsidies, which in turn could dampen private sector confidence. The rising cost of the legislation, however, ultimately means the IRA is proving successful in spurring new clean energy and storage projects,” said the report.

Under the partnership, Aurora will make use of EagleView’s high-resolution imagery taken from its aircraft fleet.
“This integration will empower solar professionals to prospect, plan, and validate solar projects with the highest accuracy possible,” said Aurora Solar. “EagleView’s high resolution aerial imagery, validated 3D roof models, and industry-leading structure measurements provide an additional layer of accuracy when selling and designing PV systems in Aurora — all without requiring physical site visits.”
High accuracy and speed in solar proposal generation can offer a competitive advantage in the residential solar sales cycle. Accuracy instills confidence in a prospective customer, while speed and the elimination of a site visit improve the customer experience, making it a smoother transition to residential solar.
Aurora’s platform makes use of artificial intelligence (AI) to construct its 3D models of homes and roofs in about 30 seconds. While a standard design service may range from 30 minutes to 24 hours, Aurora says its tool produced a design in 32 seconds on average, based on 340 trial runs of the software.

The “secret sauce” to the EagleView platform is the extremely high-resolution imagery taken from the company’s fleet of 130 aircraft. EagleView flies its aircraft above the solar project site, taking images from overhead and multiple low angles. Rendered together on the software platform, the images create a navigable 3D model of the building. 
The aircraft capture six-inch resolution at fifteen-minute intervals. This is about four times more detailed than standard aerial imagery, and as much as 70 times more detailed than standard satellite imagery.
Together, Aurora and EagleView now have roof imagery that covers over 94% of the U.S. population, with 70 times more detail than satellite imagery, said the company.
Aurora Solar is holding a demonstration of the newly updated software platform on Thursday, March 7. A registration link can be found here.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/05/shining-a-light-on-solar-module-quality/,"QUALITY,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,2024-03-05,Shining a light on solar module quality,"From pv magazine 2/24
The idea that solar panels would one day be available for €0.10 ($0.11)/Wp of generation capacity would have seemed ludicrous a few years ago. But that was the European Union spot price published by retailer pvXchange for low-cost panels in December 2023.
No matter which price graph you consider, there is a clear, slippery-slope trend. Solar manufacturing has been through a boom, with module demand way beyond supply in what was very much a seller’s market but it’s no secret that the road ahead for solar manufacturing is likely to be rocky. Analysts are predicting a downturn, with crystalline silicon-based manufacturers set to struggle to break even. The consequent casualties may affect solar project warranties.
For manufacturers to maintain margins, or even just to survive, something has to give. Typically, that raises questions about materials supply and manufacturing quality. Similarities to the wind industry spring to mind.
Numerous factors can affect manufacturing processes but the strong association between quality and profitability cannot be ignored.
This might raise an important question for PV project owners. What measures will future-proof projects against issues of module quality?
Quality testing is important to protect revenue, extend product lifetimes, and eliminate warranty-claim inefficiency. Two levers are available to project owners.
Certified third parties can be contracted to test PV modules at manufacturer factories or ISO 17025-accredited laboratories.
Sample testing is typically based on ISO 2859-1 standards that use the acceptable quality limit (AQL) methodology. AQL determines whether an order has met client specifications. It defines defects that mean test failure so project owners can reject any given sample.
Additional tests or inspections during construction might also be utilized, including electroluminescence (EL) testing after delivery or installation, via an independent third party.
If a project owner opts against quality control, they face the danger of receiving a batch that another owner has rejected.
Engineer Skyray and consultant Everoze have devised a set of employer’s requirements for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts. These include the technical requirements for EPC work, commissioning, and quality testing.
For PV module quality control, a five-step process is required.
A certified inspector should examine manufacturer facilities, reviewing manufacturing-process quality systems, as well as the procedures for raw material procurement, storage, and component traceability. The production process should also be reviewed. Product quality control should include EL and wet leakage current testing, as well as a pre-shipping visual inspection.
The inspection should include at least a visual inspection and measurement of power output. The following details should be checked or tested on a defined sample of panels: serial number, module type, package number, open circuit voltage, short-circuit current, power at the maximum power point, maximum power point voltage, current at maximum power point, fill factor, test date, record date, and EL testing carried out according to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) criteria.
A mechanical data inspection should be carried out to an inspection level based on AQL methodology and should include module and component dimensions, as well as label marking and weight conformity.
Manufacturer testing results can be verified by sending random batch samples to a lab for visual inspection, electrical insulation, and EL testing. The latter should detect hot burns, inactive parts, cracks, and micro-cracks, according to criteria agreed with the manufacturer, and maximum power measurement.
A small selection of modules should be subject to potential-induced degradation testing, according to the IEC 62804 standard.
For positively-doped, “p-type” cell technology, such as passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) solar, additional testing may be required to determine susceptibility to light-induced degradation or light-elevated temperature induced degradation.
Post-shipping tests determine whether transport conditions are aligned with manufacturer guidelines and can reveal module defects.
Samples should be randomly selected, in accordance with AQL, and IEC 61215-aligned visual inspections performed as well as in situ EL testing to detect defects such as unproductive areas or cell micro-cracks.
This stage primarily confirms that construction conditions are aligned with the manufacturer’s guidelines and that modules are free from defects. Similar testing (visual inspection and EL tests) can be carried out on a sample. This is important when determining where defects may have arisen, such as during transportation or installation, and where contractual responsibility lies.
Finally, a thermographic survey by drone is recommended to evaluate defects such as bypass diode issues, disconnected strings, or breakages during construction. Solutions are now available for post-treatment data, artificial intelligence-based detection, geolocation of anomalies, and automatic reporting.
The cost of these services has dramatically reduced due to a highly competitive market and rapid technological improvement. Such inspections enable project owners to have a global view of their plant after commissioning and offer many positive benefits.
Although solar development is a technical industry, commercial feasibility underpins its success. Clients not only want to develop technically sound projects but also financially sustainable ones that provide value to shareholders.
With a potentially rocky road ahead, project owners must consider the avenues available to help future-proof their projects. Everoze highlights the fact that thorough module testing can help illuminate the road ahead.

Eight mini-modules of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s (CSIRO) printed flexible solar cells were attached to the surface of Sydney-headquartered space transportation provider Space Machine Company’s Optimus-1 satellite which was sent into orbit today from the United States.
Australia’s largest private satellite yet, Optimus-1 is one of the 53 payloads launched into space as part of American spacecraft manufacturer Space X’s Transporter-10 rideshare mission launched from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
The 270-kilogram Optimus orbital servicing vehicle is to be deployed in an orbital slot where it will then commence its full testing campaign. Part of that will be an investigation of the CSIRO’s printed flexible solar cells that were attached to the surface of the satellite.
The CSIRO is exploring the potential of printed flexible solar cells as a reliable energy source for future space endeavors with the organization’s Space Program Director, Kimberley Clayfield, saying a major challenge in the development of spacecraft is low-mass, high-efficiency power systems.
“CSIRO’s printed flexible solar cells could provide a reliable, lightweight energy solution for future space operations and exploration,” she said. “If the space flight test reveals similar performance as we’ve shown in the lab, this technology offers significant advantages over traditional silicon-based solar.”
CSIRO Renewable Energy Systems Group Leader Dr Anthony Chesman said CSIRO-developed perovskite cells have the potential to transform spacecraft power systems and enable new possibilities for future space missions.
“Our perovskite cells have been achieving incredible outcomes on Earth and we’re excited that they’ll soon be showcasing their potential in space,” he said, adding that in situ testing would secure information on the performance of the cells as they orbit the planet. “We will get information on how the panels are holding up under the extreme conditions in space and data on the efficiency they achieve,” he said.
Chesman said the team had already undertaken pioneering research on the likely performance of the cells in a space environment.
“Based on our research we expect our printed flexible solar cells will stand up to the effects of cosmic electron and gamma radiation which can compromise the performance and integrity of traditional solar cells,” he said. “We are also confident these cells will outperform traditional cells in cases where sunlight hits them at non-optimal angles. The feedback we receive from the satellite will provide valuable insights into the practical application of our technology and inform future technology development.”

The 300 MW solar installation, developed by Invenergy, is the largest in the state and generates enough electricity to power the equivalent of 90,000 homes.
The Badger Hollow solar installation is co-located with hog farming operations. The project provides tax revenue from the shared leasing of the facility on farmland.
The project was developed in two 150 MW stages, stage 1 came online in December 2021 and stage 2 came online in January 2024. The solar park built on 1,100 acres features a total of 830,000 bifacial solar modules on trackers.
Wisconsin Public Service owns 100 MW of Stage 1, with Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) owning 50 MW of that project. We Energies, a local utility, and MGE jointly own the second phase.
“The completion of Badger Hollow is another step in our ongoing transition to greater use of cost-effective, carbon-free, renewable energy to serve all MGE electric customers,” said Jeff Keebler, MGE chairman, president and CEO. “By 2030, we expect every MGE electric customer will have 80% fewer carbon emissions from their electricity use simply by being an MGE customer as we work toward our goal of net-zero carbon electricity.”

Molson Coors is taking part in We Energies’ Energy for Tomorrow subscription program that allows companies, local governments and other users buy a share of the energy produced the facility. The program offers renewable energy certificates for energy from the facility. The company purchases electricity for its Leinenkugel’s brewery in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin under an agreement with Xcel Energy.
