Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Belectric Inc. is part of the Belectric Group, which recently reported it has constructed and manages about 3 GW of utility-scale solar plants globally.
CAMS told pv magazine USA that Belectric’s U.S. O&M portfolio totals 184 MW.
Headquartered in Texas, CAMS provides a range of services to owners of power generation and oil and gas assets. The company said it considers this solar O&M transaction a natural extension of its existing clean energy offerings.
Since its establishment in 2007, CAMS has expanded its presence in renewables generation, including wind, solar, and battery storage, representing approximately 3.5 GW of generating capacity.
Last year, other U.S. industry stakeholders sold off their O&M businesses, most notably SunPower and First Solar.

The deal combines both parties’ generation portfolios, which currently stands at 43 wind, solar, and natural gas generating projects across 16 states, with a combined capacity of 4.2 GW.
Novatus Energy contributed a 1.9 GW portfolio to the new IPP, including 543 MW of solar and 1.4 GW of wind projects. Meanwhile, Southwest Generation contributed eight natural gas power plants totaling 2.3 GW.
Although Onward Energy’s solar portfolio is spread throughout the country, it’s headlined by two large projects in the Southwest: the 120 MW Comanche solar project in Colorado and the 50 MW Pavant project in Utah.
John Foster, former CEO of Southwest Generation and new executive chairman of Onward Energy, stated that the merger will position Onward to be a “leader in the energy transition.”
In addition to owned generation, Onward Energy will continue to provide services under Novatus Energy’s and Southwest Generation’s existing power purchase agreements with their respective counterparties.
Onward Energy will continue under common ownership by institutional investors advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

Transferred from 174 Power Global’s development pipeline, the JV projects are located in Texas, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, Virginia, and Hawaii. The first project started production in 2020, and the remainder are expected to go online between 2022 and 2024.
According to the partners, the JV builds on Total’s long-standing cooperation with the Hanwha Group and combines 174 Power Global’s development experience in the Unites States with Total’s decade-long international work.
“This transaction is a first significant step for Total in the U.S. utility-scale solar market, in line with our 2025 ambition to achieve 35 GW of renewables production capacity worldwide,” said Julien Pouget, Total’s director of renewables.
Hanwha Group is a South Korean business conglomerate that was founded in 1952 as Korea Explosives Co. The group has diversified to include retail and financial services.
174 Power Global was formed in 2017. In December it signed a seven-year dispatch rights agreement with ConEdison for the development of a 100 MW battery storage project, the East River Energy Storage System, in Astoria, Queens.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/14/king-of-the-hill-mckinsey-says-renewables-will-be-cheaper-than-fossil-plants-by-2030/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 14, 2021",King of the hill? McKinsey says renewables will be cheaper than fossil plants by 2030,"From pv magazine Global
Solar and wind power will dominate the global energy market at the end of the decade as they become cheaper to install than the operational costs of fossil fuel facilities, according to a report published by management consultancy McKinsey & Company.
The 2021 Global Energy Perspective study predicts solar and wind power plants will make up almost half the world’s power generation capacity by 2035 and cites the cost competitiveness of renewables-powered green hydrogen by 2030 as another game changer for the energy transition.
With global coal-fired power demand having already peaked, according to the report, the high point for oil will be hit in 2029 and for gas, in 2037, McKinsey predicted. That would add up to the world’s thirst for all fossil fuels combined peaking in 2027.
The McKinsey report considers four future energy scenarios and, under its business-as-usual reference case, predicts the world is currently “significantly off of the 1.5C [degrees Celsius] pathway,” in terms of the maximum desired level of global heating. To keep global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C this century would require carbon emissions to halve this decade and to fall 85% by mid century, according to the study, which expects the world to burn through its 2100 carbon budget in the “early 2030s.”
In addition to the gloomy reference case, the study posits two positive future outlooks: one consistent with a 1.5C global heating pathway and a more ambitious scenario in which 10 existing trends, such as the move to electric vehicles, are accelerated. The final, worst-case outlook is predicated on the world’s policymakers prioritizing an economic recovery from Covid-19 to the detriment of energy transition-driven legislation.
The impact of Covid-19 is estimated to have hit global energy demand to the extent a recovery could take 1-4 years, according to the McKinsey report, with electricity and gas demand bouncing back faster than oil.
However, the report considers the continuation of pre-pandemic trends such as reduced car ownership to be a more influential driver of the energy transition than the impact of the world health crisis.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/14/sunrise-brief-pepsico-doubles-goals-to-address-severe-climate-change-impacts/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COVID-19,DISASTER RECOVERY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 14, 2021",Sunrise brief: PepsiCo doubles goals to address ‘severe’ climate change impacts,"PepsiCo, Inc. said it plans to more than double its climate goal, targeting a reduction of absolute greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by more than 40% by 2030. The company also pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040.
The beverage and food behemoth said it plans to reduce absolute GHG emissions across its direct operations by 75% and its indirect value chain by 40% by 2030, based on a 2015 baseline.
“The severe impacts from climate change are worsening, and we must accelerate the urgent systemic changes needed to address it,” said PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.

PepsiCo’s product portfolio includes 23 brands that generate more than $1 billion each in estimated annual retail sales. It operates in more than 200 countries and territories around the world and employs around 260,000 people. It said its emissions reduction plan will cover areas such as agriculture, packaging, distribution, and operations.
The company installed solar panels at its global headquarters in Purchase, New York, and has other solar resources at Frito-Lay facilities in California and Arizona, as well as PepsiCo beverage facilities those same states.
The company said its plan includes both mitigation, reducing GHG emissions to decarbonize its operations and supply chain, and resilience, reducing vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change by continuing to incorporate climate risk into business continuity plans.  The company said it will work to reduce virgin plastic use and increase recycled content in its packaging.
PepsiCo said it met its 2020 target to source 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. and set a new target to source 100% renewable electricity across all of its company owned and controlled operations globally by 2030, and across its entire franchise and third-party operations by 2040.
PepsiCo is also expected to achieve 100% renewable electricity in Mexico and Australia this year. Doing so would bring the total number of countries fully sourcing renewable energy in PepsiCo’s direct operations to 15, and meet roughly 60% of its direct global electricity needs through renewable sources. Twelve countries in PepsiCo’s Europe sector currently source 100% renewable electricity.
PepsiCo said it is supporting new renewable energy generation capacity through power purchase agreements. The company  finalized agreements with renewable energy company Ørsted for two new wind projects in Texas and Nebraska that will meet nearly a quarter of PepsiCo’s total U.S. electricity needs.
More than 600 utility-justice, environmental, racial justice, labor, and faith groups sent a letter to President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris urging their administration to halt utility shutoffs nationwide to protect public health.

The No Shutoffs Coalition said it has advocated for a federal moratorium on utility shutoffs since the Covid-19 crisis began. It wrote a draft executive order that it said would instruct the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to use authority under the Public Health Service Act to enact a national moratorium on residential disconnections of all water, electricity, broadband, heat, and other necessary utility services for nonpayment.
The proposed order would also mandate safe restoration for previously disconnected homes. It would last the full duration of the Covid-19 national emergency, and at least 12 months following its end.
The push for executive action comes after what the coalition said was Congress’s failure to enact a moratorium in the Covid-19 relief bill passed in December. Although Congress allocated $6 billion in funding toward electricity bill relief, “that funding does not meet the scale of the crisis,” the coalition said in a statement. The spending bill also included $638 million for a new low-income water-assistance program, “far short of what’s needed,” it said.
“America’s utility shutoffs crisis is a human rights crisis,” said Jean Su, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s energy justice program.
The coalition said that a study from Duke University last June found that water and utility shutoff moratoria reduced the average growth rate of Covid-19 by 2.6%.
Real estate investor Harrison Street said it bought five portfolios of commercial and industrial solar assets from Ecoplexus, a global developer and owner of renewable energy projects. Terms were not disclosed.
The portfolio comprises 101.9 MW of operating solar capacity from Ecoplexus’ Distributed Generation portfolio in California and its Community Solar Garden portfolio in Minnesota. The assets will generate 142 million kWh of solar power for the State of California, and investment grade municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals under long-term contacts.
Since 2018, Harrison Street has invested nearly $400 million in equity across investments in wind, solar, power, hydroelectric, and district energy. The acquisition expands the firm’s renewable energy portfolio to more than 337 MW.
Orlando-based real estate developer and property management company Avalon Park Group said it has formed a team with partners from Switzerland and Singapore to build a 300 MW PV facility in Volusia County, Florida, near Daytona Beach.
As a start, Avalon signed a contract to buy 6,253 acres for the proposed project. Further details were not available.
