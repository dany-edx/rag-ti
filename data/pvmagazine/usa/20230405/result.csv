https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/05/toyota-manufacturing-plant-in-alabama-to-power-70-of-operations-with-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,ALABAMA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 5, 2023",Toyota manufacturing plant in Alabama to power 70% of operations with solar,"Auto manufacturer Toyota announced it has entered into a power purchase agreement for a 30 MW solar project that is expected to power 70% of its operations at North Huntsville Industrial Park in Alabama.
TAI Energy Infrastructure Solutions led the project’s development and will manage construction, which is planned for spring 2023. The company will serve as long-term owner-operator. The 30 MW corporate solar project will interconnect to Huntsville Utilities, a municipal electricity provider operating in large utility Tennessee Valley Authority’s territory.
Since Toyota Alabama started production in 2003, the plant has expanded six times, representing a $1.5 billion investment. In 2022, Toyota Alabama’s 1,900 employees assembled more than 665,000 engines and hybrid engines. The plant supplies engines for popular Toyota vehicles such as the Tundra, Corolla Cross and Sienna.
The solar project, valued at $49 million, spans 168 acres and will surround the area around the manufacturing site. It is expected to generate 62,000 MWh annually, offsetting roughly 22,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, or the equivalent demand of about 5,600 homes.
The project marks another step toward Toyota’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2035.
“By relying on the sun to power our operations, we will reduce our carbon footprint and create a model of environmental stewardship in North Alabama,” said Jason Puckett, president of Toyota Alabama.
Corporate solar procurement is steadily on the rise. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), corporations in the United States have installed nearly 19 GW of on-site and off-site capacity, which doubles the amount that had been installed through 2019.
“From data centers to industrial freezers, the most energy-intensive business operations are turning to solar as the most reliable and affordable way to power their infrastructure,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, SEIA.
Meta (formerly Facebook) increased its installed solar capacity from 177 MW in early 2019 to 3.6 GW in 2022 and now has the largest corporate solar portfolio in the United States. Target remains the top onsite corporate solar user, while Microsoft joins the top 10 after installing 479 MW of new capacity since 2019.
Toyota clean energy
In March, one of the top 100 largest car dealerships in the United States, Arlington Toyota of Palatine, Illinois, commissioned Texas installer Solar One to build a 1,734-module solar array on its 2.9-acre building.
The rooftop solar array generated 256,930 kWh of electricity in its first five months of operation, offsetting 50% of the site’s demand. It also offset the dealership’s carbon dioxide emissions by 128 tons.
The installation was built and financed by Solar One, and the initial investment will be recouped once Arlington Toyota takes in incentives like Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs), rebates from the state of Illinois, and the federal investment tax credit.
In September 2022, Toyota announced a $2.5 billion investment in an electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant in North Carolina. Toyota has a target of 40% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electrified vehicles by 2025, and the target increases to 70% by 2030.  With the new investment in its North Carolina battery manufacturing facility, the total commitment to advancing its battery production is now $5.6 billion.
And in August 2022, Toyota Motor North America announced it is partnering with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to construct, install, and test a 1 MW proton exchange membrane fuel cell power generation system at the NREL Flatirons campus in Arvada, Colorado. The pilot program is a 3-year, $6.5 million project funded by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, part of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
The 1 MW system integrates multiple Toyota fuel cell modules to create a dispatchable stationary power system. In a previous partnership between the two, NREL demonstrated the use of an automotive fuel cell system to provide carbon-free power for a data center. This new test system is about 15 times the size of the previous test and is capable of both direct current and alternating current power output.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/05/optimizing-energy-storage-for-performance-and-roi/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 5, 2023",Optimizing energy storage for performance and ROI,"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed into law in August, is bringing about significant changes to energy investment in America.
Annual installations of solar in the United States are expected to consistently reach 30 to 40 GW (DC) by 2024, according to the U.S. Solar market Insight Q4 2022 report, released by the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. The report forecasts average annual growth of 21% from 2023 to 2027, across all solar segments,  New forecasts from BloombergNEF anticipate that the IRA will drive about 30 GW/111 GWh of energy storage in the U.S. between 2022 and 2030.
In addition to extending the investment tax credit (ITC) for solar and other renewable energy technologies for at least 10 years, the IRA also includes an expansion: For the first time, most energy storage technologies are eligible for the ITC in a stand-alone capability without being directly tied to otherwise eligible generation.
With this incentive, the central storage question is no longer whether to deploy it, but how much and how fast. As developers and asset owners move forward with battery energy storage systems (BESS), key strategies in system optimization can bolster financial benefits even further.
Walking the IRA’s fine line
In addition to restoring the ITC to its previous 30% level, the IRA created three additional 10% bonus credits to consider:

40% to 55% of the total cost of manufactured product components must be attributable to products mined, produced, or manufactured in the U.S.
It’s important to identify the right mix of solar-plus-storage or stand-alone storage systems to create a top-performing asset. Look for an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partner who can optimize systems with both technologies, keeping tax and financial benefits in mind.
Strategizing augmentation and asset life
Balance control strategies and energy management systems to drive the optimal performance of an asset over its lifetime. Keeping batteries continuously charged at 100% degrades them faster as does failing to cycle them or cycling them faster than designed.
Ultimately, all systems will degrade, but the rate of degradation depends on how the system is utilized. While it’s important to figure out the right time economically to increase or augment a BESS by installing new batteries, the IRA and rapid technology advance mean there now are additional parameters to keep in mind.
Asset owners need to consider whether augmentation is a CapEx or an OpEx expense, which may have varying effects on their overall financial return strategy.
Optimization
Understanding the regional ISO’s rules and regulations can help identify the best use case/revenue stacking scenarios (i.e., energy only, ancillary only, or a combination).
From the start, the asset owner needs to determine the financial metric that best meets their goals because each metric can yield a different optimal design.
In engineering parlance, study the Pareto frontier, which is an optimization tool that leads to the ideal equilibrium between a system’s variables. Look for the optimal design solution that balances size, duration, and the system’s use profile while ensuring that the model aligns with reality. An experienced partner has insights into what every element of a design change costs. Financial modeling should consider not only the initial capital cost, but also the changes in both revenue and operational cost
This kind of analysis for PV-plus-BESS plant design optimization can take advantage of the following four common curves:
Image: DEPCOM
Driving cost savings
A recent project modeled 15 battery systems with varying technologies and system configurations against local requirements, ultimately saving millions in avoided installation, augmentation, and replacement costs. The team assessed the batteries for price, bankability, power-to-energy ratio (P-rate), design life, cycle life, augmentation costs/schedule, and capacity degradation.
Proprietary analysis determined that traditional nickel manganese cobalt, nickel cobalt aluminum, and lithium ferro phosphate) battery cells would offer neither the duty life nor guaranteed calendar life required to sustain this project’s 25-year lifespan. Instead, they would require costly initial oversizing and multiple augmentations that would create future engineering integration challenges, and may require one full rip-and-replacement over the project’s life.
Optimizing at the start meant anticipated total savings of $19 million over the system’s 25-year lifespan.
Offtake agreements
Fundamentally, offtake agreements are useful in creating revenue certainty. This is a form of risk mitigation that investors and banks require and comes with opportunity trade-offs.
Power purchase agreements and fixed-tolling agreements are great risk mitigators, but with rapidly changing merchant markets there are unique upside opportunities. Decarbonization efforts, intermittent renewable penetration, and increasing grid load at unprecedented rates offer immense economic benefits.
This leads to the question of how best to balance a project’s risk profile with its upside potential/ Choose a partner with experience navigating the equation.
There are ways to design a system to capitalize on diverse market dynamics. Developers can take advantage of riskier merchant markets, or safer offtake contracts, or a mix of both to strike the right risk/reward profile for their project.
Bankable partner
In a perfect world, money could be saved by sourcing from individual component manufacturers, hiring a controls provider to integrate them, and then an EPC to lay foundations and the balance-of-plant. Another entity might even be brought in to maintain and/or operate the asset.
But in reality, unexpected hurdles arise which are outside the scope of individual contracts, especially with new products and technologies. This leaves the owner or developer on the hook financially while contractors point fingers at each other. This lack of a single responsible party eats away at contingency plans, and in many circumstances profits or returns, all of which creates an additional risk that should be considered.
Instead, partner with an integrated PV and BESS specialist who offers deep utility experience. Look for a company with in-house engineering, procurement, construction, and O&M expertise proven to deliver turnkey systems on time and on budget, and that perform as intended. An EPC with its own system optimization tools and know-how can help prevent costly overbuilds and enhance project financial metrics.
Scott Hoyte serves as DEPCOM’s chief technology officer and leads the EPC’s technology and O&M departments. As a project development engineer in DEPCOM’s energy storage division, Walker Wentzler oversees system optimization and design. DEPCOM Power has more than 5 GW of utility solar EPC experience and 2 GW of assets under management.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/05/worlds-largest-advanced-silicon-ev-battery-material-fab-begins-construction-in-u-s/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 5, 2023",World’s largest advanced silicon EV battery material fab begins construction in U.S.,"Group 14 Technologies, a global manufacturer and provider of advanced silicon battery technology, announced it has broken ground on a second commercial-scale U.S. battery active materials factory in Moses Lake, Washington.
Materials produced at the site are expected to supply 200,000 electric vehicles per year at initial production, with potential to expand. The 20 GW plant reportedly marks the world’s largest factory for the production of advanced silicon battery materials, spanning one million square feet.
The facility was made possible in part through a $614 million Series C investment round led by Porsche and Microsoft. The Biden-Harris Administration and U.S. Department of Energy also provided a $100 million grant.
Group14 said its advanced silicon material offers higher energy density and charge rates than traditional lithium-ion batteries. Its blended silicon anode, called SCC55, can boost energy density by 30% over 1000 cycles with a 20% graphite blend.
SC55 offers 50% greater energy density than conventional graphite-based lithium-ion batteries, said the company. After 1000 cycles, the technology can achieve 1000 Wh per L density.
“For the consumer, the moment for cost-parity with internal combustion engines has arrived,” said Group14.
Today, over 90% of graphite is mined or processed in China. The silicon-based anode offers an alternative, potentially sparing Group14 and its customers from supply chain issues.
The company is now “full steam ahead” constructing the facility, which will be capable of producing 2,000 tons per year for SCC55. The production lines for the factory’s two initial modules are expected to come online in 2024. Over 400 jobs will be created for the construction of the site. The company is working with more than 20 community-based organizations focused on clean energy job creation, hiring, and job training to foster opportunity across the community.
Group14 has committed to purchase over $30 million of U.S. steel to build the first two modules, and is working with American suppliers for necessary components from asphalt to HVAC systems, supporting a domestic supply chain.
“Boosting the nation’s global competitiveness in battery manufacturing comes down to strengthening domestic supply chains, which is why we are ramping up our second U.S. factory at the speed in which we need to see innovation scale,” said Rick Luebbe, CEO and co-founder of Group14 Technologies. “By accelerating the timeline for market-ready, transformational battery technology, we are putting the power to electrify everything into the hands of U.S. workers who will become the backbone of the clean energy economy.”
To date, Group14 has raised $650 million in financing from notable investors and customers including Porsche AG, Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, OMERS Capital Markets, Decarbonization Partners, Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), BASF, Showa Denko and SK Inc.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/05/northeast-workforce-training-for-offshore-wind-distributed-solar/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 5, 2023","Northeast workforce training for offshore wind, distributed solar","With the environmentalist mindset of activist Greta Thunberg permeating across the Generation Z age group, now is the time to promote distributed generation and offshore wind technology careers in junior high school and vocational programs, said a New York conference panel. 
Jeff Andreini, vice president at Crowley Wind Services, a division of Crowley Maritime dedicated to offshore wind workforce development, said the teenage to young adults’ mindset is centered on combatting climate change, and in the process young adults are starting to turn their attention to careers in environmental studies, including renewable energy roles. 
Andreini spoke during Infocast’s NY Energy Summit on a panel titled, “Building the Energy Workforce: Promoting Jobs through Clean Energy Policy,” adding that his daughter recently changed degrees in college to environmental studies. 
“How do we go out and cultivate, nurture young people at fifth grade education right now? At this stage of the (offshore) market, that’s your workforce,” Andreini said. “We don’t have offshore technicians for pre-assembly and construction roles. By the time they’re certified, they will be ready for the market. They need to know there is an opportunity for them at this age,” he said.  
Gary McCarthy, mayor of Schenectady, N.Y., agreed with Andreini, saying distributed technologies and offshore wind training is now permeating into junior high school and young adults in the northern Capitol Region of New York are seeing career opportunities first hand in clean energy.  
In mid-2022, General Electric rebranded its GE Power business as GE Vernova, where McCarthy is mayor of the industrial giant’s headquarter municipality. The Port of Albany was selected over the last two years as the hub for the New York offshore wind assembly market. 
“Tell your story to one or two students each month,” McCarthy said. “Sometimes it’s hard to convey a multi-level approach to a community college or high school, and you don’t see the outcome until you connect with one or two students. These then become assets in the field,” he added about creating a spark with young adults interested in sustainability careers. 
Adam Flint, co-founder of the N.Y. Energy Democracy Alliance, said prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, apprenticeship and prevailing wage activity was “too prescriptive,” with not a lot of capital resource availability. Now with federal funding incentives, grassroots organizations such as the EDA and his Network for a Sustainable Tomorrow (NEST) platform in central New York need to push “clean energy education to communities of all walks of life, especially disadvantaged communities.” 
Richard Lawrence, program director of the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), an non-profit whose mission is to build the foundation for rapid adoption of clean energy and energy efficiency to benefit people, the economy, and our planet, said his organization works with young adults with climate change on the mind through veterans seeking a career change. 
“If you get seasick seventy miles offshore or don’t want to be dangling 400 feet in the air trying to bolt on a turbine part, there’s information technology (IT) roles for you onshore [to] still be part of this industry,” said Crowley’s Andreini about roles in the expanding renewable energy data and information technology solutions market. 
IREC’s platform provides workforce development resources geared toward understanding where adults’ cross skillsets may align with interest in clean energy or sustainable infrastructure, Lawrence said. IREC accredits training director providers in energy efficiency professions as well, often a launchpad for careers in clean energy. The organization also provides a career map resource, a new data resource for renewable energy careers, while the group continues to pursue traditional avenues such as local business directories, trade associations and business-to-business networks, Lawrence added. 
On March 24, IREC expanded the national SolSmart program in conjunction with the Department of Energy to bring 500 additional cities, towns, counties, and regional organizations into the fold of building 1,000 U.S. markets with solar energy workforces by 2035, to achieve energy equity goals and encourage economic growth.  
Crowley Wind, an affiliate of marine logistics company Crowley Maritime, currently offers paid internship programs during two sessions of the year, Andreini said. Interns complete a 10-week training program where the executive and his team bring young adults to its Providence, R.I. campus, where trainees learn to draft project proposals and visit offshore project sites in the Long Island Sound region, he said.  
Flint’s NEST is a community-based network of workforce programs working towards social, environmental, and economic justice and equity in the Southern Tier region of central New York.  The non-profit group is convening a clean energy job fair on Sept. 27, 2023, in Binghamton, N.Y. Current NEST group initiatives include the construction of a community solar facility in Dickinson, N.Y., in utility NYSEG’s service territory. 
In the solar market, developer Sunation recently launched a solar installer certification program in Long Island with Suffolk County Community College for individuals seeking to enter the rooftop solar and residential to commercial market.  
The NY Energy Summit takes place April 4 to 6 in Albany, N.Y., and features panel discussions ranging from IRA adder updates, community solar developments, to offshore wind, renewable natural gas and green hydrogen.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/05/50-states-of-solar-incentives-montana/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,MONTANA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 5, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Montana ,"Montana is ranked 30th in the U.S. for renewable energy generation, with more than 1.5 GW of wind, solar and storage capacity reserves, while the state sees just shy of 15% of its electricity produced by renewables, according to American Clean Power. Yet through Q4 2022, Montana was ranked 44th in the country for solar installations, with only 133 MW of installed capacity, or enough to power 17,410 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. 
It’s hard to shake the reality of black fossilized lumps. Montana contains the largest coal reserve in the U.S., amounting to 30% of the U.S. total, while the state accounts for 5% of total U.S. coal production, according to the Energy Information Administration.  
With just over one million residents, Montanans enjoy a relatively low cost of energy of 11.81 cents per kWh, and with multi-state and federal pushes for reduced coal power resources, the state could usher in more than 780 MW of new solar generation over the next five years, SEIA reports.  Currently the state obtains 43% of its electricity from coal, 41% from hydro, 12% from wind, and 2% from natural gas and 3% from hydropower—it gets just less than 1% from the sun, per EIA. 
Incentives 
Enacted in 2005, Montana’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requires utilities to acquire at least 15% of the electricity they sell in-state from renewable energy sources by 2015. The mandate was reached by that timeframe thanks to abundant hydro and wind resources.  
Montana has net metering rules, enacted in 1999, that applies to utility customers with systems of up to 50 kW using solar, wind or hydropower. Net excess generation is credited to the customer’s next monthly bill. Net metering legislation does not allow for utility Northwestern Energy customers to participate in aggregate net-metering, which would allow multiple-metered customers like farmers and ranchers to apply their credits. 
NorthWestern Energy has had several lawsuits with solar developers seeking to do business in the state under the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act.  The PURPA law has for 40 years required regulated utilities to offer long-term contracts and a negotiated price to power facilities based on the utility’s avoided cost, which is the cost of either buying the power from another source or the cost of producing the energy itself. 
In several noteworthy lawsuits before the Montana Public Service Commission, including with Cypress Creek Renewables business FLS Energy, NorthWestern stated the cost of buying electricity from solar projects up to 3 MW in capacity at $67 per MWh was indeed less than the $73.85 cost of energy from its coal-fired facilities, but higher than the $58.17 per MWh cost of energy from the state’s abundant hydro power resources. Such moves have continually thwarted the proliferation of solar across the Big Sky Country state.  
Community solar 
Community solar, which is a way for community members to purchase solar energy without having to install solar panels on their home or business, is starting to take shape in Montana.  In February 2022, Senator Chris Pope (D-Bozeman) penned SB-399, which would effectuate a community solar program in Montana. 
Although the community solar legislation did not become law during its latest session on February 28, 2023, at least nine of the state’s 25 rural electric cooperatives are already starting to offer their own shared solar programs, according to advocacy group Northern Plains Resource Council. 
One such rural cooperative, Beartooth Electric, is offering a shared community program, called the Shares du Soleil array, to residents in Carbon, Stillwater and Sweetgrass Counties. The 50.2 kW shared solar array is comprised of 132 solar modules that were deployed in October 2019 on top of a municipal warehouse facility.   
The Soleil system produced 67,603 kWh per year of clean energy in its first year in operation, with credits of 845 kWh per share or $78.07 in energy credit over the year, according to the cooperative’s website. Membership to the shared program costs $750 per user. 
Landmark installation 
Completed in 2017, Magpie Solar is a 4.1 MW(dc) ground-mounted solar facility in Lavina, Montana, assembled by Cypress Creek Renewables. The solar project has enough electric capacity to power more than 569 homes, with NorthWestern Energy purchasing power from the facility under a long-term power purchase agreement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/05/co-location-transferability-and-prevailing-wages/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 5, 2023","Co-location, transferability and prevailing wages","At the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Finance, Tax, & Buyers Seminar, Deloitte Tax discussed five potential pitfalls when interpreting and applying the Inflation Reduction Act in the early days of implementation.

A team from Deloitte discussed five tax-related ‘traps’ for solar professionals to consider during the IRA transition.
The group first discussed the IRA’s reversal of rules regarding the application of a 30% tax credit to standalone energy storage projects. Under the prior solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), batteries received a 30% tax credit because they were charged by solar power and integrated into the solar power project. However, under the IRA, energy storage gets its own 30% ITC, so the advice was to physically separate the two facilities, especially when exploring new finance techniques.
The second pitfall concerned business partnerships owning solar power projects with both taxable and non-taxable partners. Direct pay and transferability options provide greater flexibility to partnership structures, but guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury is still needed.

The third pitfall focused on prevailing wages and apprenticeships in contracting. It was noted that projects smaller than 1 MWac and projects that began construction before Jan. 29, 2023 do not have wage and apprenticeship requirements. For projects seeking the full 30% tax credit and are 1 MWac and larger, the question arises regarding how projects will be required to verify that installation crews are paid the legally obligated rates. The Department of Labor Form WH-347 might be the right tool for this purpose, since it has been utilized previously in similar situations.
The Deloitte team also highlighted a nuance of the apprenticeship requirement. While the obligation to pay prevailing wages falls on the specific sub-contractor writing checks to workers, the apprenticeship requirement applies to all companies involved in the project construction, including sub-contractors and the general contractor.
The tax advisory firm mentioned that the rules for when a purchaser of transferable tax credits can use those credits were not yet clear. As corporations have specific rules for when they can take tax credits, and are allowed to adjust their estimated tax payments if they complete a solar power project early in the year, it would be prudent to assume that a purchaser of transferable credit could do the same. However, further guidance is needed.
The final pitfall involved proving project site work continuity, which applies to projects aiming to demonstrate that construction began before the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements came into effect on January 29, 2023. Deloitte emphasized the importance ‘two prongs:’ 1. Initiating significant physical work, and 2. satisfying the 5% safe harbor rules, both of which are closely considered by banks and tax lawyers when documenting projects.
Deloitte’s experts cautioned that it is very important for all projects that began construction prior to the IRA to meticulously track their work efforts through images, logs and receipts, dating back to 2019, in order to avoid potential pitfalls related to prevailing wage requirements.

The CEO of LG Electronics North America, Thomas Yoon, disclosed the company’s intentions this week during a White House executive roundtable on heat pump production and deployment, according to the company’s LinkedIn account. The factory will reportedly manufacture indoor, 100% electrical units, with plans to produce outdoor heat pumps at some point in the future.
“The market transformation enabled by heat pump technologies will be accelerated by delivering on the long-awaited promise of the smart home, coupled with today’s emphasis on a zero-carbon lifestyle,” Yoon told White House officials, including U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.
Yoon reportedly praised the U.S. government’s investments for driving demand through tax incentives and rebates such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). However, he noted that market uptake is still limited by a lack of awareness of the benefits of heat pump technology.
“From our perspective, the bigger issue is not supply but demand. We applaud the government’s major investments in driving demand through tax incentives and rebates,” Cooling Post cited Yoon as saying. “However, lack of awareness and familiarity about the benefits of heat pump technology is a barrier to market adoption.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/05/caiso-interconnection-improvements-proposed-by-seia-cesa-and-calcca/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 5, 2023","CAISO interconnection improvements proposed by SEIA, CESA, and CalCCA","California’s grid operator CAISO has launched a stakeholder process to consider how to improve the interconnection process for utility-scale generation and storage, inviting comments on six straw proposal items it presented in an issue paper and straw proposal.
The national solar trade group SEIA and the California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) proposed improved approaches to most of CAISO’s six proposed changes, while opposing others outright. Both groups said in opening comments that they favor transparency on available and planned transmission capacity. SEIA also favored application of readiness requirements for interconnection customers, rather than “prescriptive policies” that would limit new projects to areas with existing or planned transmission.
CESA and the California Community Choice Association (CalCCA) also provided alternative proposals, with CESA challenging CAISO’s conditions on alternatives.
CAISO said alternative proposals “must align with the principles” that CAISO stated in its issue paper and straw proposal. Two key principles, CAISO said, are that projects seeking to use available and planned transmission capacity must get priority, and that “even within zones that are a priority, the volume of interconnection requests receiving detailed study must be tempered.” CAISO’s six straw proposal items represent the grid operator’s proposed approach to meeting those principles.
CESA asked CAISO to clarify and refine its principles, which CESA said were “interpreted as CAISO setting a goal to reduce the number” of interconnection applications.
CESA said CAISO’s focus should be on ensuring “high-quality and viable” applications, as well as solutions to “more quickly and efficiently process a high number of applications.” CAISO could “look to best practices” of other grid operators, CESA said, on how they are processing “high volumes” of applications, such as automated validation of an interconnection request, a pre-study or feasibility study prior to CAISO’s Phase I study, and “leveraging outside consultants and engineers such as those from the project developer” to complete certain study steps. The last point could address CAISO’s expressed concern that “few experts are available to hire” who can conduct interconnection studies for utility-scale projects.
The California Community Choice Association (CalCCA), which supports community choice aggregators that procure renewable power and generation, said the state’s pace of renewables deployment must increase to 7.3 GW per year through 2045 to meet the state’s renewables target, assuming straight-line growth.
To get there, CalCCA said that in addition to other enhancements, CAISO “should pursue adding new personnel” to conduct interconnection studies, or invest in automation or efficiency gains to accelerate the study process where possible. “It would be worth exploring increases to the grid management charge to accommodate these additions,” CalCCA said, “if it results in new resources coming online faster.”
Overall, 41 renewable energy providers, utilities and other stakeholders commented on CAISO’s straw proposals.
CAISO is currently conducting Phase II interconnection studies on 205 projects in its current cluster 14, including 38 GW of solar and 94 GW of storage projects, and totaling 66 GW of capacity at the point of interconnection. CAISO is scheduled to publish the studies by November 24. Under its straw proposal, CAISO has proposed to delay beginning its cluster 15 studies until April 2024.
