https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/02/tigo-releases-design-quality-tool-for-large-commercial-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 2, 2022",Tigo releases design quality tool for large commercial solar,"Tigo Energy, a leading solar module level power electronics (MLPE) provider, unveiled a new design quality tool called the Solar PLC Signal Integrity Tool alongside expanded training material for solar engineering, procurement, and construction firms in the commercial and industrial sector.
The validation tool and accompanying training course help installers preempt powerline communications (PLC) signal integrity issues in large-scale commercial and industrial projects. PLC signals can experience “crosstalk”, disturbances in signals that can lead to reduced effectiveness of communications in large-scale PV systems. The updated TS4 Design and Installation Course now includes best practices for mitigation of PLC crosstalk issues at the design stage, preventing issues before they happen.
Tigo also released the Solar PLC Signal Integrity Tool, which can be used to identify crosstalk issues in active solar arrays. The tool is designed to be vendor-neutral and is usable for either Tigo systems or competitor MLPE products. After the PLC assessment is run, Tigo provides a performance score.
The TS4 design and installation course, integrated into the company’s education plaftorm, features a section on PLC rapid shutdown system design as well as a technical deep dive into the Tigo TS4 Flex MLPE product line. It provides best practices and practical guidance for system optimization, and installer education on how to design, install and commission a Tigo system with any compatible solar inverter. The two-hour comprehensive course earns 1.5 NABCEP continuing education credits.
“An important part of our mission at Tigo is to keep installers at the center of everything we do, and investing in tools and training is no small part of that,” said JD Dillon, chief marketing officer at Tigo Energy. “As our partners in the field raise their stakes with ever larger installations, we are supporting them with things like this new PLC Tool, Pure Signal technology, and impactful continuing education to help them design and support the highest quality PV installations.”
Tigo is holding a webinar on August 17 focused on designing PLC signal integrity. The webinar will be available live and recorded on-demand.
Last month, Tigo introduced a solar rapid shutdown devices with “Pure Signal” technology, aimed at improving PLC signal quality. Tigo RSS Transmitters with Pure Signal technology are UL PVRSS certified with hundreds of inverter models from leading manufacturers. The new transmitters with Pure Signal technology are compatible with the company’s TS4-A-F and TS4-A-2F rapid shutdown product family and can be easily integrated into new projects or retrofitted into existing installations.
“Our mission is to provide high-quality, reliable, and flexible MLPE solutions to meet customers’ needs for different system configurations. Pure Signal technology delivers on that mission,” said Jing Tian, chief growth officer at Tigo Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/02/bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-ventures-backs-startup-that-automates-solar-panel-installation/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 2, 2022",Bill Gates-backed fund invests in automated utility-scale solar installation platform,"Terabase Energy announced a $44 million Series B financing co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Prelude Ventures with additional investments by SJF Ventures and others, bringing the company’s total funding to $52 million.  Based in Berkeley, Calif., the company was founded in 2018 by SunPower alums. Matt Campbell, a founder and CEO, took part in pv magazine’s 2021 roundtable, where he introduced the company’s approach.
“A lot of the work that needs to be done to optimize plant economics becomes pretty complex and computationally intensive, which lends itself to a modern software-based solution,” Campbell said.
Terabase is on a mission to use software and automation to reduce the cost and accelerate deployment of utility-scale solar. Its suite of software includes cloud-based apps for plant design, solar energy modeling—PlantPredict—acquired by Terabase from First Solar, and construction management. The company also offers power plant controls and SCADA solutions.
Founded by Bill Gates and backed by top business leaders, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) has raised more than $2 billion in committed capital to support companies that are leading the world to net-zero emissions. BEV seeks to invest, launch and scale global companies that will eliminate carbon emissions throughout the economy as soon as possible. BEV invested in Terabase because it sees software and automation as the path to reducing costs and accelerating large-scale solar.
“In recent years, the solar industry has been focused on technological improvements of solar panels and other hardware components while the means and methods of engineering and construction have been largely unchanged. The way the industry designs and builds large scale projects needs to be rethought if we are to reach the very rapid growth required to meet net-zero goals,” said Carmichael Roberts, business lead of the investment committee of Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “To enable the Terawatt-scale deployment of solar needed to decarbonize, we believe a breakthrough is needed to transform how PV power plants are built. Terabase’s solution has tremendous potential to reduce costs and accelerate the deployment of large scale solar, and we look forward to working with them on that mission.”
Terabase said its digital platform for managing the construction of a solar power plant from start to finish can transform the way solar plants are built. The automated factory can be set up at the site of the solar plant and can run 24/7 with its robotics-assisted workflow. Three months ago, the company announced the first commercial deployment in which robots installed 10 MW in a 400 MW project in central Texas.
“Terabase’s software and automation platform allows for developers and EPCs to effectively design and manage their projects from the point of land acquisition to rapid and high-quality construction through automation. This is an essential solution for solar to get to gigawatt-scale projects around the world,” said Tim Woodward, managing director of Prelude Ventures.
“This investment is validation of our vision for rapidly deploying solar at the Terawatt scale,” said Matt Campbell. “It took fifty years for the world to build the first terawatt (one million megawatts) of solar, but we need at least 50 additional terawatts built as quickly as possible to meet global decarbonization targets. This round of funding will allow us to continue to expand our team and make the investments necessary to achieve our mission.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/02/global-energy-storage-deployment-may-reach-500-gw-by-2031/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 2, 2022",Global energy storage deployment may reach 500 GW by 2031,"As renewable energy plays an increased role in the electricity grid, energy storage buildout is quickly following behind. Wood Mackenzie said it expects 500 GW in global deployment by 2031, with the United States and China representing 75% of global demand.
Wood Mackenzie said it sees the United States on a path to be a 27 GW annual market by 2031, and 83% of that figure will be utility-scale storage. However, projections for 2022 and 2023 have been trimmed by 34% and 27%, respectively, due to disruptions from antidumping and countervailing duties tariff suit in the second quarter. Solar-plus-storage projects were impacted heavily by the investigation, leading to about 35% of grid-scale projects being delayed as a result.
The market is expected to be highly consolidated over the next decade. The top 10 nations for deployment are expected to represent 91% of the global demand, with grid-scale storage representing the largest share of capacity.
The European market is expected to increase 5x over the next decade, however project economics in Europe are hampering buildout, said Wood Mackenzie. Policy may improve project economics. The European Commission’s REPowerEU plan has provisions to streamline permitting processes for storage and PV systems, and calls for higher renewables targets, which in turn will drive demand for energy storage.
Europe’s energy storage market is characterized by distributed storage more than grid-scale. Distributed storage has numerous benefits, one of the most important being a lessened need for high-power transmission and substation buildout. It also makes the power grid more decentralized and able to respond to extreme weather events and grid outages.
China released a five-year plan for energy storage this year that calls for a large-scale development supply chain by 2025, in which the nation targets a 30% reduction in system costs through improved technology performance. Since the plan was released, 12 provinces and cities announced deployment targets for energy storage, totaling 40 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/02/its-time-to-fix-our-nations-broken-interconnection-process/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 2, 2022",It’s time to fix our nation’s broken interconnection process,"Commercial and industrial solar projects in the US are often forced to wait more than three years on average to get approval to connect to the utility grid. This creates uncertainty, increases costs, and slows solar development. The situation is so bad that about three-quarters of projects in interconnection queues drop out before ever completing the process. Many more projects are likely not even considered due to interconnection challenges.
This is unacceptable. As Congress remains stalled on climate action and President Biden weighs whether to declare a climate emergency, severe heat waves in the US and Europe, and the highest energy prices seen in history, remind us that we must take action now to increase our nation’s solar capacity.
Without interconnection hurdles, solar is quicker to deploy than fossil fuel development and is now competitive economically. Solar in the US has already increased dramatically in the last decade, from 255 MW of installed capacity in 2002 to over 121 GW today. As significant as that is, the pipeline of future projects is even more impressive, at an additional 1100 GW of solar and energy storage projects. Solar is among the least expensive forms of electricity generation, and it can be produced domestically and can be done sustainably.
To meet our nation’s clean energy and climate goals, we must ensure that these projects get built. An interconnection process overhaul is long overdue.
Guiding principles for interconnection
The good news is that we know how to make the fix. Interconnection has been studied extensively by numerous industry groups and research organizations, which have arrived at some essential guiding principles for reform.
How the US is addressing interconnection reform
Some states have begun to make improvements to the interconnection process. California leads in addressing transparency, a key area for reform.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has been conducting an interconnection proceeding for years. In June, the CPUC issued a decision that dramatically simplifies the interconnection process, providing a model that other states should follow.
Project size limits were removed for the state’s fast-track interconnection review process. And California’s integration capacity analysis (ICA) maps, established by the proceeding, will now be used in interconnection reviews, replacing the previous imprecise “rules of thumb” method.
ICA maps show the available capacity at any point on the primary grid circuits. Using these detailed maps, developers can identify locations that have the potential to interconnect projects before spending time and money submitting interconnection applications. The maps are now updated once a month; ideally, they would be automated with real-time updates to ensure they are always current.
Often known as hosting capacity analysis (HCA) maps, similar maps have been adopted by Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Green Lantern Solar’s home state, Vermont. But accuracy remains an issue for most of these, and many more states must provide the maps.
As necessary as HCA maps are, they’re only one piece of the puzzle. The other principles outlined above must also be included in interconnection reform. Given this need, and the uncoordinated and varied progress on interconnection around the US, it’s a positive development that interconnection has been taken up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
In June, FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that detailed the agency’s proposed reforms to address interconnection queue backlogs. The reforms incorporate principles like transparency, standardization and accountability.
The NOPR calls for implementing a first-ready, first-served cluster study process that prioritizes projects that are ready and have a greater chance of being built, increasing the speed of interconnection queue processing, and incorporating technological advancements into the interconnection process. In addition, the NOPR proposes a requirement for a standardized, transparent study process and firm deadlines for interconnection studies, with penalties for transmission providers that do not meet the deadlines. If FERC’s rulemaking is adopted in the form proposed, it will be a significant step toward improving interconnection.
It’s time to make the fix
The solar industry is no stranger to obstacles. We’ve persisted and even thrived through numerous growing pains. We will undoubtedly find a way to fix interconnection, ensuring that the hundreds of GW of solar now in the queue become actual projects.
Now is the time to finally remove this significant obstacle, which has been hampering the growth of solar for far too long. States and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) must continue making reforms to interconnection, and FERC must implement its proposed reforms. These steps are urgently needed to remove the bottleneck preventing our country from deploying the renewable energy we need.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/02/doe-launches-20-million-consortium-to-advance-us-made-cadmium-telluride-solar-cells/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,OHIO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 2, 2022",DOE launches $20 million consortium to advance US-made cadmium telluride solar cells,"US Department of Energy (DOE) is launching the Cadmium Telluride Accelerator Consortium, a $20 million initiative designed to make cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells less expensive, more efficient and develop new markets for solar cell products.
CdTe solar cells were first developed in the United States and make up about 20% of the market for solar modules. The Consortium intends to to spur technological advancements in CdTe manufacturing that will help increase America’s competitiveness, bolster domestic innovation, and support clean electricity deployment supporting President Biden’s goal of achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.
“As solar continues its reign as one of the cheapest forms of energy powering our homes and businesses, we are committed to a solar future that is built by American workers,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “DOE is proud to partner with leading solar researchers and companies to chart the future of CdTe technology, which presents an immense opportunity for domestic manufacturers to help ensure our nation’s security while providing family-sustaining jobs.”
First Solar and Toledo Solar are two Ohio-based manufacturers of CdTe solar modules. Aaron Bates, the founder of Toledo Solar, told pv magazine usa that the technology has grown from a small fraction of solar projects to the dominant source of modules in utility-scale projects. And with the utility-scale sector making up 55% of solar installs in the US, CdTe is well established in the clean energy industry. According to Bates, there are many reasons to support CdTe and US-made solar, including technological advantages, bankability, recyclability, supply chain stability, improved labor practices, and more.
“To move America forward, we need an all-of-the-above strategy that propels our energy independence, lowers costs, and creates good-paying jobs. Northern Ohio has already revolutionized the field of solar technology,” said US Representative Marcy Kaptur (OH-09). Now, through this remarkable partnership between the US Department of Energy, the University of Toledo, and First Solar – our region will become a hub of next-generation energy innovation that is built right here at home by Ohio’s workers.”
The consortium will be led by the University of Toledo, First Solar, Colorado State University, Toledo Solar Inc., and Sivananthan Laboratories, Inc. Toledo, Ohio is a hub of CdTe manufacturing due to the  CdTe research taking place at the University of Toledo’s Wright Center for Photovoltaic Innovation and Commercialization, and it’s fitting that the University of Toledo will help lead the Consortium.
“Our world requires scientific innovation to address the inefficient ways we find, produce and consume energy,” said University of Toledo President Dr. Gregory Postel. “The University of Toledo is proud to help power the future by leading this consortium that leverages our expertise in solar energy research and commercialization and strengthens our partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy and other leaders in this important and growing field.”
The Cadmium Telluride Accelerator Consortium will work toward making continued cost and efficiency improvements that will make CdTe more competitive on the global market. The team’s research plan that includes CdTe doping strategies, characterizing and exploring new CdTe contacting materials, and working to enable a bifacial CdTe module that absorbs light from the front and back of the module. DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will administer the Consortium, whose leaders were chosen through a competitive solicitation last year.
NREL will serve as a resource, support, and technical analysis center as the consortium develops a technology roadmap, conducts research to meet targets set within the roadmap, and regularly assesses the domestic CdTe supply chain for challenges and opportunities. The consortium aims to expand domestic CdTe photovoltaic material and module production, support the domestic CdTe supply chain, and enhance US competitiveness.
