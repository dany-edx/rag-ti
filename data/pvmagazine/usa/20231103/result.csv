The organization recently completed a study of microgrid deployment in each state in its State Scorecard 2023. Unfortunately, it found that no state is performing well with microgrid deployment, and the report offers recommended pathways to improvement.
Microgrids are groups of distributed energy resources, such as solar modules on a home, connected to a battery system, that can disconnect from the grid and operate independently during a power outage. The U.S. Department of Energy has a vision that 30% to 50% of electricity generation will come from distributed resources by 2035, with microgrids playing a key role in the transition. However, getting there is not without challenges, as noted in the Think Microgrid study.
The U.S. microgrid market reached 10 GW in the third quarter of 2022, with more than 7 GW in operation and the rest in planning or construction stages, according to analysis from Wood Mackenzie’s Grid Edge Service.

Think Microgrid gained early insight from an upcoming annual report from Wood Mackenzie, which indicates that annual growth in microgrids is expected to be close to 20%. The drivers include increasing demand for resilience, federal incentives, favorable state policies and expanding corporate commitments to environmental social good (ESG) investment goals.
Wood Mackenzie analysis finds that the most significant barrier to deploying microgrids are state laws that prohibit private or community-owned electric infrastructure across property lines. Secondarily, Wood Mackenzie identifies a lack of tariffs or other market pathways designed for multi-customer microgrids.
To assess each state, the study considered the policy and market conditions in across five critical dimensions: deployment, regulation, resilience, market access and equity. The result is that only a few states received even a B and many received a C or D.
While some states received an A for activity in specific categories, there is no state that where Think Microgrid believed an overall A is warranted, and this reflects in the policy landscape. While some states have innovated in certain categories, “barriers still inhibit advancement towards commercialization,” according to the report authors.
Deployment
No state earned the highest score; however, Hawaii, Texas, Colo. and Conn. all earned a received B grades for deployment.
Deployment scores are based on overall capacity deployed compared to electricity consumed in that state. Note that a state with high overall capacity and diverse projects deployed scores higher because it indicates a broad range of projects serving various customer and grid needs, according to report authors.
Policy
No state earned the highest score in policy; however, the same four states earned a B.
Think Microgrid looked at microgrid programs and incentives, tariffs to facilitate interconnection and services compensation between microgrids and distribution utilities, as well as reforms to regulatory processes or state law to incentivize or remove barriers to microgrid development. The report indicates that successful microgrid policies support “an ecosystem robustly incorporating private, utility ratepayer, and public sector capital”.  What they found was that most state policies including incentives, programs and tariffs support ratepayer-recovered, utility-owned projects.
Resilience
Texas achieved the rare top score for resilience, with Hawaii, Colo. and Conn. each earning a B in this category.
Think Microgrid looked at regulatory activity, legislation, and state planning activities related to electric grid resilience, as well as engaged in collaborative activities with energy regulators and energy offices.
To achieve a high score, state policy activities must include microgrids as a targeted resilience solution.
The authors noted that effective policy allows communities to tailor microgrid configurations to local resilience needs.
Grid services
For grid services, Hawaii earned the lone top score, with Texas earning a B. Colorado and Connecticut were the lowesst in this category.
The report identifies three potential market interfaces with which microgrids can engage to receive compensation for services: wholesale markets, retail tariffs and distribution-level markets. Successful retail tariffs, the authors contend, provide compensation pathways for a range of microgrid services, including: energy exports during periods of excess generation, load-shifting during peak demand periods, resiliency services, and utility distribution investment deferral or non-wires alternatives.
Equity
In the equity category, Colorado and Connecticut rose to the top. Hawaii had th next highest score, with Texas trailing behind.
Community microgrids can provide benefits to all residents, including resilience, clean air, workforce development, and economic development to vulnerable communities, so the report looked at how well the states prioritize such equity. This is accomplished by identifying and/or mapping vulnerable communities and actively seeking to stimulate investment in those areas.
The reports note that states approach equity differently, with some establishing equity laws that provide mandates, carveouts or directives for infrastructure that supports low-income, outage-vulnerable, rural, and tribal community resiliency and economic well-being. Some states offer state or regulator-approved programs that incentivize or fund projects in specific communities. And yet another approach is when state agency programs support communities with funding or technical assistance to capture federal funding for microgrids. The report authors gave high scores to states that take a coordinated approach.
The State Scorecard 2023 scores the states while also identifying practical next steps available at all levels of government and community engagement. The authors recommend that legislators or utilities develop a microgrid roadmap to guide the coordinated efforts between utility commissions, energy offices, and stakeholders. The report also sees an effective roadmap as identifying opportunities where microgrids can address grid vulnerabilities and state public policy goals, and more.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/03/california-six-flags-to-install-12-mw-solar-carport/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 3, 2023",California Six Flags to install 12 MW solar carport,"Six Flags Entertainment Corporation announced it has entered a partnership with Solar Optimum and DSD Renewables to install a 12.37 MW solar carport at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Los Angeles. The theme park’s installation ranks among the largest single-site commercial-scale solar installations in California and is particularly large for a carport installation.
“Using their parking lot for solar canopies will not only offset 100 percent of the park’s energy use, it will also provide the added benefit of shaded parking for customers. A win-win for everyone,” said Danielle Fidel, senior director, developer network, DSD Renewables.
The carport will cover the theme park’s main guest parking lot. The project includes a 1.96 MW / 7.89 MWh battery energy storage system. The solar facility is expected to produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of 2,874 California homes.
Carbon emissions offset by the project is comparable to 34,194 barrels of oil consumed, 5,110 tons of waste recycled rather than landfilled, or the carbon sequestered in 17,612 acres of U.S. forests.
“As utility prices inevitably increase, these projects reduce costs, decrease their carbon footprint, and ultimately provide more value to the customer,” said Arno Aghamalian, chief executive officer, Solar Optimum.
The park will purchase electricity produced by the system over a 25-year period, leading to an estimated 517 million kWh produced over the period.
Six Flags’ latest project adds to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Northern California and Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, which have also developed on-site solar facilities with over 30 MW of operational solar capacity. Once the Los Angeles carport is complete, Six Flags will have a combined total of 42.37 MW of solar assets, ranking it among the largest investors of on-site commercial solar.
“Here in California, innovation and climate action go hand-in-hand – our success as America’s economic powerhouse and the world’s fourth largest economy is built on our ambitious transition to a cleaner, greener future. Six Flags’ commitment to clean energy is the type of work that will power our future and ensure our kids have a healthy planet to call home,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/03/solar-module-prices-dive-to-record-low/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 3, 2023",Solar module prices dive to record low,"From pv magazine Global
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, and TOPCon module prices, declined this week by the same amount of USD 0.005 per Wp to ISD 0.140/wp and USD 0.147/wp respectively. With falling upstream prices and weak demand in China with its key export markets these are the lowest prices ever recorded, according to OPIS data.
Upstream prices across the supply chain in China continue to slide, weighing on module prices. China polysilicon prices extended losses by falling 3.33 yuan/kg, or 4.19%, to 76.17 yuan/kg this week. The wafer and cell segments saw prices fall for a third consecutive week, with Mono G12 cells seeing a 10.45% plummet to USD 0.0703/wp. Buyers and sellers of modules alike reported lower prices during OPIS’ weekly market survey. P-type modules are on the threshold of 1 yuan/W, while n-type modules are a little more than 0.10 yuan/W higher, a developer said.

Sentiment in China remains bearish. While domestic demand will come from fourth-quarter installations, this is typically a low-demand period, concurred multiple sources. As available land for projects is decreasing, demand will not be as high as hoped, one module manufacturer explained. Orders signed last quarter have been cancelled and buyers want to re-sign contracts at current low prices, another module manufacturer said. The supply picture is gloomy, too, as China’s module manufacturers are sitting on 1-2 months of inventory, according to one seller.
China’s key export markets continue to struggle, with inventories in the European distributed market so large that there’s “basically no need to replenish supply,” according to one source. Even with low prices, approvals for ground-mounted projects are slow and there is insufficient labor to set up projects, they said. Over in Latin America, Brazil’s market is also facing weakness. Brazil is “hoarding too much” inventory, a seller said.
Looking ahead, module prices are expected to continue falling as we reach the end of the year, OPIS learned during its weekly market survey. Many sources pointed to how the 1 yuan/W era has arrived already, with a recent major China procurement tender seeing P-type module bids of as low as 0.993 yuan/W. There is “brutal competition” coming, and “industry consolidation may see more momentum,” according to one solar market veteran.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/03/us-east-coast-hits-irradiance-highs-as-texas-mexico-low-due-to-weak-jet-stream/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 3, 2023","U.S. East coast hits irradiance highs as Texas, Mexico low due to weak jet stream","Solar asset operators across North America experienced a shift in October’s solar performance, as regions that experienced higher than normal irradiance in September saw a reversal in trends, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.
The East and West Coasts enjoyed particularly sunny conditions, setting records in some areas. Notably, Washington recorded the highest October average irradiance in years, matching levels not seen since 2008. In contrast, Mexico, Texas, and central and eastern Canada were shrouded more frequently by clouds, a situation that was further intensified in Mexico by Hurricane Otis towards the end of the month.

 
A weakened jet stream over North America caused Fall storm activity to focus offshore over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, leading to clearer skies over the East and West Coasts. For the East Coast, this effect was particularly strong, as the Atlantic storms drew persistent offshore winds, bringing drier continental air to coastal regions.
Irradiance was above average from Cuba to New York, and Washington, Delaware and New Jersey saw up to 130% of the climatological average.
For the West Coast, the decrease in Jet Stream effects led to less moisture from California as far inland as New Mexico and the Mid West, with irradiance up more than 10% over the climatology for October. This will have benefitted the higher solar capacities in California, Nevada and Arizona, which all saw 105-110% of normal October irradiance.

The effects of the weakened jet stream weren’t all good for solar, also allowing a summer weather pattern to continue in the Gulf of Mexico.
A lack of drier westerly fronts allowed onshore winds to continue, pushing more humidity and clouds over the continent, depressing irradiance in Mexico and Texas across the month. This was compounded by Hurricane Otis at the end of the month, which pushed cloud across Mexico and into Texas, bringing down irradiance to 80% of long term averages.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/03/building-not-your-average-dream-home-finding-an-architect/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,MINNESOTA",,"NOVEMBER 3, 2023",Building not your average dream home: Finding an architect,"While I was looking for a plot of land to build not your average dream home as described in the first article in this series, in parallel I was in search for the right architect and builder. Since I had been dreaming about and researching different types of sustainable homes for years, I already had a fairly detailed idea of what I wanted to build. But since I am no expert, I was in search of professionals who could implement my vision and improve upon it.
When I was evaluating land, I tried to take into account some of the requirements for my design concept, such as orientation and shading, but I was advised against designing the house before I found a piece of land. This is one of the first differences in building a sustainable home versus a standard house. Unlike a standard-built house that is solely designed to separate us from the elements, “a sustainable home requires that it be in harmony with its context and environment,” explained Josh Oqueli, owner of Bonsai Design Build.
During my search for the right architect and builder, I ran into a few challenges. The first was that while energy-efficient, sustainable homes would be one of the best ways to reduce energy demand, dependency on the grid, and carbon footprints, there are not a lot of experts out there. That’s because the architecture and construction industries are relatively conservative – professionally speaking.
Often when I described the concepts that I wanted to deploy, such as passivhaus, thermal mass, or biotecture, many architects and builders would resort to talking about structural insulated panels (SIPs) – which addresses only one element of the much more sophisticated way that I wanted to achieve sustainability and high performance. That’s because, as Oqueli explained, “Most architects have a working knowledge of sustainable building practices. Few have a command of high-performance building principles and even less know about biotecture practices.”
Another common hurdle that I ran into was finding experts who would meet my design and budget considerations. For instance, many did not want to build a smaller house, while others specialized in top-end houses. And I wanted to work with someone who believed that not only the ultra-wealthy are deserving of sustainability. That’s when I found Bonsai Design Build, a Denver-based certified-passivhaus designer and builder that offers turnkey solutions, from napkin sketch through certificate of occupancy.
With a dedicated team of six, they offer full services in the Denver metro area and architectural-only services throughout the country. When reviewing the company’s website and credentials, the Morrison Earth House in its portfolio jumped out to me as it incorporated both the passivhaus and biotecture design concepts that I wanted, such as a south-facing greenhouse, a building envelope, and rainwater catchment.

The design of this house was inspired by Michael Reynolds Earthships, which Oqueli describes as “the most revolutionary… and zenith of good architecture [because these homes] are designed to not only shelter life but also sustain.”
Without knowing it at the time, by focusing on the company’s completed projects, I was already following my future-architect’s advice for finding a design-build professional as he later said, “Certifications are good, but practical experience is usually better. It is a steep learning curve to command high-performance building principles and even more difficult to put them into practice.”
And so, I reached out to Josh Oqueli, owner of Bonsai. Oqueli has been an architect for 19 years, but 10 years ago he founded Bonsai because he thought “our buildings and the built environment at large is in desperate need for good architecture,” which he defines as keeping the elements out and looking and feeling good.

Speaking about the industry’s current design and structure problems, Oqueli explained, “The way we currently design and build structures is not in harmony with the Earth on multiple fronts. Most homes are designed to last thirty years, just enough to withstand a conventional mortgage timeframe. Our current code structure established a bare minimum threshold for human habitation. The industry at large has migrated towards liability avoidance and cheap building practices. All of these factors combined have put us in a precarious place where a large part of our building stock, I’d say 90+%, is hugely energy inefficient and barely habitable.”
When describing what is needed to change this dynamic, Oqueli explained “Conscious people who are willing to break the conventional mold and do what is right to elevate the harmonious buildings, which will in turn elevate the human spirit.”
That’s why in his practice, Oqueli brings a multidisciplinary skillset to the table, such as a solid understanding of high-performance building science, golden proportions, universal laws, and human consciousness.
When Oqueli and his team look at designing and building a sustainable house, they look at it on a spectrum and based on what the client’s commitment is to sustainability – from building practices to high-performance building principles and all the way to biotecture. But he says that the biggest misconception about building a sustainable house is that it needs to be net zero. He clarified that “net zero can be easily achievable because the building is high performance.”
“Successful application of [passivhaus building principles] will yield a low energy use building that can harmoniously integrate with its environment. A conventional home will consider code requirements, ignore its context, and strive for construction economies.”
Because a significant amount planning and thought is put into the design process of a sustainable house, there tends to be more upfront investment during the process – both in terms of time and budget. For instance, Oqueli explains how this means designing differently for various climates, “In colder regions, the need is to harness the sun and keep that energy within the building. In hotter regions, we need to shelter the building from the sun’s intense energy while creating natural ventilation. Completely different strategies in building envelope assembly, mechanics and if delving into the biotecture dimension.”
But these upfront costs pay off in the long run with high-performance building techniques leading to lower ongoing costs, potentially even negative, and as Oqueli emphasizes that is the definition of sustainability.
After working with Bonsai for a few months, going back and forth to optimize the intial design both for sustainability purposes and my personal vision, they have taken my napkin sketch and drastically improved it by combining both art and science, and turned it into an actual plan. While Bonsai offers full design and build services, since I decided to build in Minnesota due to climate collapse concerns, my next step is to find a local builder that has the skills, experience, and passion to turn this plan into not an average dream home.

The projects were originated and developed by Inman Solar, a contractor that specializes in utility and large commercial solar farms, and Aspen Power will now serve as their long-term owner and operator. They consist of ground-mounted solar panels with single axis trackers. Aspen Power will now serve as the long-term owner and operator of the projects and with this acquisition, the company has 43 projects in the state, amounting to 140 MW of capacity. 
“The Inman team has done a fantastic job bringing high quality projects to the table, and we’re glad to have worked with their team to get these projects across the finish line and to become the long-term owners and operators,” said Lara Bushwood, director of project development with Aspen Power. 
The projects are currently online and generating clean electrons, Dan Gulick, senior vice president of community solar at Aspen Power, told pv magazine USA. 
The systems have been contracted through long-term power purchase agreements to provide energy to Georgia Power, an Atlanta, Georgia-based electric utility and subsidiary of Southern Company. The contracts are a result of a request-for-proposals for distributed generation that the utility issued in 2020. 
Like many parts of the country, Georgia’s electric grid is in the midst of a transition. Back in 2019, the Georgia Public Service Commission required Georgia Power to procure 2.21 GW of solar over the next half decade – up from the utility’s earlier plans to procure 1 GW – in four tranches of distributed and utility-scale solar, expected to approximately double the volume of solar in the state. 
In mid-2022, Georgia utility regulators approved an integrated resource plan – essentially, a long-term road map – filed by Georgia Power, which calls for retiring and decertifying all but two of the utility’s coal-burning facilities, and replacing them with a planned 2.3 GW of renewable energy. The plan also included some 500 MW of battery energy storage. 
However, solar developers across the country still face challenges related to interconnection delays, costs and sometimes, local permitting, Gulick said.
Given this, policy makers need to continue to have dialogue with the industry, he added, pointing to places like New Jersey and Maryland, where more community solar markets have opened up. 
“For Aspen Power’s customers, this means we can have simpler agreements, create more value and provide solar to anyone who’s interested,” Gulick said. 
Another role that policy makers could play concerns finding a balanced approach for allocating interconnection upgrade costs, he said – in most situations, the solar project bears all the costs for upgrading the distribution circuit and substation. This ignores the public benefit these upgrades provide, Gulick said.
“The counterargument is that the utility should be allowed to rate-base these costs as it avoids some of the upgrades that will be required as we increase the electrification of the economy,” like electric vehicles and heat pumps, he said.
