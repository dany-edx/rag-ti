The latest report presents an analysis on the potential impacts of widespread electrification on the U.S. electricity system—specifically, generation and transmission infrastructure investments, fuel use, system costs, and emissions.
Here are five key takeaways from the new report.
Electrification drives the sustained deployment of renewable energy and natural gas generators in all regions of the United States. To meet electricity demand in high electrification scenarios, installed capacity grows to more than double 2018 levels by 2050. Generation from low-cost renewable energy increases in all scenarios and, in the absence of new policies, new natural gas-fired generation is also built to meet electrified loads. Which source supplies more electricity will largely hinge on the future prices of renewable technologies, energy storage technologies, and natural gas, among other drivers.
Local resources are increasingly relied upon to meet electrification-driven load growth, which mitigates the influence of electrification on the need for additional long-distance, inter-regional transmission expansion. However, the magnitude of short transmission segments to interconnect new renewable energy generators scales with electrification, and total transmission capacity expansion similarly scales with renewable energy deployment levels.
Electrification increases the reliance of demand sectors (buildings, transportation, and industry) on electricity, which could expand opportunities for flexible loads. Flexibility in the timing of demands from electric vehicle charging, space heating, and other end-use services can help meet peak demands and planning reserves without additional power sector infrastructure. Without this demand-side flexibility, electrification-driven shifts in the magnitude and timing of demand peaks could require infrastructure development and the need for greater supply-side flexibility (e.g., batteries).
There are abundant resources in the United States with similar costs to meet potential electrification-driven growth in electricity demand. Low-cost renewable energy resources and natural gas are available in all regions of the United States in the absence of new policies, and they are increasingly developed under growing levels of electrifications. However, this analysis finds that electrification has only a modest effect on the cost per unit of electricity consumed ($40–46 per megawatt-hour) and bulk electricity prices across all scenarios considered.
The system cost impact of electrification on the entire energy sector depends strongly on future advancements in the cost and efficiency of electric end-use technologies. Electric-sector system costs increase with the additional generation and transmission capacity that is needed to serve the growing load under widespread electrification. However, these costs are partially or entirely offset by fuel and operational savings in the buildings, transportation, and industry demand sectors. Higher levels of electrification with rapid advancements in the cost and performance of end-use electric technologies can result in net energy system savings—up to $800 billion in the high electrification scenario.
Widespread electrification leads to reductions in direct energy consumption and emissions from the energy system, due to the improved efficiency of electric end-use technologies and declining emissions intensities associated with electricity generation. Energy savings and emissions reductions are largely driven by electrification in the transportation sector. The level of emissions reductions that could be achieved depend strongly on the future generation mix, but emissions of carbon dioxide and criteria pollutants decline in all scenarios examined.

In its upcoming Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), Minnesota Power will lay out next steps in its clean energy transition over the next 15 years. Included will be plans to expand wind and solar resources, achieve coal-free operations at its facilities by 2035, and invest in what it calls a resilient and flexible transmission and distribution grid.
“We are proud to be the first Minnesota utility to provide 50% renewable energy,” said Bethany Owen, president and CEO of parent company ALLETTE. The utility’s IRP is intended to help it continue to move toward emission reduction goals.
The IRP outlines plans to boost the utility’s renewable energy supply to 70% by 2030 with about 400 MW of new wind and solar. The company said it also is proposing to retire a 335 MW coal unit by 2030 and convert its final, 468 MW unit to be coal-free by 2035, completing the utility’s shift away from coal that started in 2013.
Minnesota Power will submit the IRP to state utility regulators on February 1. Following a comment period, a final decision on the IRP is expected later this year.

According to the CIB, the proposed 250 MW/1,000 MWh energy storage facility represents the largest project of its kind in Canada. Once finished, it would also be among the largest battery storage projects in the world.
The MOU confirms the CIB’s planned financial support of the project, with further due diligence and a final investment decision expected this spring. As a Canadian federal corporation, the CIB is mandated to invest C$35 billion (~US$27.5 billion) and attract private-sector dollars into projects that benefit the country. The CIB said this latest partnership is another step toward delivering clean power infrastructure under the corporation’s C$10B Growth Plan (~US$7.8 billion).
The Oneida Energy Storage project would draw and store existing surplus baseload and renewable energy during off-peak periods, then release its energy to the Ontario grid during peak periods. The CIB said this will provide important grid-balancing services and create a more efficient and cost-effective electricity system for Ontario.
Catherine McKenna, Canada’s minister of infrastructure and communities, commented, “Renewable energy projects in partnership with Indigenous communities – like the Oneida Energy Storage project with the CIB, Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corporation and NRStor Inc. – are a great example of how our economy will grow in the future and how forward-looking investments can help Canadians achieve their economic and environmental goals.”

Under terms of the virtual power purchase agreement, which also includes Dominion Energy, Amazon and Arlington will split the electricity generated by a new 120 MW solar farm Dominion is constructing on 1,500 acres in Pittsylvania County, located in southern Virginia, not far from the North Carolina border.
The solar project is set to come online during the second half of 2022, at which point Amazon will purchase 82 MW. The county will buy the remaining 38 MW. Those capacity is expected to allow Arlington County to power at least 80% of the government’s electricity needs.
The county sits across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., and will host Amazon’s HQ2, a hotly contested corporate prize that enthralled cities across the country starting in 2017.
Beyond the 2022 goal of powering 50% of all government operations with renewable energy, the county plans to require government entities to convert to 100% renewable electricity by 2025; the entire community will be required to source 100% of its power from renewables in 2035.

The office aims to speed up NREL’s work in securing renewable energy technologies and distributed energy systems. The new office will be led by Jonathan White, former manager of NREL’s Secure Cyber-Energy Systems Group. White said the office will develop approaches that  “autonomously identify and respond within distributed energy systems comprising a hybrid mix of renewable energy technologies,” including  wind, solar, storage, and hydropower.
Reports say that Capital Dynamics and its Clean Energy Infrastructure business, in partnership with Nebraska-based Tenaska, plan to develop a 300 MW solar farm in the southwest part of Indiana.
Posey Solar Project will be located on up to 3,000 acres of land with construction set to begin in 2022. Reports say that Capital Dynamics unit Arevon Energy Management has signed leases with more than 60 landowners. If built, the Posey Solar Project is expected to begin operation in 2023.
Energy Alabama, GASP, and the Southern Environmental Law Center are appealing the Public Service Commission’s recent approval of Alabama Power’s request for one of its largest capacity increases ever. The advocacy groups filed their appeal in state court challenging the Commission’s decision allowing Alabama Power to increase its natural gas capacity by more than 1,800 MW. The estimated $1.1 billion investment includes building a new gas-fired power plant at the Barry Electric Generating Plant in Mobile County. Regulators did not approve a proposal to add 400 MW of solar plus battery energy storage projects. In September, the groups petitioned the Commission to reconsider its favorable determination. The Commission denied that petition.
Solar PV and wind power are rarely located at the same site, but this could change in the future, reports pv magazine Global.
Swiss mounting system manufacturer Smartvolt AG is working with German wind specialist Westfalen Wind to deploy a 96.8 kW pilot PV project in the parking area of a wind turbine. The two companies used a Smartvolt mounting system to deploy pre-assembled solar module strings, which can be folded out on site.
The system can be erected in around three minutes per kilowatt, and dismantled in around six minutes, the company  said. The PV system can be  dismantled for maintenance work and reinstalled after the maintenance work has been completed. Thus far, Smartvolt has not subjected the system to a long-term load test.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/12/water-use-in-the-west-can-hurt-or-help-the-energy-sector-report-says/,"POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 12, 2021","Water use in the West can hurt…or help…the energy sector, report says","A team of researchers have developed a framework to evaluate complex connections between water and energy, and options for adaptations in response to an evolving climate.
Their study, “Evaluating cross-sectoral impacts of climate change and adaptations on the energy-water nexus: A framework and California case study,” was published in the open-access journal Environmental Research Letters. The team is made up of scientists from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, UC Berkeley, and UC Santa Barbara.
Although many studies have been done on how climate change could affect the water and energy sectors, those studies were not typically looking at interactions and feedbacks between the two, said lead author Julia Szinai of Berkeley Lab’s Climate and Ecosystem Sciences Division. The newly published paper develops a framework that identifies how climate change affects these coupled water and electricity systems, and potential adaptations to future gaps in supply and demand.
The researchers said this is one of the first studies to show that water sector adaptation can have as large an impact on the electricity sector as the direct effect of climate change itself.
In applying the framework to California, which relies on snowpack for a good deal of its water and uses large amounts of energy to move water from the northern to the southern part of the state, the researchers found two possible adaptation pathways: one that is energy intensive and one that can save both water and energy.
“One of the most important points of the paper is that adapting our water system to climate change can either significantly exacerbate electricity grid stress, or on the flip side, it could help to alleviate it,” said co-author and Berkeley Lab climate scientist Andrew Jones.
A focus on adapting the water system by using transfers of water across basins, or by using energy-intensive desalination, will make the electricity problem more difficult, he said. However, if people adapt the water system by conserving water, “it’s actually a win-win situation because you’re also reducing the energy required for water.”
Currently, about 19% of California’s electricity consumption goes toward water-related applications, such as treating it, transporting it, pumping it, and heating it. And, about 15% of in-state electricity generation comes from hydropower sources.
The state has already seen some impacts that climate change could have on these interdependent water-energy systems. For example, the researchers aid that extended droughts and reduced snowpack have resulted in spikes in electricity consumption from groundwater pumping and hydropower deficits.
Climate change impacts
The researchers also found that the greatest direct climate change impact on California’s electricity sector will likely come from two factors: higher air conditioning loads and lower hydropower availability. In the water sector, the greatest and most uncertain impact of climate change is on future water supplies. In the worst case, the researchers said that available water supplies could shrink by 25%, and in the best case could grow by 46%.
The researchers said that if the state were to adapt to the worst-case water scenario by choosing the most energy-intensive technologies, it could result in an energy imbalance as large as that caused by climate change itself.
Co-author Ranjit Deshmukh, an environmental studies professor at UC Santa Barbara and faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab, said that the electricity sector could leverage its close coupling with the water sector to better balance growing amounts of wind and solar generation. For example, energy-intensive equipment such as water pumps or desalination plants could be operated during times of plentiful solar and wind energy, and turned off at other times.
The researchers are now working to link both a more detailed water resources management model and an electricity planning model to demonstrate pathways to build out electricity infrastructure in the Western U.S. when climate change impacts are included from the water sector.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/12/clear-clogged-interconnection-queues-with-transmission-planning-report/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Clear clogged interconnection queues with transmission planning: report,"With spare transmission “used up” across the U.S., the cost of connecting new solar and other generating projects, including transmission upgrade costs, has risen “dramatically” in recent years. In some cases interconnection costs have reached five to 10 times what they were a few years ago, according to a report from Americans for a Clean Energy Grid.
In most U.S. grid regions, new transmission capacity is needed for almost all of the projects in the queues, the report said. In addition, the current backlog delays electricity cost reductions for consumers, and slows rural job creation.
Relying on the interconnection process to identify needed transmission “leads to a piecemeal approach and inefficiently small upgrades, raising costs to consumers.”
The authors recommend that regional transmission organizations (RTOs) conduct comprehensive transmission planning to identify the transmission lines needed to connect many new projects to the grid.
The costs of interconnection, they said, should be paid for not just by interconnection applicants, but by all those who will benefit, noting that consumers will benefit from new low-cost generation enabled by added transmission.
For its part, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should reform the regional and inter-regional transmission planning process to “require broader pro-active and multi-purpose” transmission planning.
“Connecting to the transmission grid is like spending four years at the Department of Motor Vehicles” said Rob Gramlich, report co-author and executive director of Americans for a Clean Energy Grid. “FERC’s interconnection policy was created in a different era and it no longer works.”
Overall, 734 GW of generation projects were waiting in interconnection queues at year-end 2019. Ninety percent of the individual projects were solar, wind or storage projects.
The report maintains that “incremental” solutions “can help but not solve” the problem. The authors acknowledge that cluster studies, in which a number of interconnection requests are grouped and considered at once, enable several developers in an area to share the costs of required network upgrades. Even so, the cluster approach does not capture the economies possible from large regional and interregional transmission solutions, they say.
A shortage exists of “efficient regional transmission,” the authors said, stating that regionally planned transmission investments fell by 50% between 2010 and 2018. The shortfall has been made up in recent years with small local transmission projects constituting about half of recent transmission investments.
The report is titled “Disconnected: The Need for a New Generator Interconnection Policy.”
