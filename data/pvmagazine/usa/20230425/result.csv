Homeowners in select California markets that have the mySunPower app can earn rewards for managing electricity use, particularly during times of peak electricity demand on the grid, when utility bill rates are the highest. The service helps balance the electricity grid while offering solar and energy storage customers an opportunity to derive value from their system.
Owners of a SunVault battery are able to manage their stored electricity with OhmConnect, which tracks prices and demand in real time, helping customers reduce energy use at these peak times. Once enrolled, the SunVault system is set to automatically dispatch power from the homeowner’s battery during times of peak grid demand, while retaining a fixed amount of energy to meet their home’s energy needs.
“With the rise of virtual power plants, it is much easier for residential customers to get rewarded for helping us make the grid more resilient,” said Cisco Devries, CEO, OhmConnect. “With our SunPower partnership, OhmConnect can expand the ecosystem of homes that leverage the energy they generate to help stabilize the increasingly vulnerable grid.”
The app sends real-time push notifications before, during, and after the battery is leveraged, with the option to opt out or adjust battery backup reserve levels at any point. The app allows homeowners to manage their VPP activity, tracking battery reserves, discharge history and earnings.
“VPPs are primed to go mainstream as battery storage becomes more accessible, energy prices continue to soar and the grid is continuously overtaxed by fires, heatwaves, and even rain,” said Ellen Kinney, vice president of digital at SunPower. “Removing manual steps and complex barriers for participation will be the key to helping virtual power plants reach their true potential and create a more resilient grid powered by the sun.”
OhmConnect is a no-cost service available to residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) utilities. California residents can enroll through the mySunPower app, available to download on Apple App Store or Google Play. The companies stated plans to expand to other markets this summer.
The Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) has focused on VPPS, as the availability of debt financing for unfamiliar technologies has been a bottleneck for adoption.
“A VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances),” said Jigar Shah, director, U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office. “VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives.”
The LPO recently awarded a $3 billion conditional loan for Sunnova to offer loans to low- to moderate-income customers nationwide for VPP services.
“By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/25/solar-for-dryland-soil-health/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,ARIZONA,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 25, 2023",Solar for dryland soil health,"Soil is a lot more than just dirt; healthy soil contains many nutrients and microorganisms that maintain the foundation of an ecosystem. In arid and semi-arid climes, soils are loaded with biocrusts, which are communities of living organisms that perform important functions in ecosystem management.
Biocrusts are made up of cyanobacteria, green algae, fungi, lichens, and mosses, forming a thin layer on the surface of soils in deserts and other dry biomes. Drylands cover roughly 40% of the continental Earth.
Human activity, including agriculture, urbanization and off-road vehicle use are degrading dryland biocrusts, harming these fragile environments. Biocrusts are increasingly being pressured by climate change, as well, as increased heat is making it difficult for the microorganisms to survive.
Arizona State University (ASU) professor Ferran Garcia-Pichel and his research team have proposed to use solar arrays as a solution to the problem of excess heat and light, creating a shaded nursery to promote biocrust growth. A report on the subject was published in Nature Sustainability.
Beneath the panels, biocrust development can be encouraged, and these organic materials can be moved to areas where damage has occurred, said Garcia-Pichel. The ASU team has dubbed the practice “crustivoltaics.”
“This technology can be a game changer for arid soil restoration,” said Garcia-Pichel. “Crustivoltaics represents a win-win approach for conservation of arid lands and for the energy industry alike.”
The researchers performed a proof-of-concept experiment in the Sonoran Desert, studying biocrust growth for three years. During the study, the PV array promoted biocrust formation, doubling biocrust total biomass and tripling its coverage area when compared to open areas with similar soil characteristics. Natural recovery of harvested biocrusts can take six to eight years to recuperate without intervention, but re-inoculated areas under the solar panels were able to nearly fully recover within one year.
The study estimated that adding crustivoltiacs to the three largest solar facilities in Maricopa County, Arizona could aid the rejuvenation of all idle agricultural lands within the county, spanning more than 70,000 hectares. The research group said a small enterprise could accomplish this in the span of five years.
Among the many ecosystem and agricultural benefits, the restoration project could potentially significantly decrease airborne dust that impacts the Phoenix Metropolitain area. The practice could also benefit solar asset owner and operators by reducing soiling on panels and increasing the value of carbon mitigation credits generated by the site.
Garcia-Pichel is a Regents’ Professor in the School of Life Science and the founding director of the Biodesign Center for Fundamental & Applied Microbiomics. The Center brings together researchers that study of microbiomes acting in unison in various settings, from humans to animals and plants, to oceans and deserts.
Biocrusts offer many ecosystems services. For one, they stabilize soil by binding particles together, mitigating topsoil loss from wind and water, and they increase the soil’s water retention, reducing runoff, which can be a problem for some PV plants in arid climates.
Biocrusts also aid nutrient cycling by converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia for use by plants. And they perform photosynthetic activities, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They also contribute to overall ecosystem biodiversity and resilience.
While biocrust development can be done more rapidly in a greenhouse, the technique requires fewer resources, minimal management, and requires no upfront investment. The team modeled that the crustivoltiacs method is less expensive by four orders of magnitude when compared to conventional greenhouse methods.
The next step for Garcia-Pichel and his team is to implement the practice at regional scales through the coordination of scientists, collaborative agencies, land users and managers.
“For the first time reaching regional scales at our fingertips, and we could not be more excited,” said Garica-Pichel.

These projects were initially awarded to developers in 2016 and 2017 as part of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s (NYSERDA) annual.Large-scale Renewable Energy Standard program, which solicits eligible renewable energy projects such as solar photovoltaic, wind, and hydroelectric generation.
The four solar projects were announced alongside four other renewable projects, totaling 480 MW. 
The Jasin Solar facility, a 20 MWac solar plant developed and constructed in the Town of Willet, was completed on March 17, 2023. According to New York’s Data.gov website, the facility signed a contract for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to sell a minimum of 35,898 MWh per year, with a maximum of 43,077 MWh. These values suggest an AC capacity factor between 20.5% and 24.6%. The project’s Index REC strike price* is $75.19.

According to documents found online, the facility paid $704,685 for interconnection costs for adding or upgrading the following gear at the new Willet Substation:
In Mohawk Valley, two 20 MW solar facilities, Grissom Solar and Regan Solar, were completed on March 17, 2023 and December 29, 2022, respectively, while in the Southern Tier, the 20 MW Puckett Solar facility in the Town of Greene was completed on October 21, 2022. All four facilities were developed and constructed by CS Energy and are owned by MN8 Energy, with tax equity financing provided by M&T Community & Environmental Development LLC, a subsidiary of M&T.
NYSERDA solicited approximately 2 GW of new capacity for this program in the fall of 2022, equivalent to 4.5 million Tier 1 eligible RECs. The winning projects are set to be announced in the summer of 2023.
The NYSERDA Index REC Strike Price is designed to minimize risk of low power prices to power plant owners, while not also paying said owners a financial windfall in case of high energy prices.

First, the RECs represent only the environmental characteristics of solar electricity, allowing the electricity and capacity to be sold separately. This allows the state to research the current market rates for electricity and capacity and subtract them from the REC price.
This process provides the solar developer with a minimum price guaranteed by the State of New York, which encourages banks to finance and facilitates the construction of plants. To determine the amount the state pays, it first takes the REC Strike Price and subtracts the current rates of electricity and capacity. The remainder is paid to the solar asset owner.
If the price of electricity and capacity increases, the incentive decreases, potentially reaching zero. This arrangement allows the asset owner to benefit from market upside without burdening taxpayers. Additionally, over the contract’s twenty-year lifetime, 2% to 3% electricity price inflation is likely to significantly reduce the monthly REC price paid by the state.

The electricity generated is expected to meet 100% of the needs of the theme park.
The carport was built over the main guest parking lot and includes a battery storage system capable of producing 1.9 MW of power with 7.8 MWh of capacity. The system is expected to produce 20.8 million kW hours of energy annually, which is equivalent to the electricity consumed by 2,874 homes. The installation was completed in partnership with Solar Optimum and DSD Renewables.
“Here in California, innovation and climate action go hand-in-hand – our success as America’s economic powerhouse and the world’s fourth largest economy is built on our ambitious transition to a cleaner, greener future. Six Flags’ commitment to clean energy is the type of work that will power our future and ensure our kids have a healthy planet to call home,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Solar Optimum is a Los Angeles-based solar, battery storage and roofing company that serves businesses and residents in California, Nevada, and Arizona. The company reports that it has installed over 300 MW of solar to date.
In addition to the Six Flags Magic Mountain installation in Los Angeles, Six Flags has installed solar at two additional parks: Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Northern California and Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. The theme park operator reports that the three sites will rank as the largest volume of onsite solar for any U.S. organization, with a combined total of 42.4 MW.
“Six Flags has placed a high priority on efforts to improve and protect the environment, leading the way for theme park companies around the world and capturing the attention of other private organizations that also have the power to drive solar projects,” said Jason Freeman, vice president of operations, public safety, engineering & maintenance at Six Flags. “By partnering with experts like Solar Optimum and DSD Renewables, we can continue to improve our environmental programs with additional waste, water and energy reduction targets and initiative.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/25/yotta-and-sunstone-partner-to-offer-commercial-storage-solutions/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,NET METERING,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 25, 2023",Yotta and Sunstone partner to offer commercial storage solutions,"Buildings account for 75% of U.S. electricity consumption and present thousands of opportunities for distributed energy resources in various U.S. markets such as the Northeast. But currently the rooftop commercial and industrial rooftop market has seen just a 4% adoption rate for solar, and less than 1% penetration rate energy storage, according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
One of the challenges preventing more businesses from transitioning to clean energy is a lack of low-cost financing availability. Without access to solar loans, businesses have had to choose between paying for the entire system with upfront capital, using third-party sourced capital  or foregoing the project altogether.
Yotta Energy, an Austin, Texas-based rooftop solar inverter and storage solutions provider, announced a partnership with solar financier Sunstone Credit to rapidly deploy more rooftop storage solutions on commercial rooftops.
Under the partnership, commercial customers will be able to easily adopt solar and storage with Yotta Energy licensed contractors using the solar loan solutions of Sunstone Credit. Starting this week, Yotta will become an approved vendor on Sunstone’s platform, making its commercial solar technology and equipment available to the businesses that rely on Sunstone.
The solar finance provider will provide loans of $50,000 to $5 million for Yotta-installed systems by approved contractors, with projects carrying a five to 20-year term length financing package, Susan Tanski, co-founder and head of strategy at Sunstone Credit, told pv magazine USA.
The lender is able to finance projects in all 50 U.S. states, regardless of net metering framework, Tanski said. Sunstone has received over $250 million in loan applications on its platform since launching in late 2021.
Yotta has already helped more than 20 solar developers and installers expand their C&I offerings, and expects to enable more businesses to make the energy transition switch with the new financial offering.
“There has never been a better time for businesses to transition to clean energy, between rising utility prices, increased tax incentives, customer preferences for sustainable businesses, and a need for resilient power access,” said Duncan Hinkle, co-founder and senior vice president of business development at Sunstone.
Yotta’s SL-1000, a 1 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery system, can be paired with solar arrays up to 750 watts of total generating capacity, and can be paired in systems with 60 to 72 cell photovoltaic modules, according to a product sheet.  The battery weighs 56.7 pounds and measures 15.75 inches width by 26.25 inches length, with 4.25 inches of depth.  The storage system is designed to operate at temperatures of -4 F to 114 F.
