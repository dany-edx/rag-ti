There are 41 states with at least one community solar project installed and operational, with at least 19 states recognizing the benefits of shared renewables by encouraging their growth through policy and programs. 
This sector is expected to grow considerably in a short time, with Wood Mackenzie projecting that cumulative installations could reach 14 GW by 2028, more than doubling the total in less than five years. 
Community solar allows residents, small businesses, organizations, and municipalities to subscribe to a portion of a solar asset’s electricity generation to receive credit on their electricity bills for the power it generates. One of the major benefits of community solar is it opens access to customers that may not have a suitable roof or financial situation for rooftop solar. 
As consumer protection practices, Department of Energy recommends that community solar programs ensure subscribers receive about 20% savings on their electricity bills, are not assessed exit or termination fees, and that compliance mechanisms are in place to ensure the community solar assets deliver on their expected generation. 
Community solar is in a nascent stage in many states, and requires more program structuring, regulatory support, and community engagement to build out. The report points to landmark markets like New York and Illinois that can serve as models for implementing a successful community solar program. 
“Near-term growth in Wood Mackenzie’s national outlook is driven by robust pipelines in existing state markets like New York and Illinois. Longer-term, newer state markets support lasting growth as mature markets saturate. Additionally, developers will begin to benefit from the incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act as soon as this year,” said Caitlin Connelly, research analyst for Wood Mackenzie. 
Wood Mackenzie expects 7.6 GWdc of new community solar will come online in existing state markets between 2024 and 2028, and the national total of community solar installations are expected to pass 10 GW of cumulative capacity in 2026.
The report said residential customers are representing an increasingly larger share of community solar subscriptions, suggesting a shift in focus for developers and providers. Low- and middle-income (LMI) customers rose from 2% of the customer base to 10% from 2022 to 2023, with costs to subscribe these customers declining 30% year-over-year. 
“The early years of community solar served almost exclusively commercial anchor customers; however, stricter LMI requirements in state programs and the availability of LMI-focused federal incentives are beginning to reveal a more well-rounded, community-focused subscriber profile,” said Connelly. 
There is some variability in the 14 GW by 2028 forecast by Wood Mackenzie. A bull case would raise the total by 13%, while the bear case decreases the national outlook by 38%. 
The ramp-up in installations is expected to be made possible in part by federal funding. The community solar industry will begin to experience the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act as soon as this year, said Wood Mackenzie, and LMI credit adders will begin to be awarded. 
Wood Mackenzie noted that the LMI tax credit adder was in high demand, with applications totaling over eight times the allotted capacity. The industry also awaits the awards from the $7 billion Solar for All fund, which is expected to roll out in summer 2024. 
“I’m increasingly confident that we can leverage the transformational innovation of community solar products and the flexibility of programs to meet a diverse set of grid and policy goals in states across the country,” said Jeff Cramer, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Community Solar Access. “And what’s really exciting is that we’re seeing a significant uptick of residential and low-to-moderate income subscribers that will only grow exponentially as markets focus on these crucial customers.”

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/20/raising-consumer-confidence-critical-to-energy-transition-finds-ey-report/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-20,"Raising consumer confidence critical to energy transition, finds EY report","EY, the global professional services network, released the Energy transition consumer insights report, which finds that only one-third of consumers say they take more actions to improve the environmental sustainability of their lifestyle. With the energy transition upon us, authors of the EY report state that we are dependent on the other 70% for the success of the energy transition.
The EY team arrived at its findings after surveying nearly 100,000 residential energy consumers over a period of three years. These consumers included those who own homes, renters, bill payers and non-bill payers, and represented all ages and income levels.
The report indicates that the low level of consumer confidence in how much more they can do to make sustainable changes indicates that “consumer fatigue” has set in and that we must address this “energy apathy dilemma” immediately if the transition to clean energy is to be successful.
“U.S. consumers are concerned about the costs and accessibility of clean energy options, underscoring the need for energy providers, regulators and policymakers to work together to progress carbon ambitions,” said Trey Thornton, EY Americas power & utilities leader. “Broad consumer action is the biggest driver for demand of lower-carbon and renewable energies, yet our research concludes not enough is being done to spur greater consumer adoption of these products.”
The findings
The report found that “energy apathy” is a common occurrence, as three-quarters of consumers say they’ve done as much as they can to be sustainable. EY research also revealed a decline in climate action on the part of corporations.
Affordability is a concern among those who are not planning to invest in sustainability. For 84% respondents, energy is a budgeted expense, and more than half (67%) indicate they can’t absorb a 10% increase in their energy bill.
Interest is not turning into action, yet, as two-thirds say they are interested in rooftop solar and electric vehicles (EVs), but they won’t invest in them in the next three years. Despite public policy, rebates, credits and other incentives, consumers are not engaging. For example, only 11% of say a heat pump is their first choice of investment in energy products and services planned over the next three years.
Despite the reluctance to invest in sustainable actions, 40% indicate that they don’t know what energy-related actions to take. Only 30% of U.S. respondents are confident that they can access clean energy options and 31% are confident that their energy provider is providing value for them and the community. Furthermore, only 1 in 4 believe that the energy transition is fair and equitable. Low-income respondents and renters were found to be two to three times less likely to invest in new energy solutions.
The bottom line finding in the report is that those in the clean energy industries must shift the ways in which they engage with the consumer in order to help these consumers to make more sustainable choices.
The EY research concludes that consumers must have “affordable, accessible and appealing” energy options in order to take action toward their sustainable energy future. Some consumers distrust new technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and are skeptical of engaging in an all-electric lifestyle.
The report authors state that current approaches taken by the clean energy industries and other stakeholders are not effective or are not working fast enough. They call on energy providers, government and the broader energy ecosystem to make fast changes for the good of the energy transition.
“Energy providers can galvanize this change, transforming energy consumer engagement by first transforming themselves,” said the report. Providers must raise up the access, appeal and affordability of clean energy, and those that get it right will have helped to shape the clean energy future.

A group of researchers led by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has developed new mini solar modules based on perovskite cells treated with zinc trifluoromethane sulfonate [Zn(OOSCF3)2].
“This low-cost material is used as an additive at a very small percentage into perovskite ink,” the research’s lead author, Jinsong Huang, told pv magazine. “Its use makes perovskite modules cheaper because it makes the fabrication much more reproducible.
Huang also explained that nonuniformity in perovskite films arises from oxidized perovskite inks, especially oxidation of iodide to molecular iodine when inks are exposed to an ambient environment during the fabrication process. In addition, the introduction of 2D-iodide salts in the perovskite inks introduces more iodide interstitials. “Both molecular iodine generation in inks and many iodide interstitials in the perovskite films present nonuniformity in perovskite films and thus lead to larger cell-to-module efficiency,” he added.
The researchers added five different zinc salts into five samples of perovskite ink, and fabricated small solar cells via a blade coating process. The different zinc formations were zinc formate [Zn(OOCH)2], zinc acetate [Zn(OOCCH3)2], zinc trifluoroacetate [Zn(OOCCF3)2], zinc trifluoromethane sulfinate [Zn(OOSCF3)2], and zinc trifluoromethane sulfonate [Zn(OO2SCF3)2]. They also fabricated a reference cell without the addition of zink.
In addition, each cell was tested with different additive concentrations of 0.14%, 0.28%, 0.42%, and 0.55%. On the cell level, the scientists found the Zn(OOSCF3)2 with a concentration of 0.28% to deliver the best results, with an average open circuit voltage of 1.18 V and a fill factor of 82%. This compares with an open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V and a fill factor of 80% in the control cell.
“The results indicate that Zn(OOSCF3)2 improves the device efficiency through defect passivation as both open-circuit voltage and fill factor are significantly enhanced,” said the researchers.
They then used the Zn(OOSCF3)2 at the optimized concentration to blade coat 78 cm2 of perovskite films, from which they fabricated mini modules with an area of 78 cm2, 84 cm2, and 108 cm2, respectively. They all had 20 sub-cells, each with a width of  6.5 mm.
“Fabricated minimodules show power conversion efficiencies of 19.60% and 19.21% with aperture areas of 84 cm2 and 108 cm2, respectively, as certified by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL),” the results showed. “That is the highest efficiency certified for minimodules of these sizes.”
Conducting further investigation into the minimodules’ optoelectronic and morphologic properties, the academics emphasized that Zn(OOSCF3)2 passivated the defects of the perovskites despite its induction of negligible grain size changes. “The CF3SOO‒ anions can reduce the generated iodine during perovskite solution or device aging. At the same time, the zinc cations can precipitate the excess iodide so that the iodide interstitial concentration is diminished throughout the films, resulting in improved device efficiency and stability,” they explained.
The scientists displayed their results in “Iodide manipulation using zinc additives for efficient perovskite solar minimodules,” published in Nature Communications. “To be commercialized, it needs to be applied to equipment that can handle bigger size modules, such as slot-die coater, or roll-to-roll coaters,” Huang concluded.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/20/bloombergnef-says-global-solar-installations-could-hit-574-gw-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-20,BloombergNEF says global solar installations could hit 574 GW this year,"From pv magazine Global
The world could install up to 574 GW of new PV capacity this year, according to a new global PV outlook report from BloombergNEF. It said that new solar installations hit 444 GW in 2023, significantly surpassing its previous forecast of around 413 GW.
The research firm said it also expects new global PV installations to reach 627 GW in 2025 and 672 GW in 2026, and then grow further to 718 GW in 2027 and 722 GW in 2028. For 2029 and 2030, it predicts annual PV growth of 820 GW and 880 GW, respectively.
These figures diverge substantially from those released by Wood Mackenzie in January. It predicted flat annual average growth over the next eight years, bucking the trend of rapid growth over the last decade.
“The challenge in making forecasts is that if you keep predicting growth at current rates, you end up forecasting the entire world being covered with solar panels,” Jenny Chase, a solar analyst at BloombergNEF, told pv magazine. “Our 2030 forecast is already over 6.7 TW, well above BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario and relatively comparable with global power generation capacity of 8.5 TW at the end of 2022.”
Chase said that Portugal and Greece could generate 50% more electricity from solar by 2030 than they did in 2022.
“At those levels, we will have negative feedback mechanisms, and those are what is really hard to predict,” she added. “Power will already be priced very low when the sun’s out, and storage isn’t free – so why would anyone build more solar, at least at historical rates of growth? That’s what BNEF’s regional analysts have to grapple with now that solar is not small anymore, and it’s no wonder that they can seem like cowards. Forecasting that the future will be dramatically unlike the past is always difficult.”

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/20/rooftop-solar-has-technical-potential-to-meet-45-of-u-s-electricity-demand/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-20,Rooftop solar has technical potential to meet 45% of U.S. electricity demand,"Among the leading sources of electricity, solar has the unique advantage of being able to be installed in a distributed fashion, integrating it with the built environment, preserving land and reducing transmission infrastructure needs. Rooftop residential solar can offer homeowners bill savings or price predictability in the long run, and when paired with a battery, offers a value-add of backup power and extreme weather resilience.
A report from Environment America, “Rooftop Solar on the Rise,” celebrated the roughly 10x growth that rooftop solar has undergone in the past decade, and laid out the long runway for growth that lies ahead.
Environment America modeled the viable technical potential for rooftop solar in the United States, finding that it can serve 45% of U.S. electricity demand based on 2022 levels. In 2022, rooftop solar generated about 1.5% of the total electricity consumed.
In 2002, only 147 GWh was generated by solar, by 2021, that figure increased to 5,959 GWh. As of the end of 2022, rooftop solar generation has swelled to 61,281 GWh, or 61 TWh. Over 3.9 million American households have opted to move forward with rooftop solar.
And yet, the report notes that the U.S. “has only scratched the surface” when it comes to tapping the potential of rooftops to generate local, clean electricity. Solar panels on small buildings, including homes, have the potential to add 926 TWh of generation. Methodology for arriving at this total can be found in the report.
Large, flat commercial and industrial buildings represent another development opportunity. Environment America said warehouses alone have the potential to host 185 TWh of generation each year, enough to power over 19 million U.S. homes. Over 100,000 large retail buildings across the U.S. could host enough power for the equivalent demand of another 8 million homes, said the report.
Why rooftops?
Rooftop solar “has myriad benefits for the environment and consumers,” said the report. This includes reducing the need for dirty power plants and expensive transmission lines, providing lower costs, and can help to increase the grid’s resilience to extreme weather and other shocks.
Distributed solar helps squeeze other emitting sources off the grid. Take the 1.4 GW Mystic Generating Station serving the ISO New England grid operator region. The natural gas plant used to be fired up in the winter to prevent blackouts, but the grid operator said increased solar capacity has made the grid reliable enough to shut Mystic down. Over 5.4 GW of solar, most of it rooftop, has helped enable the transition away from fossil fuels, even in the harsh New England winter.
Another environmental benefit of rooftop solar is the reduction of land use for energy development, sometimes referred to as “energy sprawl.” For each gigawatt of rooftop solar installed in lieu of utility-scale projects, over 5,200 acres of land are saved.
Further, rooftop solar can save the nation on rising transmission needs and costs.
“Because rooftop solar generates power that can be used on-site reduces the need for transmission from central generating stations, potentially saving states and municipalities time and money on their energy transitions,” said the report. “To reach renewable energy targets, some expansion of transmission infrastructure will be necessary, but maximizing the potential of rooftop solar can help to minimize the amount we need to build.”
Solar is also now the most cost-effective new generation source in most markets and most conditions in the United States. On average, new-build solar costs 29% less than the next-cheapest fossil fuel alternative.
For homeowners, rooftop solar represents long-term bill savings and predictability. Environment America said though the initial investment can be substantial, most buyers can expect to break even in about eight to nine years and can expect to save between $20,000 to $96,000 on bills over the 25-year-plus life of the system.
“Why pay for power from a distant plant spewing pollution when we can just soak up the sun on our rooftops?” Johanna Neumann, senior director, Environment America Research & Policy Center Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy.
In a follow-up article, pv magazine USA will review Environment America’s state-by-state evaluation of rooftop solar markets and its policy recommendations to support more installations.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/20/debunking-solar-myths-solar-is-unreliable/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,2024-02-20,Debunking solar myths: Solar is unreliable,"‘Uncle Bob’ is that proverbial character who shares at family gatherings all he believes to be true about solar and why it just isn’t a good idea. Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker, has had this experience. Based on his 33 years in the solar industry, he offers short, fact-based responses to Uncle Bob’s assertions, which range from “solar is taking coal jobs” to “solar is unreliable”.
In this second in the series, Shugar debunks the myth that “solar is unreliable”.
Uncle Bob may have said, “Well, solar is just not reliable because it stops producing when the sun doesn’t shine and wind doesn’t work when the wind doesn’t blow”.
How do you respond? “Thanks for that question, Uncle Bob, here’s how it actually is working out real life…”
First of all, when the technology is supposed to be producing, solar is the most reliable form of energy production with the fewest unscheduled outages of anything. So, during the day, solar is working well over 99% of the time.
Now, solar and wind pair beautifully together. We’re seeing this in Texas, and other locations where solar comes up first thing in the morning, and as the solar winds down toward evening, the wind is up at full power. It goes till about midnight in most places. So that’s a good thing.
What we’re also seeing now is that batteries are very affordable. With an enormous addition of batteries into the grid, both can be co-located with solar and wind projects, or as standalone projects.
Last year, there were 5 GW of batteries operational on the grid. By the end of this year, we’re expecting about 15 GW. That’s a lot of power.
Within three years, we’re expecting 50 GW or more. That’s an enormous amount of capacity. The batteries have now moved to about four hours of storage. So if you’re on a solar tracker, like we do at Nextracker, those long summer day systems are going to sleep around six or seven in the evening. That four hours gets you through the evening. So solar together with wind and batteries offer an extremely reliable source of power that’s helping the lights stay on.
Episode two: Solar isn’t reliable…
 
We’ll continue this series with fact-based responses to additional myths such as: What about nuclear–that’s clean and reliable? And solar sounds great, but it’s too expensive, right? Solar takes too much land–there’s gonna be no room for farms if we have solar panels…
Stay tuned as we unpack these objections, so you’re ready for your next  dinner party with Uncle Bob.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/20/groups-call-on-tvas-board-to-pursue-100-clean-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TENNESSEE,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,2024-02-20,Groups call on TVA’s board to pursue 100% clean energy,"The utility TVA would add 35 GW of solar and 13 GW of wind capacity to reach 100% clean energy by 2035 under a resource plan presented by clean energy groups at a nongovernmental public hearing in Nashville. The federally owned utility now has 1 GW of wind capacity and less than 1 GW of solar capacity.
The hearing was modeled after a regulatory proceeding, with testimony from expert witnesses and comments from citizens, and was moderated by former Chairman of the Arkansas Public Service Commission Ted Thomas.
The clean energy groups convened the hearing after their June 2023 letter to TVA’s board of directors calling for greater public engagement in the utility’s 2024 resource planning process yielded an “insufficient response,” and a follow-up “petition to intervene” yielded no response, said a post-hearing brief.
Synapse Energy Economics developed the 100% clean energy plan for TVA. The nonprofit consultancy GridLab and the Center for Biological Diversity sponsored Synapse’s analysis.
TVA’s board of directors was invited to participate in the Nashville hearing, but when the chairman called the proceeding to order, “no one representing TVA responded,” said the post-hearing brief.
The TVA board is scheduled to vote this summer on whether to approve the utility’s final resource plan, which TVA staff are drafting in consultation with a utility working group, said Gabriela Sarri-Tobar, energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The board has the power to reject a plan that is not aligned with the Biden administration’s federal climate and clean energy goals for 100% clean energy by 2035, she said.
TVA’s board, “and especially the six board members nominated by the president,” should “make it a priority to align TVA’s energy planning with federal climate targets,” Sarri-Tobar said, citing the “tremendous” financial and public health benefits of transitioning to 100% clean power as shown by the Synapse study. TVA’s board has nine members.
Asked about the engagement of the Biden-appointed TVA board members, Bryan Jacob, solar program director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), said “TVA is out of sync with reality and out of step with the Biden Administration’s direction and commitments. It doesn’t matter which president originally nominated the Board members. If they ultimately endorse a resource plan that includes new gas resources now, it will ensure that the nation’s largest public power utility fails to achieve 100% clean energy by 2035 and will increase the risks of high bills and grid failures for the people of the Valley for decades to come.”
Maggie Shober, research director at SACE, made the case that TVA is using a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process as a “stand-in” for “genuine” public and stakeholder engagement to inform its resource planning process. “NEPA was not intended to be used that way,” she wrote in a post, and “it falls far short of what is needed for the public to be able to interact with and inform key decisions that will impact our lives for decades.”
Peter Hubbard, a clean energy advocate with the Georgia Center for Energy Solutions, testified at the hearing that TVA “must account” in its resource planning “for the remarkably poor track record of failure” for carbon capture and storage projects “such as Southern Company’s failed Kemper project in Mississippi and NRG’s failed Petra Nova project in Texas, when accounting for the possibility that this troubled technology could work for TVA.”
Groups signing the petition to intervene were Appalachian Voices, Center for Biological Diversity, Energy Alabama, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Sunrise Movement Nashville and Vote Solar.
Those groups also signed the June 2023 letter along with three other entities: QCells USA Corporation, Sierra Club and the Southern Renewable Energy Association.
TVA serves 10 million customers across Tennessee, substantial portions of Kentucky, Mississippi, and Alabama, and parts of three other states.
