The approved change now requires that CEC institute a transparent rulemaking proceeding regarding how non-energy benefits (NEBs) and social costs are incorporated into CEC planning and decision-making, including the 2025 Senate Bill 100 report. 
Senate Bill 100 required the state to source 60% of its electricity from emissions-free sources by 2030 and requires 100% clean energy by 2045. It also requires that California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the CEC, and California Air Resources Board issue a joint report to the legislature every four years, with the next report due in 2025.  
For the first time, the agencies will be required to transparently create policies that pursue the 100% clean energy goal while placing a value on the environment and public health, integrating these outcomes into its determinations, planning, and decision-making processes. 
The CEC will also be required to consider local benefits such as improved public health from reduced pollution and the resiliency of distributed renewable energy resources. For example, energy-efficiency programs targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities have been deemed not “cost-effective” under a cost-benefit analysis that has ignored the benefits to these families’ wellbeing. 
“This is an enormous first step toward making sure California’s energy decisions don’t harm communities, air and water to benefit polluting industries and corporate utilities, and it will tip the scales toward clean energy,” said Roger Lin, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.
The rulemaking decision marks the first positive development for distributed renewable energy in California, a state that has taken numerous regressive policy actions over the past eighteen months. The CPUC has effectively cratered rooftop, commercial, and community solar, siding with large investor-owned utilities at every turn, despite public outcry and protest.
CPUC approved NEM 3.0, which has tanked residential rooftop solar value and led to tens of thousands of jobs lost. It passed a rulemaking decision that made it harder for schools, farms, and renters to benefit from solar. It effectively put an end to the emergent community solar market, which has been massively successful in bringing more renewables online in states like New York and Massachusetts. And it is working on placing fixed monthly utility bill charges on ratepayers based on their income level, which analysts say will discourage energy efficiency and disproportionately impact lower-income customers.
While utilities are interconnecting large utility-scale solar projects, which are hailed as cost-effective solutions, electricity prices are skyrocketing in the state. The set of rulemaking decisions amount to protection of an effective monopoly by the state’s large investor-owned utilities. CPUC approved PG&E to hike electricity rates by 16% this year, continuing the trend of exploding electricity prices.
In a related bill, California Assemblymember Laura Friedman has introduced AB 2256, which would require the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to fully consider the costs and benefits of rooftop solar when revisiting its net energy metering (NEM) tariff.
“The commission’s leadership will go a long way toward bringing climate justice to California’s hardest hit communities and sets a precedent that other states should follow,” said Lin. “We’ll see less pollution and unlock more clean energy funding for overburdened communities that have been last in line.”

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/13/solar-asset-underperformance-estimated-to-cause-4-6-billion-in-preventable-losses/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,QUALITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-13,Solar asset underperformance estimated to cause $4.6 billion in preventable losses,"The global solar market continues to grow, as an estimated 413 GW was installed in 2023, rising 58% year-over-year, according to Bloomberg NEF. Along with this growth comes a rising trend in system underperformance, said a report from Raptor Maps.
Raptor Maps analyzed data collected from drones, robotics, application program interfaces (API) and internet of things (IoT) sensors. The company operates an AI-driven “drone in a box” that it deploys at solar facilities. Its dataset comprises 125 GW of PV assets, spanning 41 countries.
Among the analyzed assets, the company found $177.7 million in preventable annualized revenue losses. Extrapolated to solar assets worldwide, this would equate to $4.6 billion in potential annual revenue losses.
The report found average losses of $4,696 per MW, though losses varied regionally. Since 2019, the average losses from underperformance have increased from a 1.61% average power loss, to 4.47% in 2023. Raptor Maps said this equates to an internal rate of return at loss of at least 190 basis points in a 100 MW solar asset.
One factor in increased average power losses is the increase in average system size. Raptor Maps said larger projects tend to have a higher loss percentage. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that average solar project sizes have grown from 13.9 MW in 2019 to 59.6 MW in 2023, contributing to increased average losses.
Furthermore, inefficiencies in operations and maintenance are causing potential revenue losses, said the report. In a 2023 survey, the company found “many operators identified preventative maintenance visual inspections as a significant source of time wastage, and a large number of respondents also identified validating nuisance alarms as another way time is wasted.”
Regionally, preventable losses vary widely. In the Midwest, average annual losses were modeled at $4,052 per MW, while in the Northeast, losses exceeded $6,108 per MW. The report noted that asset underperformance losses are lower in the U.S. than the global average.
What causes underperformance?
Raptor Maps identified several sources of power losses. The largest fault, following an historical trend, was at the system level. Inverter faults, string outages, and combiner faults contributed power losses of 1.91%, 0.90%, and 0.81% respectively. Instances of tracker issues have also risen from 0.26% in 2022 to 0.46% in 2023.
Raptor Maps noted that module performance has improved slightly, with losses decreasing by about 12% year-over-year. However, with extreme weather events on the rise, median annual power losses attributed to weather events is about 1%. In certain extreme events, weather related losses can lead to losses of up to 60%, said Raptor Maps. Hail events, particularly in booming solar markets like Texas, are a significant risk for solar asset operations.
Risk profiles vary by module type, said Raptor Maps. Thin-film modules averaged lower power losses from defects and manufacturing anomalies than polycrystalline and monocrystalline. However, thin-film modules were twice as likely to have physical damage as polycrystalline modules, and three-and-a-half times more likely to sustain physical damage than monocrystalline modules.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/13/mitigate-lithium-ion-battery-fire-risk-for-manageable-premiums/,"INSURANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,QUALITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,2024-03-13,Mitigate lithium-ion battery fire risk for manageable premiums,"From pv magazine print edition 3/24
Lithium ion battery energy storage systems (BESS’) have emerged as a dominant energy technology, with gigawatts of capacity installed annually. Analyst Wood Mackenzie has estimated the United States battery market alone could reach 75 GW by 2027. Utility scale grid connections and major technology companies including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are driving demand as they seek reliable backup power. On site battery storage is becoming a priority for renewables developers keen to better match demand and to hedge against volatile energy prices.
The boom in demand has highlighted concern about potential fires and explosions at battery sites and has sparked debate about mitigation measures.
One approach is to leave BESS’ to freely consume, or “burn” through the stranded energy supply without active protection or suppression systems. This unused system capacity is susceptible to fire risk and with no suppression measures, could extend the duration and severity of a burn event.
Approaches to explosions and fire mitigation focus on spatial separation, robust battery management systems (BMS’), granular thermal runaway sensors, and explosion relief systems.
Mitigating fire risk became a major focus in 2017, following destructive fires in first-generation BESS’ that lacked fire protection or suppression. That prompted new asset-protection systems, with gaseous fire systems proving popular.
Gaseous suppression involves oxygen being removed from battery chambers to stop feeding fires. The other common approach involves spraying assets with water. Each has problems. Gaseous suppression risks reigniting fires with the introduction of oxygen, heightening explosion risk. Water-based systems are limited by the volume of water required to extinguish lengthy blazes.
The United States National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) released industry standards in 2017 recommending sprinkler systems for BESS fire protection. The argument for sprinklers was bolstered by a cascading thermal runaway event in Arizona in 2019 which saw a gaseous-based fire suppression system fail to stop thermal runaway gas generation, leading to explosive conditions in closed containers. The resulting updated standards required the use of sprinklers, with alternatives permitted only subject to approval by insurance companies and building-code officials.
The rapid evolution of the BESS industry makes life difficult for insurers, with property insurers considering the battery chemistry and the environment around a BESS. Single-layer BESS’ – versus stacked containers – and spatial separation of units can reduce premiums and client-related terms and conditions. Other factors include a robust BMS, predictive thermal runaway sensors, explosion relief systems, and the efficacy of fire department training programs. Such systems can influence how much project cost is covered by insurance policies.
Insurers and building code officials are divided on whether water-based fire protection systems or the free-burn approach is best. BESS technology is evolving rapidly, as are fire protection systems. To mitigate risk, developers should consider three main factors.
BMS’ monitor many variables, including the state of health – remaining useful life – and the state of charge of BESS components, down to module and even cell level. The granular use of BMS’ is critical for staying within safe operating parameters. Subsystems such as thermal management processes monitor and optimize performance, heating or cooling cells when necessary. Software tools such as LionTamer, which detects failing battery cells before thermal runaway occurs, help to mitigate explosion and fire risk.
Effective explosion relief systems require design conformance to NFPA standards in addition to enough spatial separation between containers or other structures to avoid collateral damage. Adherence to, and the enforcement of, fire and building codes will provide a basis for resilience.
It is important to consider the outlook of code officials and of insurance partners. Gaseous suppression and water-based protection systems are still available as a last line of defense. Coolant-based protection systems are currently under consideration as well. Research continues to optimize these approaches. The goal is to buy time to isolate and exhaust combustible and flammable gases while limiting fire spread and collateral damage.
Together, these measures are critical. Asset developers, operators, and owners who incorporate the latest predictive software and engineered safety systems will gain a total-cost-of-risk advantage as the BESS industry matures.
Asset owners who actively manage project risks can, over time, reduce insurance cost increases and avert massive premium spikes following losses. They should work with their brokers to identify insurance providers willing to incorporate resiliency measures into premium pricing assessments. With smart strategies, the BESS boom can charge safely ahead.

In its strategic plan for the 2024-27 period, Spanish inverter manufacturer Power Electronics said it plans to invest €300 million ($328 million) to expand its inverter production capacity in Spain and the United States.
A company spokesperson told pv magazine that its current production capacity is 30 GW, and it will increase manufacturing capacity in the United States by more than 20 GW by 2026.
The new factory will cover an area of 174,015 square meters and “will be designed with the latest manufacturing and assembly technologies to serve as an optimal center for the manufacturing and distribution of its products throughout the country,” said the company.
The plan also foresees the completion of a new plant in Llíria, Spain, for the Electric Mobility division.
Power Electronics products are present in almost 2,000 plants in 35 countries around the world. The company closed the year 2023 with an installed AC power capacity of 91 GW. According to Wood Mackenzie’s report on inverter shipments in 2022 published in August, Power Electronics is ranked seventh globally.

A state policy passed by the Public Regulation Commission allows for the interconnection of community solar up to 200 MW of capacity, split by utilities: the Public Service Company of New Mexico is allocated 125 MW; Southwestern Public Service has 45 MW; El Paso Electric has 30 MW. There is also a stipulation that 30% of electricity produced by a community solar facility be earmarked for low-income subscribers.
“As a proud sponsor of The Community Solar Act, I applaud the New Mexico Supreme Court for doing right by the people and honoring the Act’s legislative intent. Community solar will continue to play a crucial role in advancing state clean energy goals and this is a step towards cementing our role as a national leader,” said State Senator Liz Stefanics.
Investor-owned utilities, however, were not in favor the rule that restricts utilities from deducting transmission costs from solar bill credits received by customers. The appeal was brought to the New Mexico Supreme Court by Southwestern Public Service, an Excel Energy Subsidiary and supported by the other utilities Public Service Company of New Mexico and El Paso Electric.
Attorney Jason Marks argued on behalf of the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the Renewable Energy Industries Association of New Mexico, the Coalition of Sustainable Communities New Mexico, New Energy Economy and the city of Las Cruces. He referred to the 45 community solar projects that were “in limbo” due to the appeal. According to the Coalition of Sustainable Communities New Mexico, those projects that were expected to come online in the next year have all committed to allocating at least 50% capacity to low-income subscribers and will offer discounts to low-income subscribers of an additional 20% to 30% of the solar bill credit, for at least five years.
The joint brief filed on behalf of the five parties states that “the Community Solar Act provides community solar subscribers with a statutorily defined credit for each kWh of solar energy they cause to be generated, but also requires them to pay for all investor-owned utility supplied generation.”
The brief explains that community solar can access these benefits “regardless of their renter-versus-homeowner status, their income, or the suitability of their rooftop for hosting solar,” unlike rooftop solar owners. The brief also notes that the program will also accelerate the state’s decarbonization goals, “while providing long-term savings opportunities to all customers in the form of future avoided utility costs”.
Supreme Court Justice C. Shannon Bacon ruled in support of the Community Solar Act, issuing a stay for the rules of the program approved two years ago by state legislators.
“This decision from the New Mexico Supreme Court is monumental as we work to democratize solar energy in New Mexico,” said Kevin Cray, Mountain West senior director for CCSA. “This program will create a more equitable and resilient grid, enable new communities to embrace clean energy, and save money for hard-working families. We look forward to working closely with our partners in the state to continue rolling out the first phase of this program and further expand it in the future so more people can access its benefits.”

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/13/doe-loan-programs-office-announces-73-4-million-for-microgrid-on-tribal-lands/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,2024-03-13,DOE Loan Programs Office announces $72.8 million for microgrid on Tribal lands,"The Viejas Microgrid Project, which is already under construction, will provide the Viejas Band of the Kumeyaay Indians a 15 MW solar plant along with a 38 MWh long-duration battery energy storage system (BESS). The solar-plus-storage microgrid will be located near San Diego, California.
The 15 MW of solar modules from JA Solar are being installed by Indian Energy LLC on parking structures on the Tribal land and will supply electricity to the non-lithium, vanadium-flow BESS as well as to the local grid. Invinity Energy and Eos provided the BESS.
The Viejas Band will purchase electricity through a subsidiary in a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) to help operate gaming, hospitality and retail businesses. When complete, the project will allow the Tribe to benefit from a lower levelized cost of energy, allowing additional resources to be redirected toward investments by the Tribe in infrastructure maintenance, operation of the fire department, Tribal culture and educational programs, and other Tribal member services.
“This solar microgrid project will enable us to create a reliable and sustainable source of clean energy for our gaming, hospitality, and retail operations going forward. In turn, the associated non-lithium battery system supports the environmental protection and cultural stewardship of our ancestral land, thereby ensuring the vibrant future of our children,” said John Christman, chairman, Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians.
This is the first project to be offered a conditional commitment of $72.8 million through the Tribal Energy Financing Program, which was provided new and expanded loan authority the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The partial loan guarantee will help build the microgrid, which will help the Band’s economy by lowering the cost of energy as well as bringing job opportunities. While the LPO demonstrates its commitment to financing the project, the project must reach critical milestones, and certain technical, legal, and financial conditions must be met before the LPO enters into definitive financing documents and guarantees the loan.
The project is expected to create 250 construction jobs and eight permanent operations jobs, including prioritizing Tribal-, minority-, and veteran-owned contractors. In addition, LPO works with all borrowers to create good-paying jobs with strong labor standards during construction, operations, and throughout the life of the loan and to adhere to a strong Community Benefits Plan.
The project also supports the Justice40 Initiative, which has a goal that 40% of overall benefits of certain federal investments, including LPO financing, go to DOE-identified disadvantaged communities (DACs), which includes the Viejas Tribal Lands.
The borrower, IE VEM Managing Member LLC, is a Tribal energy development organization (TEDO) ultimately owned by the project developer Indian Energy LLC, and two federally recognized Tribal Nations. The two Tribal Nations will receive revenue streams from the project through their ownership stakes in the project.
The Tribal Energy Financing Program supports Tribal investment in energy-related projects by providing loan guarantees to federally recognized Tribes, including Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations, or a TEDO that is wholly or substantially owned by a federally recognized Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Corporation. The program was authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and first funded by Congress in 2017. The IRA, which was passed in 2022, increased the program’s available loan authority from $2 billion to $20 billion, and changes from both IRA and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 made permanent the ability for applicants to apply for direct loans from U.S. Treasury’s Federal Financing Bank through the program.
In addition to the commitment from the LPO, the project received a $31 million grant from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to deploy the BESS.
The Viejas Band is one of 12 bands of the Kumeyaay Indian Nation which resides on a 1,600-acre reservation in the Viejas Valley, near the town of Alpine in San Diego County. The Band is recognized as a sovereign government by the United States.
Indian Energy operates a multi-year development pipeline that consists of 4 GW of solar and wind projects, and 6 GWh of energy storage projects.
This article was amended to revise the amount of the loan commitment, per LPO.

Researchers at the University of Rajshahi in Bangladesh have simulated a dual-junction tandem solar cell based on two PV devices reyling on absorbers made of cadmium telluride (CdTe) and iron disilicide (FeSi2).
Inorganic FeSi2-based solar cells have recently drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community as these devices offer superior thermal stability and good optoelectronic properties compared to conventional solar cells. Furthermore, Fe and Si used to form FeSi2 are abundant in nature.
The scientists explained that their tandem cell takes advantage of combining the larger bandgap of the top CdTe cell and the smaller bandgap of the bottom FeSi2 cell. “The top cell transforms photons with elevated energy efficiently while minimizing thermalization losses and transmitting the solar spectrum in the close-infrared region light to the lower cell,” they highlighted. “In order to improve light absorption, it is crucial to reduce the undesired losses at the junction resulting from Fresnel surface reflection.”
The scientists used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell configuration. They assumed the top cell to be built with an n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS) window layer, the CdTe absorber, and a back surface field (BSF) based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The bottom cell was designed with an n-type CdS window layer, the FeSi2 absorber, and a copper tin sulfide (Cu2SnS3) BSF.
In the simulation, the team considered parameters such as energy bandgap, diffusion length, and doping concentration. “CdTe has featured a 1.5 eV bandgap and a 4.28 eV electron affinity, while the bandgap and electron affinity of FeSi2 are 0.87 eV and 4.16 eV, respectively,” it specified. “An optimal, slender tunnel junction connecting the upper and lower cells with monolithic architecture has been assumed for the electrical linkage.”
The numerical analysis showed that the top CdTe cell may potentially achieve a power conversion efficiency of 26.13%, while the FeSi2 bottom cell may reach up to 35.25%. It also demonstrated that the tandem device may achieve an efficiency of 43.91%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.928 V, a short-circuit current of 25.338 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 88.88%.
“These results suggest the practical feasibility of fabricating high-performance CdTe–FeSi2 double-junction tandem solar cells for efficient solar energy conversion,” the scientists affirmed.
The cell was described in the study “Design and optimization of a high efficiency CdTe–FeSi2 based double-junction two-terminal tandem solar cell,” published in Heliyon.
