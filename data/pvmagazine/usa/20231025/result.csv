CMBlu’s product combines advantages of both redox flow batteries and solid-state batteries. Its product, called the Organic SolidFlow, offers independent scaling of power and energy without sacrificing energy density. 
The technology is built on safe, abundant, and recyclable materials, said the company. Its energy storage devices do not rely on conflict or rare materials. 
CMBlu is currently developing multiple pilot projects in the U.S. and Europe to demonstrate its technology. It has active projects with WEC Energy Group in Wisconsin, Salt River Project in Arizona and several sites in Europe. 
While former redox flow batteries use metals, the company’s Organic SolidFlow batteries use carbon-based molecules for its electrolytes. The company said certain carbon-based molecules naturally can oxidized and reduced or charged and discharged. These molecules are essential elements in the “redox” reactions that power all living cells. 
“Nature had a choice to use metal or organic molecules to store and release energy. It chose organic. So are we,” said CMBlu. 
The storage devices are intended for use in large stationary projects. The company said it has a “potentially unlimited” cycle life with proper maintenance. It offers up to 90% efficiency, approaching the 95% efficiency of lithium-ion alternatives. It also can be easily scaled to GWh scale, said the company. 
“To become reality, the energy transition will require storage capacity measured in terawatts,” added CMBlu chief executive officer and founder Peter Geigle. “Only with very large storage capacities can GHG reduction goals be met. Our Organic SolidFlow batteries can be scaled up to the gigawatt-hour range, which enables the balance between renewable energy supply and essential energy demand – even without wind or sun.” 
STRABAG said the investment will help it achieve its goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2040. The company said it intend to become a full-range supplier of energy services for its projects. 
“The game changer for the energy transition is safe and sustainable long-duration storage that can make renewable energy available when needed,” explains Klemens Haselsteiner, chief executive officer of STRABAG.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/25/using-rocks-as-heat-batteries-for-renewable-energy-storage/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 25, 2023",Using rocks as heat batteries for renewable energy storage,"New Mexico-based CSolPower LLC is partnering with Sandia National Laboratories to research and develop the use of landscape gravel as a thermal energy storage medium for intermittent sources of generation like solar and wind.
The system is comprised of rocks held in a bed that are heated or cooled with air to store thermal energy. Sandia’s researchers said the gravel from landscaping companies can be successfully used for the system without requiring extensive washing or preparation.
Sandia designed a small 100 kWh test project at its National Solar Thermal Test Facility. PV panels are installed at the site, which is being tested for its ability to store intermittent generation.
“One of the advantages of thermal energy storage in rocks is that it can be built anywhere,” said Walter Gerstle, co-founder of CSolPower. “It can be commodified and doesn’t require extensive permitting. We believe it can be implemented more quickly and economically than other approaches.”
The rock bed is a long-duration energy storage system, a category of energy storage that has introduced creative solutions like gravity-based storage, rusted iron pellets, thermal bricks, and more.
Sandia tested the bed by charging it with heated air greater than 900 degrees F and maintained that temperature for up to 20 hours. The system was successfully discharged, and Sandia said the performance of the system has been in-line with modeling and predictions. The lab said prototype testing will continue until June 2024.
CSolPower said it intends to make the product ready for utility-scale use, but first it will develop small-scale versions.
“A natural approach is to store excess electricity generated during the day as heat, and then use it to heat water and homes at night. This is an example of the small-scale use of this storage option,” said Gerstle.
If the current phase of testing is successful, several greenhouses in northern New Mexico are prepared to use the rock bed storage in another pilot project.
“Instead of curtailing solar energy production, we would store it and use it during cold nights to keep the greenhouses warm enough to grow plants year-round,” said Gerstle.
The project is financed by the Technology Readiness Gross Receipts Initiative. Sandia’s economic development department administers the tax-funded program, which enables New Mexico businesses to work alongside scientists and engineers from Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/25/caribbean-could-become-offshore-floating-solar-pv-giant-researcher-says/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PUERTO RICO",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 25, 2023","Caribbean could become offshore floating solar PV giant, researcher says","Christian Breyer, a solar economy professor at Finland-based LUT University, told pv magazine that if the Caribbean and its 13 countries seized on the right opportunities, the region could become a “global center” for offshore floating solar PV energy generation.
“Land-based PV systems will be developed first. However, the substantial electricity demand may lead to limitations in land availability, which can be overcome by offshore floating PV,” he said.
Breyer recently co-authored a paper exploring the potential of solar PV in the Caribbean’s chain of islands. The paper investigates various renewable energy generation methods with a special focus on the efficacy and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of offshore floating PV arrays in Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico, a North American territory that consumes almost 70 times more energy than it produces, aims to power its hurricane-impacted electricity grid with only renewable energy by 2050.
According to the research, however, both the wider Caribbean region and the island of Puerto Rico are lagging in renewable energy capacities. Puerto Rico recorded 841 MW installed total renewable energy capacity in 2022, with 639 MW comprising solar PV, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The paper posits that as the Caribbean has limited available land, offshore floating PV should be considered. After examining multiple renewable energy generation scenarios, the paper states: “The results for Puerto Rico clearly indicate the enormous benefits of reaching 100% renewable energy, as the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) can be reduced from more than €10o ($106.2)/MWh in 2020 to €47.4 MW/h in 2050.
“The dominating source of energy for electricity supply and the entire energy system is found to be solar PV with 80% and 91% of supply share in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, respectively,” the researchers said in the paper. “When limited offshore land availability is applied, a substantial share of all PV generation can be provided by offshore floating PV for minimal extra costs.”
When asked how feasible floating solar PV actually is in the region, he said onshore floating PV is “standard” while offshore floating PV solar arrays have been developed in “various regions around the world”.
The International Solar Energy Society forecast that regions that don’t record waves larger than 6 m or winds stronger than 15 m/s could generate up to one million TWh per year through offshore floating PV arrays.
Onshore and offshore solar PV floating projects, however, come with their own technological challenges.
“The special conditions in the Caribbean with hurricane risk require special consideration of regions with better natural storm protection,” Breyer said. “I would assume that somehow stronger structures should be used, while the more protected areas will be the most important aspect. Onshore PV systems have to be also hurricane proof, thus, that may be similar for offshore floating PV systems.”
In the last decade, there have been 20 recorded hurricanes and tropical storms making landfall in Puerto Rico. When Hurricane Maria battered the island in 2017, it took the electricity grid almost 11 months to recover – making it the longest blackout in North American history.
The paper, titled “Role of Solar Photovoltaics for Sustainable Energy System in Puerto Rico in the Context of the Entire Caribbean Featuring the Value of Offshore Floating Systems,” was published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/25/u-s-airforce-embraces-e-mobility/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 25, 2023",U.S. Airforce embraces e-mobility,"To help achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030, the U.S. Air Force is increasingly using electric vehicles for its non-tactical transportation. Shoals Technologies Group announced that its Fuel by Shoals e-mobility solution will be deployed by the Air Force, supporting an EV charging-as-a-service (CaaS) pilot project provided by Leidos.
Leidos plans to design and implement a modern, resilient, scalable and secure power infrastructure solution to charge the Air Force’s fleet of non-tactical vehicles at multiple installations across the continental United States.
Leidos plans to integrate ChargePoint EV chargers with the Fuel by Shoals solution to enable the Air Force to transition its fleet of more than 49,000 non-tactical vehicles to zero-emissions using EV CaaS. Transitioning the Air Force’s fleet to zero emissions vehicles is a key component of the Air Force Climate Action Plan, which aims to achieve not only 100% carbon-free electricity on a net annual basis by fiscal 2030, but net-zero emissions at all Air Force facilities by fiscal 2046.
“This innovation pilot seeks to deploy cutting-edge private sector technologies to achieve the Air Force’s electrification goals,” said Paul Grimes, Leidos’ vice president for energy infrastructure. “We’re excited to work with Shoals and incorporate their eMobility solution to ensure quality and cost-efficiency for this contract.”
Fuel by Shoals is an EV charging infrastructure solution that has above-ground raceways and power stations designed to meet the efficiency and resiliency needs of each location, the company reports. Its solution uses analytics and engineering to mitigate the impact on local installation grids.
“As a ‘Made in Tennessee’ company, we are incredibly proud to work with Leidos on this first-of-its-kind deployment for U.S. Air Force,” said Jeff Tolnar, president of Shoals. “Fuel by Shoals is the ideal solution to cost-effectively support the Air Force’s Climate Action Plan and we are excited to play a role in helping the Air Force achieve their net-zero goals.”
The need for EV charging stations accelerated in the United States after President Biden set a goal of building out a national network of 500,000 chargers. The plan got an added boost with the announced funding to accelerate the creation of zero-emission vehicle corridors that expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure. In a recent report, Wood Mackenzie forecast that the market for public charging networks in North America will grow rapidly by 2050.
Leidos, based in Reston, Virginia, is an IT specialist providing solutions for the defense industry, among others. Its defense solutions include enterprise and mission IT, large-scale intelligence systems, command and control, geospatial and data analytics, cybersecurity, logistics, training, and intelligence analysis and operations support.
Shoals Technologies Group, based in Portland, Tennessee,  is a provider of electrical balance of system solutions and components for solar, battery storage and EV charging applications. The company reports that its solutions are deployed on over 62 GW of solar systems globally.
