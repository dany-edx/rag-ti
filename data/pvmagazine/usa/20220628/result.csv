The acquisition marks DSD’s first venture in Minnesota, expanding its footprint of assets to 22 states across the nation.
The portfolio consists of six projects with 100% residential offtaker, while the seventh project will exclusively serve commercial customers. Those six projects are expected to serve 600 residential customers. DSD will serve as the long term owner and operator of the sites, which are expected to be operational by the second quarter of 2023. Common Energy will be handling customer acquisition and subscriptions for the portfolio.
Over the last decade, renewable generation has risen 60% in Minnesota, from 10.6 TWh to 17 TWh in 2021, with renewables providing 28% of Minnesota’s generation in 2021. A large portion of this growth is attributable to Minnesota’s community solar program, which is among the strongest and most effective in the country.
As is outlined by the above graft, provided by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the majority of Minnesota’s solar capacity additions that have come on-line since the state’s market began ramping up in 2016 have come from community solar projects.
According to the Institute of Local Self-Reliance, Minnesota’s community solar program grew to 837 MW of operational capacity in June 2022. This is due in large part to comprehensive approach that the state took in developing the policy, one which makes developing community solar projects economically viable. Minnesota’s community solar program also does not cap the development of community solar projects, which authors John Farrell and Maria McCoy identified as being absolutely critical. Minnesota has also seen widespread commercial customer support for community solar projects, as 83% of the program’s total capacity serves such customers.
According to SEIA and Wood Mackenzie data, Minnesota is poised to add 1.2 GW of solar of all kinds over the next five years, which ranks 24th in the nation over that period. if history is any indicator, however, and most of that new capacity is community solar, Minnesota would still be on track to be a national leader in that market segment, alongside New York, which recently overtook it as the top solar market in the country. Industry group Clean Energy Economy Minnesota expects renewable power production to increase from 2% of the state’s electricity in 2020 to 10% by 2030, driven in large part by the program.
“Minnesota’s community solar program is widely recognized as a leader in terms of installed capacity, and DSD looks forward to additional opportunities to streamline and expand that impact,” said Joe Rosenberg, director of Business Development at DSD.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/28/historic-pittsburgh-steel-plant-reopens-to-make-components-for-nextracker/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,PENNSYLVANIA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 28, 2022",Historic Pittsburgh steel plant reopens to make components for Nextracker,"Nextracker has announced the opening of the company’s third dedicated steel line in the U.S. Through a partnership with BCI Steel, the historic Bethlehem steel manufacturing factory in Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, just outside of Pittsburgh, will reopen to produce solar tracker equipment for Nextracker’s utility-scale tracker operations.
According to Nextracker, the steel processing plant will incorporate both new and reshored equipment shipped back to the U.S. from factories in Malaysia and Brazil. Solar tracker products produced at the factory will serve rapidly growing markets in Pennsylvania, Indiana, New York, and Ohio.
According to Nextracker President Howard Wenger, the reopening of the Bethlehem steel manufacturing factory will create 40 to 70 jobs directly, however the plant alone doesn’t represent the full employment impact of Nextracker opening operations in the area.
“It catalyzes a number of indirect jobs, and jobs further upstream, for the manufacturer of the steel itself, US Steel in this case, creating more demand for them,” explained Wenger. “Of course, there’s the job trucking and transporting the product. Plus, [the location of the plant] it enables faster delivery and faster construction and solar plants. So in our ecosystem that we’re building out, we believe that we’re going to create over 1000 direct and indirect jobs, when you look at our entire manufacturing footprint.”
Supply-chain relief 
The move to sourcing American-made steel is one that became a necessity for Nextracker due to the pandemic and the resulting supply-chain and international shipping difficulties. According to Wenger, the company watched shipping and logistics costs skyrocket to more than 10-times pre-pandemic levels, while the cost of sourcing steel tripled. Even when the components could be sourced, material delivery had slowed to a crawl, hampering Nextracker’s ability to deliver its products to customers on time.
“We really hit a threshold, and that got us moving quickly,” explained Wenger. “But it turns out that it’s something we should have thought about before the pandemic, honestly, because it’s turning out to be a really good strategy for us. And we’re going to keep our international manufacturing. So we have both working in tandem, which provides a natural hedge for us. If steel costs go up in one region versus a logistics cost shift in another, we can toggle between regions. But, we are really targeting for the majority of our domestic U.S. demand to come from domestic manufacturing.”
Securing steel fabrication to alleviate supply chain concerns and shipping volatility is an emerging trend in the tracker and racking space, one that could hold momentum if the aforementioned market concerns persist. Another prominent name in the space, Terrasmart fabricates its own steel structures in house. In a prior interview with pv magazine, Terrasmart President, Ed McKiernan said that such an approach allows his company to switch up their operations “on a dime,” and to accommodate design and timeline changes for customers.
According to Wenger, the company’s main focus is keeping a consistent American supply chain of steel, as the logistics and availability of other tracker component materials have not been as disrupted.
Shortly after the announcement was made, the company also hosted a reopening event, attended by U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Senator Bob Casey, and leaders from some of the world’s largest clean energy companies, including the CEO of EDPR Sandhya Ganapathy and the Chief Operating Officer of Lightsource bp Ann Davies.
“I think having sent Secretary Granholm speak, and Senator Casey speak at our event, it’s a strong indication of the importance of of bringing renewable, clean energy jobs, and bringing a robust U.S.-made supply chain to life,” said Wenger.
Low-carbon steel
The reopening of the Bethlehem steel manufacturing factory marks the third steel manufacturing line that Nextracker has announced so far in 2022. In May, the company announced the launch of a line dedicated to producing steel tracker components for use in utility-scale solar power plants at Atkore’s Phoenix, Arizona facility, which was expanded and reconfigured with new capacity dedicated to Nextracker products. In April, Nextracker and JM Steel, a division of JENNMAR USA, announced a partnership under which a dedicated solar tracker production line was built on the campus of a new Steel Dynamics manufacturing facility near Corpus Christi, Texas.
According to Wenger, each location was specifically chosen to help Nextracker better serve some of its strategic growth and development markets across the U.S.
“We started first with where the projects are, because our strategy is to get our product, within one or two days, to our customers in the United States,” explained Wenger. “We started there, and then we mapped out where the steel manufacturing capacity is, and there is a really good intersection. I think the significance is that the U.S. has become a wide market. It’s not just in the Sunbelt, or its southwest. We have so much business now in the Midwest, in the northeast, in the heartland, that it really necessitated us to be there locally and making our products there for that market. I think that’s really significant for the industry.”
The Steel Dynamics facility in Texas utilizes electric arc furnaces in its manufacturing, which can lead to electric arc furnace facilities being up to 75% less carbon-intensive than traditional blast furnaces.In concert with this, Nextracker also shared that the steel that will be supplied for manufacture in the Bethlehem plant, which is being purchased from U.S. Steel, is produced entirely by electric arc furnaces, as is the steel supplied to Nextracker’s line at the Atkore plant in Arizona.
“Steel is like, 7% of the climate change problem, so if we can reduce the carbon content of our product by 10x, that’s very exciting and needed,” said Wenger.

Both projects are for behind-the-meter applications, which refers to customer-sited resources that are connected to the distribution system on the customer’s side of the utility’s service meter. GE said the projects will promote the deployment of novel solutions that enhance grid resiliency and stability with high solar penetration, and support commercial and industrial customers in reducing their utility bills and maximizing utilization of their solar assets. 
Battery and inverter integration 
GE with Sandia National Laboratories will receive a $1.75 million DOE Solar Energy Technology Office grant to design, build, and test a 400 kWh, 2-hour commercial and industrial battery system for integration with behind-the-meter solar. 
The projects will leverage GE’s Silicon Carbide power devices and grid forming controls to integrate solar and the battery storage system. The company will also develop grid-forming inverters as part of the system. The goal is to create advanced technology controls to support and sustain an increasingly renewables-dominated grid. 
GE said there is an increased opportunity for customers to reduce demand charges, self-consume solar energy, and ensure service continuity during grid outages. 
“It’s exciting to see the unprecedented rates at which PV solar and other renewable resources are growing behind and in front of the meter. To support and sustain this growth, innovative hybrid solutions such as the 400 kWh, 2-h BESS being developed under our DoE funded project, will play a key role in ensuring grid reliability and resiliency,” said Ahmed Elasser, principal investigator on the project. 
Elasser said inverters are essentially the gateway for renewable resources to be efficiently interfaced and reliably distributed to the utility grid. As renewables and energy storage deployment grows, the inverters are called upon to not only support the grid, but also to form the grid and coordinate with other inverters.
The GE team will design, build, and test its 400 kWh, 2-hour unit at its 12 MVA energy storage test facility, located on its Niskayuna campus. This test facility hosts GE’s 4 MWh Energy Reservoirs, its “FLEXINVERTER” PV and battery energy storage system inverters, and is also connected to a 250 kW, 1500V PV array for testing DC coupled Solar and Storage systems.
 
Grid analytics project
Additionally, GE is working with the University of Pittsburgh with a goal to demonstrate grid analytics with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA). The aim of the project is to secure quality data for distribution and transmission system operators and identify behind-the-meter solar assets to make them more easily and accurately integrated in grid planning and operations.
NRECA consists of more than 900 rural electric cooperatives that power more than 20 million customers over roughly half of the United States landscape.
“We know that by driving new advances in sensing, analytics, and control technologies, we can bring more PV Solar online while maintaining and even enhancing grid stability and reliability,” said, Honggang Wang, Principal Investigator at GE Research. “Working with NRECA will provide an excellent proving ground to demonstrate the enhanced value and visibility our grid analytics can bring toward supporting the transition to a more renewables intensive energy mix.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/28/solar-tariff-moratorium-creates-upside-but-supply-challenges-still-loom/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 28, 2022","Solar tariff moratorium creates upside, but supply challenges still loom","Since March, the solar industry has reeled from potential tariffs on goods manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, home to 80% of the nation’s supply of solar panels. Tariff risk on products from the four nations suspected of harboring Chinese goods in alleged violation of anti-circumvention laws exceeded 50% to 250%. It created an untenable level of uncertainty that cascaded into cancelled and delayed projects. The impact was so stark that it led the Solar Energy Industries Association to cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year.
On June 5, the Biden administration announced a 24-month tariff exemption, alleviating some of the near-term supply chain pressures and reopening solar panel supply, for now. Manufactures that halted operations and projects that were considered all but cancelled have now been resumed as a result of the executive order.
Wood Mackenzie said that though this has created clarity for the near-term, tariff implementation is still viewed as “high risk” by tax equity investors despite the two-year pause. The firm said developers should expect to continue to see high costs of capital and high barriers to entry as a result.
The effect of the investigation was exponential, said Wood Mackenize, as weeks of inactivity led to months in delays. Development firms had already begun reallocating machinery and personnel to non-energy projects, leading to a spike in labor shortages for near term projects.
WoodMac said that resuming renegotiations for cancelled and delayed utility-scale solar projects that were pushed to 2023 and 2024 may result in about 30-40% of these projects being installed earlier.
Altogether, the firm offered a modest improvement to its guidance for deployment this year, with an expected 1.5 GW boost, about 17%, to utility-scale solar in 2022, and about a 3 GW increase in deployment projections for 2023.
Further questions to be answered
There are several questions that remain unanswered for clarity in the near and mid-term for solar deployment. First, there is a possibility that the two-year moratorium on tariffs could come under legal challenges. Recently, a coalition of Republican Senators wrote a letter of concern to the Biden Administration, questioning the use of emergency status to invoke the order.
 The senators wrote that the use of an emergency declaration to enact the moratorium was an overreach. They argue that “food, clothing, and medical, surgical, and other supplies for use in emergency relief work,” are the only means for emergency declaration, and that the emergency declaration “translates those words into the language of climate catastrophe.” 
However, the summer reliability assessment by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) found that vast portions of the Western United States could be subject to widespread blackouts as there is not enough capacity online to serve peak demand, and extreme weather has knocked out numerous centralized transmission wires. NERC described the capacity shortage as “resulting in high risk of energy emergencies.”
It remains to be seen what kind of impact pushback on the two-year moratorium may have.
Another element of uncertainty is the implementation and operation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). WoodMac said the exact mechanisms for implementing the UFLPA will dictate its impact, and much lies in the details of how it is enforced. The UFLPA went into effect on June 21.
To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at an entity subject to “rebuttable presumption” that there is a connection to forced labor, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
Roughly half of the world’s polysilicon supply comes from the Xinjiang region that is under scrutiny for forced labor practices. A list of 20 entities under close attention was released, and several are already under similar scrutiny through Withhold Release Orders (WRO). New entities that were not part of the WRO but are now highlighted in UFLPA include Daqo New Energy and its aliases, Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co., and Heifei Meiling Co.
The Department of Homeland Security’s implementation of the UFLPA will be watched closely to determine what UFLPA may mean for solar panel supply in the near term.
A third element to watch is how the Department of Commerce will rule on the anti-dumping/anticircumvention (AD/CVD) investigation launched by the Auxin Solar petition this August.
WoodMac said developers will want to safe harbor modules without tariffs, but supply is already constrained. The final AD/CVD tariffs will differ by company and change from year to year. This will likely result in higher module pricing to account for these risks.

The project is expected to create more than 250 jobs at peak construction. The project is expected to generate more than $14 million in revenue for the local communities in both Audrain and Ralls Counties. Under terms of the agreement, the local utility, Ameren Missouri, will acquire the plant when construction is complete, which will help the company meet its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2045.
Missouri ranked 35th for installed solar last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, with only .72% of its electricity derived from solar. Anheuser-Busch and IKEA both have solar installations in the state. The O’Fallen installation (pictured above) is also owned by Ameren Missouri and, at 5.7 MW, is currently one of the largest in the state.

“Solar generation is good for all of our customers because it provides clean electricity, creates economic opportunity and injects millions of dollars into the community over the life of the project, which will have widespread additional benefits,” said Mark Birk, chairman and president of Ameren Missouri.  “The facility is a step-change for solar generation in Missouri and is designed to generate more than 25 times the amount of energy of Missouri’s largest existing solar facility. With timely regulatory approvals, the project could begin generating clean energy as soon as 2024.”
The expected electricity generated at full capacity is enough to meet the consumption of approximately 40,000 homes or the equivalent to avoiding over 330,000 metric tons of carbon (CO₂) emissions annually, which represents the greenhouse gas emissions from over 70,000 passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year.
The deal between EDF Renewables North America and Ameren Missouri, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation, is subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.
