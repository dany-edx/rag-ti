The Smart Yard station is designed to charge electric appliances and provide storage for lawn equipment.
The solar-powered tool shed provides close to 462 square feet of internal storage space in a 6.9 feet by 5.5 feet enclosure, which includes a 110 V plug-in connection for charging yard or household equipment.
The device integrates all-electric lawn umbrellas, pergolas, gazebos, enclosed outdoor rooms and outdoor power equipment such as a robotic lawnmower, leaf blowers, hedgers and weed whackers.
SunVilla’s equipment can be synced with a consumer-facing smartphone app, Suntek Smart Link, allowing customers to monitor and control charging applications and power consumption of home systems when in use or charging.
“We are thrilled to add Suntek’s innovative smart living technology to the SunVilla family. With this groundbreaking addition, we are bringing the future of residential living right to your doorstep,” said Matt Weiss, executive vice president at SunVilla.
SunVilla will be exhibiting the Smart Yard series products at Booth B1 4-D1 of the upcoming Casual Market Atlanta consumer expo, taking place from July 10-13 at the AmericasMartAtlanta center in Atlanta, Ga.
Backyard solar has turned from niche to mainstream with the recent launch of the PowerGazebo, an outdoor gazebo from Arka Energy that provides 2.4 kW to 4.3 kW of solar power via monocrystalline PERC solar tiles. The gazebo system is on display for installers and residents in the Bay Area, at a demonstration site in Union City, Calif.
Despite a previous product recall from 2022 involving Suntek’s battery-powered umbrella series, the company’s solar umbrella was awarded the International Casual Furnishings Association’s (ICFA) 2023 ICFA Design Excellence Award, while the lawnmower won the 2023 iF Design Award.
Last year, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada issued a joint product recall with SunVilla for the 10-foot smart umbrellas that used lithium-ion batteries and a small PV array. The recall followed reports of the system’s battery overheating and causing fires in select U.S. and Canadian markets.
Formed in 2021, Suntek Technology is a Shanghai, China-based company developing an outdoor brand ecosystem. The company now has global offices in the U.S, Germany and France.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/07/massachusetts-has-52-gw-of-top-rated-solar-potential/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 7, 2023",Massachusetts has 52 GW of “top rated” solar potential,"According to analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER), Massachusetts has the technical potential to add 506 GW of solar capacity. This is about 15 to 18 times the amount of solar capacity that is likely needed to meet the state’s decarbonization goals.
The conclusion, based on geographic information systems (GIS) mapping analysis, suggests that Massachusetts, a highly land-constrained and densely populated state, should have no trouble finding places to distribute local, clean electricity generation.
The state’s climate plan for 2050 estimates that 27 GW to 34 GW of solar capacity will be needed by 2050. This is considerable growth over the roughly 4 GW installed and operational today.
DOER determined that the state has 52 GW of “top rated” solar potential and 152 GW of “highly suitable” potential. These preferentially-ranked locations value land-saving installations like rooftop solar, canopies, and ground-mounted solar on landfills and other brownfield sites.
A consultant team from Synapse Energy Economics conducted a parcel-based geospatial analysis of every property tax parcel in the Commonwealth using ArcGIS software. The analysis considered land use and cost criteria such as biodiversity, carbon sequestration by forests, and electric infrastructure.
“The study shows we can site solar strategically to balance our land use and environmental justice priorities while meeting our solar and emissions reduction targets,” said Massachusetts Governor Maura Healy.
An interactable ArcGIS map can be viewed to identify the top rated solar locations, assisting developers and communities as they prospect for new project sites. The full report based on the mapping analysis can be found here.
“The StoryMap will be another important tool for our cities and towns to identify the best locations for solar in their communities,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll.
The study behind the map included a stakeholder and public engagement process and gave practical direction on how much and where solar can be built while protecting, managing, and restoring natural and working lands to maintain valuable natural resources that help sequester and store carbon.
“These results should inform the development of equitable solar projects and policy to better serve and support environmental justice communities. Having identified where the most suitable potential is, we can now engage with these communities to support their clean energy goals, priorities, and access,” said Rebecca Tepper, energy and environmental affairs secretary, Massachusetts.
The report dovetails with resources provided by the state’s the Grid Modernization Advisory Council and the Commission on Clean Energy Infrastructure Siting and Permitting.
The report was released on the 15th anniversary of the establishment of Massachusetts’ Green Communities Program, which has awarded nearly $167 million in grants to cities and towns. In 2008, when the program was initiated, 3 MW of solar was operational in Massachusetts, and today there is over 4,000 MW of delivering emissions-free electricity in the state.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/07/using-existing-fences-as-near-zero-cost-racking-solution-for-pv-deployment/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,CANADA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 7, 2023",Using existing fences as near-zero-cost racking solution for PV deployment,"From pv magazine global
A U.S.-Canadian group of scientists has suggested using existing fences in animal farms as a low-cost racking solution for solar modules.
“This is perhaps the lowest-cost approach to racking,” the research’s corresponding author, Joshua M. Pearce, told pv magazine. “What we did is show that at least one PV module between two upright posts is mechanically acceptable for every type of conventional farm fencing. In this case, the racking is almost free.”
The researchers identified three main typologies of fencing: fences based on multiple battens placed between the main posts to support the fence wire; fences using posts on which the fence wires or mesh are attached; and fences utilizing prefabricated meshes of various designs suitable to the need and sometimes aesthetics. “Normally for fences, high tensile steel wires and mild steel wire are predominantly used,” they noted. “Their diametric dimensions are generally 4 mm, 3.15 mm and 2.5 mm for high tensile (HT) wire and mild steel wires.”
In order to ascertain if an existing fence may be used for solar deployment, developers should first investigate if the fence can withstand a certain wind load in a specific location with the addition of PV panels, as well as the region’s topological, geographical and climatic challenges. In this regard, the group said special attention should be given to line post size and spacing play, adding that the main factors to be carefully considered are the height of the fence, footing depth, design and size of mesh fabric, as well as the material strength of the posts.
The scientists also explained that wind load measurements should be taken via the Main Wind Force Resisting System (MWFRS) and Components & Cladding (C&C) procedures, as well as by the Open Source Wind Load Calculator, which is a tool used to calculate the wind load on a fence in a given region in the United States. “The program outputs the wind loads in terms of the base shear force in pound force (lbf) and base moment in feet pound force (ft- lbf),” they specified, adding that they calculated for a range of wind loads from 80 mph to 150 mph (129 km/h to 241 km/h).
The academics conducted a series of field tests using three Cheetah HC 72 M monocrystalline PERC panels manufactured by China-based JinkoSolar. They said their installation was performed quickly by two people, with the mounting of a single module requiring seven minutes and a total of four zip-ties.

They also conducted a series of simulations for retrofitting existing farm fencing for a wide range of farms, including sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and alpaca, and found solar projects based on the proposed approach would be economically viable in the United States.

“The cost of the racking retrofit is only the cost of four stainless steel zip ties per module, which can be purchased in 120 packs for $11 or about 37 cents per module,” they explained. “If the modules range in power from 250 to 500 W then the racking cost of an existing fence is less than a penny a Watt.”
Pearce said the research group also laid out what would be an optimal inverter strategy depending on how much energy a farmer would need. “Small-scale farmers can use the free ebook to set up the design for the system, do the install with metal zip ties themselves, and then only need to call an electrician to attach to the grid,” he concluded.

The scientists presented their findings in the paper “The potential for fencing to be used as low-cost solar photovoltaic racking,” published in Solar Energy. “Future work is necessary to determine the full scope of the benefits of this approach of vertical PV agricultural fencing on a global scale,” they said, looking forward to how to improve the proposed methodology.

The research team comprises academics from the Western University in Canada and the Michigan Technological University in the United States.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/07/amazon-air-hub-adds-2-mw-rooftop-solar-array/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 7, 2023",Amazon Air Hub adds 2 MW rooftop solar array,"Customers of Duke Energy Kentucky will now source their electricity in part from a 2 MW solar array built on the rooftop of an Amazon Air Hub. The $1.5 billion Air Hub is the logistics giant’s own airport designed to meet its growing shipping needs.
The 5,600 panel array is the largest rooftop installation in Kentucky, topping the 800,000 square foot airport adjacent to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. The 2 MW utility solar project adds to the local distribution grid and can serve the demand of 400 homes.
The solar project is a joint partnership between Amazon and Duke Energy, aligning with both companies’ renewable energy goals. Amazon’s Air Hub was selected for its substantial and accessible flat roof and its proximity to infrastructure needed to feed the solar energy to the distribution grid, and then to nearby customers.
“Powering our operations with 100% renewable energy is an important part of Amazon’s commitment to reach net zero by 2040, and we built Amazon’s Air Hub – the largest field operation in Amazon’s history – with sustainability in mind,” said Chris Roe, Amazon director of energy and sustainable operations.
Duke Energy has a few other distributed solar sites in the region, including the Walton Solar facilities in Kenton County, which are comprised of 19,000 panels and offer 4 MW of capacity, and the Crittenden Solar facility, located in Grant County with 12,500 panels and 2.7 MW of capacity.
Duke Energy Ohio/Kentucky provides electric service to 900,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in a 3,000-square-mile service area.
Amazon has also been active in solar development in Kentucky. The company recently supported a partnership at an agrivoltaic installation developed by Silicon Ranch at Kentucky’s Hazelbrook Farm. In the partnership, sheep graze under the solar panels both to regenerate soil health and prevent the vegetation from interfering with energy production, and the panels provide shade for the sheep. The arrangement allowed Hazelbrook Farm to triple the size of its flock to 1,000 sheep and change the farm from a part-time operation to year-round, said Amazon.
“Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, and we want to ensure the local communities where our customers live and work are also benefiting from the solar and wind projects that we support,” said Charley Daitch, director of energy and water strategy at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The program will enable grantees to “expand existing low-income solar programs or design and deploy new Solar for All programs nationwide,” EPA said in a notice.
States, territories, tribal governments, municipalities, and eligible nonprofits may apply for a grant in an amount between $25 million and $400 million. The first stage of the application, a notice of intent, is due from interested parties by July 31. Each applicant must then submit a program strategy and a program administration plan, with the final submittal due September 26.
The EPA will provide an informational webinar on July 12.
Grant recipients, EPA said, will provide subsidies and other financial assistance to residential rooftop projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities, and residential-serving community solar projects benefiting those communities.
To help overcome barriers to solar deployment, the EPA said that grant recipients will also provide technical assistance that may include workforce development, community outreach, and other support, such as interconnection technical assistance and support for siting and permitting.
The $7 billion competitive grant program will result in up to 60 grants. The EPA intends to make at least one award per state and territory. Approximately one to three awards will be made to serve tribal nations. An applicant may apply to receive funds to serve one or more geographic areas.
The EPA says the goal of the Solar for All program is to expand the number of low-income and disadvantaged communities “primed for distributed solar investment—enabling millions of low-income households to access affordable, resilient, and clean solar energy.” The program is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.
The Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) is “actively working” with state energy offices to help them develop community solar programs that will directly benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities, said Molly Knoll, the organization’s vice president of policy.
A “simple and proven approach,” she said, is to provide incentives to build community solar projects that commit to providing a certain percentage of energy output and bill savings to LMI households.
CCSA expects the Solar for All program will support development of an additional 13.4 GW of new residential and community solar capacity if the full $7 billion in potential grant support is awarded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/07/five-organizations-turning-community-solar-into-savings-for-low-income-americans/,"COMMUNITY,GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,ALASKA,MASSACHUSETTS,MINNESOTA,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",,"JULY 7, 2023",Five organizations turning community solar into savings for low-income Americans,"Community solar projects can enable more people to access the benefits of clean energy by allowing anyone to take part in a local solar project regardless of whether they can, or want to, put solar panels on their own roofs. Community Solar can deliver particularly meaningful benefits to the communities they serve, such as providing bill savings (especially to low-income households), increasing community resilience to grid outages, creating jobs, and building community wealth.
Through the Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is recognizing organizations that are unlocking the full potential of community solar and sharing best practices to help others more readily adopt this innovative solar model. This year, DOE recognized five organizations that exemplify the benefits that community solar can bring with $10,000 grand prizes, and recently launched a new round of the prize.
Among this year’s winners, these five organizations each take a unique approach to save a combined total of $4.3 million on their subscribers’ energy bills. Here’s how they’re bringing the benefits of clean energy to their communities:
In Shungnak and Kobuk, Alaska, the Shungnak-Kobuk Community Solar Independent Power Producer (IPP) project, a solar-battery microgrid project located, is owned by two local tribes. It provides every household in these communities with renewable power and increases resilience to diesel fuel cost fluctuations.
The project includes a 223 kW solar array and a battery, allowing the communities’ diesel generators to turn off for an average of eight to ten hours per day during the daylight season. The battery storage also stabilizes the local grid in the event of any generator failures and can power the community for up to 2 hours. Excess funds generated by the sale of electricity from the solar array will be used to help households lower their energy bills through energy-efficient home upgrades.
The project is the first of its kind operating above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. The Northwest Arctic Borough plans to have all 11 communities in their jurisdiction develop independent power producers within five years.
In Washington, D.C., the District of Columbia’s (D.C.) Solar for All program provides no-cost community solar subscriptions to low- to moderate-income (LMI) households, saving them an average of $520 per year. It currently includes over 160 community solar projects that serve more than 6,000 LMI households in D.C., with a goal of reducing electricity bills by 50% for 100,000 LMI households by 2032.
This program, led by the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment and the D.C. Sustainable Energy Utility, provides a capacity-based incentive to community solar developers. This incentive, coupled with federal tax benefits and Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs), helps cover the cost of developing, constructing, operating, and maintaining each project.
D.C. Solar for All partners with Groundswell, a non-profit, which leads in-person community events. Many of the solar projects are built on community buildings such as churches and multi-family housing. D.C. Solar For All also partners with the DC Sustainable Energy Utility on a workforce development program that helps to connect DC residents with a five-month paid externship and provides skills development, on-the-job training and experience, OSHA training, certifications, mentoring, and job placement assistance.
In Brooklyn, N.Y., the Community Power project is a 1.2 MW project that delivers 20% guaranteed electricity bill savings to 500 LMI households. Two local organizations, WE ACT for Environmental Justice and the Brooklyn Movement Center, engaged residents and community members through a neighborhood-based approach. These community-based organizations worked in multiple languages with community boards, tenant associations, affordable housing and social service providers, and elected officials to build trust in and awareness of the opportunity for households to subscribe to this project.
The project also provided workforce training led by Solar One and Green City Force that led to full-time jobs with solar installers for several public housing residents. All the subscribers to this project also become members of the NYC Community Energy Co-op, giving them a controlling stake in future energy projects and the opportunity to become member-owners of the solar array that serves their community.
In Faribault, Minn., the Faribault Community Solar project is a community solar project developed by Cooperative Energy Futures under the Xcel Energy Solar Rewards Community program. All subscribers to the project are member-owners of Cooperative Energy Futures. They receive an annual share in the Cooperative’s profits through dividends and equity and have voting rights in key Cooperative decisions. This community ownership model helps households build wealth and have decision-making authority in the clean energy future of their communities.

The project provides bill savings to 77 subscribers, about half of which are LMI households. Cooperative Energy Futures does not require income or credit verification for subscribers, as verification paperwork requirements can create barriers to enrollment. The project provides assurance to lenders and tax equity investors using an innovative back-up subscriber model in which a large local organization–called an anchor tenant–agrees to accept additional project capacity as a stop gap measure in case of vacancy or default by residents.
The project was constructed by a local, minority-owned installer that is committed to fair wages and providing workforce training through an electrician apprenticeship program.
In Ashland, Mass., the JOE-4-SUN Ashland project is a 6 MW low-income community solar project located on a federal superfund site. The project serves over 500 LMI households. It provides a guaranteed 50% savings on bill credits to participating households, amounting to savings of more than $400 per year per household.
This project leverages the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program, which promotes solar development in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The project developer and owner, Citizens Energy, prioritizes making enrollment as easy as possible for households – never requiring a credit check and avoiding any sign up or cancellation fees. This project used entirely union labor, supporting good-paying jobs with livable wages and benefits. It also demonstrated innovative siting practices by locating the project on a superfund site once home to the Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump.
Each of these Sunny-award-winning projects demonstrates how community solar can provide meaningful benefits to the communities they serve and ensure the clean energy transition unfolds equitably. The Sunny Awards are run by the DOE National Community Solar Partnership, a coalition of stakeholders working to expand access to affordable community solar to every U.S. household and enable communities to realize meaningful benefits.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/07/first-solar-to-support-12-gw-growth-trajectory-with-1-billion-revolving-credit/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ALABAMA,ARIZONA,OHIO,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JULY 7, 2023",First Solar to support 12 GW growth trajectory with $1 billion revolving credit,"After securing growth of more than 12 GW of new panel orders from utility-scale solar developers since late 2022, First Solar has signed a multi-year secured debt agreement to procure a $1 billion revolving credit facility from major Wall Street banks.
On June 30, the Tempe, Arizona-based producer of U.S.-made solar panels arranged a new credit facility that includes a sub-limit of $250 million of available letters of credit. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank is lead arranger for the new debt, with participation from Bank of America, Citibank, Credit Agricole CIB, PNC Bank, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank, MUFG Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Truist Bank.
“This agreement underscores First Solar’s bankability and is underpinned by the strong fundamentals that drive our business today,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We are focused on exiting this decade in a stronger position than we entered it and liquidity is a crucial differentiator that we intend to maintain. This revolving credit facility provides us the financial headroom and flexibility we need, while also balancing our ability to grow in response to demand for our technology.”
First Solar has seen a period of what the company calls “unprecedented growth,” which will add 8 GW of new production capacity between the second half of 2023 and 2026, when it expects to have a global manufacturing footprint of over 20 GW.
The company disclosed booking more than 12 GW of new orders in its fiscal year 2022, with 4.8 GW since Q422 alone at an average selling price of 32 cents per watt, according to its full year 2022 report.
First Solar is scheduled to commission a new 3.4 GW manufacturing facility in India in the second half of the year while expecting to add a new 3.5 GW factory in Alabama in late 2024 and expanding its existing footprint in Ohio by 900 MW by 2026.
The company is also investing up to $370 million in constructing a new research and development center in Perrysburg, Ohio, which is expected to be commissioned in 2024.
Financial terms
With the revolving debt facility, First Solar will increase its total debt profile to $1.252 billion outstanding leverage.  Based on a market consensus that the company should generate more than $670 million in 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the solar panel producer will have a 1.87 times net leverage profile (debt to EBITDA), based on the market expectation that the company generates at least $500 million in EBITDA in the second half of 2023.
The new five-year credit agreement includes financial covenants mandating the company to not exceed a net leverage ratio of 3.5x and maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3x.
Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate based on the current secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) of 5.06%, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.25% based on its current net leverage ratio, putting the debt facility’s pricing at about 6.9% to 7.4% per year, SEC filings show.
Guidance
Based in Tempe, Arizona, First Solar is a U.S.-domiciled manufacturer of solar modules, and services the utility solar market. As of December 31, 2022, the company had $2.6 billion in cash and available term debt borrowings, compared to $1.8 billion in liquidity in 2021.
The company reiterated prior guidance given in late 2022 during its April 27 full year report. The domestic solar manufacturer expects 2023 net sales in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, with sales volume of 11.6 GW to 12.3 GW for the year.
