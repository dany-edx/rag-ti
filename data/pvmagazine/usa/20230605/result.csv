A SpaceX Dragon spacecraft propelled by a Falcon 9 rocket will bring several measurement instruments as well as two roll-out solar arrays. The arrays, International Space Station Roll Out Solar Arrays (IROSA) will deliver additional energy capacity to the microgravity complex. Live coverage of arrival will begin at 4:15 a.m., EST, Tuesday, June 6, on NASA Television, the agency’s website, and the NASA app.
As of 2021, the International Space Station had 250 kW of IROSA capacity, and the two new arrays may add up to 60 kW of capacity.
These arrays are a compact design, more affordable, and offer autonomous capabilities that can enhance a wide spectrum of scientific and commercial missions, from low-Earth orbit all the way to interplanetary travel.
ROSA is a technology of Redwire Space, originally developed by Deployable Space Systems (DSS) with support from NASA. Since 2009, NASA has funded parts of DSS’s journey, from conceptualizing ROSA to its development, culminating in successful technology demonstrations, operational mission use, and other cutting-edge potential applications. DSS was acquired by Redwire in 2021, continuing ROSA’s infusion into both NASA and commercial missions.
“You come up with a simple concept, but to get that to space, riding along that controlled explosion is what drives your design,” said Ken Steele, vice president, business development, Redwire.
The Sun is the largest power source in space, producing more power per second than humanity has consumed in the past 70 years, said NASA. Most spacecraft use solar panels to harness the Sun’s continuous energy and provide power for various needs such as thermal and payload operations.
However, solar panel designs are built around two key factors: size and reliability, which have been difficult to optimize. Size of the panels affects the cost of launch, while long-term reliability is needed to withstand the harsh environment of space, including temperature swings, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts.
Since standard solar panel designs yield modules that are rigid, large, heavy, and complex to operate, NASA recognized how ROSA could improve solar panel design for launching into orbit and beyond.
 
Included in the NASA/SpaceX cargo shipment are thunderstorm-studying devices and a system that tests the viability of plant seeds produced in space and returned to Earth. The results could provide insight into how to grow multiple generations of plants to provide food and other services on future space missions, said NASA.
The cargo mission will also send devices to study the effects of space on telomeres, genetic materials that protect human chromosomes. While telomeres shorten with age and wear, scientists have studied telomeres lengthen in space. Other devices in the 7,000-pound cargo shipment include measurement tools to monitor glacial melting and cosmic radiation weathering.
Recently, researchers from Caltech successfully beamed energy back to Earth from solar arrays in space. The pilot project deployed a constellation of modular spacecraft equipped with PV to collect sunlight, convert it to electricity, and then wirelessly transmit the electricity over long distances wherever it is needed. Caltech said the technology could be useful to remote areas that do not have supportive transmission infrastructure.

It is based on the Austrian company’s autonomous operations center (AOC), an AI-powered SaaS platform. According to the company, this allows the operation of photovoltaic systems to be completely automated. According to Raicoon, the platform detects all measurable errors and eliminates false alarms.
The performance guarantee promise is also backed by Munich Re. According to Raicoon, it is the first solution in the industry with a 100% error detection guarantee without false alarms for existing photovoltaic systems, says CEO Ralf Tschanun. Should the platform trigger a false alarm, Raicoon will compensate 100% for the damage. Munich Re’s insurance product compensates Raicoon for the liabilities to customers resulting from this guarantee. Raicoon reports that it enables photovoltaic system operators could thus invest in the AI-supported technology without risk.
Raicoon and Munich Re expect the new performance guarantee to accelerate the energy transition as a result of the increase in efficiency and profitability. The company has begun pilot programs in the U.S.

The RFP calls for seven distributed resource projects, including rooftop solar, solar parking canopies, or floating PV projects, and can also include battery energy storage, electric vehicle charging, and wind turbines. The total portfolio capacity is for a minimum of 2.65 MW.
Proposals are due June 21, with project completion dates requested by December 31, 2025.
The projects supporting the Port Authority’s goals of a 35% reduction in direct emissions by 2025, a 50% reduction by 2030, and net zero for all emissions by 2050.
One of the project sites is requested to be a community distributed generation (CDG) or remote crediting (RC) system, for which the Port Authority is seeking competitive bids for a Host Site Agreement. If proposing a CDG system, the selected proposer will be required to act as Project Sponsor, and perform all aspects of ongoing system management, including but not limited to subscriber management and credit allocation.
The remaining project sites may be developed behind Port Authority-owned and -operated substations, pursuant to terms and conditions substantially in the form of a power purchase agreement (PPA). NYPA seeks PPAs with 25-year terms but will also review pricing for 15 year and 35 year terms.
NYPA is also requesting pricing under an up-front purchase option, to be provided as a lump sum and in the form of dollars per kilowatt of direct current capacity ($/kW-DC). Under the purchase option, proposers will also be required to provide pricing for operations and maintenance services, which must be in the form of dollars per kilowatt of direct current capacity per year.
Proposers must demonstrate past success in the development, design, installation, operation and maintenance of distributed energy resources on a similar scale and installation scope. NYPA said it will use “best value” evaluation criteria to select the project.
Full requirements for proposals can be found on the New York State Power Authority procurement website under the “Utilities & Green Energies” section.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/05/blm-to-hold-public-meetings-for-300-mw-bonanza-solar-facility/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEVADA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 5, 2023",BLM to hold public meetings for 300 MW Bonanza Solar facility,"The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) unveiled a public review process on the Bonanza Solar Project, a proposed 300 MW (AC) utility-scale solar and battery storage project sited in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada.
A 45-day public scoping period ends on July 20, 2023 for the project being developed by EDF Renewables North America. During the scoping period, there will be a combination of virtual and in-person public workshops:
Each workshop will start with a presentation followed by public comment and question and answer sessions in an open house format.
In August 2021, EDF Renewables began the permitting process for the vast 5,133 acre Bonanza Solar project, located on BLM public land about 45 miles northwest of Las Vegas and capable of producing 928 GWh per year of clean power. Additional oversight and input on the project is managed by the Nevada Renewable Energy Coordination Office in Reno, Nev., and the Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, respectively.
Bonanza Solar’s environmental review and permitting process is expected to conclude by January 2026, with a right-of-way authorization by December 2025 and environmental impact statement (EIS) to be issued by Q3 2025, according to the federal infrastructure projects permitting database.
Additional project proposals for the utility-scale solar-plus-storage project include building a main access road, a 5.5 mile 230 kV power generation tie-in line, an on-site power sub-station, operations and maintenance building, fencing and telecommunications tower.
EDF’s preliminary plan of development calls for the construction of the solar project with crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe), or Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) solar panels up to 660 watts per module. Panels will be installed using single-axis tracking systems interconnect using 5 MW inverter stations.
The project has proposed a 300 MW or up to 1.2 GWh battery storage facility located adjacent to the 220 kV on-site substation, with the battery facility requiring a separate 35 acres of its own.
A key driver to the utility solar-plus-storage project is its strategic location to interconnect with utility NV Energy’s 350-mile high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line, Greenlink West. The 525 kV transmission line, whose schedule in-service date is December 2026, is being built to connect the local grids of Reno and North Las Vegas with 4 gigawatts or more of clean power from abundant Nevada desert solar facilities.
According to its website, EDF Renewables has developed 709 MW generating capacity solar projects and about 1.38 GWh of energy storage projects in Nevada.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/05/caltech-researchers-beam-solar-from-space/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 5, 2023",Caltech researchers beam solar from space,"Space-based solar power has been studied for decades because, theoretically, it could tap into a virtually unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space. Caltech researchers estimate that solar from space could yield eight times more power than solar panels at any location on Earth’s surface, and in January the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPD) launched into orbit a prototype to beam power to Earth.
The SSPD deployed a constellation of modular spacecraft equipped with PV to collect sunlight, convert it to electricity, and then wirelessly transmit the electricity over long distances wherever it is needed. Caltech said the technology could be useful to remote areas that do not have supportive transmission infrastructure.
Wireless power transfer was demonstrated by Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment (MAPLE), developed at Caltech. It is one of three key technologies being tested by the Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD-1), the first space-borne prototype from Caltech’s SSPP.
MAPLE includes lightweight microwave power transmitters driven by custom electronic chips that were built using low-cost silicon technologies. It uses the array of transmitters to beam the energy to desired locations.
“Through the experiments we have run so far, we received confirmation that MAPLE can transmit power successfully to receivers in space,” said Ali Hajimiri, Bren Professor of electrical engineering and medical engineering and co-director of SSPP. “We have also been able to program the array to direct its energy toward Earth, which we detected here at Caltech. We had, of course, tested it on Earth, but now we know that it can survive the trip to space and operate there.”
Beaming solar from space has been studied by groups around the world for decades. Like any futuristic technology, it has its naysayers. In this case, some worry that the high energy beam will fry anything in its path or cause destruction when it fails to hit its target.
In the Caltech project, there is a transceiver array that beams the energy and two separate receiver arrays to receive it.
The signal appeared at the expected time and frequency, detected by the receiver located on the roof of the Gordon and Betty Moore Laboratory of Engineering on Caltech’s campus in Pasadena. The signal also had the right frequency shift as predicted based on its travel from orbit.
To be sure that the energy reaches its intended destination, the transmitter array uses precise timing-control elements to dynamically focus the power on the desired location using the coherent addition of electromagnetic waves.
Once the receiver arrays receive the energy, they convert it to direct current (DC) electricity, and use it to light up a pair of LEDs to demonstrate the full sequence of wireless energy transmission at a distance in space. MAPLE tested this in space by successfully lighting up each LED individually and shifting back and forth between them.
“To the best of our knowledge, no one has ever demonstrated wireless energy transfer in space even with expensive rigid structures. We are doing it with flexible lightweight structures and with our own integrated circuits. This is a first,” said Hajimiri.
The next steps for the team are to assess the performance of individual elements within the system by evaluating the interference patterns of smaller groups and measuring difference between various combinations. The researchers say the process, which can take up to six months to fully complete, will allow the team to sort out irregularities and trace them back to individual units, providing insight for the next generation of the system.
“The flexible power transmission arrays are essential to the current design of Caltech’s vision for a constellation of sail-like solar panels that unfurl once they reach orbit,” said Sergio Pellegrino, Joyce and Kent Kresa professor of aerospace and civil engineering and co-director of SSPP.

The SSPP team also has to design solar power energy systems that are lightweight and flexible, according to Harry Atwater, one of the principal investigators of the project. Individual SSPP units will fold up into packages about 1 cubic meter in volume and then unfurl into flat squares about 50 meters per side, with solar cells on one side facing toward the sun and wireless power transmitters on the other side facing toward Earth.
“In the same way that the internet democratized access to information, we hope that wireless energy transfer democratizes access to energy,” said Hajimiri. “No energy transmission infrastructure will be needed on the ground to receive this power. That means we can send energy to remote regions and areas devastated by war or natural disaster.”
In addition to the support received from the Brens, Northrop Grumman Corporation also provided Caltech $12.5 million over three years through a sponsored research agreement between 2014 and 2017 that supported for the development of technology and advancement of science for the project.

The software manages and optimizes EV charging for projects that require dynamic load management and have numerous EVs on site. Apartment buildings, workplaces, and public charging locations are among some of the applications the software is designed to serve.
SolarEdge said its charging manager is built on AI-based predictive algorithms that incorporate real-time data and consider solar production, electricity price fluctuations, and tiered charging schedules. It integrates with SolarEdge’s energy management system, orchestrating interactions between the facility’s solar generation, battery energy storage, and large-scale EV charging, taking into account local infrastructure and grid conditions and limitations.
“As more companies are taking active measures to electrify their car fleets, combining solar PV and EV charging is a cost-effective and sustainable way to manage these fleets,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer, SolarEdge Technologies.
Wevo Energy, a startup focused on EV charging management software, developed the platform. SolarEdge is an investor in the company. 
“Wevo’s solution is already deployed at thousands of parking spaces globally. The combination of Wevo’s software with SolarEdge’s leading PV solution and market presence will enable the accelerated deployment of load-balanced EV charging infrastructure,” said Teddy Flatau, chief executive officer, Wevo Energy. 
The new commercial and industrial will initially launch in Germany and the UK, with plans for other major markets to follow quickly, said SolarEdge. The company will display the new technology at Intersolar Europe, June 13 and 14, booth B4, 110.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/05/southern-florida-college-to-fill-gap-for-more-certified-solar-workers/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,FLORIDA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 5, 2023",Southern Florida college to fill gap for more certified solar workers,"Across emerging solar markets including the southeast states of Florida and Georgia, developers and turnkey service providers are struggling to meet the demand of having enough qualified technicians and solar installers for rooftop solar and distributed generation projects.
St. Petersburg College (SPC) is working to fill the gap for more certified solar workers in the Tampa Bay, Florida region. The Gulf Coast college recently partnered with the University of Central Florida’s Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), the first solar energy apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor.
“SPC’s goal has been to strengthen the workforce through the use of apprenticeships, which include structured on-the-job training and related technical instruction,” said Jennifer Bodnar, apprenticeship coordinator at SPC.
Future apprentices in the Florida training program must already be employed by a solar company that is an approved member of the apprenticeship solar consortium before participating in the program. While working, apprentices will take courses, fully paid for by their employer, to prepare them for certification in the solar installation market.
Interested employers seeking to participate in the SPC program can click here to apply or receive more information, while interested applicants can click here for more information.
“I think this will be the most comprehensive program in the state. It includes curriculum that other programs don’t have, like thermal and plumbing, and it covers both commercial and residential solar,” Bodnar said.
In 2022 SPC received grant funding to help employers defray costs as part of the Expansion of Registered Apprenticeship Programs (ERAP).
“With the grant, SPC is able to offer funds to offset some of the expenses to employers, as well as explore additional funding resources,” Bodnar said. “As a state college, we have access to a wide network, to help reduce employer costs.”
“The Solar Energy Technician Apprenticeship program addresses the future needs in Florida’s workforce,” said Colleen Kettles, director of workforce and business development, FSEC. “I am very grateful that St. Petersburg College has stepped up and is working with us on the training.”
The apprenticeship requirement of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires that any U.S. taxpayer who employs four or more people must also employ at least one qualified apprentice. And, depending on when construction begins on a project, a certain journeyman to apprenticeship ratio must be met. Prevailing wage requirements states that the taxpayer (developer) must pay any laborer, mechanic, contractor or subcontractor at the prevailing rates for the location in which the construction takes place, as determined by the Secretary of Labor. The prevailing wage rate requirements provides correction and penalty mechanisms for a taxpayer’s failure to comply.
To meet apprenticeship requirements, developers must ensure that for construction beginning this year, at least 10% of labor is performed by qualified apprentices. This steps up to 12.5% for construction that began after December 31, 2022, and before January 1, 2024. And then bumps up again to 15% for construction that begins after December 31, 2023.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), with 11,761 workers, Florida’s solar market employed the second highest amount of workers of any U.S. state after California’s 75,712 solar workers, as of data through December 31, 2022.

Brisbane-based battery maker Redflow will build a 20 MWh zinc-based battery energy storage system as part of a large-scale solar and storage project planned for northern California after securing AUD 18 million ($12 million) in funding from the California Energy Commission.
The 20 MWh battery energy storage system will be paired with a 5 MW solar installation as part of a $50 million renewable energy microgrid which will provide power for the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians in northern California.
Redflow said it will supply, supervise installation and assist with the commissioning and maintenance of 2,000 of its 10 kWh 48 V ZBM3 batteries in modular energy pods. Shipping of the 200 kWh pods, to be manufactured in Redflow’s factory in Thailand, is expected to begin later this year with practical completion and commissioning of the system expected in 2025.
Redflow Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Tim Harris said the 20 MWh system is the company’s largest single sale and deployment of batteries to date and is an important step in the execution of the company’s plans to expand into the U.S. market.
“This 20 MWh project is one of several large-scale opportunities in our pipeline and represents the start of the next phase of our growth strategy, validating our focus on large-scale systems in the U.S. and Australia,” he said. “The market for long-duration energy storage solutions is rapidly accelerating and this project will firmly establish Redflow’s presence in California, which is leading the development and support of non-lithium technologies to achieve its net-zero goals.”
California, which is targeting more than 400% growth in clean energy in the next two decades, is expected to require 45 GW to 55 GW of long-duration energy storage by 2045 to support grid stability and the state’s clean energy transition targets.
Harris said the new microgrid project follows on from the 2 MWh system that Redflow installed in California for biowaste tech company Anaergia in 2022 that has been successfully operating for more than a year.
Harris said Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow technology is capable of providing up to 12 hours of flexible energy capacity for both commercial and utility-scale energy storage applications.
“For this project, Redflow’s battery system is designed to charge from solar and discharge throughout the remainder of the day, reducing grid demand and boosting the energy security of the Paskenta Rancheria,” he said.
The project will be funded by the California Energy Commission’s long-duration energy storage grant program which is supporting the development of non-lithium technologies to help the state government achieve its net-zero goals.
Faraday Microgrids, a California developer and contractor that has deployed a number of California Energy Commission grant-funded microgrid projects, is the grant recipient and project lead, and will purchase the battery system from Redflow.
Faraday Microgrids CEO David Bliss said the “resiliency, operational performance, and safety” of Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow battery technology will play a key role in providing greater “energy sovereignty” for both California and the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians.
“Redflow’s strength of team, innovative approach to flow technology, and a strong track record of successful deployments is a welcome addition to our microgrid portfolio,” he said.
Faraday expects the definitive supply agreement will be formalised and a notice to commence issued to Redflow around the end of July 2023.

The project will include 15.5 MW of solar, 11.6 MWh of storage, and fossil generation in an amount that has not been finalized, FEMA said. The project will retrofit the islands’ existing 9 MW of generation that includes diesel generators, FEMA added.
The “solar backup systems” on the two islands, FEMA said, will enable medical facilities, schools and other critical service providers to function “in case the main grid fails.” The islands are located to the east of Puerto Rico’s main island.
The microgrid project is one of 21 projects across the U.S. territory that will “provide energy resilience and promote the use of renewable energy,” said Manuel Laboy Rivera, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resiliency.
Priorities
FEMA said it has allocated $32 billion to help Puerto Rico rebuild after Hurricane Maria. Regarding the total solar and storage capacity across all FEMA-initiated projects in Puerto Rico, a spokesperson said that so far FEMA has reviewed projects under a $3 billion funding program that would include “over 10 MW” of solar capacity and “over 12MWh” of storage capacity. Those amounts include the solar and storage planned for the Vieques and Culebra microgrids.
Eight Puerto Rico organizations and the Center for Biological Diversity have filed a federal lawsuit challenging FEMA’s approval of $13 billion for the Puerto Rico utility PREPA to rebuild the territory’s grid “back to the fossil fuel status quo.” The lawsuit aims to redirect that funding, of which it says only a “small fraction” has been spent, toward “the distributed renewable energy Puerto Ricans need.”
Howard Crystal, legal director and senior attorney for the Center, said that FEMA’s “formal response” to the lawsuit is due in the next few weeks. The Center has also filed a Freedom of Information Act request backed up by a lawsuit to compel FEMA to disclose its funding for renewable and fossil generation.
Project stages
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) assisted in the preliminary design for the microgrid project for Vieques and Culebra through the use of the Microgrid Design Toolkit developed by Sandia National Laboratory, and workshops with community leaders.
The initial $10.2 million phase of the microgrid project will fund preconstruction activities, including architectural and engineering design services, a geotechnical study and an electrical load assessment.
The $86 million construction phase will include land acquisition, bidding and procurement, permitting, final design plans, environmental and historic preservation compliance, equipment, site work, construction, final testing and commissioning, project supervision, inspection, contingencies, and closeout.
The microgrids on the two islands will serve Vieques’ 8,000 residents and Culebra’s nearly 2,000 residents. The microgrids will connect to Puerto Rico’s existing transmission system with a submarine cable. The project is being funded by FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
