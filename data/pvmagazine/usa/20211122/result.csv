Florida’s net metering program was established in 2008 under Florida Administrative Code Rule 25-6.065. Within that rule, residential and commercial customers with systems less than 2 MW in capacity are eligible to sell their excess generation back to the utility at the full retail electrical rate on their monthly bill. To calculate a customer’s annual excess generation credit, compensation is based on the avoided cost to the utility for the power it would otherwise have had to generate. This calculation can vary from utility to utility, depending on their methodology.
The guidelines apply to customers of investor-owned utilities, like Florida Power and Light (FPL). Municipal utilities and electric cooperatives are able to set their own credit rates for net metering.
Bradley’s bill would change the existing net metering structure from one that promotes the development of renewable energy resources in this state, to one that  purports to “continue” development “in a manner that is fair and equitable to all public utility customers.”
The basis for the change to the code relies on the cost-shift argument. As Andrew Sendy, CEO of SolarReviews.com explained in an op-ed for pv magazine USA, “Solar consumers produce their own solar power on-site, meaning that they are not using their distribution and transmission systems (aka “the grid”). Therefore, the argument goes, they [net metering customers] are not paying their fair share of upkeep of the grid. And since they aren’t paying for it, someone else obviously has to—and so they claim those costs shift to non-solar customers.”
The language of SB 1024 echoes that rhetoric, claiming that, “The substantial growth of customer-owned and -leased renewable generation has resulted in increased cross-subsidization of the full cost of electric service onto the public utility’s general body of ratepayers.”
Sixteen state-level studies, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, have disproven the cost-shift argument, as has a national study, completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
Berkeley found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar, and that the cost picture remains this way until solar penetration meets 10% of a state’s generation portfolio.
SB 1024 calls on the Florida Public Service Commission to set up a successor net metering program by January 1, 2023. The new program is required to:
The bill would also allow utilities to add in base facilities charges, electric grid access fees, monthly minimum bills, or other fixed charges to customers’ bills in order to ensure the utility recovers their cost of serving net metering customers.
Additionally, if the bill were to pass, existing net metering customers who had their system operational before Jan. 1, 2023 would be grandfathered in to their previous compensation rate for 10 more years.
In response to the bill’s introduction, Justin Vandenbroeck, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association that, while the organization is still analyzing the full impact of the legislation, “Initial modeling suggests this legislation has the potential to set the rooftop solar industry back nearly a decade.  Erasing the thousands of jobs, consumer choice and savings, along with the resiliency benefits that rooftop solar offers to Floridians.”
Over the summer, Green Cove Springs, Florida, passed an ordinance to halve the net metering rate. The city buys its power from a municipal power agency, rather than an investor-owned utility, so the town board was able to pass the ordinance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/22/as-maxeon-waits-on-potential-u-s-based-solar-cell-fab-it-launches-air-panels-in-europe/,"INTERVIEW,UNITED STATES,WESTERN EUROPE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 22, 2021","As Maxeon waits on potential U.S.-based solar cell fab, it launches Air panels in Europe","Maxeon, the international spin-off of SunPower, said it plans to launch its Air series of panels in Europe. The company’s chief revenue officer Mark Babcock recently spoke with pv magazine to talk about the Air series as well as Maxeon’s vision for U.S. manufacturing.
Among the company’s production line are two classes of solar PV modules, the Performance series, shingled bifacial panels with applications in utility scale and large commercial projects, and a line of interdigitated back contact (IBC) panels, of which Maxeon Air is just one.
The Air series, to launch in Europe, is a pencil-thin IBC module that lessens weight load on roofs.
The company selected Europe to launch the panel given the number of low-load commercial and industrial roofs on older buildings throughout the region, said Babcock.
The adhesive back-contact eliminates the need for racking and other balance-of-system (BOS) components to be placed on the roof. This opens the door for many roofs that would otherwise lack proper structural support to adopt PV, as the panels have a load of 6 kg per square meter.
Babcock said that unlike most panels, the module can bend and crack without experiencing significant degradation and without creating hotspots, allowing for more flexible applications. Babcock said he sees possibility in integrating the IBC panels in transportation and off-grid solutions, but, for now anyway, the focus will be on commercial rooftops.

Babcock said that thermal runaway and hotspots are curbed through the modules’ ability to share load with neighboring panels. The Air panels also mitigate installation defects that cause fires, like installing wires on the sharp edges of a rack or mount.
While Maxeon has no firm plans of launching Air in the U.S. just yet, its performance series panels are already operating under the SunPower brand. The Primergy and Quinbrook Infrastructure-backed 690 MW Gemini solar and storage project of Nevada will be powered by Maxeon performance 5 and 6 series panels, which are manufactured in Malaysia, assembled in Mexico.
Babcock said future expansion into U.S. manufacturing is being explored, but plans hinge on federal policy. He said a 3 GW cell manufacturing facility in the U.S. is waiting on an Energy Polict Act of 2005-established Title XVII loan from the U.S. Department of Energy; it also may depend on the success of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. Babcock said that adoption of the bill would make U.S. expansion a more attractive prospect to Maxeon, and likely would draw in other industry players, as well.
Pending the DOE loan and the Ossoff bill, Maxeon said it may begin producing cells in the U.S. as soon as 2023.
Babcock also said that the Biden administration’s Build Back Better bill that was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives has language for direct incentives for both cell and module manufacturing. He said that the inclusion of an incentive for both would go a long way towards making the case for siting manufacturing in the U.S.
In October, Maxeon said it planned to convert its production facility in Mexicali, Mexico to manufacture shingled modules exclusively for the U.S. market.
The two facilities should reach a capacity of around 2.6 GW, Babcock told pv magazine in a separate interview during the Intersolar event in Munich, Germany. He said at the time that the facility in Ensenada was ramping up to 800 MW with the one in Mexicali planned for 1.8 GW of capacity.
Both facilities will manufacture only products based on the company’s mono PERC shingled technology.
Production should start at the two facilities late in the first quarter of 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/22/center-notches-29-80-efficiency-for-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cell/,"RESEARCH,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 22, 2021",Center notches 29.80% efficiency for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Helmholtz Center Berlin (HZB) claim to have produced a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a world record efficiency of 29.80%.
The result was certified by Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems’ (ISE) CalLab, and was included in charts maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The result improves upon the previous world record achieved by perovskite developer Oxford PV in December 2020, when the U.K.-based company announced a power conversion efficiency of 29.52% for its perovskite/silicon tandem device.
The solar cell has an area of 1cm2 and is based on a nanotextured front side and a back side with a dielectric reflector, which is used to reflect infrared light back into the silicon absorber.
The nanotexturing on one side, according to the researchers, is responsible for improving light absorption and photocurrent compared to a reference solar cell without the nanotextures. It also slightly improved the electronic quality of the tandem device and enabled better film formation of the perovskite layers.
“By using a dielectric reflector, we were able to use this part of the sunlight more efficiently, resulting in a higher photocurrent,” said HZB researcher Alexandros Cruz Bournazou. He said that the cell’s efficiency may soon exceed the 30% threshold through nanostructuring the absorber layers on both sides.
Technical details on the solar cell can be found in the paper “Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with >29% efficiency by enhanced hole extraction,” which was published in Energy in December 2020, when the same research team achieved an efficiency of 29.15%.

The projects are the 275 MW Cadence Solar Energy project, the 101 MW Juliet Energy Project, the 100 MW Marion County Solar Project, and the 117 MW Sycamore Creek Solar project.
While not the largest solar project ever proposed in Ohio (the 300 MW Birch Solar project proposed by Lightsource bp and the 300 MW Yellow Wood Solar project proposed by Invenergy both went before the board in August) the Cadence project is the largest in the state known to pv magazine to be approved for construction.
Cadence will occupy around 1,925 acres within an approximately 4,900-acre project area in York, Liberty, and Taylor townships in Union County, northwest of Columbus. The facility will be composed of LONGi solar modules or comparable Tier-1 solar panels, of which the project application also lists Jinko Solar, JA Solar, Trina Solar and First Solar modules. These modules will be mounted on single-axis trackers, and inverters will be supplied by one of TMEIC, SMA, Power Electronics, or GE.
The 101 MW Juliet Energy Project, being developed by 7X Energy, will be located on around 585 acres of a roughly 670-acre project area in Weston and Milton townships in Wood County, south of Toledo. the project will utilize tier-1 solar modules and tier-1 inverters, with the modules being mounted on single-axis tracking systems.
The 100 MW Marion County Solar Project, being developed by Savion Energy, would include a 20 MW energy storage system. The project, planned a site north of Columbus, would use tier-1 solar modules, with applicants identifying Risen, Jinko, Trina, Longi as possible providers. Inverter mounting system specifics were not disclosed.
Sycamore Creek would be a 117 MW standalone project in Crawford County, between Cleveland and Toledo. It is being developed by National Grid Renewables. Like the other projects, Sycamore Creek would use tier-1 solar modules and tier-1 inverters, with the modules mounted on single-axis tracking systems.
The previously-largest project to reach the construction phase in Ohio was the 200 MW Hillcrest Solar facility, developed by Innergex Renewable Energy. The project is on 1,350 acres in Brown County, about 45 miles east of Cincinnati.
Ohio has witnessed a solar boom, with the majority of the state’s nearly 800 MW of installed capacity coming since the start of 2020. This year has included multiple approvals for utility-scale solar projects in the state, especially for projects with a capacity of 100 MW or greater. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Ohio is projected to add 5,596 MW of solar over the next five years, 6th in the nation.

As part of the deal, Lightsource bp and bp ordered roughly 4.4 GWdc of modules, with options for an additional 1 GWdc.
Lightsource bp agreed to buy up to 4.3 GWdc of modules for its U.S. utility-scale projects. Integrated energy company bp will buy up to 1.1 GWdc to power their projects being developed by Lightsource bp. Planned deployments for both companies include projects in Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.
The framework agreements are the largest in First Solar’s history, and will provide modules for delivery between 2023 and 2025. Under the agreement, First Solar has firm orders for 1.55 GWdc of modules in 2023, 1.3 GWdc in 2024, and 1.55 GWdc in 2025.
First Solar also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to explore opportunities to source electricity from generation assets developed, owned, and operated by Lightsource bp in Ohio, where First Solar has a major manufacturing presence. First Solar committed to powering all of its global manufacturing operations with renewable energy by 2028, with an interim goal of transitioning its facilities in the U.S. to carbon-free electricity by 2026.
Earlier this year, First Solar announced that it would invest $680 million to expand its U.S.-based PV solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually, by building its third manufacturing facility in Ohio, near Toledo. The new facility is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023 and when fully operational will scale the company’s Northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GW.
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia. It also announced plans to build a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. With First Solar’s expansion in the United States and India and optimization of its existing fleet, the company anticipates that its nameplate manufacturing capacity will double to 16 GW by 2024.
