The decision was reached in Belmont Association v. Thomas Farwig. Farwig argued that his HOA had no grounds to block his rooftop solar plans, as the community rules don’t expressly prohibit it. Conversely, Belmont Community Association, argues that Mr. Farwig’s solar array can be considered an “improvement,” which is something that the group has the authority to reject, regardless of whether it is an improvement explicitly listed by HOA rules. Belmont also found that the array would “be aesthetically unpleasing as viewed from the public street.”
Belmont began charging Farwig $50 a day to keep his property out of foreclosure, which he paid. The HOA then placed a lien on his home. This is when Mr. Farwig decided to countersue, alleging that solar access laws had been violated.
After an appeals court ruled in favor of Belmont, the issue was brought to the North Carolina Supreme Court. The court ruled that HOA provisions granting broad discretionary authority to architectural review committees cannot be used to prohibit the installation of solar panels. The court also affirmed that the HOA’s architectural review committee could not limit the location of solar panels to the back of the home, in situations where installing panels in the back would prevent the reasonable use of the solar panels due to roof orientation.
During the case, the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association (NCSEA), represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, submitted a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the Farwig, as did the North Carolina Attorney General.
“The ruling issued by the North Carolina Supreme Court is a significant achievement for homeowner property rights in North Carolina, affirming access to clean, renewable power for those previously denied by their HOAs,” according to Peter Ledford, NCSEA’s General Counsel and Director of Policy. “This decision will reduce a significant barrier to the residential solar market in North Carolina, supporting jobs in the rooftop solar industry, and helping homeowners lower their utility bills and clean up the grid.” 
The decision was based on North Carolina’s 2007 solar access law, which states that HOA’s cannot ban solar explicitly or effectively, and that it can only bar front-facing solar arrays if it explicitly lists them in its community rules.
In 2021, the state’s House of Representatives passed legislation that removed the front-facing exception, and instead gave control to HOAs to dictate panel placement, as long as there isn’t more than a 10% impact on generation.
A rising issue
North Carolina is not the first state where disputes between homeowners and HOAs regarding solar installations have been taken to the state level, though the issue has typically been resolved through legislation.
In March, Indiana passed legislation, House Bill 1196, which makes it considerably more difficult for Homeowners Associations (HOA) to prohibit residents from adding solar installations to their homes.
The law states that any homeowner who is a member of a HOA that has codified rules (adopted or amended after 2019) or previously ruled that solar installations may not be installed within the community, can petition other homeowners association members for approval to install a solar energy system on the homeowner’s dwelling unit or property. Once homeowners have collected signatures from 65% of HOA residents, the HOA board of directors, an architectural review committee, or an architectural control committee of the HOA may not deny the homeowner’s request to install the solar energy system.
In August 2021, Illinois passed similar legislation to House Bill 1196. That legislation rescinded the ability of community associations to ban members from installing solar on certain areas of their homes. The associations can still determine the specific configuration of said installation, so long as that decision does not lower the system’s annual estimated generation output by more than 10%. The law also significantly cut down the amount of time that association members have to wait for a response once filing their application for approval of a system with their association.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/23/constellation-bank-of-america-agree-to-160-mw-solar-supply-deal/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 23, 2022","Constellation, Bank of America agree to 160 MW solar supply deal","Bank of America and Constellation have announced a 15-year, 160 MW power and renewable energy credit supply agreement, which is expected to cover 17% of Bank of America’s global annual energy consumption.
The electricity and applicable credits will come from a portion of Constellation’s 600 MW Mammoth Central project, the third and final phase of the broader Mammoth Solar project, which is currently being developed by Doral Renewables LLC in Starke and Pulaski counties in Indiana. In total, the Mammoth solar project, which also includes the Mammoth North, Mammoth Solar I, and Mammoth Solar II installations, will amount to 1.3 GW once the project is completed. The Mammoth Central project is expected to be completed in late 2024.
While the energy purchase covers 17% of Bank of America’s global annual electricity demand, the energy generated by the Mammoth Central project will be used to power Bank of America operations in Delaware, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Separate from the Bank of America agreement, Constellation and Doral shared that the companies have also entered into agreements with three other customers to purchase an additional 140 MW of power and project-specific renewable energy certificates. These purchases in total will cover 300 MW of the Mammoth facility’s planned 600 MW of capacity.
Constellation has become a go-to source for large corporations looking to meet their environmental and renewable energy procurement goals. On Feb. 18, popular mid-Atlantic restaurant and convenience store chain, Sheetz, announced it had entered into a long-term renewable energy supply agreement with Constellation, enough to power nearly 70% of the chain’s Pennsylvania facilities with renewable energy.
Sheetz will receive approximately 110 million kilowatt hours of energy per year from the long-term power purchase agreements for the 55 MW of Pennsylvania-based solar that Constellation is procuring, with that energy matched by Green-e Energy Certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) sourced from renewable facilities located throughout the US.
Constellation is also purchasing the electricity generated by the installations via separate power purchase agreements. All of these projects are expected to achieve commercial operation by January 2024.
Prior to that announcement, in Aug. 2021, Constellation announced it came to terms on an agreement to buy power and project-specific renewable energy certificates (RECs) equal to 140 MW from the 200 MW Big Star Solar Project, currently under development in Bastrop County, Texas, just outside of Austin. The energy and RECs will be used to fill power agreements with PepsiCo, McCormick & Co., Best Buy and two Viacom-owned TV stations. Each customer signed an equivalent long-term agreement with Constellation to receive energy and RECs from the project as part of their retail electric supply contract.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/23/senator-schumer-prioritize-sweeping-clean-energy-legislation/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 23, 2022",Senator Schumer: Prioritize sweeping clean energy legislation ,"With each passing day, the planet warms and the window for advancing urgently-needed climate legislation narrows. As the United States celebrates our independence this July, we can also establish ourselves as a world leader in the fight against the climate crisis – the ultimate act of patriotism and duty to the country.
After more than a year’s worth of missed opportunities, this summer has ushered in a make-or-break opportunity for the US Senate to pass the $555 billion climate and clean energy jobs package from the House-passed Build Back Better Act. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer must put climate at the top of the agenda and work to pass a budget reconciliation package by Independence Day, while Democrats still hold the majority.
The climate and jobs package would put the country on a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50% below peak levels by 2030, which is roughly the pace that scientists say the whole world must follow to keep the Earth from warming more than 2.7 F. Experts warn that, beyond this threshold, the threat of catastrophic climate events will grow immensely.
Passing the climate and clean energy jobs provisions of Build Back Better is our best chance to achieve the necessary reductions and avert climate disaster; we simply cannot wait any longer. If Democrats lose control of Congress following the midterm elections this fall, hope for meaningful climate action at the federal level will be quashed. Conversely, if the Senate follows the House’s lead and sends this legislation to the President’s desk, it would mark the largest-ever federal investment in clean energy and usher in a new era for our country’s energy system.
Americans want to see this action. A Pew Center poll in January found that 69% of Americans favor federal action towards carbon neutrality by 2050. The climate package would have sweeping impacts beyond reducing 5.2 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It would spur inherently deflationary clean energy projects,  help strengthen energy security and national security, create millions of jobs, improve the health of communities, and lower U.S. energy expenditures by $67 billion dollars per year, saving US households $300 per year.
The bulk of the funding – around $320 billion – would go to providing tax credits for installing residential and commercial solar power, retrofitting buildings to be more energy-efficient, and purchasing electric vehicles. These provisions alone would mark the largest climate investment in our nation’s history, setting the course to meet our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets while creating millions of good-paying jobs, reducing energy costs for consumers, advancing environmental justice, investing in climate resilient housing and community infrastructure, and strengthening our economy.
As Americans face historically high prices at the gas pump, it’s also critical that we advance our country’s energy independence and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. The Biden Administration has already demonstrated a willingness to strengthen our domestic clean energy industry by invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) to spur manufacturing of solar technology on American soil. Build Back Better would build on this momentum, doing even more to jump-start domestic manufacturing of clean energy equipment, including wind turbines and solar panels.
Key to Build Back Better is the protection and inclusion of low-income and historically disadvantaged communities. The bill would implement a tax credit for 30 percent off the costs of solar projects, plus an additional 10% to 20% tax credit for renewable energy systems located in or serving low-income communities. Crucially, the solar tax credit would be made refundable or direct pay allowing everyone, including non-taxable entities like cities, non-profit organizations, Tribes, and schools, regardless of their federal income tax bill, to access the tax credit. These provisions allow more Americans to directly reap the benefits of clean energy.
The overwhelming positive response to President Biden’s DPA announcement from the American people, energy industry, environmental advocates, corporate leaders, and stock market this past week clearly signals that the future is in clean energy. If Majority Leader Schumer can get this transformative legislation passed by the 4th of July, he will secure his place in history at this pivotal moment for the United States of America. It’s the patriotic thing to do.

The project is located in Mitchell County Georgia, and RWE is the operator/manager of the facility, selling energy and renewables certificates to utility Georgia Power through its Renewable Energy Development Initiative (REDI) program. It will sell power to the utility has part of a 30-year power purchase agreement.
“Projects like Hickory Park, With its co-located battery storage systems, will become increasingly important as renewables from a bigger part of the energy mix. This project plays an important role in expanding our operating portfolio in the US, one of our focus markets,” Silvia Ortin, CEO RWE Renewables Americas. 
The project utilized 650,000 solar panels covering 1,800 acres. It integrated a DC-coupled storage system that allows the project’s energy yield to be optimized and increases the predictability of the facility’s energy supply.
“Our largest solar project in the Americas is now benefiting the state of Georgia, including tax revenue to local counties and school districts,” said Ortin “We are pleased to develop this project and advance solar in the state of Georgia as part of Georgia Power’s REDI program.”
RWE Renewables has operations in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, with a target of 50 GW of renewable energy in operations by 2030. It is investing over $50 billion gross in pursuit of this goal this decade.
The United States accounts for over one-third of RWE’s renewables capacity and plays a key role in the company’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. The company has more than 30 projects in operation in the US, totaling an installed generation capacity of more than 5 GW.
Georgia ranks 7th nationally in the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) solar deployment ratings, with over 4.3 GW installed to date. The state holds over 4,400 solar jobs, houses 176 solar businesses, and roughly 4% of the state’s total electricity comes from solar energy.
The state currently has enough solar capacity to power over 500,000 homes. SEIA projects the state will install nearly 2 GW over the next five years, ranking it 16th in the nation over that period.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/23/republican-senators-send-letter-of-concern-to-biden-on-solar-tariff-moratorium/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 23, 2022",Republican senators send letter of concern to Biden on solar tariff moratorium,"Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced a 24-month pause on all solar goods tariffs related to the ongoing antidumping/anti-circumvention (AD/CVD) investigation into Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, which are alleged of shipping tariff-dodging Chinese products.
About 80% of the US supply of crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from the four countries. AD/CVD tariffs can be as high as 50-250%, a level of risk and uncertainty that was too much for the US solar industry to bear. Many projects were cancelled and delayed as a result. After the investigation was announced, it essentially halted utility-scale solar buildout, and the Solar Energy Industries Association cut its deployment forecast for the year by 46%.
The move by the Biden Admin paved the way for supply contracts to get signed, prices to get better estimates, and factories and shipments from the four nations under investigation to get back on track. Concurrent with the two-year pause was a series of executive actions by the White House to boost US solar manufacturing, including invoking the Defense Production Act and giving US solar goods “super preference” status in federal procurement.
“Most people feel this was a positive move and very helpful to managing some of the challenges on the table right now,” Paul Wormser, vice president of technology with Clean Energy Associates told pv magazine.
However, nine Republican senators disagree with this sentiment generally shared by the US solar industry, as they recently sent a letter of concern to President Biden about the effects of this pause on tariffs. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) led the effort. He resides in Ohio, the location of First Solar’s new $680 million, 3.33 GW US solar module manufacturing plant. First Solar was among the loudest voices in the industry’s minority opposition to the moratorium.
Portman was joined by senators Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Mike Braun (R-IN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) in singing the letter to Biden.
“Already the United States is over-reliant on China for solar power. Currently, 80 percent of our solar panels come from China or Chinese companies, and this reliance is not market-based. China has used a variety of anti-free market practices, such as industrial subsidies, to come to dominate the solar sector,” read the letter.
“We cannot afford to trade dependence on Russian energy for that of Chinese solar panels. It is counter to the national interest to rely on our adversaries for our energy needs,” it continued.
The letter continued that the Department of Commerce’s investigation is a quasi-judicial process and that the pause is “disfiguring” the legal process as a result of political pressure and climate activism. The investigative process was launched when Auxin Solar, a California-based US solar module maker with a very small manufacturing capacity filed a petition.
The senators wrote that the use of an emergency declaration to enact the moratorium was an overreach. They argue that “food, clothing, and medical, surgical, and other supplies for use in emergency relief work,” are the only means for emergency declaration, and that the emergency declaration “translates those words into the language of climate catastrophe.”
The US Department of Agriculture said climate change is likely to diminish continued progress on global food security through production disruptions that lead to local availability limitations and price increases, interrupted transport conduits, and diminished food safety, among other causes. A recent report by Deloitte said the US could stand to lose $3 trillion if there is inaction on decarbonizing our economy. The report said over the next 50 years, nearly 900,000 jobs could disappear each year due to climate damage.
Despite this, the coalition of senators “are disappointed that the climate change agenda has proven to be an effective means to pre-empt and nullify the legitimate claims of U.S. workers and industry before they can be fully considered through the ongoing investigation by your Department of Commerce.”

The deal was booked prior to the release of First Solar’s Q1 2022 earnings in April and also prior to the Biden administration’s announcement on the two-year tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, while also invoking the Defense Production Act as a means to accelerate American manufacturing.
Last August, First Solar broke ground on its third manufacturing facility in Ohio. The new 3.3 GW facility is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2023 and represents a $680 million investment. When it is fully operational, the facility is expected to scale the company’s northwestern Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GW, which would make it the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complex outside of China. First Solar has invested over $2 billion in its US manufacturing footprint and, when its third factory is fully operational, will directly employ over 2,500 people in Ohio, while supporting an estimated 15,000 indirect jobs through its American supply chain.
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023.
A Minneapolis-based business, National Grid Renewables has a portfolio of solar, wind, and energy storage projects located throughout the United States in various stages of development, construction, and operation. In the past National Grid Renewables and First Solar have partnered on multiple projects, including the recently operational 200 MW Prairie Wolf Solar Project in Illinois and the currently under construction 275 MW Noble Solar and 125 MWh Storage Project in Texas.
“National Grid Renewables and First Solar share more than just deep roots in the US Midwest and a longstanding strategic partnership. We share a common view on the need to create a sustainable energy future,” said Nathan Franzen, vice president, Development for National Grid Renewables. “We’re pleased to be working with First Solar as we continue on our mission to deploy clean, economically beneficial and community-focused solar energy projects, powered by responsibly produced American solar technology.”
First Solar recently announced other large orders from solar developers including a 4 GW order from Silicon Ranch, a 1.5 GW order from SoftBank subsidiary SB Energy Global, and a commitment from Lightsource bp and bp to procure 5.4 GW, and more.
