The Austin, Texas-based firm said that during the power crisis:
In reporting on the timing of events, the firm said that natural gas power generation suddenly dropped early Monday morning by 10 GW after having tripled capacity to more than 35 GW during the previous seven days.
Coal-fired generation also deteriorated through Monday morning, and nuclear suddenly lost around 1 GW of generation around 7 a.m. Central time.
The firm characterized wind generation as having been “slow” over the Valentine’s Day weekend. Wind production continued to “get worse” through Monday and Tuesday, ending up down around 8 GW compared with the prior week.
It said that in a hypothetical scenario, the ERCOT shortfall could have been met had natural gas, coal, and nuclear all been operating at summer peak levels (+9 GW) and if wind were operating at its typical February rate (+8 GW).
Here are the three graphs as released by Lium:

That’s right: opt out.
The pilot was developed by Joule Community Power and is similar to a traditional community solar pilot, but with that one twist. As designed, the municipality signs up the entire population, leveraging the collective buying power at a scale large enough to secure better terms through a single competitive bidding process with solar providers.
Unlike a traditional opt-in program, homeowners are automatically enrolled in the program, with any credits or charges accounted for in their monthly National Grid electricity bill.
What’s more, under this pilot program homeowners who want to take part do not have to undergo a soft credit check, sign a contract with a community distributed generation, or pay separately for the solar credits.
The opt-out community solar program will initially be rolled out to 3,800+ households; those households will be a part of the program for at least 25 years.
Residents are free to opt out at any time and for any reason, with no penalty. Once out, however, they lose the guaranteed 10% price reduction offered through the community solar program.
“Implementing community choice aggregation has been a goal that the Village of Lima has been working on for four years,” stated Lima Mayor John Wadach. “Thanks to the support and expertise of Joule and its local partner Roctricity, we are excited to bring renewable energy at a cost savings to our residents.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/17/u-s-poised-to-lead-utility-scale-energy-storage-market-in-record-year/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 17, 2021",U.S. poised to lead utility-scale energy storage market in record year,"The global utility-scale energy storage market is on track for a record year in 2021, with the U.S. continuing to lead the way.
According to a new report from IHS Markit, global utility-scale energy storage installations are set to exceed 10 GW for the first time this year. That’s more than double the 4.5 GW installed in 2020.
Notably, the report does not include smaller commercial or residential energy storage installations, which have also experienced a rise amid distributed solar adoption.
Speaking about the utility-scale report, George Hilton, senior analyst of clean technology at IHS Markit, explained, “The energy storage industry will begin significant multiyear growth in 2021, continuing until 2030, as the technology begins to form a core component of power grids in developed markets and new opportunities in developing markets continue to emerge.”
The report said the U.S. will account for 50% of the global utility-scale energy storage market this year, following a threefold increase from 2020 as storage begins to provide power during times of peak demand at a significantly wider scale.
IHS Markit added it expects the U.S. to continue to extend its dominance of the global market, gaining market share until 2023 when the project pipeline is slated to shrink.
However, the report noted aggressive decarbonization plans in mainland China will lead to rapid growth in the region starting in 2025, driving the Asia-Pacific to account for 44% of global annual installations by 2030.
In Europe, a 70% increase in annual installations will be realized this year, as the technology will begin to be used more widely to keep the grid frequency stable and reduce the intermittency of renewable energy.
“The global market for energy storage is maturing rapidly,” said Hilton. “The number of countries where annual installations exceed 100 MW will increase from nine in 2020 to 17 in 2022. The three biggest contributors to this growth will be the United States, mainland China, and Australia, which are together forecast to supply 4.5 GW of capacity in 2021.”
The report said solar-plus-storage installations are emerging as a major growth factor for the overall market.
Solar-plus-storage installations are capitalizing on recent policy changes in the U.S. such as the extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), meaning that energy storage projects co-located with solar will continue to benefit from a reduced tax burden through to 2025.
According to the report, 1.3 GW of tenders have been announced or awarded globally for utility-scale storage co-located with solar PV in the past six months.
Combined with the impact of the U.S. ITC, IHS Markit said it predicts that 3.8 GW of utility-scale solar-plus-storage will be completed this year. That’s a big leap compared to 0.9 GW in 2020. Of the expected 3.8 GW, 2.5 GW will be in the U.S.

Outside of project acquisitions in Florida, the company also gave updates on its ongoing projects in the Sunshine State, with a specific focus on projects that will either begin their construction or reach commercial operation in 2021.
Since the beginning of 2021, Duke Energy Florida has broken ground on two projects that the utility expects will go online by the end of the year: the 74.5 MW Duette Solar Power Plant and the 74.9 MW Charlie Creek Solar Power Plant.
The Duette Solar Power Plant is set to be located on 520 acres in Manatee County and will consist of 227,000 single-axis tracking solar panels, while the Charlie Creek Solar Power Plant will sit on 610 acres in Hardee County and consist of approximately 235,000 single-axis tracking solar panels.
Other projects set to be completed within the first half of the year are the Twin Rivers Solar Power Plant, a 74.9 MW facility located on 460 acres in Hamilton County, and the Santa Fe Solar Power Plant, a 74.9 MW plant located on approximately 600 acres in Columbia County. 
And while it won’t be completed until spring 2022, Duke is also breaking ground on a 74.9 MW installation located on 625 acres in Bay County, the Sandy Creek Solar Power Plant. 
According to Duke, each solar project creates approximately 200 to 300 temporary jobs during construction.
Duke Energy has signed power purchase agreements with 11 solar projects under the company’s CPRE program, during the most recent round of competitive bidding for new solar construction in the Carolinas.
In total, the 11 projects come out to 664 MW of new capacity. Ten of the projects, totaling 589 MW, will sell power to Duke Energy Carolinas, while a single 75 MW project will sell power to Duke Energy Progress. The utilities will own none of the projects.
More specifically, this is what the new capacity will look like:
According to figures from the independent administrator’s report of the competitive bidding process, the 11 projects represent $680 million to $990 million in solar construction over the next few years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/17/probes-launched-as-texas-works-to-get-the-lights-back-on/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,POLICY,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 17, 2021",Probes launched as Texas works to get the lights back on,"Even as Texas struggled to restore electric power service to millions of customers, state and federal officials said they plan to open inquiries into how the days-long energy crisis occurred and how it can be prevented from happening again.
They may want to start by turning back the calendar to February 2011.
That was when a similar winter storm froze natural gas pipelines and power plants alike, leading to service disruptions all across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid, which covers 90% of the Lone Star State.
“The large number of generating units that failed to start, tripped offline, or had to be derated during the February event demonstrates that the generators did not adequately anticipate the full impact of the extended cold weather and high winds.” That assessment from the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) came not this week, but in a report published after the 2011 events that disrupted service in ERCOT. The report said that “more thorough preparation for cold weather could have prevented many of the weather-related outages.”
NERC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) both presumably will have a chance to review their decade-old recommendations. The two announced plans Feb. 16 to open a joint inquiry into service disruptions that hit wide swaths of the U.S., including the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a press release that called for reforming ERCOT and making the task an emergency item this legislative session. He called on the legislature to investigate ERCOT and ensure that the state does not experience power outages on the scale that occurred beginning Feb. 14.
“The Electric Reliability Council of Texas has been anything but reliable over the past 48 hours,” Abbott said in a statement.
A winter storm packed with moisture and cold temperatures reportedly led on Feb. 14 to frozen wind turbines in West Texas and limited natural gas supplies to power plants. A significant number of additional fossil and nuclear generating units tripped offline as weather worsened later that night.
By Monday, Feb. 15, ERCOT reported that around 34,000 MW of generation was offline, including renewables, fossil generation, and nuclear power plants. ERCOT went into the season with a total winter generating capacity of around 85,000 MW. Demand was forecast to reach around 74,000 MW on Monday, but fell through the day to around 45,000 MW.
Record demand for power was met by ERCOT-mandated load shedding as supply and demand curves narrowed. Reserve margins at one point on Feb. 15 were around 1,000 MW. By around 7:30 a.m. Central time on Feb. 16, operating reserves stood at 1,480 MW. On Feb. 17, at 9:00 a.m. reserves were below 2,000 MW and demand was less than 44,000 MW.
To many Texans, this week’s events may have seemed like a real-life version of the movie “Groundhog Day.” That’s because the state’s energy grid was hit by another winter storm that disrupted power supplies in 2011.
In its post-event report back then, NERC wrote that while the probability of a winter event in the predominantly summer peaking Southwest “appears to be low,” shedding load in the winter “places lives and property at risk.” It recommended that all entities responsible for the reliability of the bulk power system in the Southwest “prepare for the winter season with the same sense of urgency and priority as they prepare for the summer peak season.”
The 2011 NERC report raised a number of issues that focused primarily on fossil-fueled power generators. For example, it determined that some generators were better prepared than others to respond to the cold weather event. It said that in many cases the entities that performed well had emergency operations or winterization plans in place to help keep their units operating. It said that although a winterization plan does not guarantee that a unit will not fail due to cold weather conditions, “it can reduce the likelihood of unit trips, derates, and failed starts.”
The report also said that all new generating plants and modifications to existing plants should take into account the lowest recorded ambient temperature for the nearest city for which historical weather data is available, factoring in accelerated heat loss due to wind speed.
It said that “the ideal time to prepare a generating unit to withstand cold temperatures is in the design stage.” As a result, it recommended that the low temperatures and wind chills that can occur “during the occasional severe storm” should be incorporated in the design process.
The report also found gaps in generating units’ preparations for winter performance. These included a lack of accountability and senior management review, lack of an adequate inspection and maintenance program, and failure to perform engineering analyses to determine the correct capability needed for their protection equipment.
It recommended that each generator owner/operator should develop a winter preventative maintenance program for its freeze protection elements, as well as specify inspection and testing intervals both before and during the winter.
These decade-old recommendations, among others, may be revisited as FERC and NERC start to piece together the root causes of this week’s blackouts.

However, the figures paint a picture of a tough fourth quarter, year-on-year, compared to the final three months of the Covid-free days of yore in 2019. What is beyond argument is that the inverter maker–which describes itself as a “smart energy” business after venturing into storage tech–achieved an impressive year of revenue progress on the 2019 results despite the global travails caused by Covid-19, and despite that tough end to the year.
Solaredge, which published its fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results yesterday, shipped 1.36 GWac of inverters from October to December but nevertheless saw revenues fall to $358 million from the $418 million registered in the same period of 2019, just as the pandemic was stirring in China.
That meant gross profits in the last three months of last year came in at $110 million, from $143 million 12 months earlier just as R&D, sales and marketing and administrative expenses rose. Pre-tax profits in Q4 slumped to $24.8 million from the $61.6 million posted in October-to-December 2019, for a year-on-year fall in net income from $52.3 million to $17.7 million.
Far from capping a year of retreat, however, the close of 2020 failed to mask 12 months of revenue progress after Solaredge shipped 6.1 GWac of inverters in the period. That volume drove record annual revenues of $1.46 billion, mostly on the back of a record $1.36 billion raised from the sale of solar products, for a $300 million upside from the figure posted for 2019.
The revenue uplift was not sufficient to stave off an $18 million fall in gross profit, to $461 million, and rising R&D, sales and marketing and general administrative spending prompted a fall in pre-tax income, year on year, from $179 million to $164 million in 2020. That added up to a marginal fall in net income for last year, from $145 million in 2019 to $140 million. Not bad during a global health pandemic.
With Solaredge having freed up around $25 million in restricted bank deposits since the end of 2019, the company’s cash balance has risen from $224 million, at that point, to an $827 million warchest on December 31. The inverter maker secured more payments owed from its customers and piled up more inventory, year on year–further prudent actions during exceptional market conditions.
And the company was optimistic enough to predict a rebound in revenues from the fourth-quarter figures, with expectations of $385-405 million during the current three-month window, on the back of predicted solar income of $360-375 million.

The deal offers Sunnova access to a multi-year supply of homesites, reduced customer acquisition cost by making solar a standard feature on new homes, and an opportunity to upsell solar and battery storage services to the roughly 250,000 homes built by Lennar in the last decade.
Through LENX, a Lennar business unit, the business partners will develop and deploy home storage and community microgrid technology. LENX will maintain an equity ownership interest in Sunnova, and will provide tax equity investments to support Sunnova’s homebuilder customer pipeline.
Under terms of the agreement, LENX will receive up to 7.22 million shares of Sunnova common stock, including 3.33 million shares payable at closing and 3.89 million shares associated with two earnouts.
The first earnout of up to 2.78 million shares is tied to hitting annual customer commitment goals over four years. The second earnout of up to 1.11 million shares is tied to developing microgrid communities over the next five years.
.
The acquisition is expected to be completed during the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
WEC Energy Group proposed plans for a 310 MW solar and battery storage project in Wisconsin. If approved, the Paris Solar-Battery Park would be one of the largest facilities of its kind in Wisconsin. It would include 200 MW of solar generation and 110 MW of battery storage.
The company filed its battery and solar storage proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. If approved, WEC Energy Group utilities We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service would own 90% of the project. Madison Gas and Electric would own the other 10%.
The project is being developed by Chicago-based Invenergy. Construction could begin in 2022 and enter service in 2023. In December, Invenergy LLC received regulatory approval to build the project.
Fluence said that its artificial intelligence-based trading platform was selected to provide optimization and market bidding services for Pacific Gas and Electric Co’s 182.5 MW, 730 MWh battery energy storage system in Moss Landing, California.
Using artificial intelligence, price forecasting, portfolio optimization, and market bidding algorithms, the software is intended to ensure the system is responding optimally to market and reliability needs in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) wholesale market.
The software provides PG&E with a tool that can optimize not only the Moss Landing project, but potentially larger portfolios of generation and storage resources.
The Fluence Digital team was formerly known as AMS, and was acquired by Fluence in 2020. The company said its trading platform can increase revenue and operational efficiency for battery-based energy storage by 40-50% and revenue for standalone renewable energy assets by more than 10%. It is currently used to optimize around 1.7 GW of wind and solar energy assets bidding into the Australian national energy market. PG&E plans to use the software at Moss Landing when the project comes online later this year.
Avangrid announced a notice of open solicitation for transmission service on the Excelsior Connect, the company’s proposal to build an underground high voltage direct current transmission line across more than 260 miles in New York state.
The proposed 1,310 MW bidirectional line would deliver energy into New York City (Zone J) and help support New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act targets.
Avangrid said it wants to partner with a developer or group of developers to submit a response to the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority (NYSERDA) Tier 4 Request for Proposals. The company said that developers should complete and submit an Expression of Interest form by March 8.
