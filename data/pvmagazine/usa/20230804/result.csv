Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Colorado found that the amount of land available to deploy renewables depends on the characteristics of the ordinances and they looked at the types of ordinances that commonly affect solar and wind deployment. The findings are published in the Nature Energy article titled “Impact of Siting Ordinances on Land Availability for Wind and Solar Development.”
“It’s important to understand the types of ordinances in effect, specifically setback ordinances, or the required distance from a specific feature like a house,” said Anthony Lopez, lead author of the paper. “Setback ordinances determine how much land is available for deployment and how much wind and solar resource we have to decarbonize our energy system.”
While land may seem perfectly suited to solar energy generation, the final decision is often steered by zoning ordinances. State and local zoning laws and ordinances guide local land use boards in assessing where a developer can site solar projects. For example, local setback ordinances vary from town to town.
In one New Hampshire town, for example, the setback ordinance of 100 feet in the residential district has sent numerous applicants back to the drawing board. In this case the unusually large setback is designed to uphold the rural character of the town, but it also has shown, in practice, to limit the placement of solar energy systems.
NREL researchers postulated that previous assessments of the amount of land available in the U.S. was greatly overestimated due to the lack of data on ordinances. The study determined that the number of local ordinances has grown appreciably in recent years. For example, they identified 1,853 local wind ordinances in effect during 2022 compared to 286 in 2018. A companion survey related to utility-scale solar identified 839 ordinances in effect in 2022, but they had no comparison data from earlier years.
“The increase in local zoning ordinances is a sign that the renewable energy industry is maturing,” Lopez said. “Ordinances can provide a structured approach to thoughtfully weave clean energy infrastructure into society and our natural environments.”
The most common type of ordinance that affects solar siting relates to setbacks from structures, roads and property lines. The researchers found that setback distances within the identified zoning ordinances vary considerably across jurisdictions. For solar, the setback is typically a fixed distance, and they found that under the strictest setback restrictions could cut solar resource by as much as 38%, compared to areas with no setback ordinances.
The study looked at the potential for solar installations under the most permissive scenario that does not account for setbacks and only excludes legally protected areas and land not suited for development. The researchers found that there is the “technical potential” for 147 TW of solar capacity. Conversely, with the strictest setbacks in place, the findings show that solar potential could decrease to 91 TW.
“It’s really important that we understand the impacts of renewable development on communities and provide information that helps them develop ordinances that balance regulation of the real impacts of renewable energy development while enabling deployment and the benefits of that deployment,” Lopez said.
According to the NREL researchers, these results indicate the importance of considering setback ordinances in energy resource assessments so that resource potential is not overstated. Because local land use and zoning rules have a strong correlation to the move to a carbon-free economy, they conclude that the ordinances should be accurately reflected in modeling and analysis.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/04/self-storage-rooftops-to-host-88-mw-in-multi-state-community-solar-partnership/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Self-storage rooftops to host 88 MW in multi-state community solar partnership,"Solar Landscape announced it started construction on the first half of 133 rooftop solar projects hosted on self-storage facilities operated by Public Storage. The solar arrays together will combine for 87.5 MW of capacity and will feed a multi-state community solar program.
Community solar involves residential and commercial customers subscribing to a portion of a solar facility’s generation in exchange for utility bill credits. This self-storage rooftop solar partnership is focused on low- to moderate-income (LMI) customer bases.
The portfolio includes 21 projects adding 13.2 MW to the Illinois Power Agency’s solar program called Illinois Shines. The projects will contribute directly to the Community-Driven Community Solar tranche within Illinois Shines. These projects will serve approximately 1,500 households.
A further 57 projects will serve nearly 2,600 homes in Maryland, many of whom are LMI residents. This is the single largest portfolio of projects submitted to the Maryland Community Solar pilot program LMI category. The projects are estimated to save the residents a collective $1 million per year on energy bills.
Another 37 projects will be submitted as community solar projects in New Jersey, one of the premier markets for community solar today. Together, the full portfolio of projects across states will cover more than 8 million square feet of Public Storage rooftops.
The projects further the storage giant’s goal of installing solar on 1,000 properties by 2025. This portfolio marks 13% progress towards that goal.
“We are providing affordable renewable energy for low- and moderate-income residents, reducing our collective carbon impact on the environment, and converting non-used rooftop area into socioeconomically productive space for our company,” said John Sambuco, president of asset management, Public Storage.
Solar Landscape employs more than 150 people and has more than 250 MW of solar projects built, with 150 MW operating and under construction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/04/sheffield-hallam-university-updates-info-on-alleged-forced-labor-in-solar-industry/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Sheffield Hallam University updates info on alleged forced labor in solar industry,"British researchers, from Sheffield Hallam University, have published a second report on the alleged utilization of forced labor in the solar industry in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), in China. The report finds falling levels of XUAR polysilicon and raw materials in the solar supply alongside a diminishing level of transparency.
The report “Over Exposed: Uyghur Region Exposure Assessment for Solar Industry Sourcing” is not a peer-review study. However, it goes into considerable detail in analyzing the complex solar supply chain. It describes the exposure to using polysilicon or silicon metal, otherwise known as metallurgical grade silicon, manufactured in the XUAR by several major Chinese solar module manufacturers, as well as non-Chinese manufacturers that have parts of their supply chain located in China.
The report finds that the share of polysilicon manufactured in the XUAR and used in solar module production has dropped from 45% in 2020 to 35% in 2022. Polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter contributed to the report. He anticipates that this share will decline to approximately 28% to 32% “in the coming years.

While the share of XUAR produced polysilicon falls, it appears to be being replaced by locations elsewhere in China, such as Inner Mongolia. The research found that polysilicon produced in interior China increased from 30% in 2020 to 50% in 2022, with the share of international markets dropping, somewhat surprisingly, from 25% to 11%.
The share of silicon metal, from which polysilicon is made, is also falling – the report notes. Although it remains high, accounts for 45% of China’s silicon metal production or 32% of global output.
“Despite the decline in the region’s share of the world’s production, the Uyghur Region’s continued dominance in the production of materials essential to the manufacture of more than 95% of solar modules represents significant exposure to state-imposed forced labor for the industry,” the report reads. It notes that the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), enacted by the U.S. government at the end of 2021, banned all imports from China’s Xinjiang region, unless it can be proven that products were not made with forced labor.
The report also claims that, although big manufacturers are seeking to resort to supply chains that are reportedly free of solar products made in XUAR, they continue to source from suppliers or sub-suppliers that continue to rely on shipments from this region.
“Some of the world’s largest module manufacturers appear to have bifurcated their supply chains in an effort to create a product line that is free of XUAR inputs,” the Sheffield researchers write. “Most companies have suggested that these supply chains are dedicated to the US market or designed with UFLPA compliance in mind. The portion of modules that is made on these dedicated supply chains does not appear to exceed 12% of any company’s production capacity.”
This bifurcation of supply chains is potentially problematic, it is argued in the new report. While providing some evidence of supply chains outside of the XUAR production sites, it is very difficult to verify – as metal silicon or polysilicon supplies can be blended.
“Bifurcation of solar module supply chains presents a significant challenge to the wide range of governments, developers, and consumers purchasing modules, as they cannot always be certain whether they are buying the tainted or untainted products.”
Alongside the accusations of forced labor, the report provides an additional motivation for buyers to source products outside of the XUAR. It notes that every polysilicon plant in the region is 100% powered by coal – due to its abundance, “resulting in a very high carbon footprint and very low price.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/04/lightweight-solar-panel-provides-solution-for-rooftop-installations/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Lightweight solar panel provides solution for rooftop installations,"From pv magazine Australia
Brisbane-headquartered UV Solar has installed a 9.135 kW solar power system atop a local church in the outer suburbs of the Australian city. The installation features Goodwe’s new lightweight Galaxy 315 W solar panels, accompanied by the Chinese manufacturer’s 10 kW SDT inverters and an electric vehicle charger.
The owners of Rock’s Church had been seeking to install a rooftop solar system at the facility to counter rising electricity bills but an assessment determined the building’s ageing roof, which had undergone repairs due to leakage issues, was not suitable to host a traditional rooftop system.
UV Solar opted instead to use GoodWe’s frameless Galaxy 315 W solar panel. The panel can be adhered to the roof surface without the need for drilling, making it suitable for installing on roofs with a low load-bearing capacity and poor waterproofing.
“We’ve been working closely with GoodWe for over four years now, and we’ve built a solid trust in the quality of their products and sales service,” a UV Power spokesman said. “Even though it is our first experience with their Galaxy Series, we found the product incredibly easy to install. We secured them to the roof within just five minutes.”
Apollo Chai, head of BIPV marketing at GoodWe Australia, said the inclusion of the Galaxy series in the manufacturer’s product portfolio makes it a more comprehensive energy solution provider.
“Over 25% of rooftops in Australia cannot be installed with traditional solar panels and mounting systems, due to the risk of weather damage and structural integrity being compromised,” he said. “The Galaxy series of panels is the ideal solution for these scenarios, especially for commercial property owners who are looking for solar solutions to reduce operational costs at a time when energy prices are increasing.”
The panels measure 2,116 mm × 777 mm × 4 mm and are reinforced by 1.6 mm ultra-thin glass which provides durability and all-weather protection. The new Galaxy 315 W panel has a power conversion efficiency of 174 W per square meter. The panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius, the operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The series also includes a 335 W model.
GoodWe offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. It said the panels are able to operate at 82% of their original performance after 25 years and at 80% after 30 years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/04/enel-develops-robot-for-waterless-cleaning-of-pv-plants/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Enel develops robot for waterless cleaning of PV plants,"From pv magazine Italy
Enel Green Power has developed a new robot for automated solar panel cleaning without the use of water, in partnership with Sicily-based startup Reiwa.
The robot can move on the panel rows independently and does not require human assistance. It is also able to recharge itself via solar panels and return to its docking station at the end of the journey.
The SandStorm system is equipped with a system of brushes that act as the cleaning force.
“The approach normally adopted involves cleaning the surfaces with pressure washers or tractors equipped with hydraulic brushes; both cases entail water consumption and gas emissions from the motor vehicles used,” Enel Green Power said. “Sturdy and versatile, SandStorm adapts – when necessary – even to the non-homogeneous alignment of the trackers of the panels, managing to move independently from one row of panels to the adjacent one.”
Enel Green Power has already tested the system at its Innovation LabEGP research center of Passo Martino, near Catania, and then on an industrial scale in a 1 MW section of a PV plant it operates in Totana, Spain.
“Today EGP is scaling up the application of this technology with an initial contract for the implementation of around 150 robots in two Spanish PV plants, Totana and Las Corchas, for a total capacity of 135 MW,” the company said.
