It can also be integrated into the built environment artfully, fusing objective value with subjective enjoyment. Here are five of pv magazine’s favorite designs from 2021:

France-based organic PV module maker Armor solar power films and Dutch designer Marjan van Aubel crafted transparent organic PV modules for the Netherlands’ pavilion at the Expo 2020 Dubai, the universal exposition that will take place in the United Arab Emirates in October.Van Aubel specializes in incorporating solar cells into furniture, windows, and other objects. In this project, she used Armor’s “ASCA” organic transparent solar cells to create colored modules in which the lines and patterns are interacting with each other.
The transparent panels produce electricity for the pavilion and simultaneously allow sunlight into its spaces and filter the light’s spectrum to enable the photosynthesis of the plants located inside the building.
“Van Aubel demonstrates that solar panels, whilst collecting energy, can be beautiful and a form of art too,” Armor said in a statement, adding that the graphic design is made with a colored Moiré effect, which is an interference pattern produced by overlaying similar, but slightly offset, templates.

Soltech Energy, a Swedish PV system integrator and solar product supplier, is building several PV facades in its home market. It recently installed a 646.6 kW solar façade on a newly built garage with 300 EV–charging posts in Gothenburg, Sweden, by adopting a special design it has developed for buildings with particular airflow patterns. 
The flow of air in the garage is important because of exhaust from the vehicles. The façade is open so the air exchange does not need to be measured, as it is far beyond the required levels for garages, according to the company. It also claims that the air flow is beneficial for the temperature of the panels. 
“The façade is being built with semi-transparent modules that requires a certain tilt angle and, at the same time, it is placed on a building wall that needs a high exchange of airflow between its inner and outer parts,” the company’s chief innovation officer, Anna Svensson, told pv magazine.The grid-connected solar facade supplies electricity for the garage, which features approximately 300 charging boxes for electric cars. The system includes 1,096 semi-transparent glass-glass frameless panels with 40% transparency and a power output of 54 kW.

An origami-inspired umbrella that can power a refrigerator was designed by an MIT-spawned innovation firm along with architects and an Italian frozen-desserts brand. The fold-out array is meant to be deployed in the sun, shading beachgoers and generating PV energy that feeds attachable nebulizers and coolers underneath. This provides a way to keep the beachgoer, their drinks, and Italian ice cream cool on a hot summer’s day. 
The project was supported by “transformable design” proponent professor Chuck Hoberman of Harvard, who worked with Italo Rota and MIT professor Carlo Ratti on the design. The modular system means that multiple umbrellas can be strung together, leaving it up to resorts to be creative with how they integrate the technology.   The umbrella is 8.2 feet high, has a 10.5-foot diameter, and includes panels over the entire top.

Researchers at South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) have demonstrated a highly transparent, colorful solar cell based on silicon that they claim shows unprecedented flexibility combined with remarkable power conversion efficiency. 
Conceived for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), the solar cell was designed to be built with a 100μm-thick n-Si wafer and by punching, via photolithography, micro-holes that can allow light to be transmitted through the cell itself. 
The holes are arranged in the shape of a periodic array within the device, which ensures, according to the research team, that the cell is highly flexible, with a bending radius of 6mm. “The periodic hole array structure uniformly distributes the stress across the device and suppresses the generation and propagation of microcracks,” they explained, noting that the structure was implemented by controlling the dry etching process.
In order to make the cell colorful, the scientists added organic dyes into its polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. PDMS is an organic-based polymer that is commonly used in solar module backsheets.

One of Google’s newest buildings is using a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) product called Dragonscale, which is manufactured by European solar panel company SunStyle. 
And it is gorgeous. 
The internet giant, which also is a world-leading clean energy procurement company, has installed around 7 MW of the product on two buildings at its Silicon Valley campus. The 90,000 individual solar panels will generate enough electricity to cover around 40% of the electricity use in the buildings, known as Bay View and Charleston East. 
The solar cells are embedded into a sturdy, but flexible, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) layer. Six millimeters of hardened solar glass protects the face of the panels; the back is protected by a layer of fire resistant Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride). Because the edges of the tiles are sealed to keep out moisture — much like a glass-glass solar panel — aluminum framing on the panel is not necessary. 
The polyvinyl layer is a highly textured “prismatic” surface, which traps photons within the solar panel that would normally escape from traditional flat solar panels. The result is an increase in the solar panel’s generation.

The project is being constructed in Macon County, Georgia, located in the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) energy market. According to Doral, the Project has secured almost 1,600 acres under long term leases with local landowners and has a signed interconnection agreement with Georgia Power. Once complete, the Project will produce enough electricity to power approximately 36,000 households.
Doral Renewables currently owns more than 5 GW of projects under development in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic US, including the Mammoth Solar project in Indiana, which recently celebrated the ribbon cutting of the project’s first phase.
Mammoth Solar 1 is set to include 480 MW of capacity, and would be the first phase of a planned development that would cover more than 12,000 acres in Starke and Pulaski counties. Mammoth Solar 1 is expected to begin construction during the fourth quarter and reach commercial operation by the second quarter of 2023. It will sell energy into the PJM market. The project’s development timeline has not yet been shared.
AEP Energy, a unit of American Electric Power, and Doral signed a long-term purchase agreement for phase one of the Mammoth project, which is set to clock in at 1.65 GW once completed.

Gov. John Carney, D-Del., signed into law SB33, which raises Delaware’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for regulated utilities to 40% by 2035. The new law raises Delaware’s previous RPS goal of 25% renewable energy by 2025. The RPS solar carve-out also will nearly triple from 3.5% by 2025 to 10% by 2035.
New Mexico gains a community solar program
With the signing of SB 84, New Mexico became the 21st state to establish a statewide community solar program. Regulators have until April 2022 t0 evaluate existing community solar programs and develop rules for a state program. The law also calls on regulators to develop a list of low-income service organizations and programs that may pre-qualify low-income customers.
Arizona regulators kick the can on clean energy goals
Arizona utility regulators voted 3-2 to advance an amended package aimed at moving Arizona’s regulated utilities to 100% carbon-free energy by 2070. The vote came after the energy rules package failed at the commission’s May 5 meeting. The package is generally seen as inactive and laggard, even falling behind the stated goals of the state’s investor-owned utilities.
Texas works to protect its grid
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed Senate Bills 2 and 3 into law on June 8. The laws are intended to change how parts of the state’s power grid must prepare for extreme weather and how the Electric Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) is governed.
The legislation was sparked by a mid-February winter storm that lasted for days and crippled much of the state’s electric power grid. Power plants that had not been winterized were particularly hard hit in a near carbon-copy of a power outage that hit the state in February 2011.
An action-packed year for New Jersey
In July, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) voted unanimously to implement a new solar incentive program that it said will enable up to 3,750 MW of new solar generation by 2026.
The Successor Solar Incentive Program (SuSI) was part of a nearly three-year process mandated by the Clean Energy Act of 2018 to replace the state’s Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) program with new incentives that encourage solar development while minimizing ratepayer cost.
The regulatory agency said that solar energy is expected to generate approximately 10% of New Jersey’s total electricity needs once the program is fully implemented.
In October, the BPU voted to approve 164 MW of new community solar projects, with all of that capacity aimed at serving low-to-moderate-income (LMI) households.
Regulators also said that the state will transition the two-year-old pilot community solar program to permanent status. The decision to move to a permanent program now rather than wait for a third year of the pilot to commence was driven by the pilot’s success so far.
The community solar program is administered by New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program. It provides access to solar energy through a subscription-based model.
Just a few weeks later, in November, Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law bill A3352, which requires all new warehouses in the state to be built as solar-ready buildings.
Now, new warehouses (defined as any building 100,000 square feet or larger and that primarily is used to store goods for resale) built on or after July 1, 2022 will need to be optimized for solar. If the structure is intended to use hot water, then it also must allow for the installation of a solar water heating system.
North Carolina: State of compromise
North Carolina’s 2021 was marked by new policy at the price of concessions. In October, the State Legislature passed House Bill 951 (HB 951), a measure which looks to formally adopt Governor Roy Cooper’s goal of 70% carbon emission reduction by 2030 into state law.
The bill looks to put many of the state’s coal plants on an accelerated retirement schedule, at a schedule to be determined by state regulators.
The bill also calls on state regulators to develop a plan for the state’s utilities to achieve the emissions reduction goal, mandate if passed, through power generation, transmission and distribution, grid modernization, storage, energy efficiency measures, demand-side management, and emerging technology, no later than the end of 2022.
However, also included in the bill are reduced oversights for Duke Energy, including the freedom for the utility to institute multi-year rate plans (MYRP), a rate structure that the utility has been pursuing for some time. The MYRP is a process by which the utility can start charging customers for projected future costs. The current process looks backward at costs actually incurred.
To end November, Duke energy came to terms on compromise with a number of environmental organizations regarding the company’s new net metering compensation structure. The new rates include minimum monthly bills, non-bypassable charges, and grid access fees for larger systems, all things that solar advocates have long argued against as harmful for the health of the state’s rooftop solar market.
Healthy net metering policy in South Carolina
In late May, the South Carolina Public Service Commission issued final rules for net metering, which the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said will better align with customer behavior and electricity system needs.
The net metering regime for current solar customers will be extended through 2025 or 2029, depending on when customers switched to solar. At the end of that period, customers can continue with the current setup at 2025 or 2029 retail rates, or switch to the new program. Key elements of the new program include time-of-use rates and rebates for smart thermostats, both of which SEIA said better align customer behavior with electricity system needs.
Power to the NIMBYs in Ohio
Ohio legislators in June passed legislation granting county commissions the power to stop new wind and solar development projects in their tracks.
Senate Bill 52 would require renewable energy project developers to share their application with township trustees 30 days before applying for a certificate from the Ohio Power Siting Board. HB 118 currently awaits referral to a House committee.
Township trustees, after reviewing the application, could then move to call for a referendum petition. If that petition receives signatures representing at least 8% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, then the project must be voted on at the next primary or general election before moving forward.
Critics of the bill have argued that it adds an additional and unnecessary bureaucratic step to the project  development process, one which has already been bogged down by the Ohio Power Siting Board’s lengthy application project. These same constraints do not apply to oil and gas projects.
No small feat: Illinois passes new, sweeping energy package
Potentially the most arduous fight of the year (and the end of 2020) ended this fall, as the Illinois Senate passed The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (SB 2408), a sweeping energy package that sets the state on a trajectory toward 100% clean energy by 2050.
The measure is expected to provide a pathway forward for the state’s solar industry, which has been languishing for almost a year following the exhaustion of previous incentives.
New York plans for 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030
Governor Kathy Hochul announced a plan that is expected to generate enough clean electricity per year to power nearly 700,000 additional New York homes, including those in disadvantaged communities.
The roadmap proposes a strategy for expanding the state’s NY-Sun initiative into one of the largest solar programs in the nation, expected to spur approximately $4.4 billion in private investment and create 6,000 additional solar jobs across the state. The expansion will also deliver at least 35% of the benefits with a goal of 40% from the investments to disadvantaged communities and low-to moderate- income New Yorkers.
A job unfinished: The battle over net metering continues in California
Earlier in December, California became the first state in the country to mandate that solar power plus energy storage be integrated into all future commercial structures via its most recent update to building codes. Additionally, the new building code added a requirement that all new residential construction must be ready for the addition of energy storage. The regulatory body estimates this requirement may add 280 MW of annual solar capacity, as well as 400 MWh of energy storage.
The value of that added solar capacity is fueling the hottest debate in residential solar for the time being, as California still looks to make a final decision on its third iteration of net metering – NEM-3.
The vote is highly charged. At least 17 parties have submitted opinions backed by financial and legal arguments sent directly to California’s Public Utility Commission (CPUC). The whole of the legal filings – thousands of pages of documents – can be found on the CPUC website.
Various parties are arguing in favor of an 80% reduction to solar’s net-metering value, as well as monthly fees of $75 for homeowners with solar systems attached to the grid. Commercial customers could be facing fees from $800 to $3,400 per month. These fees would negate most of the savings for installing solar power.
The various players and proposals involved in the proceedings are far too nuanced to be done justice in a roundup, so we refer you to pv magazine’s full gauntlet of previous coverage, plus other solar voices chiming in.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/22/u-s-identified-land-that-could-support-100-gw-of-federal-solar-infrastructure/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,NEVADA,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 22, 2021",U.S. identified land that could support 100 GW of federal solar infrastructure,"The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) oversees nearly 250 million acres of land, most in the western half of the country. In 2012, the BLM worked with the Obama administration to flag potential sites in the western U.S. to develop large-scale, federally managed solar. It identified 1,400 square miles of public land, which could support 100 GW of solar.
That figure would nearly double the installed capacity of the United States. Yet today, a minute amount of solar PV infrastructure is federally managed for the public.
However, this may soon be set to change, as BLM works with the Biden administration to revive some of the Obama-era investigations into such projects. This week, BLM held a call to nominate land for solar development across Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico, with a combined area of 140 square miles. The agency’s director Tracy Stone-Manning said officials are actively evaluating 40 large-scale projects in identified public lands.
Progress has already begun on this front as BLM approved the construction of the Arica and Victory Pass solar projects in California. The two have a planned combined capacity of 465 MW solar, 400 MW battery energy storage. The projects represent a $689 million investment and an estimated $5.9 million in annual operational economic benefit.
Clearway Energy Group is slated to construct, operate, maintain, and decommission the two facilities. The projects are developed as part of the BLM’s Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan, which seeks to conserve desert ecosystems and recreational areas while expanding decarbonized energy in California.
Officials said that the further approval of a 500 MW project in California called Oberon is expected in the coming days.

Of that, $10,000 is going to the Team Western Kentucky Tornado Relief Fund, established by Governor Beshear, and another $10,000 contribution to the Footprint Project, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization that is deploying two solar trailers, two palletized microgrids, five solar generators and six portable power stations to the hardest hit area in Kentucky.
The Footprint Project’s mission is to build back green, by providing clean energy generation to support first responders, meet emergency power needs, and provide light and power where it is needed most. Since 2020, for example, FP volunteers were some of the first to respond following the January earthquake in Puerto Rico, deploying ten mobile solar generators to power device recharging, medical equipment, and lighting. In Matamoros, Mexico, Footprint provided a solar tent and trailer for a field hospital to power Global Response Management’s COVID-19 clinic, serving 2,500 asylum seekers in the encampment.
“Day to day we are honored to work in Kentucky to increase the use of solar energy, following this extreme weather event, we understand providing Kentuckians with backup power is a top priority for their wellbeing,” said Jodi White, co-CEO of BayWa r.e. Solar Systems LLC. “By providing communities with access to clean energy sources during these trying times, we are demonstrating how renewables are a solution, not just to everyday needs, but to natural disasters, made more severe by climate change. We encourage others to add their support toward these relief activities as energy supply will continue to be critical.”
With a presence in 28 countries, BayWa r.e. is a leading global renewable energy developer, service provider, distributor, and energy solutions provider that has brought over 4 GW of energy online and manages over 10 GW of assets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/22/toshiba-claims-8-4-efficiency-for-transparent-cuprous-oxide-solar-cell/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 22, 2021",Toshiba claims 8.4% efficiency for transparent cuprous oxide solar cell,"Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba has announced an 8.4% power conversion efficiency for a transparent cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin-film solar cell. The result, the company claims, is the highest efficiency ever reported for any cell of this kind to date.
The cell was conceived for use in electric vehicles and high-altitude platform station (HAPS) applications. “The tandem solar cell offers the promise of more efficient solar modules by combining top and bottom cells that generate power at different wavelengths,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The record efficiency was achieved by reducing copper(II) oxide (CuO) and copper (Cu) impurities during the fabrication of the cell’s Cu2O layer and, in particular, by carefully controlling the oxygen flow. These impurities are due to the reactive sputtering deposition method used in the manufacturing of the cell. “We used a transparent conducting oxide as the bottom electrode and fabricated a low-impurity Cu2O thin film by reactive sputtering using argon and oxygen,” the Toshiba research scientists stated.
The Cu2O thin films were deposited by reactive sputtering in mixed oxygen and argon atmosphere on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) on a glass substrate with TCO composed of double layers of antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) and indium tin oxide (ITO). “The ATO layer was chosen for its good electrical contact with the Cu2O layer,” the researchers further explained. “The thicknesses of the Cu2O thin films were varied from 2 to 5 μm.”
The cell was tested under standard illumination conditions and was found to have an efficiency of 8.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.13 V, a short-circuit current of 10.63 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.696.  The Cu2O thin films showed the highest transmittance with the lowest impurity ratio.
The scientists also conducted a device simulation analysis and found that the cell has the potential to reach an efficiency of over 10% by decreasing the surface velocity at p–n interfaces and increasing n-type carrier density at the n-layer. “With support from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Toshiba will continue research to achieve the 10% PCE target for top Cu2O cells,” the researchers said. “Toshiba is also cooperating with Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation in the development of large-scale Cu2O solar cells that are the same size as mass-produced silicon solar cells.”
The solar cell was described in the paper “Highly transparent Cu2O absorbing layer for thin film solar cells,” published in Applied Physics Letters (AIP).
