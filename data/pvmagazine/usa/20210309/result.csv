The bipartisan legislation would create a standalone investment tax credit (ITC) for energy storage technologies for utilities, businesses, and homes.
House Members Mike Doyle (D-PA), Vern Buchanan (R-FL), and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) introduced the bill in the House, while Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced companion legislation in the Senate.
The current tax code only allows an ITC for energy storage when it is installed in conjunction with a solar energy system. The sponsors said the bill would extend the federal incentive for energy storage investments to a wider range of applications and provide greater assurance to prospective investors.
For commercial applications, the bill would make standalone energy storage eligible for the tax credit under Section 48 of the IRS code. All energy storage technologies would qualify, including batteries, pumped hydropower, thermal storage, and hydrogen storage. For residential applications, the bill would provide homeowners the same credit for battery storage as currently available for solar power in Section 25D of the IRS code.
The U.S. Energy Storage Association (ESA) and Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) both support the legislation and urged Congress to pass it.
CRES Executive Director Heather Reams said the federal incentives would spur significant private-sector investments in energy storage.
Jason Burwen, interim CEO of ESA, said the bill would put storage “on the same playing field as other clean energy technologies.”
According to ESA’s 2030 Vision, at least 100 GW of energy storage is needed to drive the U.S. clean energy transition and transform the electric system to handle 21st-century demands. The U.S. currently has over 3 GW of battery and other advanced energy storage deployed.
In February, members of the House Ways & Means Committee included similar ITC eligibility for standalone storage and an extension of the solar ITC in the the Growing Renewable Energy and Efficiency Now (GREEN) Act. The Solar Energy Industries Association called that comprehensive bill “critical” for solar.

The report, Hail or High Water, said that the average solar loss due to traditional natural catastrophes or extreme weather was almost 2400% higher than the average non-weather-related solar loss in 2019. The report also said that 70% of solar losses in the last 10 years have occurred since 2017.
Historically, solar projects have most often suffered catastrophic damage from wildfires. After all, much of the early solar market was focused in California, a state with a high annual wildfire risk. Once development began to expand to the Southeast, hurricanes, high wind events, and flooding became of more concern.
David Wagman
Now, as central Texas, Oklahoma, and the Plains States see solar projects coming their way, hail is the paramount issue, even as  high winds remain as much a threat as ever.
Changing weather patterns and more instances of non-traditional, “unmodelled” extreme weather – storms that go beyond traditional predictive and modeling methodology – are partially to blame for the increased severity and frequency of renewable and insurance losses.
But another reason is also a factor of renewables’ success as resources: they’re being built in more areas across the country.
Such was the case with the 178 MW Midway Solar Project in Pecos County, Texas, a sprawling county in the western part of the state. There in 2019, a hail storm damaged more than 400,000 solar panels and caused insurance losses totaling $70 million. The incident opened the eyes of many to the types of weather events that large solar projects could fall victim to, as well as the shortcomings of current hardware reliability testing.
As a result, renewables’ enhanced economic viability has led in part to greater insurance losses as projects are built in areas that are prone to severe weather events, like central Texas and the Florida Coast.
In response, renewable energy insurance markets have hardened, with premiums increasing by as much as 400% over the past 21 months. Some insurers have introduced natural catastrophe sublimits. These set a maximum on the amount of money that can be used to cover losses related to a certain type of weather event.
Renewable asset owners face a larger financial burden, but that burden that must be supportable in order for the renewable asset insurance agency to survive. According to the GCube report, before Midway, the 2017 hurricane season was one of the first weather events to show just how soft the renewable insurance market was; the report went so far as to call it naive.
Today, even though the insurance market is harder, premiums have risen, and specific sublimits and extreme weather protection clauses have been introduced, the report said that the market is in a much stronger position to sustainably provide coverage for the renewable energy sector.
The catastrophic events experienced nationwide since 2017 have opened the eyes of insurers and developers alike, providing tangible examples of what severe weather events can do to solar energy projects, and what components are most likely to be damaged and experience failures.

Now, the company aims to reduce its own carbon footprint.
Gillig partnered with SunPower to add rooftop solar and energy storage at its headquarters and assembly plant in Livermore, California. When completed later this year, the 3 MW, 7,800-panel system will represent one of the largest rooftop installations in the San Francisco Bay Area. It also will be one of a growing number of integrated battery storage installations at a U.S. manufacturing plant. Energy from the project will power transit bus manufacturing and charge battery-electric buses.
SunPower will design, install, and operate the 3 MW SunPower Helix solar system and two Helix battery-electric storage systems. The batteries will be charged by the solar panels and provide power to help reduce demand spikes.
Gillig’s transit buses include zero-emission battery-electric, near-zero-emission compressed natural gas, and diesel-electric hybrid models. The company also builds buses using “clean diesel” technology for reduced emissions.
At its 600,000 square-foot facility, Gillig currently uses high-efficiency lighting and recycled water for ground watering, as well as offers employee electric vehicle charging stations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/09/the-solar-massachusetts-renewable-target-program-works-heres-why/,"MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MASSACHUSETTS",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 9, 2021",The Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program works. Here’s why,"The Massachusetts Department of Energy and Resources (DOER) was tasked with replacing its highly successful Solar Renewable Energy Certificate I & II programs five years ago. After a couple of band-aid extensions that allowed the SREC II program to continue, in late 2018 the agency launched the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program.
The program has a broad goal of deploying 1.6 GWac (later upped to 3.2 GWac) of solar power in such a way that it is financially sound for electricity ratepayers. Project siting, economic justice, and energy storage all were considered in the equation of constructing this solar capacity.
In the field experience of this solar developer, and many others based upon demand shortly after the new program was released, the tools deployed by DOER and the underlying contract structure have created a program that local business and homeowners can grasp, and are investing in.
Let’s see what makes it work.
The program path within SMART that appeals most to local bankers is the Alternative On Bill Credit (AOBC) + Wholesale Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). This program is specifically designed for standalone solar projects that will sell all of their electricity to the local utility.
In practice, the project owner signs two 20-year contracts – the ABOC and the PPA – with the state and the electric utility, respectively. The independently metered solar project begins to pay the owner via one direct deposit and one check per month about four months after the project switches on.
Because these are fixed contracts with highly credible institutions, bankers see the electricity revenues as lower risk than the intermingling of incentives, and electricity bills, of the business themselves.
(Read “Bill would mandate rooftop solar on new homes and commercial buildings.”)
And, because all of the system’s electricity generation can be sold to the utility, building owners are motivated to maximize the amount of solar they are willing to deploy.
If the AOBC program within SMART sounds familiar, that’s because it shares a few aspects with Rhode Island’s REGrowth program. The key similarities are:
● Standalone solar project
● Long term, fixed value contract
● High credit offtaker (electricity utility), backed by the state.
Of course, the project’s return on investment matters as well. At a high level, Massachusetts has done a good job pricing incentives to motivate local installations. However, determining ROIs requires a bit of alchemy—combining the data of project size, utility load zone, capacity installed already, additions of energy storage and agrivoltaics, siting rules, and system efficiency—into spreadsheets.
Programs of this nature that maximize roofs with high-quality off takers are why Rhode Island and Massachusetts have significant rooftop, and distribution level, volumes of solar power deployed.
In particular, Massachusetts produces nearly 20% of its electricity from solar. That speaks volumes about the political support it receives.

Gambit Energy Storage could have the grid-connected facility in service by June.
The project was first proposed by Plus Power. Bloomberg, which reported the news, said that Plus confirmed it sold the project to an undisclosed party.
The project would include lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4 or “LFP”) batteries, similar to those used in portable electronic devices such as laptops, mobile phones, electric bikes, and cars. The project site is near a 138 kV substation in Angleton, Texas, and would offer black start capability to help the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid recover after a blackout.
The site was chosen in part because the Angleton area forms an especially volatile node on the ERCOT grid. The proposed battery would provide energy balancing services.
The ERCOT grid was battered in mid-February by a winter storm that led to widespread power outages that lasted for days across much of Texas.
In a tweet during the state’s power crisis, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, “ERCOT is not earning that R.”

The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed the Solar Time-based Residential Analytics and Cycle time Estimator (Solar TRACE) online tool to increase transparency into PII processes, requirements, and overall adoption cycle times nationwide. Access Solar TRACE here.
Solar TRACE shows median cycle times for more than 700 jurisdictions with at least 10 installs in the dataset spanning 140 utilities and 28 states.

Users of the new tool will be able to compare PII timelines and requirements for any jurisdiction in the U.S. The tool is intended to allow contractors, homeowners, and others to estimate how long PII processes may take. It also can help identify PII-related improvements to streamline cycle times and potentially reduce PII-related costs and delays.
Solar TRACE shows median cycle times for more than 700 jurisdictions with at least 10 installs in the dataset spanning 140 utilities and 28 states. NREL developed Solar TRACE using industry-provided data from over 220,000 installations between 2017 and 2019, representing about 25% of total U.S. installs each year. NREL also collected PII requirements related to the install process, including whether jurisdictions process instant online applications, if they are SolSmart awardees, and whether utilities require interconnection approval prior to install.
Solar TRACE is released in conjunction with SolarAPP, or the Solar Automated Permit Processing platform. SolarAPP is a similar collaborative effort to develop an instant online permitting platform that any authority having jurisdiction in the U.S. can use to improve permitting efficiency and reduce labor costs. Access Solar APP here.
NREL is partnering with the Solar Energy Industries Association on a webinar series that summarizes analysis on the topic of PII, including Solar TRACE. The first webinar, scheduled for Wednesday, March 31, at 1 p.m. ET, will focus on NREL’s analysis and findings on the PII process and nationwide trends. The second, on Wednesday, April 14, at 1 p.m. ET, will showcase Solar TRACE and include a roundtable discussion with local governments, utilities, and installers on pathways to improving PII processes nationwide.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/09/we-have-a-real-adversary-work-intensifies-to-safeguard-solar-from-cyber-attacks/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SOFTWARE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 9, 2021",‘We have a real adversary’: Work intensifies to safeguard solar from cyber attacks,"Alan Mantooth figures that making a $500 fix to a $10,000 piece of equipment could better safeguard the grid from a potentially devastating cyber attack that could be directed at – or even launched by – a solar power plant.
Such an attack on the bulk power system is possible, if unlikely, at least for now.
Mantooth says that safeguards were designed decades ago to offer some measure of cyber security for solar technology. Those safeguard were largely seen as unnecessary, expensive add-ons. After all, the solar industry was laser-focused on driving out costs; an attack through electronic systems was thought to be far-fetched.
Now, however, the realization is growing that cyber threats are real. In a speech at the State Department in early February, President Joe Biden said the government had elevated the status of cyber issues and was launching an “urgent initiative” to improve U.S. capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace.
Solar systems of all sizes could pose a risk to the grid in much the same way that an attack on a conventional power plant could result in widespread blackouts. The consequences of a cyberattack could be as minor as reducing a solar array’s power output, or as major as overloading a battery energy storage system to the point of failure. In a worst-case scenario, an intruder could initiate plausible, yet inappropriate commands that disable large portions of the grid.
And so, with $3.6 million in grant money from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office, Mantooth and his team at the University of Arkansas’ National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission are working to develop sophisticated yet low-cost tools to protect the power electronics housed within inverters, a device that has been given vastly expanded functionality in recent years.
“Inverters represent a vulnerability in the sense that we have to communicate with them,” Mantooth said. The point of contact that enables that two-way communications to occur also means “the grid is vulnerable” to a potential attack.
Where inverters once were used almost exclusively to extract the most power from solar modules and deliver it to a voltage load, today’s technology includes software to enable performance monitoring, ancillary services, and even black start capabilities. More recently, inverters have emerged as central to the growth of virtual power plants, which use software to link together hundreds or thousands of individual inverter-based generation resources and make them available to the distribution grid.
Inverters have grown to be “more intelligent than simply putting out power,” Mantooth said. Indeed, inverters are essentially Internet of Things devices that share their electronics DNA with devices around your house like smart thermostats, TVs, and refrigerators. And like any other Internet-connected device, security breaches can occur.
Mantooth looks at the problem of hardening a solar inverter against a cyber intruder as involving both hardware and software. If no one inserts a hardware trojan horse, then the device can be considered protected, he said.
Software presents a different case. Here, he and his research team assume that a bad actor can access the software that operates an inverter’s power electronics and can manipulate the software to cause harm.
Inverter functionality is addressed under the IEEE 1547 standard, which was revised in 2018 and is currently being rolled out in a range of regulatory rules that cover grid interconnection. Underwriters Laboratories also modified its inverter certification and standard to require voltage ride-through, frequency ride-through, anti-islanding, volt-var, and frequency-watt functionalities, all aimed at improving grid resiliency.
The addition of these kinds of capabilities might also increase cybersecurity vulnerability. The risk may have been compounded by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 2222 of last September. That order opens the door for distributed energy resources to take part in energy markets. While the FERC order was widely hailed for expanding the role that solar can play, it may also broaden the possibility for cyber intrusions.
Massoud Amin is an IEEE Fellow and professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. He is also widely regarded as the father the smart grid; he led utility security efforts coordinated through the Electric Power Research Institute after the 9/11 attacks. He now warns that a cyber attack targeted against today’s inverters could be “disastrous” in many ways.
“If there’s malware placed in a very large number of devices – not just at the inverters but elsewhere in the system – and they are timed correctly as part of a multi-pronged attack – without giving a blueprint for such an attack, yes, a lot of damage can be done,” Amin said.
Cyber attacks are nothing new. The Stuxnet computer worm was first reported in 2010; it targeted supervisory control and data acquisition systems and was believed to be responsible for causing substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear program.
In 2013, retailer Target’s point of sale databases were hacked, exposing private data on 70 million customers. An investigation found that the hackers had gained access through an HVAC contractor whose password to a vendor portal were stolen.
In what is widely regarded as perhaps the first known successful cyberattack on a power grid, hackers in December 2015 targeted information systems of three energy distribution companies in Ukraine, temporarily disrupting the electricity supply to consumers.
And this past December, a security breach was discovered involving U.S.-based SolarWinds, the network management software of which is widely used across the energy industry. The scale and scope of the breach is still being uncovered, but it could be substantial.
In a 2020 research report, scientists from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the University of Illinois-Chicago, and Texas A&M University highlighted grid vulnerabilities as the United States rapidly embraces what they refer to as the electronics dominated grid, or PEDG.
Increased use of PEDG makes the distribution-level grid more vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. That is because of the sheer number of intelligent devices that can impact power grid stability if compromised.
A typical PEDG includes solar energy generation, flexible loads, local battery systems, smart meters, and so on. All these elements constitute what the researchers refer to as the “device layer” of the cyber-physical system. This layer communicates with a supervisory layer through two-way transfer of information and commands.
NREL
The main role of the supervisory layer, the researchers said, is to assure that the network is operating optimally. It does this by monitoring and controlling device layer entities. But this structure also offers a doorway for attackers who might try to manipulate operations and draw the supervisory control layer into executing incorrect commands.
As one example, the researchers outlined a case in which a grid-following inverter tells the supervisory upper control layer that it is going to island itself due to an internal failure. In response, the control layer acts to inject more power from nearby grid-following inverters in an effort to compensate for the reported generation loss.
However, if a false alarm was sent by a cyber intruder, then the supervisory layer’s action to increase voltage in the distribution network could instead trip overvoltage protection relays, causing a blackout in that portion of the grid. In this way, an otherwise acceptable communication may lead to a blackout affecting thousands of electricity customers.
The researchers wrote that, “with the increased adoption of grid-following inverters in our current energy landscape, their influence and dynamics are crucial in terms of network operation.”
One important point to keep in mind is that if there is no communications link, then little if any cybersecurity vulnerability exists. As explained by Brian Lydic, chief regulatory engineer with the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, the scope and scale of a potential cybersecurity breach depends on the capability of the communications link.
“If settings can be changed over communications, then the potential impact could be larger, limited only by the scope of connected systems,” Lydic said. As inverter-based systems become more widely embedded in grid operations, “we potentially open them up to more vulnerability.”
Despite the increased threat, one possible advantage of bulk power generation from wind and solar is that the systems are composed of many devices coming from a larger and more diverse set of technology providers, said Danish Saleem, a senior Cybersecurity Systems researcher at NREL. “If each device and sensor were to have a mechanism – say, a tripwire – to detect or counter malicious threats, that could support a robust situational awareness and mitigation capability.”
Saleem said that NREL is developing metrics to evaluate security at the system-of-systems level. As part of their work, researchers will look at millions of devices, distributed architectures, and their resulting connections under scenarios that can then help determine the potential implications of different types of threats.
NREL is developing metrics to evaluate security at the system-of-systems level.

It would do this by identifying three operational conditions for each inverter given its location in the network: normal, safe, and abnormal. The proposed IDS, along with other functionalities of smart inverters, would verify that the active and reactive power set points of inverters have not been manipulated.
Meanwhile, back at the University of Arkansas, Alan Mantooth and his team are looking at a multi-layer cyber security approach. One layer would be based on adding a second core processor that would remain “hidden” from view but could be brought online within nanoseconds after an intrusion is detected. The second core processor would take over normal operations and offer protection at what Mantooth says would be a relatively minimal cost, perhaps $500 on a $10,000 inverter.

Added to that would be machine learning tools. Here, the power electronics would be taught what constitutes a device’s normal behavior. A related step adds blockchain concepts that enable many inverters to be monitored and evaluated simultaneously. Combined, these security layers “tell us if someone is knocking on our door and if it is legitimate,” Mantooth said.
A more expensive security layer would include a dedicated fiber communications link from a solar facility to a central operations center. That sort of closed communications system would represent an added cost, but also would secure vital communications functions from an external threat.
As a goal, Mantooth says his team aims to produce effective cyber controls that add no more than 15% to the cost of an inverter. And work to date suggests that safeguards will cost “way less than that,” he said. His laboratory’s design solutions are slated to be tested in 2023. For the field demonstration, cyber security devices will be deployed at a 5 MW solar array outfitted with 125 kW string inverters.
Power electronics’ functionality is rapidly evolving and tackling cyber security problem is not a typical engineering problem, Mantooth says. “We have a real adversary where someone is trying to break down my design. We are all learning how to design things better.”
