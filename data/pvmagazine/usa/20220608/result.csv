Buried in the bill in section 54 is the language, “beginning on January 1, 2023, no supplier… shall execute a new contract or renew an existing contract for generation services with any individual residential retail customer.” 
The provision is viewed as an anti-competitive move that re-establishes monopoly utility control in the state. The ban would take a significant amount of renewables off the market, forcing customers back to their default electricity supplier, such as utilities National Grid and Eversource. This comes just as the two are scheduled to increase their retail electricity rates. 
More than three-quarters of the competitive electricity supply contracts available to Massachusetts residents are 100% renewable energy products. Nearly 20% of renewable generation is already under contract and will be removed if this language is included in the final draft of the bill. Utilities are only mandated to supply 51% renewable energy in Massachusetts, meaning the bill could jeopardize clean energy goals for the state. 
An online survey of 800 Massachusetts residents conducted on behalf of Clean Choice Energy found that residents overwhelmingly support the option to choose alternative suppliers. The survey found 83% of respondents want the freedom to choose clean energy for their homes, 79% want to be able to choose their supplier, and 73% would be interested in 100% clean energy contracts if given the option. Alternative energy suppliers are more popular than rooftop solar, with 74% of respondents voicing interest in the option, versus 50% of respondents saying they are interested in rooftop residential solar. 
In 2021 alone, nearly half a million Massachusetts residents, about 7% of the state’s population, chose a different energy source than their default utility. Many shop for competitive clean energy on the state website Energy Switch Massachusetts. 
“Nearly 500,000 Massachusetts households already voted with their wallets, and most are accelerating the purchase of renewable energy – an option that Senate Bill 2842 (S. 2842) would take away,” said Christopher Ercoli, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Energy Advancement League. “When retail energy suppliers compete for your business, they have the incentive to offer better rates and service – not treat you like a captive ratepayer who pays whatever the utility mandates.” 
Though the bill is pitched as a climate-change combatant, the anti-competitive provision removes a market for solar and wind energy developers, thereby potentially slowing the buildout of clean energy in the state. It goes in direct contrast with the will of Massachusetts residents, who have overwhelmingly supported the freedom to choose.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/08/200-partners-to-help-speed-interconnection-through-us-department-of-energy-program/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 8, 2022",200 partners to help speed interconnection through US Department of Energy program,"The US Department of Energy’s i2X partnership program, which aims for faster and lower-cost interconnection of solar, wind and storage projects on both the transmission and distribution grids, will define and simulate interconnection process improvements by the end of this year, said Tom McDermott, a chief engineer at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, in a webinar.
“We also need to define achievable metrics for improvement over a five-year horizon—for example, to reduce the cost or time of interconnection by 50%,” he said. “We plan to define this metric in collaboration with the i2X community.”
By next March, the program will produce the first draft of an engineering guide on interconnection studies for utility-scale projects, as well as the first draft of a five-year strategic roadmap for the overall program. “I’m confident that our industry can do better with interconnection processes,” McDermott said.
Meanwhile, the program will conduct two “sprint” studies with stakeholder involvement. The first, McDermott said, will focus on a better interconnection queue, considering ideas such as better automation, clustered impact studies, and sharing of grid upgrade costs. The second will focus on queue alternatives, “for example, an auction-based process of hosting capacity or grid needs, informed by experience with auctions of broadband spectrum.”
Grid operators PJM, Southwest Power Pool and CAISO, and utilities National Grid and Duke Energy, are among 200 current participants in the $3 million DOE program. They are joined by solar trade group Solar Energy Industries Association, renewables and transmission trade group American Clean Power, and distributed energy training and advocacy group Interstate Renewable Energy Council. The program is led by DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office and Wind Energy Technologies Office, with the support of several national laboratories.
Several partners shared insights in a webinar panel. To reduce time-in-queue for utility-scale developers, Charlie Smith, executive director of the Energy Systems Integration Group, suggested a “publicly transparent” generator interconnection study process that allows developers to do their own analysis and have a sense of costs before submitting their project.
Whereas distribution systems are publishing hosting capacity maps, which provide up-front information to developers on the cost of interconnection, “the transmission system is behind on that front,” said panelist Cindy Bothwell, a senior grid integration engineer with DOE’s Wind Energy Technologies Office. “We feel that increasing transparency along these lines is one way to promote a fair interconnection process.”
According to panelist Bailey McGalliard, lead strategy and analytics consultant for Duke Energy, the utility provides transparency to developers by voluntarily providing interconnection queue status reports. The utility is also beginning a cluster study process for projects requesting interconnection in North Carolina and South Carolina.
The reliability and speed of interconnection “don’t have to be conflicting objectives,” said panelist Ryan Quint, a senior manager with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. “Our goal should be to achieve both with appropriate enhancements to the interconnection process.”
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm opened the webinar, saying that “according to the Berkeley National Lab, we are already leaving—this is mind blowing to me—1400 gigawatts of solar, wind and battery capacity untapped, waiting to be connected to the grid. And that’s at the bulk transmission level alone, there’s even more in the distribution system. That 1400 gigawatts is about what we need to reach a critical milestone of 80% clean electricity by 2030.”
“If we could get all that capacity online,” Granholm said, “imagine how much faster we’d reach our climate goals. Imagine how many families we could help by lowering their energy bills and keeping the lights on during storms. Imagine how many more construction workers or engineers or electricians we could hire to build those projects. Instead of imagining, let’s actually start making it happen, together.”

The funds are planned to support the development of Agilitas’ large project pipeline in excess of 500 MW. 
The investment amount may be upsized to $650 million upon the completion of designated projects. CarVal now assumes a minority stake in the company, and the two have established a joint venture to own and operate the energy assets. 
“With our experienced management team, existing project pipeline and organizational expertise combined with the support of CarVal, we’re well positioned to expand nationally and help make a dent in our country’s decarbonization goals. CarVal adds significant value beyond their capital. They are smart business athletes with real-world energy and business acumen who will be true partners as we execute our growth plan.” Barret Bilotta, president of Agilitas Energy. 
Energy storage is increasingly an important aspect of a resilient, reliable electricity supply backed by solar energy. The Energy Storage Association said, “Energy storage fundamentally improves the way we generate, deliver and consume electricity…But the game-changing nature of energy storage is its ability to balance power supply and demand instantaneously – within milliseconds – which makes power networks more resilient, efficient and cleaner than ever before.” 
CarVal said it selected Agilitas for the investment due to its standout track record. According to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s latest report on U.S. interconnection queues, only 13% of solar, wind and energy storage projects in approval queues have signed interconnection agreements. Over the past decade, only about 23% of all projects in interconnection queues have successfully connected to the grid and begun operating. Bucking that trend, Agilitas has a 100% success rate of bringing all of its projects through the queue and connecting to the grid, said the company. 
Agilitas has core competencies in project origination, development, project engineering, debt and tax equity financing, engineering, procurement, and construction, and asset management, including energy storage revenue optimization. The company operates a proprietary bidding and forecasting model called Intelligent Power Dispatch, aimed at boosting revenues by predicting market conditions in day-ahead and real-time energy markets. 
Active projects and components used 
The company said within 90 days, the joint venture expects to acquire eight projects totaling 45 MW. This includes two Massachusetts SMART program projects and one stand-alone storage project in Rhode Island, already under construction, two stand-alone storage systems under development in Maine, and three operational solar facilities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
Jeff Perry, vice president of Agilitas Energy told pv magazine that his company solely uses Bloomberg Tier 1 solar modules. Recently, projects have featured Hanwha Q Cell and ZNShine modules. For inverters, the company has recently used Massachusetts-made Solectria products, SMA, and WSTECH. For energy storage applications, the company uses Tier 1 equipment, including LG Chem, Samsung, CATL, Tesla, and Dynapower equipment. 
“We are vendor agnostic (as long as it proven, well-established equipment). We have experience with most of what is out there,” said Perry. 
Agilitas Energy is currently hiring for roles across the major functional groups of the company with a particular focus on adding to the development team. To learn more, please visit https://agilitasenergy.com/contact/.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/08/spongy-solar-cell-may-be-used-to-power-pacemakers/,"RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 8, 2022",Spongy solar cell may be used to power pacemakers,"Scientists at the University of Chicago discovered a new way to make solar cells that could be paired with a small light source to power pacemakers and other medical devices.
Aleksander Prominski, the first author of the paper published in Nature Materials, is a member of the lab of University of Chicago chemist Bozhi Tian, which specializes in creating ways to connect biological tissue and artificial materials such as wires to modulate brain signals and surfaces for medical implants. In this study, the researchers discovered a new way of making a single-layer solar cell and etching holes in the top layer to make it porous.
Solar cells are usually made of two layers, usually a combination of silicon with another material, but the University of Chicago team found they could create a solar cell out of pure silicon if they made one layer porous. The result is a soft, spongy solar cell that can be less than five microns across. The porous cell has multiple advantages over the ways that traditional solar cells are manufactured, streamlining the production process while maintaining the efficacy of the final product.
“You can make them in a matter of minutes, and the process doesn’t require high temperatures or toxic gases,” said Prominski.
“When we measured them, we saw the photocurrent was really high—two orders of magnitude higher than our previous designs,” added Jiuyun Shi, study co-author.
One of the areas that the researchers are interested in is making devices that can be powered by light. When operating in the body, such devices are known as photoelectrochemical cells and can be powered from a tiny optical fiber implanted in the body. The solar cell that the team developed can be paired with an optical fiber, which can be made as thin as a strand of human hair, significantly reducing the overall size of an implant.
The possibilities for medical procedures include pacemakers for the heart as well as applications for nerve stimulation. All of the components can be biodegradable, which would make them applicable to short-term procedures, such as correcting heart arrhythmias. The unique design could also be applied in renewable energy. Because the cells work best in a liquid environment, the researchers envision that they could be used in applications such as artificial leaves and solar fuels. environment, UChicago scientists think they could be used in applications such as artificial leaves and solar fuels.
The team is working with cardiac researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine to further develop the technology for eventual use in humans. They are also collaborating with the University of Chicago Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation to commercialize the discovery.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/08/maryland-passes-a-pair-of-community-solar-bills/,"COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MARYLAND",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 8, 2022",Maryland passes a pair of community solar bills,"The Maryland legislature has taken steps towards strengthening its ongoing community solar pilot program, passing a pair of bills targeted at increasing the amount of eligible projects, and increasing the incentive for such projects to be developed.
The first of the two is HB 1039, which exempts community solar projects from both county and municipal corporate property taxes, so long as the 50% of the electricity generated by the projects go to serve low- to moderate-income individuals and families at a rate which is at least 20% lower than the base electricity rate that these customers would be paying otherwise.
As it stands, 30% of the pilot program capacity is still set aside for low-to-moderate income customers wishing to participate and another 30% is set aside for project development on brownfield sites.
The bill also establishes additional tax incentives for the development of agrivoltaic community solar projects on rooftops, brownfields, landfills, and clean fills. Agrivoltaic projects are those which dual-use a plot of land to house both a solar installation and agriculture, and have been described by Chad Higgins, an associate professor in Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences as a “rare chance for true synergy: more food, more energy, lower water demand, lower carbon emissions, and more prosperous rural communities.”
The other bill, HB 440, will expand the maximum capacity of a permitted community solar project from 2 MW to 5 MW, while also reducing the land requirements for siting projects. This provision pertains to projects developed on multiple, contiguous lots, rather than opening up new types of land zones for development.
“HB 1039 and HB 440 send a signal to the community solar industry that Maryland welcomes the private sector as a way to inject capital into grid modernization and build a new energy market that can bolster the state’s economy,” said Leslie Elder, Mid-Atlantic director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access. “We thank the Maryland General Assembly for passing these bills and Governor Hogan for his support.”
The bills both build on regulatory action from 2021, which expanded the program to allow community solar to power the equivalent of an additional 6,840 Maryland homes, while also allowing community solar projects to be built on clean-fill construction sites, transforming previously unusable industrial locations into clean solar energy generation sites.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/08/us-utility-scale-solar-sets-record-breaks-50-gw-of-instantaneous-generation/,"INSTALLATIONS,MONITORING,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 8, 2022",US utility-scale solar sets record: breaks 50 GW of instantaneous generation,"The utility-scale solar power plant fleet of the United States has surpassed 50 GW of instantaneous generation. This data comes to us via the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Hourly Electricity Grid Monitor.
EIA’s grid monitoring tool is a sum of most utility-scale electricity generation in the lower 48 United States. Behind the meter solar generation is not accounted for in these values.
The first time that more than 50 GW was produced in the United States occurred on Sunday June 5, 2022 at 4 pm EST, when the online tool registered solar production at 50,157 MW of total output.

This was brought to pv magazine USA’s attention by a tweet that referenced the event from Joe Deely.
On Monday June 6, the fleet’s instantaneous generation remained above 50 GW generation for three hours – from 2 to 5 pm EST, peaking at just over 51 GW during the 2 pm hour. As the year’s longest day is June 21, 2022, peak solar generation is expected to occur around this period.
Jason O’Leary, principal analyst, PV intel told pv magazine USA that utility-scale solar also broke another key value on March 2 of this year – meeting 10% of the grid’s electricity generation at 1 pm on March 2, 2022.
Since then, solar has broken that 10% value almost 70 times.

On Monday June 6 at 2 pm EST when it set the current peak value at over 51 GW, utility solar was delivering 9.3% of all electricity generation. On March 22 at 2 pm EST saw utility-scale solar peak at 11.3% of all tracked electricity generation.
Per the EIA’s tool, last year’s peak solar generation value reached 38.6 GW on June 14, 2021 at 3 pm EST, which means the peak value so far this year grew just over 24%. Total solar capacity deployed in the United States grew about 25% in 2021 over 2020’s value.
Two important volumes of electricity generation are not included in these values. The first volume – Hawaii and Alaska – would have a peak generation time much later in the day, and thus wouldn’t have had much of an effect on the peak value.
The second volume, however, is massive – that being the non-utility- scale capacity in the nation. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the US has over 123 GWdc of solar capacity. About 40 GW of that volume is in non-utility-scale settings, and thus is not accounted for by this tool.

If the nation’s roughly 79 GWdc to 83 GWdc of utility-scale capacity is producing 50 GW at its peak, then small scale solar’s roughly 40 GW of volume would likely be outputting in the 20 to 25 GW range, brining the nation’s total peak instantaneous solar generation value into the 70 GW to 75 GW range.

Standard Solar funded the construction and will own and operate the project. SolarPark Energy is the developer, and Catalyst Power Holdings LLC, a portfolio company of BP Energy Partners and an integrated provider of cleaner energy solutions for the commercial and industrial sector, is managing subscriber acquisition and customer service.
The single-axis tracker system is projected to produce approximately 10,794,000 kilowatt-hours annually and will allow local residents and businesses to benefit from clean energy savings by offsetting their electricity bills with solar energy. The project is dedicated to the late Thomas Guzek, founder of SolarPark Energy, a company that was created in 2015 as a result of energy policy changes made by the New York State Public Service Commission. Guzek, who was an entrepreneur in renewable energy development, along with his investors and partners saw great opportunity in bringing the benefits of this new energy policy to a focused area of Western, Central and Upstate New York.
The project is complete and fully subscribed through Catalyst Power. New York’s community solar program enables residents and businesses to save up to 10% on their utility bills while supporting local green energy development.
“New York’s community solar program is among the fastest and easiest ways for businesses to save money while supporting the local community,” said Gabe Philips, CEO of Catalyst Power.
In March, New York officials announced the state had reached a milestone of more than 1 GW of community solar generation capacity installed across the region. According to New York Governor Kathy Hochul, New York has the nation’s largest pipeline of community solar under construction, with more than 700 projects in the queue. That milestone positions New York as the top community solar market in the United States. In addition to being the leader in installed community solar, New York sets an example for the speed at which these projects become operational. Prior to 2018, New York had few community solar installations. Today, not only is New York the leader for community solar installations, but is installing new projects twice as fast as second-place Massachusetts, according to the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie’s Solar Market Insight 2021 Year in Review report.
