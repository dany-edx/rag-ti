Renewables currently make up about 8% of Duke’s electrical output, natural gas accounts for 42%, coal for 33%, and nuclear  for 17%. By 2030, Duke plans for its generation mix to include 30% nuclear, 38% natural gas, and 9% coal.
New renewable resources will be developed to replace the generation lost by the 1,922 MW of coal capacity the utility plans to retire by the end of 2025. While Duke will have retired more than 8,400 MW of coal in total by 2025, that only represents about a third of the utility’s coal fleet; some plants are scheduled to stay active until 2048.
According to Duke, the company plans to retire all coal-only units by 2030 in the Carolinas and shorten average retirement dates by 40% in Indiana.
On the emissions front, Duke said that it has reduced its carbon dioxide output by more than 40% since 2005. The company aims to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030, achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution businesses by 2030, and net-zero emissions from electricity generation by 2050.
In pursuit of this net-zero goal, Duke highlighted a few technologies that it said will be critical.
One is energy storage and the sustainability report states that Duke plans to add 375 MW of energy storage across its businesses over the next five years. The commitment is not limited to battery energy storage, as Duke said it recognizes the role that pumped hydro storage will play in its energy transition. For example, the company plans to increase capacity at its Bad Creek pumped hydro facility in South Carolina by 280 MW through unit upgrades.
A second emerging technology that Duke recognized in its sustainability report is green hydrogen. Duke said it is partnering with Siemens Energy and Clemson University to study the use of hydrogen for energy storage and as a low- or no-carbon fuel source to produce energy at the company’s combined heat and power plant in South Carolina.
The study will include research on hydrogen production, storage, co-firing with natural gas, and multiple forms of hydrogen production, such as electrolysis, which produces hydrogen from water and has no byproducts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/28/consider-these-three-options-if-your-business-is-exploring-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 28, 2021",Consider these three options if your business is exploring solar,"People’s motivations for seeking renewable power for their businesses can be broad: Reducing energy costs, doing their part to save the planet, and even bragging rights are among some of the most popular reasons to go green. Often, it’s a combination of all of those things.
Regardless of what drives an individual in taking the first step towards solar power for their business, it’s that first step that may be enough to stop them in their tracks.
The number of avenues available can be overwhelming. Some of that can be attributed to marketing. Vendors try to differentiate their services from the rest of the pack, which can lead to confusion about the business model behind the marketing.
That is really only part of a bigger issue: some of the concepts in play are understandably foreign to the average person.
Conceding up front that an exception exists to every rule and that not every state fully supports all of these programs, there are three basic models to consider for the majority of potential business consumers:
Keep in mind that other options for off-site customer-owned models exist, as do many other variants that don’t fall neatly in these three buckets. But for now, let’s take a look at the three basic models as options for a business exploring solar.
Customer-owned on-site systems are probably the easiest option for people to understand. The key notion is that the customer finances and owns the system.
From a pure long-term investment standpoint, this model shines. Where many people pause, however, is with the up-front cost that is required, which can run a business tens of thousands of dollars for the average installation. Add in operations and maintenance costs, and the price of entry and ownership may scare many people away. That’s where our next model option comes in.
A simple Google search will likely return the most popular option: third-party on-site systems. These systems are common because they provide a win-win scenario to the consumer: the customer gets their on-site photovoltaic system, energy costs fall, and all without a major up-front cash payment. The system provider is also smiling, because they may have just secured a long-term revenue stream, depending on the arrangement.
These systems often involve a Power Purchase Agreement (through which the owner buys the power that is produced at an agreed rate over a long term) or a “lease to own” model, in which the owner and the system provider split the value of the energy savings over a period of time.
The number of variations in economic models likely to be encountered will roughly equal the number of system providers you review, so doing a true “apples to apples” comparison isn’t going to be a simple task. Short of engaging a professional to assist you in evaluating realistic payback scenarios and potential pitfalls, plan on doing a lot of reading and learning to make sure you are getting the option that fits your needs.
If your motivations for “going green” don’t require you to display your solar panels, your location includes a lot of shade, you are a renter, you don’t want to be locked in to a long-term investment, or any one of a number of other reasons that don’t make on-site solar a good fit, then there is yet another avenue to consider: community solar.
In simple terms, this typically means a ground-mounted photovoltaic system installed on the same utility network as you. The system owner seeks subscribers to buy a portion of the system output, often at a rate that is 10% lower than the subscriber currently pays the utility company. The customer is signing up to buy green power and reduce their electric bill, generally without a long-term commitment. This option has become quite popular for obvious reasons, as it’s a pretty painless way to save money.
These three basic models are really just the entrance to a deep rabbit hole. When you zoom out to the community level, you’ll learn about microgrids and community choice aggregation programs. Zoom out a little farther, and you’ll find large-scale renewable generation that may total hundreds of megawatts.
For the average business consumer, chances are that one of the options—a customer owned on-site system, a third-party on-site system, or a community solar program—are viable and readily available. Having a clear understanding of your businesses needs will help determine the best avenue for renewable power.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/28/watch-doe-will-work-with-11-vulnerable-communities-to-bolster-their-energy-infrastructure/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 28, 2021",Watch: DOE will work with 11 vulnerable communities to bolster their energy infrastructure,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said it will work with 11 remote and island communities around the United States and provide federal assistance to bolster their energy infrastructure, reduce the risk of outages, and improve their future energy and economic outlook.
DOE said that remote coastal and island communities often face high energy costs and vulnerable energy infrastructure due to their increased risk of natural disasters and climate change.
The 11 selected communities are:
Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association (ALFA), Sitka, Alaska – ALFA’s fishing fleet is reliant on diesel fuel imports, the cost of which makes up most of the fishers’ earned income. With ETIPP, they will investigate the possibility of developing a hybrid fuel or electrified fishing fleet to reduce diesel reliance and increase the earning potential of their members.
Dillingham, Alaska – Barge shipments containing the fossil fuels needed to power Dillingham’s islanded grid are a big expense to the community. Through ETIPP, Dillingham and nearby communities will explore the impact and benefits of the Nuyakuk River Hydroelectric Project.
Eastport, Maine – To increase their energy resilience, reduce carbon emissions, and leverage their tidal resource potential, Eastport will explore the infrastructure and siting needs of a microgrid which integrates with the existing regional grid.
Honolulu, Hawaii – To harden their electrical infrastructure from the threat of severe weather, Honolulu will look to develop a hybrid microgrid opportunity map that identifies the best opportunities for this technology to support resilience.
Islesboro, Maine – Due to a vulnerable electric infrastructure, Islesboro relies on the mainland for their electricity, oil, gas, internet, and food. Islesboro is seeking to employ energy efficiency measures for their municipal and residential buildings, as well as researching renewable resource potential and storage options to be more self-sufficient.
Kauai, Hawaii – Kauai will explore alternative and autonomous mobility options for its residents and tourists to move away from fossil-fuel powered single occupancy vehicles and toward a modern, clean transportation system.
Nags Head, North Carolina – Nags Head is vulnerable to severe weather events and long-term, rising trends in global sea level. To build up their resilience and prevent future disasters, Nags Head will explore various renewable energy and energy efficiency deployments and work toward securing 48 to 72 hours of backup generation for facilities used by first responders.
Ocracoke Island, North Carolina – Ocracoke is planning for an electrified future and is exploring electrifying its ferry fleet, which residents are dependent on for transportation to the mainland. ETIPP will analyze the additional grid infrastructure needs that come with an all-electric ferry fleet, and how Ocracoke can best prepare for this future.
Ouzinkie, Alaska – Ouzinkie currently relies on diesel generators and an aging hydroelectric system to power their community but is looking to understand how they can optimize their use of renewables and storage.
Sitka, Alaska – To build up their renewable energy generation to support a growing community with changing needs, Sitka plans to assess the available renewable resources in and around their community while planning for a more modern grid control system.
Wainwright, Alaska – Located in the Arctic Circle, Wainwright is a fully diesel-fired, islanded power grid looking to employ energy efficiency measures and renewable power where possible to decrease its reliance on diesel and increase its community resilience.
These projects are funded by Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Energy Transition Initiative, Solar Energy Technologies Office, Water Power Technologies Office, and are supported by DOE’s Office of Electricity. Experts also will be available from DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
New communities will be able to apply this fall to be in the second group receiving technical assistance.

Bloom Energy and its South Korean partner, SK Engineering & Construction Co., an affiliate of SK Group, deployed 100 kW of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) powered by hydrogen in Ulsan, South Korea, generating zero-carbon onsite electricity.
Bloom Energy first announced its plans to enter the commercial hydrogen market in July 2020, which included an intended 1 MW hydrogen-powered installation with SK E&C by 2022.
The SOFCs use hydrogen byproduct generated by SK to create power without carbon emissions. The fuel cells are supplied, operated, and maintained by Bloom Energy.
Bloom Energy’s hydrogen SOFCs are intended to support South Korea’s Changwon RE100 initiative, as well as other projects. The RE100 is a global renewable energy initiative led by the Climate Group to accelerate the move toward zero-carbon electricity grids. Bloom Energy and SK E&C won a bid in November from the Changwon RE100 to supply Bloom Energy’s hydrogen-powered SOFCs and hydrogen electrolyzers to an industrial complex.
In addition, Bloom Energy intends to supply solid-oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC), which are designed to produce green hydrogen via solar and battery, to South Korea in 2022 as part of the RE100 project. The green hydrogen produced by the SOEC, which is created through electrolysis by converting water and renewable electricity into hydrogen without carbon emissions, will be used to power the hydrogen SOFC.
