When we have power, we don’t give the grid much thought. But that is changing. Much of the nation’s grid is old, with the average age of power plants being over 30 years old and most transmission lines and transformers are over 25 years old. In that time period, much new technology has been added to the grid including solar and energy storage.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is taking seriously the potential threat of cyberattacks on our energy resources. In a speech at the State Department in early February, President Joe Biden announced an “urgent initiative” to improve U.S. capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace.
(Read “‘We have a real adversary’: Work intensifies to safeguard solar from cyber attacks.”)
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is continuing its effort to shore up the solar industry’s resilience against cybersecurity threats. Recently, SEIA and the Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) hosted a half-day virtual summit on the state of cybersecurity in the industry, with emphasis on how these threats must be taken into account from the initial design phase.
SEIA advises that it is more cost-effective to mitigate risks now than to pay the price after the fact by taking just a few, simple, low-cost steps for businesses to take to strengthen their cybersecurity and prevent future attacks, including password protection solutions, multi-factor authentication, and keeping software up to date.
Furthermore, SEIA advises that companies should proactively implement a strong data governance strategy. Data can fall into the wrong hands if it isn’t handled properly, and it is recommended companies dispose of older, unnecessary data. Tips for small business security can be found in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) cyber security toolkit.
What is needed is an industry-wide approach. SunSpec and the Sandia National Laboratories lead a distributed energy resource (DER) Cybersecurity Workgroup to create an industry standard for cybersecurity from the competing frameworks. Interested companies can join the working group to contribute to the development of these critical industry standards and best practices.
Clean energy companies can join a public-private partnership to work together with other businesses and the government to identify vulnerabilities, triage cyber issues, and develop scalable solutions to secure the grid. The Department of Energy’s (DOE) Cyber Testing for Resilient Industrial Control Systems (CyTRICS) is one such partnership between many of the national labs and private businesses.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/13/usda-grant-program-provides-funds-for-rural-agricultural-solar-projects/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MAINE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 13, 2021",USDA grant program provides funds for rural agricultural solar projects,"Two commercial potato farms in Maine are set to receive federal funding from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the installation of solar PV projects. 
The state is set to receive over $24 million in grants and loans to build renewable energy infrastructure in rural areas, like the two solar facilities built for Irving Farms of Caribou and Corey Rioux & Sons of Fort Kent, Maine.  Irving Farms is receiving more than $150,000 to fund a system large enough to power 44 homes, and Rioux & Sons was granted more than $30,000 for a system large enough to power roughly nine homes. The facilities are planned to power the growing, shipping, and packing operations of the two companies. 
These grants came upon successful application to the Rural Energy for America program, which offers guaranteed loan financing and grant funding for small businesses to install renewable energy systems or make energy efficiency upgrades.
(Read: “Which crops pair well with solar?”)
To qualify for the program, applicants must be agricultural producers with at least 50% of their gross income coming from agricultural operations and must be small businesses in eligible rural areas with populations of 50,000 residents or less. Eligible addresses can be checked here. 
Funds can be used to construct solar PV projects, or other renewable energy projects like biomass, geothermal, hydropower, wind, and hydrogen. 
Loan guarantees up to 75% of eligible project costs are available, and up to 25% of project cost can be funded in the form of a grant. Combined funding of loan guarantees and grants can equal up to 75% of eligible project costs.
A study by Purdue University showed that of 400 surveyed farmers, who run operations larger than $500,000 in annual revenue, nearly one-third are aware of solar leasing opportunities for their farmland, and 29% have engaged in discussions with solar companies about leasing their land.
Larger farms benefit from economies of scale and lower prices from larger solar projects. The USDA program offers small farms an opportunity to better compete and to procure lower-cost renewable energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/13/the-value-of-net-metered-solar-is-up-for-vote-in-california/,"NET METERING,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 13, 2021",The value of net-metered solar is up for vote in California,"Sometime soon – maybe as soon as today – the nation’s largest rooftop solar power market, residing in the state with the most grid-connected solar, will vote on how to financially compensate over 10 gigawatts of installed,  net-metered capacity on homes and businesses. California’s vote will be its third iteration of net metering – NEM-3.
The vote is highly charged. At least 17 parties have submitted opinions backed by financial and legal arguments sent directly to California’s Public Utility Commission (CPUC). The whole of the legal filings – thousands of pages of documents – can be found on the CPUC website.
Various parties are arguing in favor of an 80% reduction to solar’s net-metering value, as well as monthly fees of $75 for homeowners with solar systems attached to the grid. Commercial customers could be facing fees from $800 to $3,400 per month. These fees would negate most of the savings for installing solar power.
Included among the list of groups in favor of strong net metering compensation are the California Solar & Energy Storage Association (CALSSA), the Clean Coalition, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Vote Solar, the California Energy Storage Association, and others. Those submitting proposals that are less supportive of rooftop solar include the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, multiple wind power associations, as well as the power companies.
CALSSA submitted a 255 page document, which outlines their own proposals for NEM-3. They propose a gradual reduction in the export compensation rates, as well as tying those reductions to the achievement of specific adoption targets. They also wish to shield low-income customers and community-owned projects from reductions to their compensation, and they propose that NEM-2 should be retained by all customers who qualify for the various low-income programs offered in California.
Revel Energy’s graphic is based on CALSSA’s estimates of how the value of net metered solar electricity could change as a result of the power company’s suggested NEM 3.0 model.

CALSSA’s submission strongly rejects the pro-transmission parties’ proposals. They point out that these proposals have fatal flaws, including violations of state and federal law, lack of precedent, and the significant impairment to the future of distributed energy resources. They also cite significant consumer protection concerns, the total lack of any transition period, a dramatic reduction in equity for ratepayers, severely extended payback periods, and a failure to understand the realities of the energy storage market.
Analysis from Sage Consulting shows the value of net metered electricity will fall in comparison to the two prior versions of net metering.
Sage notes that part of NEM-3 is the goal of installing more energy storage with solar, rather than solar power on its own. Instead of incentivising energy storage, the more extreme proposals would more closely follow Hawaii’s version of rejecting net metered electricity altogether, with no solar rooftop exports allowed due to the very high solar penetration.

The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has generally said that they support large scale solar power over rooftop solar because of the higher cost per unit when installing rooftop solar. However, they do support distributed, rooftop solar power.
The group released the graphic below, which shows where their proposal falls into the broader range of submissions versus the current net metering structure.

The driving logic behind the NRDC’s proposal is the “cost shift” argument. The logic is that full credit net metering (NEM 1.0) was originally intended to drive a nascent industry that needed the support – and that was so small that it had little effect on the broader power grid technically or financially. The goal of NEM 2.0 was to refine the system by adding time of use charges for solar, and to adjust the compensation as the volume of solar grew.
The NRDC is now arguing that rooftop solar – along with large scale solar – has reached a point where it is now strong enough, and contains sufficient volume, that the cost shift is becoming real, and is beginning to negatively affect those who have not installed solar power.
Thus their proposal, which they believe “strikes the right balance” between the more extreme proposals of the monopoly utilities and the large scale focused wind companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/13/domestic-manufacture-of-solar-modules-trackers-inverters-incentivized-in-build-back-better/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 13, 2021","Domestic manufacture of solar modules, trackers, inverters incentivized in Build Back Better","The Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the Build Back Better (BBB) infrastructure bill, and in it are up-front incentives for the domestic manufacturing of solar PV wafers, cells, modules, trackers, and inverters. Committee chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) is expected to lead conversations as the committee holds bipartisan meetings on the bill.
Included in the bill is an incentive for the manufacture of thin film PV or crystalline PV cells. The incentive would pay $0.04 per watt DC capacity of the cell. PV wafers would be offered $12 per square meter, and solar-grade polysilicon is offered $3 per kilogram U.S.-made solar modules are offered an incentive of $0.07 per watt.
Trackers have been added to the bill. Structural fasteners would qualify for $2.28 per kilogram, longitudinal purlins $0.87 per kilogram, and structural fasteners $2.28 per kilogram.
Inverters were also a new addition to BBB. Microinverters, with capacity of 650 W or less can receive $0.11 per watt, while other residential inverters with 20 kW capacity or less are offered $0.065 per watt. Commercial inverters that range between 20 kW and 170 kW would be eligible for an incentive of two cents per watt.
Utility-scale inverters with capacity between 170 kW and 1 MW of capacity would be offered an upfront incentive of $0.015/W if BBB is passed, and central inverters greater than 1 MW in capacity would be eligible for an incentive of $0.025/W.

Incentives are viewed as a way to bring solar manufacturing back onshore. In a recent interview with pv magazine, module producer Maxeon said that it is considering a 3 GW cell production plant in the U.S., but is waiting on a Title XVII loan from the Department of Energy, and the passing of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. If passed, the company said it could begin producing cells in the U.S. as soon as 2023.
Ossoff’s bill would offer tax credits for several steps along the PV supply chain, including for the domestic manufacture of modules, cells, and solar-grade polysilicon, as well as trackers and inverters. The incentives would be available through 2028 with a phase-down over the following two years. On November 19th the bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, and it next faces review by the Senate.

Under development by Savion, the Martin County Solar Project is a 200 MW solar project being constructed on 1,200 acres of the former Martiki coal mine site in Martin County, near the Kentucky-West Virginia border.
Construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2022 and it is expected to achieve commercial operation early 2024. During construction, the project is anticipated to create between 250 and 300 temporary construction jobs, in addition to 11 full-time Kentucky jobs, including eight in Martin County. Moreover, the temporary construction workers will all receive certification upon the project’s completion, allowing them to pursue further careers in solar construction.
This is especially important in Kentucky, as most of the workers expected to build the project will be displaced former coal workers. Creating new employment opportunities for displaced fossil fuel workers in renewable energy has been one of the paramount goals of the Biden Administration’s energy transition plans.
The project is the largest in Kentucky known to pv magazine, unseating the former record holder: ACCIONA’s 188 MW Fleming County Solar Project, currently under construction.
While Kentucky has installed just under 65 MW of solar to date, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the state’s energy landscape is set to change rapidly in the coming months and years.
In October, pv magazine USA reported that Kentucky has an 815 MW pipeline of solar projects in the five years, including multiple projects above 100 MW in capacity. These project include the aforementioned Martin and Fleming County installations, as well as a three-site, 125 MW project being developed by utility LG&E KU, and a 173 MW solar, 30 MW/120 MWh storage system sourced under the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Green Invest program. That project will feed its generation to Facebook and General Motors.
