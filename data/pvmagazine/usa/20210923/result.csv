With a roughly $61 million investment, Ubiquity will repurpose 800,000 square-feet of space at the former campus. The manufacturing facility will create up to 150 highly skilled jobs once the campus is entirely operational, which is expected by the end of 2022.
In the project’s first phase, it is expected that the increase in capacity gained from the former-IBM site will enable Ubiquity Solar to produce 1.5 MW of advanced space-grade PV cells for aerospace customers and 350 MW of utility-grade PV cells for the power generation market in 2022.
Ubiquity Solar CEO Ian MacLellan said New York State was selected for the first phase of U.S. expansion because it is business-friendly, has a skilled workforce, and is committed to taking strong actions on climate and sustainability.
Empire State Development will assist the project with up to $3 million through the Excelsior Jobs Tax Credit Program, to be granted based on actual job creation.
“The Southern Tier has become a hub for next generation energy research, innovation and advanced manufacturing, and Ubiquity Solar’s decision to establish its U.S. operations in Endicott is yet another indicator of the region’s bright future,” Governor Hochul said. “It is through forward-thinking projects like this that we are helping to spur economic development across Upstate New York, ensuring a more sustainable future for generations to come.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/23/report-calls-on-texas-again-to-winterize-its-energy-infrastructure/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2021",Report calls on Texas…again…to winterize its energy infrastructure,"The electric and natural gas industries need to strengthen their winterization and cold weather preparedness and coordination to prevent a recurrence of the unprecedented February 2021 power outages to millions of people during the February 2021 freeze in Texas and the Midwest.
That was the assessment of a preliminary report presented at a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) meeting by a joint inquiry team of staff from FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and its regional entities. It echoed a similar call for action that came a decade ago after a similar winter storm also disrupted power production and delivery across Texas. The recommendations that followed the 2011 storm were largely ignored.
The most recent report reviewed what happened during the February 2021 freeze and outlined recommendations, including mandatory electric reliability standards, to prevent its recurrence.

FERC Chairman Rich Glick noted that a similar inquiry took place after Texas experienced extreme cold weather in 2011, but that those recommendations were not acted on. “This time,” he said, “we must take these recommendations seriously, and act decisively, to ensure the bulk power system doesn’t fail the next time extreme weather hits.”
The February freeze triggered the loss of 61,800 MW of electric generation, as 1,045 individual generating units experienced 4,124 outages, derates, or failures to start. It reduced natural gas production, with the largest effects felt in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, where combined daily production fell more than 50% to an estimated 20 billion cubic feet per day.
The assessment pointed to freezing of generator components and fuel issues as the top two major causes of generator outages, derates, or failures to start. The identified causes in the preliminary report affected generating units across all fuel types. Of the 1,045 generating units affected, 57% were natural gas-fired units that primarily faced fuel supply challenges.
In a statement, Sean Gallagher, vice president of state and regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association said that solar and storage “will be a big part of the solution” in Texas. “We look forward to working with state and federal leaders to continue to make it easier and faster to get solar projects online.”

In March, a white paper said that wind generation over-performed compared with expectations and that solar recovered quickly after storm clouds passed. Solar did better than models predicted and “contributed to keeping more customers with power as the grid climbed out of its depths of load shedding.” The white paper was prepared by Colorado-based grid analysis firm Vibrant Clean Energy.
The firm said that wind underperformed during a few periods over the course of the days-long storm, but that this underperformance “only lasted a few hours at a time.” It added that 40,000 MW of storage under a “high renewables” scenario would have met all of the February blackout requirements “with room to spare.”
The preliminary FERC/NERC report made nine recommendations, including changes to mandatory reliability standards that build on standards developed in the wake of a 2019 joint inquiry into a prior cold weather event. Among those are:
The preliminary report also recommends that generator owners be provided the opportunity for compensation and recovery of the costs of building or retrofitting to operate to a specific temperature. It also called on Congress, state legislatures, and jurisdictional regulators to require gas facilities to prepare and follow cold weather preparedness plans.

The products range from 10 kW to 10 MW, and offer compatibility with third-party components, the company said.
Tigo has previously worked as a module-level power electronics (MLPE) provider. The new EI inverters offer energy conversion for home consumption or export to the grid. When used in combination with Tigo’s MLPE products, the inverters are expected to provide module-level optimization, monitoring and rapid shutdown.
The inverters are available in 7.6 kW and 11.4 kW configurations, and feature up to 200% DC oversizing,  and 50V starting voltage. Built-in Wi-Fi is included, and an option to add cellular communication is avaiable.
The EI battery provides energy bill management for time-of-use rate plans, and backup power during outages. It can be configured for either whole-home or critical load backup. The system has a usable capacity of 9.0 kWh and is scalable up to 40 kWh.
Continuous power of 5 kW and 6 kW of peak power are available in the battery. It can operate between 14-122 degrees Fahrenheit and is warranted for 11 years or 6,000 cycles.
The Tigo EI platform provides system diagnosis, over-the-air software upgrades, and production monitoring.
Over the past year, Silicon Valley’s Tigo also released updates to its MLPE products to accommodate modules up to 700 W. Recently, the company partnered with Advanced Solar and Electric, an installer with over 4,000 customers in south Texas.

The rack is designed not to compromise a roof’s structural integrity, which relies on its ballasts for stability.
The added weight of solar can often surpass a membrane roof’s physical limit, said Roll-A-Rack. To address this, the company developed a 12-inch metal channel rack that is distributed across existing roof ballast while securing the solar panels.
The rack can be as thin as 22-gauge, and roll-formed. Roll-A-Rack said it supports 50 psf snow loads and 37.5 psf wind uplift. The company said automated install is feasible for its product.
Roll-A-Rack said it is working to line up developers or installers to test the product. The first 100 kW of racking would be provided for free. The company also said it would perform wind uplift analysis to determine ballast requirements. 
Product development was funded in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Technologies Office.

KORE is a U.S.-based manufacturer of high-energy-density lithium-ion pouch cells and module configurations for the electric vehicle and energy sector applications. ZEV is also a U.S.-based manufacturer of electric powertrains for fleet customers. ZEV is working to advance EV thermal technologies including an advanced battery cell passive thermal management system intended to deliver power conservation and optimize battery cell performance.
Under the agreement, the KORE and ZEV teams focus on three areas: thermal management, safety, and module and pack configurability towards higher energy and power densities. KORE will provide ZEV with battery cells and supplies for their electrification solution through 2030.
KORE currently has an annual production capacity of 2 GWh and expects to expand to a total annual capacity of 18 GWh by the end of 2030.
