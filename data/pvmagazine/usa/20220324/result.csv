The construction of this 11GWh capacity site is set to begin in the second quarter of this year, with plans for mass production slated in the second half of 2024. The cylindrical batteries will be supplied to EV manufacturers as well as electric tool companies in North America.
Electric vehicles are driving demand for lithium-ion phosphate batteries, according to London-based, S&P Global-owned IHS, which predicted a battery module price increase of 5% this year will drive up the overall cost of stationary battery projects around 3%. The analyst recorded price rises of 10-20% for lithium-ion batteries in the “later months of 2021,” it predicted price tags will not return to a downward trajectory for another two years and even that development will depend on manufacturers expanding production capacity and seeing off demand from EV makers.
LGES’s investment decision comes on the back of growing demand of cylindrical-type batteries particularly in the North American market. LG notes that EV startups using cylindrical batteries are on the rise in the region, while demand for applications that use cylindrical-type batteries, such as electric tools, increases in line with the wireless trend. Tesla is one EV brand that uses cylindrical batteries, with Elon Musk stating in a tweet that …”probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use.”
LG reports that its new manufacturing facility, located just outside of Phoenix, will be a fully automated smart factory with remote support, manufacturing intelligence, logistics automation, and more. The Arizona plant aims to establish LGES’s presence in North America cylindrical battery market while actively considering additional production in the future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/24/hyundai-sonata-hybrid-is-equipped-with-a-solar-roof/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOUTH KOREA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 24, 2022",Hyundai Sonata hybrid is equipped with a solar roof,"The newest model of the Hyundai Sonata hybrid is equipped with a 205W solar PV array that directly charges the car’s battery. It is estimated the PV will add about 2.5 miles of range per day. The solar panels feature 22.8% efficiency.
While this number may not jump off the page as impressive, the solar PV marks an improvement in efficiency for the vehicle that can add up to being significant. Two and a half miles per day for a year comes out to 912.5 “free” miles. Based on an average commuter’s yearly mileage of 10,000 miles, this represents an over 9% improvement to fuel efficiency.
Hyundai said its solar array system comes with efficient design advantages over competitor cars like the solar-roofed Toyota Prius. The Prius has a separate solar battery, requiring two stages of conversions to charge the high voltage driving battery and the auxiliary “starter” battery. The Sonata only converts once, directly feeding power through the panels, to a maximum power point tracker charge controller, and directly into the auxiliary batteries and drive batteries. This leads to a more efficient use of photovoltaic generation, said Hyundai.
The automaker said that the solar roof lessens the burden on the engine and prevents battery discharge. The Korea Insurance Development Institute estimates 4 out of 10 emergency on-road services relate to battery discharge, as parked car electrical systems require an average of about 720mAh per day, and black box cameras, which are increasingly being integrated in cars, require an additional 12,000mAh. With the solar roof, one hour of charging can provide 14,000mAh, supplying a car’s powered-off battery needs for the whole day.
While the range added by the PV is not dramatic, efficiency improvements are just that – improvements. Hyundai does not attempt to “greenwash” the product and recognizes that this is not the core of the vehicle’s power, but rather an ancillary system that provides a handful of benefits.
The solar roof-integrated “Limited” trim for the Sonata is rated at 47 miles per gallon and has a 192 horsepower engine. It has autonomous features like remote parking assist, highway driving assist, and has cameras for blind-spot views. Through an app, drivers can access the Sonata using their mobile phone as a key.

In January, Palmetto’s software and mapping division, Mapdwell, acquired in 2021, charted the solar potential of 107 million rooftops across the United States, roughly 75% of all US buildings, as part of a larger company goal to  map the solar potential and derive energy load profiles of every building in the country. Incubated at MIT and licensed to Palmetto, the software instantly assesses any building’s rooftop potential for solar energy production and battery storage and provides a baseline energy load profile.
Because of this prior venture, the company adds that 95% of residential rooftops across Utah can be assessed for solar panel installation through Palmetto’s clean energy platform.
The data provided by Mapdwell also enabled Palmetto to create Instant Proposal, a service that enables a solar system proposal to be generated and designed within 60 seconds of a Palmetto sales member entering a homeowner’s utility information into the Palmetto system.
The existing comprehensive rooftop solar potential and  Instant Proposal service Palmetto offers should help to company to establish footing in the Utah rooftop solar market, though said market has not been the most historically active. While Utah is home to roughly 2.6GW of installed solar, the vast majority of that capacity has come from the state’s utility-scale solar projects, according to data collected by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Of the 107 operational solar companies in the state, provided by SEIA, 46 are operating as installers and developers, though 45 companies are unlisted by the agency. Many of those 45 ungrouped companies are listed as service if financial service providers, but a few installers are also included, so Palmetto may have more competition than what appears at an initial glance.
“This is an exciting step for Palmetto as we accelerate our growth across the United States,” said Palmetto Chairman, Founder, and CEO, Chris Kemper.  “Residential solar installations in Utah have increased by 20% since 2021, making expansion into Utah a key part of our mission to ensure that choosing clean energy sources is a right, not a privilege.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/24/new-lithium-battery-cells-and-packs-for-commercial-vehicles/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 24, 2022",New lithium battery cells and packs for commercial vehicles,"Houston, Texas-based Microvast, a publicly traded lithium battery provider, announced the release of two new lithium-ion battery cells and upgraded “Gen 4” battery packs designed for commercial and specialty vehicles. The company said it expects high-volume production to begin in 2023. 
The new generation of battery packs offer similar dimensions to Microvast’s previous generation of batteries, but now carry up to 20% more energy and power. The packs integrate enhanced safety features for thermal management at both the cell and pack level. Microvast said it expects the batteries will be certified by all cross-regional battery standards. 
The 48Ah and 53.5Ah cells are designed for the diverse technical requirements of commercial and specialty vehicles. Optimal battery design is challenging in this space, said Microvast, as engineers must choose between inherent tradeoffs between power and energy inputs. Both new pouch cells share the same dimensions and are can be integrated into the new battery packs. Microvast said this offers flexibility for customers, choosing between standardized cells for either high-power or high-energy requirements without adjusting powertrain design.
“The new cells enable our customers to easily optimize vehicle design in terms of energy density and cycle life, delivering improved overall performance and reducing total cost of ownership while preserving fast-charging capabilities. We expect these next generation battery cells to become pivotal revenue drivers for our business going forward.” Yang Wu Microvast president and chief executive officer.
The MpCO-48Ah is designed with 10% higher energy density than its predecessor, and carries 3C fast charging ability, and a life cycle beyond 7,000 cycles. The HpCo-53.5Ah cell’s energy density is even higher at 235Wh/kg, offers 1C charging, and can be charged for 5,000 cycles.
Microvast vertically integrates its business from core battery chemistry raw materials for the cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, to final pack assembly. In addition to EV batteries, it has capabilities in energy storage and battery components supply. The company was founded in 2006.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/24/hundreds-of-sheep-to-help-maintain-strathmore-solar-installation-in-alberta/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 24, 2022",Hundreds of sheep to help maintain Strathmore Solar installation in Alberta,"Construction of the Strathmore Solar installation in Alberta was completed on schedule with commercial operations announced this week. And as soon as grazing season begins, sheep will arrive on site.  Eventually there could be 400 to 600 sheep from the Whispering Cedars Ranch who will be tasked with sustainably managing the land by keeping the grass cut.
“Solar has been historically looked at as lost land, but for us it is an opportunity as first-generation farmers to access this land to produce food and fiber, while also supporting renewable energy.’” – Janna and Ryan Greir, Whispering Cedars Ranch
Grazing sheep at solar installations has been found to have benefits over and above keeping the grass cut. In a Temple University study, researchers found that managed sheep grazing on an acre of recovering agricultural soil with native plants installed may sequester one ton of carbon per year, which may accumulate for 12 to 15 years before reaching saturation.
When the Greirs were asked if they have had experience grazing sheep among solar panels, Janna said that this is a first for them. “We have fellow shepherds who do this in Ontario who have been mentors for us. We have been practicing this on our 100 acre ranch for the past 4 years using a grid system and rotational grazing,” Janna said. “The only difference between home and the solar site are the solar panels, and we can manipulate both the sheep and the electric fencing to provide vegetation management. “
Sheep-plus-solar is also a first for Capital Power. While it would seem that it might be difficult to keep sheep to a maintenance schedule, Capital Power has a plan. The sheep will be kept in 1-5 acre paddocks via electric fencing, and will move throughout the site through a series of mapped out paddocks via adaptive multi-paddock grazing (a form of rotational grazing). This will ensure adequate grazing, trampling, and management of the grass. Each year will be different, but a grazing plan (including paddock size, number of animals, etc.) will allow for adequate maintenance of the site.
The installation in Alberta, owned by Capital Power, is located on 320 acres of leased land owned by the Town of Strathmore, and it consists of 109,174 LONGi bifacial solar panels mounted on a DuraTrack HZ v3 horizontal single-axes tracking system. Capital Power is a wholesale power producer headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta. This is the company’s first solar facility in Canada.
“As we work to power a sustainable future for people and planet, this project represents another step on our pathway to net carbon neutrality by 2050 and we’re excited to partner with TELUS to support their decarbonization goals too,”  said said Brian Vaasjo, President and CEO for Capital Power.
The offtaker is Telus Corporation, a communications and information technology company. having signed a 25-year power purchase agreement for all the energy and renewable energy credits generated by the facility. This is Telus Corporation’s fourth PPA in Alberta, moving the company one step closer to its goals 100% of its electricity procured from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2025 and of 100% net carbon neutrality in its operations by 2035.

Adding an average of 10GW of solar per year would require doubling California’s highest level to date, which was 5GW in 2016 as reported by the trade group SEIA. Last year, the state’s grid operator CAISO processed 5GW of interconnection requests for utility-scale solar, while the state installed 1.7GW of small-scale solar. Adding an average of 5GW of battery storage per year would require a sharper ramp in installations. The CAISO grid region now has 2.6GW of battery capacity, while CAISO completed full interconnection studies for 7GW of battery storage last year.
The consultancy E3’s presentation did not mention wind power as a generation resource, while in a similar study for Los Angeles, NREL included wind power.

NREL’s analysis of how Los Angeles could achieve 100% renewables found that the city’s municipal utility could reach a high-electrification scenario by 2035 by installing about 5GW of utility-scale solar, 2.5GW of customer-sited solar and 4.5GW of wind power, as shown at right (from figure 24 in chapter 6).
Because Los Angeles has 1/10 the population of California, those capacity totals for Los Angeles by 2035 may be comparable, for a similar high-electrification scenario, to the required annual capacity additions statewide in each of the 10-plus years through 2035.
Invited to comment on the aggressive renewables scenario for California, Jin Noh with the California Energy Storage Alliance said achieving the higher level of solar and storage deployment would require streamlining interconnection and permitting, proactive planning where possible, and minimizing regulatory risk, “such as when tariffs or resource adequacy rules change, that make it difficult to finance and invest in the level of scale needed.”
NREL similarly advised the Los Angeles municipal utility that if it pursues a target of 100% renewables by 2035, “success would require an accelerated schedule for renewable energy procurement, permitting, siting, and workforce training.” NREL noted that its 2035 scenario would reach 98% carbon-free electricity by 2030, but would keep adding “significant” new capacity through 2035 to meet the final 2% of energy needs during extended periods of low wind and solar generation, as gas units are retired.
E3’s results showed the need for 47GW of solar associated with electrolysis demand to produce hydrogen for seasonal storage, in the scenario with 100% renewables with electrification. E3 did not specify whether that amount of solar was included in its projected need for annual solar additions. If not, E3’s projected need for annual solar additions through 2035 would be greater than 10GW.
E3’s analysis used the PATHWAYS model, which is designed for studies of economy-wide decarbonization, and which models the electric sector with hourly treatment.
E3 also modeled three other scenarios for the California Air Resources Board, as the board updates a scoping plan that will include cost-effective policies to meet the state’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. The scoping plan will address all sources of greenhouse gases, not just the electricity sector.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/24/energy-storage-installations-set-new-records-despite-supply-chain-issues/,"COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS,PUERTO RICO,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 24, 2022",Energy storage installations set new records despite supply chain issues,"Despite not quite hitting the numbers anticipated, the US energy storage market set a new record in the fourth quarter of 2021, with new system installations totaling 4,727MWh, according to Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) latest US Energy Storage Monitor report, released today.
And it could have been so much more. Due to supply chain challenges, over 2GW of grid-scale capacity originally slated to come online in Q4 2021 were delayed to 2022 and 2023.

Grid-scale 
Annual deployments of grid-scale storage nearly tripled year-over-year to 3GW / 9.2GWh. An additional 770MW of late-stage capacity that was previously delayed is expected to come online, positioning Q1 2022 to deliver up to 1.7GW of capacity. These projects saw impressive deployments in certain Southern states, as well as from traditional market leaders this quarter such as California and Texas, where projects have an average duration of around three hours. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that supply chain pressures and interconnection-related delays will persist through 2024.
Projects are still being built at record-setting pace remain on track for exponential growth, despite supply chain and pricing issues. Module and BOS prices have caused some projects to be delayed while developers wait for capex to stabilize.
Residential
Residential storage had its strongest quarter to date with 123MW installed, (the previous quarterly record was 110MW in Q1 2021). Despite limited battery supply, the segment still managed to grow 85% between 2020 and 2021 in MWh terms, and this is in part due to solar-plus-storage sales in markets outside of California. The national annual total of installed residential energy storage amounted to 436MW.
By 2026, annual installations in the residential segment are expected to hit 2GW / 5.4GWh, with California, Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida leading the way. The residential forecast assumes that the NEM 3.0 proposed decision in California will go into effect as written, although WoodMac analysts said that this is not a certain outcome. If it does not, the forecast would be reduced ~5% annually from 2023.
“2021 was yet another record for the U.S. energy storage market, with annual installations of multiple gigawatts for the first time,” said Jason Burwen, Vice President for Energy Storage at American Clean Power. “Even in the face of continued macro-economic headwinds, interconnection delays, and lack of proactive federal policy, increasing demand for resilient clean energy and volatility in the price of fuel-based generation will drive energy storage deployment forward.”
Non-residential
The non-residential storage segment delivered 131MWh in the fourth quarter resulting in 162MW / 350MWh of total annual deployments in 2021. Segment demand was driven by increased storage attachment rates within the community solar markets of New York and Massachusetts. The non-residential/community solar market is forecast to near 1GW annually in 2026.

Costs
Higher costs for raw materials and transportation have undercut system component price gains experienced over recent years. Specifically, the increased cost of raw materials resulted in battery module prices increase the most among all system components. Increased standardization has helped hold BOS steady,  with few system components increasing, such as inverters and GSU.
The report found that despite policy uncertainty, the California storage market remains resilient, and by 2027, California is forecast to remain the largest residential storage market, with three-and-a-half times more storage installed annually in 2027 compared to 2021. Puerto Rico is also a strong market, as solar-plus-storage is embraced as a defense against the widescale power outages experienced in recent weather events.
“Puerto Rico’s position in the residential US solar-plus-storage market comes as no surprise, and demonstrates how outages can drive battery adoption, with thousands of new residential installs emerging each quarter and competition increasing between local installers,” said Chloe Holden, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.
