The 200 MW project is expected to reach commercial operations in 2024. 
The project is comprised of 500,000 solar modules and is estimated to produce enough power for 40,000 New Mexico homes. It is expected to offset 192,156 kg of carbon emissions that would otherwise have been produced by a comparable coal plant.
The coal plant, operated by Tri-State and closed in 2020, marks the first solar project to start construction under the utility’s Responsible Energy Plan announced the same year.
“We continue to reinvest in the local community and advance our goal of having 50% of the energy used by our members coming from renewable resources in 2025 and meeting the 2030 renewable energy requirements of the Energy Transition Act five years early,” said Duane Highley, chief executive officer, Tri-State.
Origis Energy acquired the development rights for the Escalante Solar Project from TurningPoint Energy, the original developer. Located in Continental Divide Electric Cooperative’s (CDEC’s) service territory, the project will serve all of Tri-State’s members, including CDEC and its other ten members in New Mexico.
“CohnReznick Capital helped engage us with Origis and we ultimately partnered with Origis on this project because they are uniquely qualified to deliver on utility-scale solar projects in today’s business environment,” said Jared Schoch, president of TurningPoint Energy.
Constuction services are being provided by Albuquerque-headquartered Gridworks. Peak construction is expected to employ 400 people, and upon completion four to six long-term on-site jobs will remain.
“While the solar project cannot replace jobs at the retired coal plant, the addition of new tax base for McKinley County and our local school district is impactful, and we appreciate Tri-State and the project partners for bringing Escalante Solar to our region,” said Robert E. Castillo, chief executive officer of CDEC.
The project negotiated an Industrial Revenue Bond with McKinley County, N.M., which will generate approximately $7,100,000 in taxes to the County and $2,400,000 in taxes to the School District over the life of the project.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/30/model-procedures-for-fixing-distributed-solar-and-storage-interconnection/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Model procedures for fixing distributed solar and storage interconnection,"Interconnection processes for distributed solar and storage across the 50 states have much room for improvement, as the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and Vote Solar highlighted in their report “Freeing the Grid,” which graded each state’s process, as shown in the image above.
To help states achieve faster, lower-cost interconnection of distributed energy resources (DERs), IREC has published model interconnection procedures that any state could adopt to upgrade its DER interconnection process.
The procedures are based on best practices already in use nationwide, IREC says in an introduction to the document, and are intended to “save money and time for consumers, developers and utilities alike.”
The model procedures “can serve different functions depending on what is needed for a state,” said Gwendolyn Brown, IREC’s vice president of communications. “They can be adopted word-for-word or with modest changes; they can be used as a starting point for discussions and modified more or less, depending on the state’s needs; or specific provisions can be pulled from the model procedures and inserted into existing state rules.”
If the model procedures themselves were scored against the “Freeing the Grid” criteria, “they would get an A,” Brown said.
IEEE 1547-2018
The model procedures advise that any current state rules and utility interconnection procedures that are based on the IEEE Standard 1547-2003 “will need to be updated” to reflect the new IEEE Standard 1547-2018, which “will transform how DERs interact with and function on” the grid.
The new IEEE standard requires DERs to be capable of providing specific grid-supportive functionalities relating to voltage, frequency, communications, and controls, says IREC’s document. The voltage functionalities for DERs meeting the new IEEE standard are known as volt-var and volt-watt.
Once the IEEE-1547 functions are widely utilized, they “will enable higher penetration of DERs on the grid, while maintaining grid safety and reliability and providing new grid and consumer benefits,” IREC says. IREC promotes the use of voltage regulation functions “sooner rather than later” to avoid a high volume of DERs that do not provide such capabilities, Brown said.
In Hawaii, distributed solar has reached a substantial percentage of generation largely through the use of the volt-var setting for all new installations; Hawaii also allows enabling the volt-watt setting for customers who choose it. California uses the volt-var and volt-watt settings in all cases, although the volt-watt decision involved a controversy over consumer protection, IREC has reported.
Batteries
IREC said that “many states’ interconnection procedures have been updated to ensure efficient interconnection of energy storage,” and given that experience base, the model procedures now include “important updates” for interconnecting solar-plus-storage and standalone storage. Those updates emerged from an IREC-led project to advance the use of distributed batteries through publication of a “BATRIES Toolkit” last year.
IREC also flagged four other categories of important updates in the model procedures, compared to IREC’s previous model procedures published in 2019.
Innovations
IREC acknowledged that the “existing best practices” captured in the model procedures do not always reflect innovations that have not yet been “sufficiently deployed and tested.” For example, the model procedures “do not yet fully incorporate the use of hosting capacity analyses,” IREC says, “although IREC strongly recommends states begin adopting robust hosting capacity analyses.”
Also, as some states have developed group study processes “to increase study efficiency and more fairly allocate upgrade costs,” IREC said it plans to analyze group study practices and potential challenges in a paper it expects to publish this fall.
Webinar
IREC’s model procedures are titled “Model Interconnection Procedures: 2023 Edition.”
IREC will host a webinar on September 7 to discuss the model procedures.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/30/funding-for-second-life-ev-battery-materials-manufacturer-reaches-4-billion/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,NEVADA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Funding for second-life EV battery materials manufacturer reaches $4 billion,"Redwood Materials announced the close of a $1 billion Series D funding, co-led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Capricorn’s Technology Impact Fund, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Redwood has now raised nearly $2 billion in equity capital.
The funds, which build on a $2 billion conditional loan from the Department of Energy, are expected to be used to continue building the company’s capacity, expanding the domestic battery materials supply chain.
Redwood manufactures anode and cathode materials, in part from recycled materials, which are used for the EV battery market. Together, these components amount to nearly 80% of the material cost of a lithium-ion battery, and currently they are exclusively manufactured overseas. According to the company, U.S. battery cell manufacturers are estimated to offshore more than $150 billion in value by 2030.
The company said on average it can recover at least 95% of the critical battery elements (including lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper), and use these metals to manufacture anode and cathode components.
“We are relentlessly focused on expanding our collection of end-of-life batteries, increasing our refining capability to recover higher quantities, and harnessing their value to make the most sustainable products,” said Redwood.
The company has a manufacturing facility that is already built and operational in northern Nevada, currently producing anode copper foil. Panasonic is the first customer for copper foil at the Nevada factory.
“As the electrification megatrend continues to accelerate, building a local sustainable battery materials supply chain is more important now than ever,” said Sebastien Gagnon, a managing director in private equity, Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
Redwood expects to produce 100 GWh per year of battery materials, enough to produce more than 1 million EVs each year. The DOE Loans Program Office estimates that 1 million EVs will reduce annual gasoline consumption by over 395 million gallons and avoiding more than 3.5 million tons of CO2 emissions each year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/30/california-electricity-pricing-exploded-in-the-last-three-years-far-outpacing-inflation/,"MARKETS,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 30, 2023","California electricity pricing exploded in the last three years, far outpacing inflation","Energy Toolbase, a financial modeling platform specializing in solar and energy storage that collects nationwide electricity tariffs and rates, has published an in-depth analysis on the inflation of California’s electricity rates over the past decade. The analysis found that the state’s electricity inflation far outpaced generation inflation, averaging 15.3% from the 2020 through 2023. This surge came on the heels of a comparatively modest six-year span, which saw an average inflation of 1.6%.
Over the whole 9-year period, retail electricity bills from California’s three major utilities rose by at least 47%, with San Diego Gas & Electric spiking 104%. In contrast, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 28% over the same period.

Highlighting how nice we had it from 2014 to 2020, California’s residential and commercial electricity bill prices closely aligned with broader economic trends: the CPI rose by 9.85%, while electricity pricing increased by 9.6%. Essentially meaning that the price of electricity stayed the same when accounting for inflation.
However, from January 2020 through the latest available CPI data in July 2023, electricity prices in the state soared, posting a total inflation of 45.9%. This electricity pricing inflation rate is 271% higher than the general inflation rate of 16.9% over the same period.
Although recent CPI suggests a 20% deflation in energy commodities and falling electricity prices in many markets, these trends haven’t materialized in California.
Energy Toolbase conducted the analysis to help solar developers better predict future electricity prices. The study recommended using a compound annual growth rate of 3.9% to 7.4%, depending on the utility, in the Electricity Cost Escalation field of its ETB Developer software.

Having reliable electricity inflation data is valuable not only for creating robust financial models for customers bt ualso for mitigating risks. This is especially relevant as third-party lease companies have faced legal challenges when their projected electricity inflation rates fell flat.
Energy Toolbase also highlighted changing financial returns on solar investments in California due to NEM-3. Solar exports under this new standard are estimated to be roughly 75% less valuable on average compared to NEM-2.
The study identified five major drivers of electricity price increases in California. Fuel and energy costs play a critical role, especially given that recently volatile methane gas prices fuel half of the state’s electricity generation. Demand shifts, spurred by vehicle electrification, population growth, and economic conditions, are also affecting prices. Regulatory changes, like the Public Purpose Program surcharge, and environmental mandates such as renewable portfolio standards and grid modernization, impose further costs. Infrastructure maintenance and upgrades also play a role, sometimes offset by solar investments. Notably, California’s investor-owned utilities spent nearly $11 billion in 2021 and 2022 for wildfire mitigation and grid enhancements, some of which also went to settlements. These costs are expected to be borne by ratepayers over the next 15 years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/30/allume-energy-receives-1-5-million-bridge-investment-to-deploy-solshare-technology-in-southeast-u-s/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Allume Energy receives $1.5 million bridge investment to deploy SolShare technology in Southeast U.S.,"Australia-headquartered Allume Energy announced it received a $1.5 million bridge investment from Elemental Excelerator and the Schmidt Family Foundation, which Allume plans to use to deploy its technology and bring rooftop solar to more than 4,000 residents in the Southeast U.S., beginning with solar projects in Florida, Georgia and Mississippi. 
Solar PV systems tend to be designed for one-to-one connections and deploying them in multi-unit buildings can pose unique challenges. Asset owners pay for the systems, but residents benefit from lower utility costs, according to Mel Bergsneider, executive account manager at Allume Energy. Solar PV systems also have a lifespan that exceeds the short-term stays of apartment renters. 
The company’s behind-the-meter technology, called SolShare, helps address this “split incentive” challenge by allocating power to common areas and apartment units. It is able to allocate the solar energy generated by rooftop panels to each grid meter. In addition, it also keeps tabs on the building’s energy demand, and delivers solar energy in a way that maximizes solar consumption and provides bill savings. 
Residents in apartments can lower their utility bills by using on-site solar power and reducing their consumption from the grid, Bergsneider told pv magazine USA. 
“Direct access to solar can protect against increasing utility rates. Each kWh consumed from solar PV helps residents avoid rising electric grid charges,” Bergsneider said.
The company estimates that its technology can help residents save up to 40% on their electricity bills. Participants in its first pilot project in the U.S., in Orlando, saw average annual savings of $1166 per apartment in the first year, the company reported. This included net metering credit savings. Earlier this year, Allume Energy, RENU Communities, and ESA Solar announced the successful commissioning of a solar installation that will generate renewable electricity for the 296-unit apartment complex, Canopy Apartment Villas. The 165 kW DC rooftop solar was installed in two phases on 12 buildings.
The company also has a project in Jackson, Mississippi, and will soon begin installing its third U.S. project in Orlando. The Mississippi project, which was announced in March, is located at a multi-family building with a 22kW solar array, installed by Louisiana-based contractor Solar Alternatives. Allume’s next projects in the South East are continuing into the end of the third quarter and beginning of fourth quarter, Bergsneider said.
Until recently, solar technology has largely been saving money for people who already have it, Cameron Knox, Allume’s CEO and co-founder, said.
“We need to ensure we include everyone in the energy transition. This partnership will ensure low-income communities can benefit from clean, affordable energy from the sun,” Knox added. 
Elemental Excelerator is a non-profit climate technologies investor, with a portfolio of more than 150 companies, while the Schmidt Family Foundation is a philanthropic initiative focused on renewable energy, resilient food systems, and other areas. 
“We originally invested in Allume Energy because they are leaders in bringing affordable solar to affordable housing. We could all use an extra $1,000 a year in our pocketbooks rather than spent on electricity bills,” Dawn Lippert, founder and CEO of Elemental Excelerator, said.
