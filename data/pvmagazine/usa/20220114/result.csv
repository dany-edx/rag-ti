(STI Norland), establishing an outfit that Array is touting as the largest tracker company in the world.
STI Norland was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Pamplona, Spain with manufacturing facilities in both Spain and Brazil. The company has made a name for itself with its dual-row tracker system, a solution which is well-suited for installation on irregular terrain and in regions with low wind and/or snow load requirements.
To date the company has shipped or awarded more than 12 gigawatts of trackers, making it a top-three manufacturer in Spain, while also establishing the top market position in Brazil.
According to Brad Forth, Chairman of Array, the acquisition of STI Norland will accelerate the company’s international expansion efforts while enabling Array to keep costs low for international customers.
“We are thrilled to officially join Array—a solar pioneer—as we focus on providing our customers with industry-leading technology and superior service,” said Javier Reclusa, CEO of STI Norland.
Prior to the acquisition, Array was the second largest supplier of trackers worldwide, behind NEXTracker.
Different tracker vendors have different engineering approaches and Array’s one motor per-MW design has allowed for significant price reductions, which the company has credited as being critical to attaining its market share.
According to the company’s S-1 filing, made prior to its 2020 initial public offering: “Array Technologies uses less than one motor per megawatt which compares with more than 25 motors per megawatt for our largest competitor. Using fewer motors per megawatt lowers the cost, reduces the number of failure points, and minimizes the maintenance requirements of our system. Fewer motors per megawatt also reduces the number of motor controllers and the amount of wiring and other ancillary parts that are required for the system, which further reduces cost, simplifies installation and improves reliability.”

The company reports a total of $70 million has been raised to scale its transparent, energy-producing windows. 
The round was led by new and existing investors, including Andersen Corporation, ENEOS, Safar Partners, Hostplus, Red Cedar Ventures, and Riverhouse Investments.
Ubiquitous Energy said its technology is the only patented transparent photovoltaic glass coating that produces energy, while retaining the same look as a traditional window.
The company has begun the site selection process for its U.S. manufacturing line, which will produce the UE Power window coating for sale to the windows industry. The company said broad adoption of its UE Power windows could offset up to an estimated 10% of global carbon emissions, significantly reducing the 40% of global emissions that are sourced from buildings.
Over 20 billion square feet of windows are installed each year, creating an opening for the company to integrate its technology. This year, the company installed transparent solar windows at an NSG facility in Japan, a commercial office building in Colorado, and Michigan State University campus buildings.
“We are thrilled to bring on new and existing investors as partners, including ENEOS, a leader in the renewable energy sector, and Andersen, America’s premier window manufacturer,” said Susan Stone, Ubiquitous Energy’s CEO.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/14/yotta-energy-and-cal-solar-plan-solar-storage-deployment-across-california/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 14, 2022",Yotta Energy and Cal Solar Inc. plan solar & storage deployment across California,"Beginning next year, California is requiring solar & storage systems for all new commercial and multifamily construction. Yotta Energy announced today is joining forces with Cal Solar Inc., a solar and energy storage design-build engineer and contractor for new commercial and multifamily construction. The companies plan to partner on deploying renewable energy solutions to meet California mandate requirements.
Cal Solar Inc. has a team of in-house installers, electricians, and engineers who can update construction documents based on building design changes that occur throughout the design and construction phases.
“With the new building code requirements that go into effect in 2023, we anticipate that the demand for solar and storage will continue outpacing industry analysts’ predictions,” said Sean Neman, CEO & Founder of Cal Solar Inc.
Yotta’s unique energy storage solution includes a one-kilowatt-hour battery that mounts underneath a roof-mounted solar module. This panel-level solution fits under any industry standard solar module, Yotta reports.  The installations with Cal Solar Inc. will be designed as a virtual-power-plant-ready installation. In addition to battery charging from the solar photovoltaic (PV) system, Yotta’s energy storage system provides time-of-use software control. This capability saves users money by allowing the battery to be discharged when electricity prices are high.
“With more policies now requiring energy storage, we’ll see the industry adopt more innovative ways to include it with new construction. The mandates will also bring energy storage to the forefront and drive innovation in the sector,” said Omeed Badkoobeh, CEO of Yotta Energy.
The California Building Energy Efficiency Standards will take effect on January 1, 2023, requiring all new commercial and multifamily construction to include solar plus energy storage and all new residential construction to have energy-storage-ready solar PV systems. The state anticipates adding 280 MW of annual solar capacity and 400 MWh of energy storage with these requirements.
In 2019 Yotta raised $1.5 million in seed funding and an additional $300,000 in grants for the continued development and commercialization of the SolarLEAF. Just recently, Yotta announced a funding raise of $13 million to scale its unique, modular energy storage and microgrid technology. This round brings the company’s total funding to $20 million.
Yotta Energy is attending and exhibiting at Intersolar North America, which opened yesterday in Long Beach, California. See Yotta in booth #1609.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/14/u-s-house-committee-questions-tva-on-hindering-distributed-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TENNESSEE",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 14, 2022",U.S. House Committee questions TVA on “hindering” distributed solar,"The Tennessee Valley Authority is “hindering” the deployment of renewable energy by its commercial and residential customers, says a letter to the utility from the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The letter questions TVA’s 2018 “maneuver” to reduce its wholesale rate while simultaneously imposing a fixed fee on local power companies, several of which then passed on the fixed fee to their customers.
Internal TVA documents show that TVA believed the fixed fee “would curtail the deployment of solar energy projects by 40%,” says the letter. TVA has also permitted local power companies to impose new fees on distributed solar, says the letter, citing TVA documents that state its goal of limiting “the potential decrease in TVA load that may occur through the adoption of [behind the meter] generation.”
The Committee is also concerned that renewable deployment in the region under the federal PURPA law is discouraged by TVA’s avoided cost and contract terms, which “are inadequate to finance and construct qualifying facilities.”
Citing President Biden’s Executive Order 14008, which seeks to achieve an electricity sector free of carbon pollution by 2035, the Committee said it is “greatly concerned” that TVA has deployed little solar and wind energy, while “considering” new gas units totaling 1.5 GW. The Committee asks whether TVA’s next integrated resource plan (IRP) will “comply with President Biden’s executive order,” noting that the Tennessee Valley Authority Act requires TVA to engage in least-cost planning, including energy conservation, efficiency and renewable energy.
Tennessee Valley residents have electric bills that exceed the national average, “which particularly impacts low-income households in Tennessee,” the letter says, calling out TVA’s “decision” to deprioritize energy efficiency and impose fixed fees that “keep rates low but cost ratepayers money.”
President Biden has nominated four TVA directors to fill openings, who await Senate confirmation. Two more vacancies on the nine-member TVA board will open up in May, creating the possibility for Biden-appointed directors to govern the utility.
“The Senate needs to get to work,” said Daniel Tait, COO of Energy Alabama. “We have four good nominees and every day spent waiting is another in which the people of the Tennessee Valley are getting the short end of the stick.”
The U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce letter poses 16 questions to TVA, and requests responses by February 2. TVA is the nation’s largest public utility, serving customers in seven states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/14/solaredge-and-pearlx-partner-on-virtual-power-plant-to-connect-renters-with-solar/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 14, 2022",SolarEdge and PearlX partner on virtual power plant to connect renters with solar,"Energy provider PearlX Infrastructure and SolarEdge are collaborating on a series of residential clean energy projects for renters throughout Texas. ‘Project TexFlex’  intends to deploy community solar & storage virtual power plants (VPPs). The first will be installed the first quarter of 2022 in the Montrose neighborhood of Houston, with several other installations planned across Texas, California and other US states throughout 2022.
Described by PearlX as a “win-win-win,” each VPP provides load-serving and resiliency benefits to consumers, royalty and income streams for its multi-family real estate partners, and flexibility and capacity services to the Texas energy market, enabling utilities to leverage and control a previously untapped pool of available distributed energy resources to support grid stabilization.
As owner and operator of the project, PearlX will purchase hardware and cloud-based grid services technology from SolarEdge, while SolarEdge will provide design and engineering support. The plan is to expand the initiative to other locations in Texas.
PearlX uses an underwriting method that allows tenant subscribers who live within TexFlex properties to access the rewards of solar generation and battery storage without the obligation to present an industry-defined adequate credit score.
“Mainstream solar and especially storage has traditionally been an amenity for the wealthy. If you don’t have good credit, you don’t have access,” said Michael Huerta, CEO of PearlX. “Credit is the ability to repay. Electricity is the ability to live. Payment for electricity we believe is the highest form of credit.” Huerta added, “When you look at the data, electric bills are paid before rent, cell phone bills, even car payments.”
Project TexFlex has the capability to reduce grid strain and outages, while increasing energy resilience across the state.  This is particularly valuable in the wake of the extreme cold weather event in Texas last February, which placed grids under huge strain and caused mass power outages. Onsite solar will send energy back to the grid in near real-time, and utilities are provided with access to stored power when grid stabilization is needed or during energy shortages.
For participating tenants, in addition to having access to low-cost solar power to reduce their own carbon footprint and electricity bills, they will also gain onsite grid resiliency to help power their home during blackouts, and can simultaneously further reduce energy costs by participating in demand/response events or time-of-use arbitrage programs, where excess solar is diverted to help support the grid.
The VPPs will use the SolarEdge energy hub inverter and new energy bank battery. SolarEdge’s software for grid services also enables behind-the-meter VPPs to receive and respond to onsite and grid level signals.
PearlX awarded an EPC contract to Austin-based Native Solar to design and construct Project TexFlex. The project is under construction and will be interconnecting through an agreement with CenterPoint Energy in the first quarter of 2022. The plan is that after successfully deploying in Texas, the project will continue in California and several other US states later in the year.

To meet the utility’s goal of improved interconnection processing, $550,000 will be spent hiring up to six new contractors to support the interconnection process. These individuals will be focused on the transmission level cluster study process for large scale projects. An additional $150,000 will go to fund an ongoing industry/utility working group whose purpose is to identify and troubleshoot grid connection challenges.
The $700,000 will come from shareholder money, and is not allowed to be covered by ratepayers.
The settlement also notes that CMP was at fault, and should have identified its ‘over voltage’ challenges far sooner in the project interconnection process. The utility said they will change analysis techniques in order to better estimate upgrade requirements.
Among these interconnection technique alterations is a pricing refinement. The utility CMP says they will “commit to provide cost estimates and construction schedules that are more detailed than the (-50%/+200%) cost estimate(s)” that they had been submitting.
Additionally, the utility released a list of projects – noted below – that are currently in long term cluster studies, slowing down their progression toward construction. CMP says they will work toward meeting the currently defined deadlines so as not to slow down these projects any further.
This settlement comes in response to massive interconnection fees that were sent out to solar developers after they’d already been given costs, and processes, for interconnection.
Per the Maine Renewable Energy Association, some examples of the upgrade changes that were received by solar developers include:
After some public pressure, including the Governor Janet Mills calling for an investigation, managers at the company were able to find the errors of their ways. The utility responded with a letter stating that the initial upgrade estimates, which were in the range of $10-$15 million per substation, reflected the cost of a complete rebuild. The revised estimates delivered a range of $175,000 to $375,000 for required upgrades.
