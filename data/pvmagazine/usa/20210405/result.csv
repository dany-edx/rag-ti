The company has dubbed the initiative “Be a Fuel for Good,” an effort that has already seen $17 million in solar project investment and the development of the company’s first utility-scale solar farm in partnership with parent company Cobb EMC.
That project is a 6,000-square-foot rooftop installation with 1.85 MW of generating capacity and 1 MW/4 MWh of battery storage. Alongside the rooftop installation is a solar garden with three 18-foot-tall Smartflowers, producing 13,400 kWh of solar energy.
Outside of company-specific installations, Gas South has invested $12 million in eight residential community solar projects through its relationship with Sol Systems.
Gas South serves roughly 425,000 residential, commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, and New Jersey.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/05/rosendin-and-tokyo-gas-plan-to-deploy-500-mw-of-solar-for-ercot-market/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 5, 2021",Rosendin and Tokyo Gas plan to deploy 500 MW of solar for ERCOT market,"Rosendin’s Renewable Energy Group (REG) and Tokyo Gas America have begun building a $600 million, 500 MWac/631 MWdc solar power project in Texas. The Aktina Renewable Power Project will be brought online in blocks starting in mid-2021 with energy sold to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) wholesale market.
The facility will include around 1.4 million solar modules across 4,000 acres in Wharton County, around 60 miles southwest of Houston. The project will use racking from GameChange Solar, Sungrow 3600 inverters, and Jinko modules that range in size from 405W to 455W.
Over the past 15 years, REG has delivered more than 3 GW of solar project installations in the U.S. and Canada, with more than 1 GW under construction and another 2 GW in development. Tokyo Gas is on track to own more than 1.36 GW of total renewable energy capacity globally and aims to grow that portfolio to 5 GW by 2030.
The greater Houston area is something of a hotbed for solar and energy storage development.
In late March, S&B USA said it would acquire 100% of the Brazoria West Solar Project, a 260 MW project about 40 miles southwest of Houston. Construction is expected to start in the second quarter, with a commercial operation date slated for the first half of 2022. The project will supply power to the Houston area; it has secured one commercial and industrial power purchase agreement (PPA) and another PPA with an energy trading company.
Earlier in March, an entity linked to Tesla was reported to be developing a 100 MW lithium-ion battery energy storage facility south of Houston. Gambit Energy Storage could have the grid-connected facility in service by June. The project would include lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4 or “LFP”) batteries, similar to those used in portable electronic devices such as laptops, mobile phones, electric bikes, and cars. The project site is near a 138 kV substation in Angleton, Texas, and would offer black start capability to help the ERCOT grid recover after a blackout.
Texas has at least a dozen solar sites in operation that are producing at least 100 MW of power, according to pv magazine’s reporting. The state is projected to be No. 2 in terms of new solar capacity over the next five years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
A 2019 report from ERCOT outlined 43.5 GW of solar project applications in its interconnection queue, 5.1 GW of which had interconnection agreements and planned to complete construction by the end of 2020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/05/sunrise-brief-partners-launch-fund-to-invest-in-clean-hydrogen-projects/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 5, 2021",Sunrise brief: Partners launch fund to invest in clean hydrogen projects,"Plug Power, Chart Industries, and Baker Hughes are investing a combined $320 million to form the FiveT Hydrogen Fund to back clean hydrogen infrastructure project development at scale.
Plug Power will commit $200 million, and Chart Industries and Baker Hughes each will invest $60 million. The Euro-denominated fund aims to raise a total of $1.18 billion from both financial and industrial investors.
The fund will finance projects in the production, storage, and distribution of clean hydrogen. It will be led by Pierre Etienne Franc, former vice president of Hydrogen Energy for Air Liquide and co-secretary of the Hydrogen Council.
New York-based Plug Power develops hydrogen fuel cell systems for equipment and vehicles powered by electricity. Georgia-based Chart Industries manufactures cryogenic equipment used in the production, storage, and distribution of liquefied natural gas and industrial gases. Texas-based Baker Hughes is an industrial service company and one of the world’s largest oil field services companies.
J-Power USA Development Co. and funds managed by units of Fortress Investment Group, said they will develop Birchwood Solar, a 50 MW solar plant, and Birchwood Storage, a 190 MW, energy storage facility.
The projects will be sited at a 25-year-old, 242 MW coal-fired power plant in Virginia that is being shut down due to unfavorable economics.
Units of Japan-based Electric Power Development Co. and General Electric each own a 50% stake in the existing coal-fired power plant. The facility had a 25-year power purchase agreement with Virginia Electric and Power. In 2019, that agreement was transferred to Consolidated Edison utility Con Edison Energy.
Site redevelopment partner Fortress manages almost $50 billion of assets. J-Power is based in suburban Chicago and is owned by J-Power EPDC. It has two other solar projects under development, both in Texas: the 400 MW Charger solar project and the 350 MW Red-Tailed Hawk solar project.

San Diego-based Sempra Energy is selling a 20% interest in its recently created Sempra Infrastructure Partners platform to global investment firm KKR for $3.37 billion in cash. The Sempra business unit was formed in December in a corporate shuffle; it develops energy infrastructure projects in North America. At the time of its formation, Sempra Infrastructure had around 4 GW of renewable energy projects under development in Mexico. The business unit also develops liquefied natural gas export facilities, and operates natural gas infrastructure in Mexico.
PV modules that have reached the end of their service lives could total 1 million tons of waste in the United States by 2030, equal to around 1% of the world’s e-waste.
Recognizing the growing need for materials recovery and secondary market development, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory who are working on the issue said that repair, reuse, or recovery would reduce negative environmental impacts and resource constraints, and stimulate economic growth.
The team conducted legal- and literature-based research and interviewed solar industry stakeholders, regulators, and policymakers, then published a series of NREL technical reports, narrowing in on options and opportunities for PV equipment reuse and recycling.

One finding is that few incentives exist for private industry to invest in PV recycling, repair, or reuse due to current market conditions and regulatory barriers. Only one manufacturer has implemented a “takeback” program to reuse or recycle retired PV modules.
And although a growing number of U.S. third-party recyclers accept PV modules, most companies only recover bulk material and leave behind high-value materials such as silver, copper, and silicon.
The U.S. industry for recovered PV materials from modules alone could total $60 million by 2030 and as much as $2 billion by 2050. PV equipment recycling could increase supply chain stability and resource security, decrease manufacturing costs, enhance a company’s green reputation, provide new revenue streams, add tax benefits, and create jobs.
To help spur private investment, the analysts recommend government-funded R&D and analysis to help relieve some of the market and regulatory uncertainty associated with the reuse and end-of-life PV options. R&D could focus on designing PV modules to be more easily repaired, reused, or recycled, as well as on the associated cost-effective services and business models.
The NREL team recommended a multifaceted regulatory approach that places responsibility across the value chain. Consistent, clearly defined federal, state, and local regulations could mandate and incentivize secondary markets. Laws could prohibit disposing PV modules, provide an exemption from stringent regulation, or require reuse. For example, Washington state has a policy that requires PV manufacturers to take back or recycle modules at no cost to consumers. It also allows modules to be regulated under less-stringent solid waste requirements if they are recycled.
