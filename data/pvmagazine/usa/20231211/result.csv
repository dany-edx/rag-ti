The new 1 MW rooftop installation doubles the total solar generated power to 2 MW, which powers the building load and sends excess generation back to the grid through a net metering arrangement with Northcentral Electric.
Northcentral electric is a member-owned electric distribution cooperative serving nearly 35,000 meters in four counties in Mississippi. The ASICs project is the largest solar array on the coop’s grid.
The project was constructed in three months with minimal disruption to business, PowerFlex reports. The additional 1 MW of solar is projected to provide $100,000 in energy savings in the first year, with the environmental benefits of the combined systems estimated to offset the electricity of around 290 households annually.
“As ASICS continues towards a goal of reducing our overall CO2 emissions by 63% by 2030, today’s announcement is a strong step forward,” said Kyle Koestler, Director of Operations, ASICS North America. “The PowerFlex team were great partners in helping seamlessly complete the second rooftop solar project without disrupting our day-to-day business at the distribution center.”
PowerFlex, an EDF Renewables affiliate, specializes in commercial rooftop solar and level 2 EV chargers. The company reports that it has 400 MW of commercial solar, 40-plus MWh of energy storage and over 10,000 EV charging stations installed to date. PowerFlex also offers  an onsite intelligent energy management platform that monitors, controls and optimizes onsite clean energy assets. It uses adaptive load management to reduce overall energy costs of the assets, which can include storage, EV charging stations, and more.
PowerFlex was acquired in 2019 by EDF Renewables, as part of EDF’s strategic growth in the distributed energy market. Last year PowerFlex received a $100 million investment from Manulife Investment Management, which gave Manulife IM a minority stake. PowerFlex said at the time that it would use the proceeds of this capital raise to further invest in PowerFlex X, and it would enable the company to accelerate the deployment of onsite solar, storage, and EV charging. The company reports that it has seen increasing customer demand driven by corporate sustainability commitments, individual state renewable portfolio standards and targets, and climate-friendly federal legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/11/elevating-u-s-energy-security-reshaping-domestic-supply-chains/,"BATTERY,EV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,ARKANSAS,NEVADA",,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Elevating U.S. energy security & reshaping domestic supply chains,"In a world increasingly defined by geopolitical complexities and economic interdependence, the United States finds itself at a critical juncture, navigating the delicate balance between energy security and global supply chain dynamics. The current landscape is one marked by strategic considerations and intentional policymaking.
In recent analysis, attention is drawn to a significant element: The incorporation of Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) within the Infrastructure Law. Notable nations covered by this provision include China, Russia, North Korea and Iran. This inclusion aims to curtail their influence in the burgeoning domestic battery supply chains.
Against this backdrop, the impending unveiling of the EV tax credit revolution in January 2024 and the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022 emerge as catalytic forces propelling transformative shifts.
Just 16 months after the passage of the IRA, the largest federal investment in alternative energy and sustainability in American history, we are witness to historic climate action and an investment in America to create good paying jobs and reduce costs. Encouraged by the IRA, the private sector has announced over $110 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments. over $70 billion in the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain and more than $10 billion in solar manufacturing. The private sector has invested in over $240 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments since President Biden was elected.
Amidst the changing currents of U.S. energy policy and supply chain reform, the states of Nevada and Arkansas stand center stage in the development of lithium projects. Nevada, renowned for its arid landscapes and abundant natural resources, has become a crucible of innovation, hosting ambitious initiatives which harness the vast potential of lithium.
Nevada aims to become epicenter of lithium mining
Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo’s five-year strategic plan focuses on expanding the state’s electric vehicle production, technological innovation and new infrastructure. He believes that claystone lithium will emerge as the key critical element in Nevada’s energy transition as he seeks to make the ‘Silver State’ the epicenter of lithium mining in North America.
Unlike traditional lithium production from brine or hard rock sources, claystone lithium extraction represents a distinct approach that taps into the geological characteristics of regions in Nevada.
Arkansas’ role in powering America’s future
In the heartland of America, Arkansas is actively carving out its role in the energy sector by spearheading critical elements projects. A noteworthy development unfolded in November 2023 when ExxonMobil laid out ambitious plans to establish itself as a key player in lithium production. The company embarked on a significant venture by drilling its inaugural lithium well in southwest Arkansas, marking a strategic move toward bolstering the nation’s lithium supply. Under the brand Mobil Lithium, this endeavor underscores the transformative potential in regional initiatives.
These local initiatives are tangible examples of the groundswell of activity underway, attesting to the decentralized nature of the U.S. push toward energy independence and supply chain resilience.
The heightened need for the U.S. to source as much sustainable, “homemade” lithium as quickly as possible, with America’s natural resources and supportive policies able to bring new mines online, will ensure its place in history as the leader in America’s secure and sustainable new energy paradigm.
America’s road to energy metal independence is long and full of hurdles, both on the supply and processing side. While the United States holds about 8 million metric tons of lithium in reserve, ranking it among the top five countries in the world, right now only a fraction of the world’s supply is produced at one solitary lithium brine mine in Nevada called Silver Peak, run by Albemarle Corp.
As we dissect the intricate web of national policy, it becomes increasingly apparent that Nevada and Arkansas are not just states on the map; they are vital players in the quest to reshape domestic supply chains and elevate the nation’s energy security.
America’s legislative strides are engines of change, steering the nation toward a future characterized by a robust, self-sustaining ecosystem in the sourcing, manufacturing, processing, and recycling of energy metals. As the gears of progress are set into motion, America’s drive for domestic resilience is a paradigm shift actively reshaping the nation’s energy landscape.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/11/project-finance-management-software-for-the-energy-transition/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Project finance management software for the energy transition,"Long has the renewable energy industry waited for this moment: Riding the momentum of the past decade, dominant renewable technologies have reached cost-competitiveness with fossil fuels, and other emerging technologies that support the decarbonization of food, water, and waste are diversifying a quickly evolving and expanding market. And, of course, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) unlocked historic federal funding levels and established unprecedented legislative certainty for long-term industry support. Stronger and with more capital than ever, experts agree that the market is primed for rapid and explosive growth. 
Critical to this growth will be project management software for renewable energy development that provides seamless documentation and data management while enabling banks, lenders, and developers alike to manage complexity, mitigate risk and maximize returns at scale. 
But despite the clear need for innovation, traditional financial institutions have historically resisted adopting new technologies for project finance, opting instead to augment archaic legacy systems with spreadsheets, emails and PDFs. Bluntly put, this approach is short-sighted, inefficient, and expensive. These processes require too much time and manual labor from already slim teams while exposing counterparties to increased complexity and higher risk. In fact, a single loan can require 150 hours of unnecessary labor while also losing up to 70 bps.
Banks clinging to yesterday’s outdated tools will be woefully underprepared to scale efficiently for tomorrow’s challenges and profit from the market’s imminent growth, especially as assets become more distributed. With higher volumes of transactions comes higher mountains of paperwork that can critically delay a deal or wash away the margins with overhead.
The good news? Unlike the multifaceted issues of transmission infrastructure expansion or interconnection reform, this can be addressed primarily with technology: The industry can adopt a digital data management and risk monitoring strategy that leverages today’s automation and optimization technologies. 
By bringing project finance tools into the 21st century, financiers can increase transparency and liquidity, tighten timelines and overhead, and reduce barriers to entry, fostering a flourishing, diverse, and scalable sustainable infrastructure market. 
Historically, traditional utility-scale energy infrastructure deals have relied on a Frankensteined combination of multiple on-prem systems bolstered by webs of spreadsheets and other static documents. This translates to time-consuming manual processes, workflow redundancy, and opaque, disorganized data management. 
Already highly cumbersome for managing large deals, this approach becomes prohibitively costly when investing in smaller distributed projects that have more data, contracts, and counterparties: The overhead required to finance a single $1 billion deal pales compared to the overhead required to finance 1,000 $1 million deals. A lack of deal transparency further stifles market diversity, as significant, entrenched players have typically been the only ones with the specialized industry knowledge to confidently assess project risk, track covenants and navigate other deal complexities. 
While industry experts agree that the IRA’s legislative certainty and dedicated funding will undoubtedly accelerate market growth, the reality is that its tax credit, adder eligibility, and ongoing reporting requirements add multiple layers of complexity and risk that necessitate more organized and robust data management than what traditional tools can offer. 
Other areas of finance have certainly benefited by adopting automation, digitization, and other advancements in fintech. In a recent industry report, over 35% of American businesses reported that payment automation saves their finance teams more than 500 hours per year on average. These same gains in efficiency and cost savings can be achieved across renewable energy project finance; in fact, one green bank will save over 1,400 processing hours across 30 reduced steps by replacing its manual systems with end-to-end software. 
We’ve identified three steps that the sustainable infrastructure industry can take today to increase operational efficiency, decrease overhead, and accelerate deal velocity by adopting today’s technologies:
1.Initiate digitization today to build the foundation for future workflow automation.
Most challenges associated with today’s data management stem from siloed systems and the need for manual auditing, copying, and pasting. With a simple upgrade to centralized and digitized data management, organizations can prevent human error and minimize data inconsistencies and redundancies.
This simple step can not only lower the cost of capital and increase velocity and liquidity but also afford significant efficiency gains that accelerate market growth. For example, thanks to the digital data collection and automation afforded by fintech advancements, it now can take only minutes, instead of weeks, for a business to apply for and get approved for a commercial loan. Why can’t we do the same for project finance? 
2.  Create standardization to minimize risk and overhead, enabling a greater diversity of opportunities.
With a suite of tax credits that improve project economics for a wide range of technologies, the IRA is opening doors to more diverse opportunities within the sustainable infrastructure market – in particular, smaller deals in the 1 MW to 5 MW range are becoming more bankable. However, these opportunities are severely hampered by the bespoke nature of smaller projects that, combined with today’s inefficient processes and outdated tools, create barriers to investment in even the most low-risk, high-impact deals. 
While complete standardization of sustainable infrastructure may not be possible today, some modularization of deal components can be achieved. By identifying similar components across deals, banks can decrease complexity and create greater predictability, which in turn can improve workflow efficiency and reduce perceived risk, lowering barriers and creating more opportunities for new entrants to participate. 
3. Digitize compliance to take advantage of tax credits and manage ongoing requirements.
Today, Deal teams, often already small and overworked, must contend not only with increased volumes of opportunities but also with the mountains of data and documentation needed to track and measure eligibility for the IRA’s tax credits and adders. To be able to take full advantage of IRA benefits while also meeting requirements with auditable, organized documentation, the industry should increase transparency through centralized tracking and preparation of ongoing obligations.
In particular, a cloud-based data room can serve as a single source of truth, providing an infallible system of record and facilitating 360-degree visibility across all counterparties. This means that organizations can not only ensure an organized approach for evaluating and tracking tax credit eligibility with a clear digital audit trail of relevant documents but also hedge against future changes in guidelines and requirements. 
Today, more opportunities exist in the sustainable infrastructure market than ever before, and they are only predicted to grow in volume and diversity over the next decade. However, the industry’s slow adoption of more advanced, flexible, and accessible project finance tools will continue to limit deal velocity and increase barriers to entry, hindering the acceleration of market growth. To fully capitalize on C&I opportunities, the industry first needs to embrace existing technology to not only improve data access and management but also kickstart much-needed gains in operational efficiency, deal transparency, and standardization. 
As we start to reap the benefits of the IRA, it will become increasingly urgent to evolve project finance management tools. Bolstered by advanced technologies, we can bring capital more efficiently and cost-effectively to a liquid, diverse and scalable sustainable infrastructure market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/11/carbon-capture-hubs-could-present-solution-for-industrial-emitters/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Carbon capture hubs could present solution for industrial emitters,"Small-to-midsize industrial carbon emitters in the U.S. are clustered in several regions across the country, potentially allowing for the development of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) hubs, a new report from the EFI Foundation and Horizon Climate Group found. 
In total, there are more than 3,000 such carbon emitters in the country, collectively producing some 266 million metric tons of carbon dioxide every year – roughly a quarter of annual U.S. industrial carbon dioxide from point sources, according to the report.  
The report looked at carbon capture opportunities in 11 industrial subsectors, with over half of the emissions coming from emitters that are in the business of producing, transporting and processing petroleum and natural gas, as well as refining petroleum, and producing ethanol and petrochemicals. Natural gas use comprised nearly three-quarters of the total carbon dioxide emissions from these targets, the report said. 
Achieving American climate goals will require going beyond the power sector, and pursuing industrial decarbonization and carbon removal, Ernest Moniz, former U.S. Secretary of Energy and current CEO and president of EFI Foundation, said. 
“Carbon capture, utilization, and storage hubs are pathways to effective industrial decarbonization of small and midsize emitters,” Moniz said. 
CCUS technologies essentially capture and compress carbon emissions from power generators and other emitters, either to store underground or channel to alternate uses. Over the next three decades, large-scale carbon capture capacity could double every five years, IHS Markit reported in 2021. At the time, there were 23 such projects under construction, financing and design, estimated to double CCUS capacity by 2026.
Prior studies on carbon capture, utilization and storage have generally focused on relatively higher carbon emitters, but small-to-midsize industrial emitters collectively account for roughly a quarter of all industrial emissions. With the deployment of CCUS hubs, multiple such facilities can use the same transport and storage operations, allowing for lower costs on the whole.
The report identified 10 potential regional clusters of small-to-midsize industrial facilities that could allow for the creation of such a hub. Together, these 10 clusters comprise 1,000 facilities that produce 111 million metric tons of emissions every year.  
Four of these – representing 700 facilities, producing more than 70 million metric tons of carbon emissions every year – were then chosen for a more detailed study. These include southeastern Texas, around Houston; the Louisiana Gulf Coast; the eastern Ohio River Valley area; and the southern Great Lakes region. These four regions all have larger-scale carbon capture projects that are either planned, being developed or operational, which could be “anchor tenants” for a larger hub, the report said. 
While historically many U.S. industrial facilities were thought to be too difficult to decarbonize, the report “underscores that a cluster approach to carbon capture, particularly point-source carbon capture technology, is the most viable path forward for heavy industries,” said Aniruddha Sharma, CEO and chair of Carbon Clean, a carbon capture company and sponsor of the report. 
The report also laid out a series of recommendations to facilitate the build-out of these hubs. For instance, while recent changes to the Section 45Q tax credit are a step in the right direction, the incentive can be further tweaked to facilitate the transferability of the credit, or expand optional direct pay eligibility, the report said.
The Department of Energy could also take steps to leverage funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act to support the buildout of carbon capture hubs, the report noted – for instance, by expanding DOE loan guarantee authorities to allow the financing of multiple CCUS projects for certain industrial applications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/11/building-not-your-average-dream-home-finding-a-builder/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,MINNESOTA",,"DECEMBER 11, 2023",Building not your average dream home: Finding a builder,"In the previous article in this series, I had spent a few months working with an architect on the first design stages of not your average dream home. This included positioning and azimuth of the home on the lot, a detailed interior layout, and other passivhaus considerations, such as exterior wall thickness, south-facing passive solar, air circulation, thermal mass, underground water cistern placement, and even an integrated indoor garden.
Now that I have these initial plans, since I am using a separate architect and builder, I am sharing them with builders to get quotes. Prior to the design process, I began searching for a builder through the Minnesota Green Path, which has a list of builders committed to energy-efficient residential home construction, including RESNET’s HERS (Home Energy Rating System) index and air exchange ratings.
I interviewed 13 builders from the Minnesota Green Path designated builder list. All of the builders were very knowledgeable on Minnesota’s Energy Code and often spoke about reducing the Air Changes per Hour (ACH), but many did not have the knowledge of or experience with the type of high-performance building principles that I am looking to achieve. For some builders, I needed to define the meaning of passivhaus. A German word, translated to passive house, that is a building practice of reducing energy demand (instead of offsetting it) through an airtight exterior, passive solar, thermal mass, and air exchange to maintain a comfortable temperature.
The interview process felt long and tedious and– at times– a bit like speed dating. But that is what is needed to find the right fit. As Justin Riddle from Paltrin recommends, “Interview different people and find what you think is a good fit for you at that moment. I always joke that it is a little bit like dating, you are about to get into a relationship with that company.” Riddle continued by explaining that a relationship with a builder will be a long-term one. While building may only take six months, the planning stages may take a year or more, and then there are questions post build for another few years.
During my first call with Riddle, I felt like I finally found my perfect builder match. He was the first builder who not only understood all the building practices that I wanted to achieve, but had implemented many of them. We ended up extending our thirty-minute phone call to an hour, geeking out about different types of energy efficiency and temperature control techniques – such a geothermal versus earth tubing.
Demonstrating his deep knowledge of sustainable building practices, Riddle explained “Some of the elements are the same wherever you are building, such as air quality, material choice or onsite power generation. In northern climates where the heating demand dominates, you can adjust the design to pick some passive solar heat via window sizing and glazing choice on the southern side.”
And being at the forefront of the sustainable building industry, Riddle noted that “there are lots of cool developments happening now where people are trying to advance materials, such as reducing the carbon footprint in concrete production, distribution models, and manufacturing methods using more modularity.”
Riddle, who has a PhD in Chemistry, is the founder and owner of Paltrin LLC, a boutique organization offering design-through-construction services, including energy analysis and mechanical design for custom home builds in the Twin Cities metro region.
“Our outcome is focused on delivering a home that our clients love. To do that we work with people wherever they are in their journey. Some people come to us with a blueprint and land, so we build a home for them. Others are more upstream from that so we get more involved in the design of the home and planning stages,” Riddle stated.
Previously in R&D at 3M for 14 years, Riddle transitioned into sustainable and energy efficient buildings after a chance encounter at a tradeshow when he learned about the USDA Biobased certification program. Now after seven years building sustainable homes, Riddle considers it his superpower where he can combine his formal scientific training with his love of construction to help people and society.
When it comes to sustainability and project scope, Riddle thinks about it on a continuum. “A sustainable home is working to minimize its ecological footprint, reduce operating costs, and provide a healthier, more environmentally responsible living space for its occupants. It’s about minimizing your impact now and in the future. This is typically achieved by working to minimize energy consumption, conserve water, use materials that are produced locally or with more renewable content, and to utilize renewable energy.”
During my first conversation with Riddle, I could tell he is as passionate as I am about high-performance buildings, and he believes that having this type of alignment between a builder’s motivation and clients is important. He also recommended a few certifications to ask about, including EnergyStar, Zero Energy Ready Home, and PHIUS (Passive House Institute US, Inc.) or PHI (Passivhaus Institut).
Out of the thirteen builders that I initially interviewed, four demonstrated some knowledge of the building practices I want to achieve so I’ve shared the preliminary plans from the architect with each of them, including Riddle. The quoting process for each is different, with all offering a square foot estimate for free and some also providing a more detailed quote based on subcontractor bids for free. Others have a fee of a few thousand dollars for the more detailed quote. While the free square foot estimate is nice to have, the detailed quote is necessary for the next step of understanding the budget and adjusting the design to fit the budget.
Riddle advised that the cost of building a sustainable home typically “does cost more upfront because you are likely selecting materials that are higher performing so they are more of a premium. In addition, there are generally more steps and details to pay attention to versus a code-built home, so there is more labor involved.” This can include working with municipalities and subcontractors who are not used to high-performance building practice and may require time and education. However, Riddle confirmed that the upfront cost tends to pay off in the long run, especially with higher inflation, which he said “seemed to surpass the cost difference of the sustainable features.”
With the quoting process from builders expected to take three to four weeks, I am eagerly waiting to hear back. In the meantime, I’ve been busy learning about soil health and regenerative farming with terra.do so that the house won’t just be net zero, but the land will be a carbon sink. Plus, I’ve been digging into the right roof angle and weighing a number of considerations that I’ll dive into in the next article.
