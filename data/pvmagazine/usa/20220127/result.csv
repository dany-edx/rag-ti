https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/27/industry-heavyweights-look-to-solid-state-battery-cells-resources-and-recycling/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,GERMANY,JAPAN,TAIWAN,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Industry heavyweights look to solid-state battery cells, resources, and recycling","In light of its ambition to go all electric by 2030, German luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz continues to expand its network of tech partners, this time through a collaboration with Taiwanese solid-state battery specialist ProLogium.
The first Mercedes-Benz test vehicles equipped with solid-state batteries co-developed with ProLogium are expected to be introduced in the coming years. The companies have agreed on milestones to enable the integration of solid-state battery technology into a range of passenger vehicles in the second half of this decade.
“We believe that range and efficiency are the new industry benchmarks for electric cars,” said Daimler head of development Markus Schäfer. “Solid state technology helps to cut down battery size and weight. This is why we are partnering with companies like ProLogium to ensure that Mercedes-Benz continues to break new ground in the automotive sector for the benefit of our customers.”
Under the agreement, Mercedes will take a seat on the ProLogium board. The high double-digit million euro investment by the carmaker will be used to support the development of the technology and ProLogium’s plan of establishing production capacity in Europe. The Taiwanese battery maker focuses on the development of next-generation batteries including solid-state devices with silicon and lithium metal anodes and bipolar technology.
“We have been working with Mercedes-Benz on the testing of our EV [electric vehicle] battery cells since 2016 and are excited to strengthen and expand our partnership,” said ProLogium CEO and founder Vincent Yang. “At ProLogium, we believe that innovative technology must be backed by the scalability of production. We look forward to ramping up our new plant by the end of 2022 and working with our customers toward successful mass production.”
Thus far, the development of solid-state batteries has been primarily driven by automotive companies. Mercedes has partnered with Canadian battery material specialist Hydro-Québec to integrate the technology into field applications and cut development cycle times and other legacy automakers have invested heavily in solid-state devices, including Toyota and Volkswagen.
Offering potentially higher energy density, more cycles at a reduced rate of degradation, and less weight, solid-state battery cells are described as one of the key levers for determining the cost, scalability, and energy density of EV batteries. A solid-state electrolyte offers the option of using materials with high storage capacity, high-ionic conductivity, and better chemical stability; replacing the flammable electrolytes used in conventional lithium-ion batteries.
The innovative materials and design of solid-state batteries could almost double the range of today’s conventional li-ion battery cells and could be far cheaper as they do not require cobalt. However, the technology remains relatively unproven, with auto manufacturers hoping their battery partners will give them an edge and help bring forward commercial production.
Closing the loop
Elsewhere, Toyota and Panasonic have started research with the University of Tokyo into battery resources and recycling. In addition to closing the loop and realizing carbon neutrality, the aim of the project is to reduce production costs in the battery supply chain.
Four project partners: the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo; the Prime Planet Energy & Solutions Inc joint venture set up by Toyota and Pansonic; Panasonic’s Energy Company unit; and Toyota trading arm the Toyota Tsusho Corporation, will look at two aspects of the battery economy. They will focus on the development of new processes in an integrated manner, ranging from the development of nickel, lithium, and cobalt metal resources to refining them during the development and manufacture of battery materials. The research will also consider the development of new processes for the recycling of battery waste and used batteries.
With the aim of further improving the recycling rate of batteries, the research project will promote the development of technology for the efficient and waste-free recycling of leftover materials from battery manufacturing and used devices. Combining the knowhow of the partners – manufacturing experience; commercial collection, processing and recycling of materials; and university research into rare metal refining technology – the project aims to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and recycling costs, which are currently a big issue.
“We will not only supply battery materials but also contribute to the reduction of environmental impact and the formation of a recycling-oriented society by promoting recycling, making use of our knowledge in the recycling-oriented venous business,” said Masaharu Katayama, chief operating officer for Toyota’s Metals Business Unit.
New fab
Following its historic listing on the Korean Stock Exchange, LG Energy Solution unveiled its expansion plans yesterday, with a commitment to construct a $2.1 billion battery manufacturing plant in the US with General Motors. The facility will begin mass production in early 2025 and will produce 50GWh of EV batteries annually once fully operational.
The factory will be located in Lansing, Michigan and will produce batteries under the Ultium brand developed by a joint venture between General Motors and LG Chem. Ultium devices are said to be unique because their large-format, pouch-style cells can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside a battery pack, enabling engineers to optimize energy storage and layout for each vehicle design.
LG and General Motors are building two other battery cell manufacturing sites – one in Ohio and another in Tennessee – both of which will be capable of producing 35GWh of battery cells. “With a shared vision, GM and LG Energy Solution pioneered the EV sector by seizing new opportunities in the market well before anyone else did,” LG Energy Solution chief executive Young-Soo Kwon said. “Our third battery manufacturing plant, fittingly located in America’s automotive heartland, will serve as a gateway to charge thousands, and later, millions of EVs in the future.”
LG Energy Solution shares were sold at an IPO price of KRW300,000 ($250) this month in Asia’s second largest float, behind only the $12.9 billion initial public offering for the Alibaba Group in 2019. On its trading debut today, LG Solution’s shares surged 68%, solidifying the battery maker’s rank as South Korea’s second-most valued company.

The VTA received a grant for the project from the California Energy Commission.
In conjunction with Proterra and Scale Microgrid Solutions, VTA will deploy approximately 1.5MW of rooftop solar on a solar canopy at the Cerone bus yard. VTA’s current electric bus fleet consists of 40 Proterra buses, with five more on the way. Upon completion, the new charging infrastructure will be able to fully charge a bus in as little as four hours.
Proterra is a developer and producer of commercial electric vehicle technology, and, in addition to providing the electric buses, the company is installing the charging system. Scale Microgrid Solutions is the integrator of the EV infrastructure with onsite solar, 4MWh battery storage system, and a backup system that can provide power for up to 20 hours. The system will be connected to the grid, but can also enter island mode in the event of a grid outage. For extended outages, VTA has the option to easily connect a temporary generator to provide additional backup power for fleet operations. The microgrid and charging infrastructure will be linked together by a switchgear and controls package designed by Schneider Electric.
The solar PV and battery energy storage system will give VTA operational flexibility as to when to purchase the utility power needed to charge its vehicle fleet. “California’s electric grid needs distributed energy resources in order to support fully electrifying its transportation sector,” says Tim Victor of Scale Microgrid Solutions.
“This project combines several VTA goals.  It shifts us toward greener sources of energy, saves VTA money that can be reallocated to other operating needs and provides the infrastructure to charge our next batch of zero-emission buses.  Our riders will benefit from a newer, quieter fleet and we will decrease our contribution toward climate change and poor air quality,” said Adam Burger, Senior Transportation Planner with VTA.
The microgrid and charging infrastructure will be linked together by a switchgear and controls package designed by Schneider Electric.
The VTA also partnered with Lehigh University, whose Institute for Cyber Physical Infrastructure and Energy has been working in the “smart grid” space for nearly a decade. The system is expected to be operational in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/27/enphase-and-semper-solaris-team-up-for-residential-solar-in-california/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Enphase and Semper Solaris team up for residential solar in California,"Enphase Energy announced it reached a partnership with installer Semper Solaris in which its IQ microinverters and home batteries will be deployed throughout the state of California.
Enphase started shipping the IQ8 microinverters in December. IQ8 gained attention for their ability to form a microgrid during a power outage. The devices limit energy capture to just what the home is consuming, so if the grid goes out, the IQ8 automatically switches between on or off-grid.
(Read: “Enphase going Einstein with IQ8 solar power inverters”)
The Enphase Energy System with IQ8 comes in four different configurations: “Solar Only”; “Sunlight Backup” with no battery and the addition of IQ Load Controller to only support essential loads during an outage; “Home Essentials Backup” with a small battery; and “Full Energy Independence” with a large battery. While the first configuration is a standard grid-tied system, the remaining configurations are grid-agnostic systems that need the Enphase IQ System Controller 2 (formerly called Enpower smart switch) to island the home during an outage.
The IQ8 family includes five types of software-defined microinverters, IQ8, IQ8+, IQ8M, IQ8A, and IQ8H, with peak output AC power of 245VA, 300VA, 330VA, 366VA, and 384VA, respectively. Enphase reports that the IQ8H microinverter is its most powerful microinverter to date and has a California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency of 97%. The multiple types of IQ8 enable seamless pairing with a full range of solar modules, up to 540W DC.
“We began piloting the product in the third quarter of 2021 with select installers and the feedback has been great. Homeowners not only get backup power with sunlight, but also have the flexibility to add more solar or batteries in the future as their needs change,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO of Enphase Energy.
Semper Solaris plans to use Enphase’s proposal and permitting services. Enphase said it plans to build on the partnership and create a fully integrated digital platform, integrating additional services like operation and maintenance.
“We have seen an incredible surge in demand from our customers for backup power and expect this trend to continue to increase as the push for electrification grows,” said John Almond, CEO of Semper Solaris. “There will be significant strain on our aging energy infrastructure, forcing us to rethink the way we generate and deliver energy to California households.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/27/ontario-government-launches-voluntary-clean-energy-credit-registry/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Ontario government launches voluntary clean energy credit registry,"The Ontario government is developing a voluntary clean energy credit (CEC) registry, announced Todd Smith, minister of energy.
Voluntary CECs are certificates that each represent 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of clean electricity that has been generated from a non-emitting source, such as solar, wind, bioenergy, hydroelectric, and nuclear power. Businesses will be able to to voluntarily purchase and retire these CECs to meet their corporate sustainability goals and demonstrate that their electricity has been sourced from a non-emitting resource. A CEC registry could return funds raised through the purchase of CECs to Ontario ratepayers and could support future clean energy generation in the province.
“A CEC registry could enable more Ontario consumers to choose wind and solar energy to power their operations and help companies meet their ESG targets,” said Nicholas Gall, CanREA’s director, Ontario and Distributed Energy Resources.
CanREA has a net-zero target to be achieved by 2050, and reports that at the end of 2021, at the end of 2020 had approximately 2,399MW of major solar energy capacity and ranked 22nd in the world for installed solar energy capacity. In 2021 Canada saw 288MW of new utility-scale solar energy commissioned, and CanREA projects that 2022 and 2023 will see significantly more growth in the deployment of wind and solar energy.
The Ontario government has directed the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) to research and report back on the design of a provincial CEC registry, that would give businesses more choice in how they achieve their corporate sustainability goals.
The IESO will deliver its report by July 4, 2022, and the government intends to have the registry available by January 2023.
“A voluntary clean energy credit market could be a key tool to help Ontario electricity customers realize their clean energy preferences,” says Lesley Gallinger, President and CEO of the IESO.

The projects in question are the 50MW Broad River Solar power plant in Cleveland County, North Carolina, west of Charlotte, and the 22.6-MW Speedway Solar power plant in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, just northeast of Charlotte.
Construction of the Broad River project began last March, with Swinerton physically constructing the facility. Located on roughly 500 acres, the project is comprised of more than 170,000 solar panels and created more than 100 jobs during peak construction.
In constructing the project, Duke also awarded a $5,000 grant to the Cleveland County Schools Educational Foundation and Crest High School to add a renewable energy and green construction skills module into the school’s workforce development curriculum.
Construction on Speedway Solar also began in spring 2021, with efforts officially beginning in May. The project’s 185 acre site is home to 77,000 Jinko bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers. During peak construction, the project created roughly 70 jobs, and Duke awarded a $5,000 grant to the Cabarrus County Education Foundation to increase internet connectivity for students in Midland and Mt. Pleasant, N.C., much like the company did with the Broad River project.
In total, Duke has constructed or acquired more than 4,100 MW of solar power via roughly 40 solar installations across North Carolina.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/27/storing-excess-energy-in-underground-salt-caverns-in-kansas/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,KANSAS",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Storing excess energy in underground salt caverns in Kansas,"Working with Evergy, a utility serving customers in Kansas and Missouri, the Kansas Geological Survey is studying the possibility of storing excess energy generated by coal-fired power plants in underground salt caverns for future use.
“Excess electricity can be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas,” said Franek Hasiuk, KGS geologist and principal investigator for the project. “The hydrogen can then be stored in salt caverns for later use, either by burning it with natural gas in the power plant, adding it into pipeline natural gas for burning in home furnaces and stoves, supplying it to another business for use in chemical processes like fertilizer production, or using it to power vehicles.”

As electrical grid operators increasingly buy power first from wind, solar and nuclear operations and turn to natural gas and coal plants only when needed, there’s a growing need for storage of  energy for future use.
“Hydrogen storage could allow Evergy to store large amounts of energy to deal with the problem of intermittent power production from renewables – no solar when it’s night, no wind power when it’s not windy,” Hasiuk said.
Extensive salt beds lie under the surface in Kansas. The Hutchinson Salt Member, deposited during the Permian Period, covers about 37,000 square miles in the subsurface in central and south-central Kansas and reaches a maximum thickness of more than 500 feet. Thick salt layers also occur in western and southwestern Kansas.
Salt has been mined in Kansas since the late 1800s. Caverns in the salt beds are used for storing natural gas, natural gas liquids and other hydrocarbons.
The study, supported by a $200,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, will study the economic risks and benefits of storing hydrogen in these underground salt caverns.
“Right now, it’s unclear whether undertaking a project like this is feasible for energy companies,” Hasiuk said. “Our study will help reduce the uncertainties related to hydrogen storage. At the end of the study, we may find out the costs of underground storage are as risky as or more risky than thought, but we should certainly be more confident about just how risky it is.”
If the one-year project successfully demonstrates the viability of hydrogen storage, the partners will move to a second phase consisting of more advanced engineering and design of a storage system.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/27/vistra-to-expand-what-was-already-the-worlds-largest-energy-storage-facility/,"ENERGY STORAGE,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Vistra to expand what was already the world’s largest energy storage facility,"Vistra is planning a third expansion for its Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in Moss Landing, Monterey County, California.
When Vistra’s first expansion was announced in 2020, it quadrupled the battery system’s size, making it the largest battery storage installation in the world, a couple of times over. At the time, the world’s largest operating battery storage system was the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, which used Tesla batteries and was colloquially known as the Tesla Big Battery. Moss Landing uses Tesla batteries.
The Moss Landing site was in the news less than a year after it was completed, as it was knocked offline when an unspecified number of batteries overheated. At the time the 100MW/400MWh Phase II facility at the Moss Landing site was already up and running and remained operational.
For this third expansion, the company has entered into a 15-year resource adequacy agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) for a new 350MW/1,400MWh battery system. This would complement the existing 400MW/1,600MWh of energy storage capacity already at the site.
On Jan. 21, 2022, PG&E filed its application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to approve the contract, with a decision expected within 180 days. Pending the receipt of CPUC approval, Vistra anticipates construction on the third phase to commence in May 2022 and begin commercial operations prior to June 2023.
“These innovative battery energy storage systems are necessary to maintain electric grid reliability as increasing levels of intermittent renewable power are integrated into the electric grid,” said Curt Morgan, Vistra CEO.
Like previous phases, Moss Landing Phase III will be able to move quickly due to the already-approved development permit and its location on a Vistra-owned power plant site with existing interconnection and infrastructure.
Today’s announcement brings the Moss Landing site’s total energy storage capacity to 750MW/3,000 MWh.
Morgan continued, “With this planned expansion, we are moving the Moss Landing site closer to its full potential. With additional phases, this project could eventually reach 1,500MW.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/27/tesla-energy-results-up-but-mixed-for-2021-solar-makes-nary-a-sound-on-quarterly-call/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 27, 2022","Tesla Energy results up, but mixed, for 2021; solar makes nary a sound on quarterly call","Tesla’s fourth quarter earnings call for 2022 referenced solar power in passing, and only touched on the subject of energy storage. And though it was reiterated that energy storage has terawatt potential, expectations for 2022 growth have been muted due to continued chip challenges. Additionally, Musk made it clear that energy storage deployment took a backseat to deliveries of their much higher margin electric vehicle products in 2021.
The company’s slide deck stated that the Solar Roof product tripled in volume deployed; however, the company has yet to deliver any actual values associated with the product.
Both Tesla’s solar power and energy storage booked sales grew for the whole of the year versus 2020 — solar grew 68% and energy storage grew 32%. However, when comparing quarter sales, the numbers were a bit disappointing, with 4th quarter rates for the two products ranging between a decrease of 34% and growth of 2.4%.

In Summary
For the quarter, Tesla installed 85MW of solar power. For the year, it totaled 345MW; a significant increase from 2020, more than double the trough of 2019. The volume is still far from the peak value of 870MW deployed in 2015, with almost 250MW in Q4’15.
Energy storage deployment was just shy of 4GWh, showing a year over year increase of 32% over 2020’s 3.0GWh. Tesla’s growth was far behind the broader stationary energy storage’s market’s expansion projected to be triple digits.
Roughly speaking, the car company manufactured around 80GWh of energy storage cells, and only 5% of them went to energy storage.
This year’s 4TWh was first projected for 2019, when hundreds of percent growth was projected in prior Tesla earnings calls.

“We did short-change the energy business last year, in that vehicles took priority over storage, we do see a terawatt hour per year energy business,” said Musk, who has uttered similar variations on this theme in several prior earnings calls.
Regarding market potential, NREL does think the USA alone might need 6 TWh of energy storage to shift the power grid to “Zero Carbon”.
Considering quarterly growth numbers, Q4’21 was a disappointing quarter. Solar power grew only 2.4% – that’s 2MW – versus the prior quarter. And it was down by 1MW compared to the prior year. Energy storage was actually down significantly on the quarter – compared to both Q3’21 and Q4’20.

The energy storage department lost money both in the quarter, and year over year.
Total revenue for the year was $2.789 billion, while the cost of said revenue was $2.918 billion — a loss of $129 million. The energy department’s revenues were not discussed in the quarterly call.
Tesla earned $688 million in revenue for the quarter, spending $739 million. This was down from the 3rd quarter’s $806 million in revenue, as well 2020’s Q4 revenue of $752 million.

Over the last five quarters, Tesla has mostly lost money on its energy department.
As in many prior earnings calls, Musk said he believed energy storage will catch up, and eventually grow faster than vehicles.
Looking at 2022, Musk said the batteries will probably not be the limiting factor when building vehicles. Instead, the challenge will be in manufacturing chips. Silicon carbide inverters were noted as the critical, specific component of EVs, which are currently challenging to acquire.
Unfortunately, it was suggested that chip issues will also affect energy storage deployment. Accordingly, growth in deployment volumes will also be muted, at least for the short term.
Musk posited a potential growth rate of 50% for energy storage deployment, and joined another company representative in suggesting that several hundred percent growth is still possible — though less likely.
After the chip limitation is projected to be alleviated next year, it was predicted that then a battery cell limitation might arise.
