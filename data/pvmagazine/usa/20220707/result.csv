The portfolio, which represents the largest municipal solar development in Westchester County, is expected to triple the county’s solar capacity. The portfolio consists of canopy, rooftop, and ground-mount installations at four parking garages: Gillie Park, the Ebersole Ice Rink, Gedney Way Recycling Facility, the city’s Water Storage Site and the Sanitation Complex.
The installation at the Gedney Way Recycling Facility is especially noteworthy, as that project consists of a floating foundation canopy mounted on a landfill cap.
“The City partnered with New York Power Authority and DSD to create a successful 6.8 MW community solar portfolio that will not only benefit residents today, but future generations,” said White Plains Mayor, Thomas Roach. “We are in a climate crisis and we are obligated to recognize the urgency and take deliberate action to build a sustainable, resilient planet. The City of White Plains will continue to serve as a sustainability leader by investing in and implementing renewable energy initiatives that will meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
In addition to the solar installations, energy storage systems totaling 1.76 MW / 8 MWh were also installed at the Recycling Facility and the Shapham Place parking garage. Alongside the solar installations, some infrastructure improvements were also made, including a new roof for the Ebersole Ice Rink and an innovative enclosed solar canopy storage area for the water department.
While the projects were developed and installed to provide electricity for the city’s municipal operations, subscriptions are also open to residents and local businesses, and all subscribers will receive a 10% discount for credits applied to their energy bill. Perch Energy will manage the community solar subscriptions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/07/battery-storage-capacity-more-than-tripled-in-2021/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 7, 2022",Battery storage capacity more than tripled in 2021,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) made an early release of the 2021 EIA-860 data reporting that battery energy storage capacity grew more than 300% year over year, increasing from 1.4 GW in 2020 to 4.6 GW in 2021.
The boost was largely driven by the 106 utility-scale battery projects that reached commercial operations, with 3.2 GW of capacity. Consistent with historic trends, about 78% of all storage capacity added last year was built in regional transmission organization (RTO) service territories.
The nature of battery energy storage deployment advanced last year, as operators are reporting more applications and use cases for the technology beyond the conventional ancillary services that have characterized the technology since it began to ramp up deployment in 2016. Ancillary services such as frequency response and ramping/spinning reserve were the dominant use cases of battery energy storage over the last several years and continue to be a significant part of the work that utility-scale batteries perform.
Last year, batteries were increasingly reported to provide additional services like arbitrage, load management, and response to excess solar and wind generation, reducing power losses from curtailment.
Battery arbitrage involves a storage system charging during low price periods on the grid, and discharging during high price periods, like during times of peak demand. Arbitrage was reported to be performed in 50% of batteries installed representing 2.7 GW of capacity. California Independent System Operator (CAISO) had the lion’s share of arbitrage-performing batteries, representing 1.8 GW, or 83%, of the nation’s capacity that participated in the service.
Load management was another major function of batteries in 2021, increasing its capacity by 744 MW. This was a large step up from the 110 MW of capacity dedicated to this service by the end of 2020. Similar to arbitrage, load management is the act of smoothing demand peaks and valleys by storing during low demand times and exporting during peak demand hours.
Batteries were also paired with solar and wind energy to address the intermittent cycles of generation. Over 93% of battery capacity that went online in 2021 was co-located with solar. This use case gained over 1 GW of capacity last year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/07/truecapture-boosts-solar-plant-performance-in-field-tests/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,SOFTWARE,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 7, 2022",TrueCapture boosts solar plant performance in field tests,"Maximizing the generation performance of a solar project is critical to any project’s overall success, as power delivery contracts and payback periods all hinge on an installation operating at its absolute peak for as many hours out of the year as possible.
A number of different solutions have been instituted over the years to increase power generation at a low enough of a cost as to not offset the value of the power gains. Bifacial panels and single-axis trackers are perhaps the most visible examples of solutions to squeeze out extra generation, however plant control and monitoring software have emerged in recent history to offer additional gains through advanced sun tracking and machine learning.
One such software is Nextracker’s TrueCapture, a smart tracker yield-optimization and control software that combines advanced sensing with machine-learning technologies to help mitigate energy losses and boost plant performance. The software continuously dispatches optimal tracking algorithms to each tracker row in an installation, correcting for inter-row shading anomalies caused by uneven ground and diffuse light conditions caused by cloudiness or haze.
According to the company, the increase in power production results in better performance, lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and maximized financial returns for the asset owner.
To prove these claims were more than promotional language for the company’s product, Nextracker teamed up with Arevon, which owns the 38 MW Beacon 5 solar project in Kern County, California. First built in 2017, the installation experienced some difficulties in consistently achieving maximum generation, namely due to the site’s undulating terrain and array layout, both of which led to “significant” row-to-row shading.
Testing
Nextracker proposed implementing TrueCapture at the Beacon 5, and the project was upgraded in 2019 with software that utilizes both row-to-row and diffuse light optimization features.
With the assistance of independent engineering consultant Black & Veatch, Nextracker carried out sitewide validation experiments at Beacon 5 by dividing the project’s panel rows into two equivalent groups: a test groups, which instituted TrueCapture, and a control group, which used a standard tracking mode without TrueCapture.
The two groups were split to represent, at a baseline, as close to 50% of overall generation each as possible. Before the testing started, Black & Veatch performed an independent analysis confirming a positive bias toward the control group to enable a conservative assessment of the TrueCapture performance.
After 12 months of testing, the TrueCapture test group outperformed the control group by 2.21% during that time, according to the bias-adjusted data validated by Black & Veatch. According to Nextracker, the results are attributable to TrueCapture’s ability to mitigate production losses caused by inter-row shading and diffuse irradiance.
In response to the findings of the test, Nextracker and Arevon signed a master services agreement to include TrueCapture on all new projects, while adding the software into the operations of seven legacy solar plants run by Arevon in Indiana and Nevada. All are expected to be operational by the end of 2023.
As of the end of 2021, TrueCapture has been adopted by more than 20 GW across more than 150 projects.

The trailer features a fold-out array of nine solar panels and the SpaceX Starlink satellite internet system.
The trailer is speculated to produce about 50 miles of additional electric vehicle range, assuming the modules pictured are about 300 W each, bringing the array capacity to approximately 2.7 kW.
The average US driver covers about 39 miles a day in their daily commute, so the trailer may represent a useful alternative to home charging. Tesla has not announced whether the prototype will go into mass production.
The trailer also integrates SpaceX’s Starlink, a satellite-based internet hub that offers high-speed, low-latency broadband internet in remote and rural locations by connecting to a SpaceX Starlink satellite in orbit. Starlink is currently offered for residential and RV applications for an initial hardware cost of about $600, plus $110-$135 a month for ongoing service.
More solar trailers
Solar trailer models have continued to pop up across the globe, designed for various applications. In Munich, Germany, Sono Motors announced it will equip the city’s fleet of buses with trailers topped with 20 semi-flexible solar panels.
The modules cover an area of 12 square meters and supply the 24V battery with over 2,000W. In this pilot, the solar energy generated will be used to operate the HVAC system and to support the trailer steering system. This saves the bus from burning diesel and stabilizes the battery’s energy supply, which lowers maintenance costs and extends battery lifecycle.
The company said a medium-sized fleet of 300 buses could save about 2,000 metric tons of C02 emissions each year. When considering the 1.5 ton C02 emissions “backpack,” or the amount of emissions related to producing the bus trailer, the carbon impact of production would be offset in less than one year of operation.
In Spain, startup Polar Developments created a retractable compact trailer that houses 12 solar panels with a total capacity of 4.4 kW. The system is scalable and can reach a capacity of up to 6.5 kW.
It can be used to provide energy for cars, scooters or electric bikes. It can also provide energy support to homes during power outages, among other uses. The PolarGreen Tow trailer can be transformed into “an authentic removable solar micro farm” in less than an hour.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/07/500-million-program-to-site-clean-energy-projects-at-former-mines/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,KENTUCKY,WEST VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 7, 2022",$500 million program to site clean energy projects at former mines,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) issued a Request for Information (RFI) to inform a $500 million program funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to place clean energy demonstration projects on current or former mine lands. The program will fund clean energy projects on mine lands to benefit communities and their economies, create jobs and cut carbon emissions.
A recent EPA analysis found approximately 17,750 mine land sites located across 1.5 million acres in the United States. If all of these current or former US mine land were to be redeveloped with clean energy projects, up to 89 GW of clean electricity could be deployed, enough to power millions of American homes.
The Environmental Protection Agency has long recommended that Superfund sites, such as abandoned mines, are appropriate for renewable energy projects. Investing in renewable energy can lead to strengthening and diversifying economy in areas formerly considered coal country, according to the report West Virginia’s Energy Future, issued by the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at the West Virginia University College of Law. The report concludes that continued dependence on coal has many downsides economically, environmentally, and from a health standpoint, while a move to renewables has many benefits, just a few of which include job creation, a diversified economy, and health.
The revitalization of mine land with clean energy deployments will further the objective of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities that seeks to deliver federal investment to revitalize hard-hit energy communities. It will also advance the Justice40 Initiative that aims to deliver 40% of the benefits of clean energy and climate investments to disadvantaged communities.
“Developing clean energy on mine lands is an opportunity for fossil fuel communities, which have powered our nation for a generation, to receive an economic boost and play a leadership role in our clean energy transition,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “The investments in the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help America’s mining workforce apply their skills to grow and deploy cheaper, cleaner energy across the country.”
The Clean Energy Demonstration Program on Current and Former Mine Land will support clean energy technologies including solar, geothermal, advanced nuclear and fossil-fueled generation with carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, as well as others. Two of the clean energy demonstration projects funded under this program must include solar energy and DOE is seeking information from respondents about opportunities to use US manufactured solar for these projects.
DOE is seeking feedback from industry, community organizations, environmental justice organizations labor unions, and state and local governments. It is also seeing input on how to best design the program to encourage private-sector investment in similar projects for economic development in underserved communities located near current and former mine lands. The selected projects will chart a course to navigate federal, state, and local rules and regulations for siting and grid interconnection, mine remediation, post-mining land use, and environmental safety.
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provides a total of $11.3 billion in abandoned mine land grant funding at the Department of the Interior to eligible states and Tribes to help communities eliminate dangerous environmental hazards and pollution caused by past coal mining while creating jobs and providing opportunities to revitalize coal communities.
The deadline for responding to this RFI is August 15, 2022. The DOE expects to announce a funding opportunity to solicit project proposals in 2023.

“The Clean Energy Initiative of HBCU CDAC is thrilled to bring action-oriented and measurable change to underserved communities. The disparities and inequities are clear.  It is imperative that our most vulnerable neighborhoods in Greensboro, NC, and across the country have access to clean energy and advanced technology solutions that will bring about cost savings and are supportive of balancing growth, equity, and environmental injustices,” said Karen Soares, director of the HBCU Clean Energy Initiative.
To date, ten solar systems have been installed in Greensboro, with four installations in progress in Winston-Salem. These projects are part of a national initiative spearheaded by HBCU CDAC, which was charged by the Department of Energy (DOE) to increase awareness and equitable access to clean energy solutions through the direct engagement of the nation’s HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). In the Spring and Summer of 2021, HBCU CDAC identified HBCU North Carolina A&T (NCA&T) University in the City of Greensboro as the first university for community-based deployment in North Carolina.
Southern Energy Management (SEM), a Certified B Corporation solar installer based in North Carolina, installed SolarEdge optimizers, inverters, and consumption and production monitoring applications, allowing homeowners to track solar usage and savings in real-time. By aggregating the SolarEdge monitoring data, HBCU CDAC will be able measure the impact within the community and advocate for funding to grow the program across the country. The completed systems are covering an average of 76% of the homeowner’s electricity usage through May of this year.
“Central to CDAC’s mission and work is a partnership engagement model that prioritizes relationships that empower HBCUs, MSIs, and their affiliated organizations as partners, beneficiaries, and ultimate stewards of sustainable green communities. Our work, in this regard, in North Carolina and other markets has allowed us to stress test that model and we are now moving forward to bring our efforts to full scale,“ said Henry Golatt, chief of strategy and partnerships, HBCU Clean Energy Initiative.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/07/one-third-of-global-pv-manufacturing-capacity-is-at-medium-or-high-risk-of-bankruptcy-iea-says/,"BANKRUPTCY,BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 7, 2022","One-third of global PV manufacturing capacity is at medium or high risk of bankruptcy, IEA says","From pv magazine global
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revealed that more than 30% of the integrated companies operating in the solar module manufacturing business worldwide are at medium or high risk of bankruptcy.
In the Special Report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains, the agency stressed that only 15% of these manufacturers are at high risk of bankruptcy and that in 2018 their share was around 28%. As for polysilicon suppliers, around 11% of them are currently at a high risk of bankruptcy, while another 49% are estimated to have a medium risk. “Owing to high polysilicon prices, the bankruptcy risk of polysilicon businesses dropped considerably in 2021,” the report reads. “A return to low polysilicon prices could, however, reverse this change.”
According to the IEA experts, the support that the Chinese government is awarding to polysilicon manufacturers in the form of financing and subsidies makes this market segment particularly vulnerable from a financial point of view. “For instance, the largest polysilicon company posted net losses between 2018 and 2020 despite government support,” they state without naming the producer. “From a security-of-supply perspective, consistently poor financial performance within and across the solar PV value chain reinforces supply chain vulnerability to bankruptcies and underinvestment, which can reduce its resiliency, raise prices and limit PV deployment.”
The agency warned about possible changes in subsidy regulations for the PV industry in China, claiming these may lead to higher bankruptcy risks, even for the most competitive manufacturers. “Should competitive companies go bankrupt, this could lead to broader price increases and supply impacts, in addition to loss of the subsidy,” the report says.
The paper also describes thoroughly the main vulnerabilities of the global PV supply chain while highlighting the need for a wide geographical diversification of the industry. “China has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV, with multiple benefits for clean energy transitions,” the IEA analysts emphasize. “At the same time, the level of geographical concentration in global supply chains also creates potential challenges that governments need to address.”
According to their estimates, the world will almost completely rely on China for solar panel production through 2025. “Based on manufacturing capacity under construction, China’s share of global polysilicon, ingot and wafer production will soon reach almost 95%,” they note. China’s Xinjiang Province currently accounts for 40% of global polysilicon manufacturing, the report points out. “This level of concentration in any global supply chain would represent a considerable vulnerability; solar PV is no exception.”

Researchers from the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) and the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) claim to have achieved a power conversion efficiency exceeding 30% for a 1 cm2 tandem perovskite-silicon solar cell, which they said represents a world record for a PV device of this kind.
In particular, they achieved an efficiency of 30.93% for a 1 cm2 solar cell based on high-quality perovskite layers from solution on a planarized silicon surface and an efficiency of 31.25% on a cell of the same size and fabricated with a hybrid vapor/solution processing technique compatible with a textured silicon surface.
“These results constitute two new world records: one for the planar and one for the textured device architecture,” they specified, noting that both efficiencies were certified by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). “The latter approach provides a higher current and is compatible with the structure of current industrial silicon solar cells.”

“These high-efficiency results will now require further R&D to allow their scaling up onto larger surface areas and to ensure that these new cells can maintain a stable power output on our rooftops and elsewhere over a standard lifetime,” said CSEM researcher Quentin Jeangros. “Our results are the first to show that the 30% barrier can be overcome using low-cost materials and processes, which should open new perspectives for the future of PV,” the researchers added.
The previous world record — of 29.8% — had been achieved by scientists from the Helmholtz Center Berlin (HZB) in Germany in November 2021. This result improved upon the previous world record achieved by perovskite developer Oxford PV in December 2020, when the UK-based company announced a power conversion efficiency of 29.52% for its perovskite/silicon tandem device.
EPFL researchers achieved 29.2% efficiency for a tandem solar cell with fully textured silicon measuring 1 cm2 in April. This result was confirmed by Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE. “A big challenge will be developing solar cells that can remain stable on our rooftops for more than 25 years. But the higher efficiency we demonstrated without changing the front texture will be very attractive for the photovoltaics industry,” said EPFL scientist Christophe Baliff at the time.
