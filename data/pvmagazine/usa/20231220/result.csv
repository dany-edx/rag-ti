The first site, Lancaster 1, is a 6.06 MWdc community solar project, with Finger Lakes Health as the anchor commercial utility off taker. Lancaster 2, a 6.63 MWdc project, is not a community solar site and is instead classified as a “remote crediting” site, and Finger Lakes Health is one of its many off-takers.
Ampion, a community solar subscription management company, enrolled Finger Lakes Health along with the Town of Hector’s municipal sites and other subscribers.
Both of the solar installations use 540 W Znshine solar modules, Gamechange racking and Chint inverters. Lancaster 1 has 11,232 modules installed, whereas Lancaster 2 has 12,298. The projects are connected to the New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) distribution infrastructure by two different interconnection points.
Originally designed by AC Power, a woman-owned development company specializing in repurposing previously disturbed land into productive solar fields. Catalyze acquired the two installations, which it will now own and operate.
“In working alongside Catalyze, we’ve managed to turn a once dormant landfill into a source of clean energy, contributing to New York’s ambitious renewable energy targets,” said AC Power founder and CEO Annika Colston. “This project is a shining example of how solar development can not only offset land maintenance costs but also transform a challenge into a revenue-generating asset, all while supporting the community and the environment.”
Catalyze is a national independent power producer (IPP) with a strong presence in the California and New York markets. Catalyze is backed by EnCap Investments L.P. and Actis.
“We’re proud to support New York’s efforts in expanding solar energy access to commercial and mass market energy users that may not have the option of putting solar on their own building,” said Jared Haines, CEO of Catalyze. “This project further demonstrates renewable energy’s role in supporting local economies, and we will continue to look for opportunities that both accelerate the clean energy transition and create value from unused space.”
These projects will support New York’s goals of expanding clean energy access to commercial users and the state’s clean energy target of 6 GW of distributed solar by 2025, and 70% renewable energy by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/20/researchers-discover-new-factor-in-perovskite-solar-cell-stability/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Researchers discover new factor in perovskite solar cell stability,"Researchers at Georgia Tech have discovered a new factor in perovskite solar cell stability that may enable the development of more stable, longer-term perovskites. The research, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, is a first step toward solving one of the main issues in metal halide perovskite development: degradation. 
Perovskite solar cells are an emerging category of photovoltaic materials that are lauded for their ability to be deposited in extremely thin films, allowing the material to be deployed in a wide variety of use cases. Though these cells have now achieved efficiencies that compete with traditional silicon solar cells widely used today, they suffer from rapid efficiency degradation from the elements.
Using X-ray to examine the perovskites’ crystal structures’ reactions to both water and oxygen, the researchers discovered that degradation occurs due to an interplay of oxygen and water molecules. When isolated individually, however, neither oxygen nor water caused rapid degradation seen when both are present.

The Georgia Tech team developed a thin water-repellent layer for the perovskite cells using a material called phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The researchers found that PEAI was sufficient to stabilize the perovskites structure and conversion efficiency.
However, further research is needed to optimize PEAI layers. While the material does well to repel water, it struggles with thermal stability. The Georgia Tech researchers said finding a way to support thermal stability for PEAI layers is the next step in their pathway toward making commercially viable perovskites.
“Industry is already very interested, with companies around the U.S. popping up and trying to commercialize this. All the technology that we’re creating here at Georgia Tech is eventually going to be able to be translated into industry,” said Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, assistant professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Tech.
Correa-Baena said that perovskites are useful not only for photovoltaic applications, but for other technologies that require light transmission.
“Perovskites have the potential of not only transforming how we produce solar energy, but also how we make semiconductors for other types of applications like LEDs or phototransistors. We can think about them for applications in quantum information technology, such as light emission for quantum communication. These materials have impressive properties that are very promising,” said Correa-Baena.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/20/enphase-to-lay-off-10-of-workforce/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Enphase to lay off 10% of workforce,"Enphase Energy, a distributed energy solutions provider, made a Securities and Exchange Commission filing outlining plans to restructure and consolidate its business. The company said the moves are designed to increase operational efficiencies, reduce operational costs, and better align its workforce with current market conditions.
Macroeconomic conditions like high interest rates and policy changes like California’s NEM 3.0 have pushed down demand for residential solar in 2023, battering down the stock share prices of Enphase and its competitors.
The plan calls for a reduction of its global workforce by about 10%, impacting about 350 contractors and employees. It will also cease operations at contract manufacturing locations in Romania and in the state of Wisconsin.
“We are looking to cut expenses further by consolidating facilities across our worldwide sites to reduce our real-estate footprint, minimizing capital purchases and … extending the hiring and travel freeze through 2024,” said chief executive officer, Badri Kothandaraman.
The filing said company will focus on manufacturing with its two existing partners in South Carolina and Texas. Once these two sites are have fully ramped production, Enphase expects to have a global production capacity of 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, about 5 million of which will be manufactured in the U.S.
Overall the restructuring is expected to reduce the company’s manufacturing capacity from 11 million units per quarter to about 7.25 million, with U.S. capacities remaining flat.
“Over the last few months, we have made significant efforts to reduce our operating costs, but we have more work to do to right-size our operations and become leaner and more efficient,” said Kothandaraman.
The company expects to incur about $16 million to $18 million in costs from the restructuring, most of which will be incurred in Q4.
“Our focus in the first half of 2024 will be on clearing the excess inventory in the channel worldwide,” said Kothandaraman. “However, we see that there is greater confidence in the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting the interest rate next year, and we hope this leads to growth in the back half of the year.”
Raghu Belur, co-founder and chief products officer for Enphase told pv magazine USA in a exclusive interview that he expects 2024 to be a year of recovery for residential solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/20/longi-announces-27-09-efficiency-for-heterojunction-back-contact-solar-cell/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",VINCENT SHAW,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Longi announces 27.09% efficiency for heterojunction back contact solar cell,"From pv magazine global
Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 27.09% for an HBC solar cell. Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) has confirmed the result.
Longi said the result was enabled through a new laser graphical process that costs less than conventional high-cost photolithography processes.
“This substitution has effectively reduced the cost of the BC cell,” the company said in a statement, noting that the HBC architecture also minimizes the reliance on traditional indium-based transparent conductive oxide (ITO). “This breakthrough has propelled the commercialization of HBC solar cells, featuring independent intellectual property and cost-effectiveness.”
In early November, Longi announced a power conversion efficiency of 33.9% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.
It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/20/indiana-solar-project-moves-forward-with-tax-equity-deal/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Indiana solar project moves forward with tax equity deal,"Lightsource bp closed on an $85 million tax equity investment from Bank of America to support construction and operation of the 188 MW Honeysuckle Solar project.
“Project Honeysuckle” has been in the works for at least three years, after RES launched the project, then was seeking a buyer and off taker.
Now with Lightsource bp as owner, it has plans to turn the solar power plant into a pollination station as well. In partnership with the Bee & Butterfly Habitat Fund, a custom mix of vegetation is planted underneath the solar panels and around the site perimeter to provide food and shelter for critical pollinators and other wildlife.
In addition to being a home for pollinators, the Honeysuckle solar project will abate more than 204,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year 1, while creating additional benefits for community members and the local environment.
The project has created approximately 200 jobs during construction, and entry-level recruits have the opportunity to apply for apprenticeship programs with three unions represented on-site.
“A truly sustainable investment will create tangible social and economic benefits for people, in addition to fighting the climate crisis,” said Emilie Wangerman, Lightsource bp’s interim COO of the United States. “Bank of America is supporting a positive, long-term ripple effect beyond the solar farm itself.”
The $85 million investment marks Bank of America’s fifth tax equity transaction and seventh solar project with Lightsource bp totaling nearly 1.5GW.  Bank of America also participated in the debt financing that Lightsource bp raised for Honeysuckle Solar, alongside ING Capital LLC (ING), Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest and Societe Generale.
Located on 1,900 acres of land in St. Joseph County, Indiana, Honeysuckle Solar is scheduled to come online in early 2024 and will deliver power to off taker AEP Energy Partners (AEPEP) under a long-term power purchase agreement.
The 188 MW solar plant will help boost Indiana’s overall solar ranking, which the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) puts at 16th in the country in 2023, with 2.2 GW installed. SEIA expects it to rise to seventh place in five years.
Lightsource BP is now owned by British oil and gas conglomerate, BP, which said it will scale up Lightsource BP’s solar operations with the acquisition and will “target double digit equity returns.”. Lightsource bp, already active in the U.S., completed its first utility-scale solar installation in 2016. Since 2019, the Lightsource bp team has brought into operation or initiated construction on 3.2 GW of U.S solar projects with capital costs of nearly $4 billion in 11 states across the country.
