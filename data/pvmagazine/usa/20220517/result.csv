Ambient Photonics develops a unique low-light energy harvesting photovoltaic (PV) technology that the company reports can generate as much as three times more power than conventional technology. Its cells are made using an industrial printing process through which proprietary energy harvesting molecules are applied to thin and durable glass substrates to create cells of virtually any size and shape.
Compared to semiconductor vacuum manufacturing methodologies, Ambient said its rapid production process is efficient, scalable and lower cost. Ambient works with global smart home and Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers on embedded solar cells. The technology reportedly can deliver power density from a broader spectrum of ambient light.
By powering smart home and IoT devices with embedded solar cells, batteries are not needed—thus reducing landfill waste.
“Disposable batteries are both a consumer inconvenience and a significant environmental problem,” stated Matt Peterson, director of The Climate Pledge Fund at Amazon. “We are excited that through The Climate Pledge Fund we will invest in Ambient to help in their path toward creating innovative solutions to decrease the carbon footprint of battery-operated devices across industries.”
“We believe Ambient has the potential to catalyze more sustainable systems across growing global industries, including consumer electronics, smart home and IoT. Ambient’s technology offers the first viable solution to cost-effectively power these devices with clean, renewable energy,” said Sasha Brown, partner at EIF.
Ambient will also progress its Part II application for a $162 million loan guarantee under the US Department of Energy (DOE) Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program. The facility is expected to provide hundreds of local jobs while also reducing Scope 3 emissions.
“IoT sensors are everywhere. And each one has a battery that gets replaced and added to toxic trash,” said Tony Fadell, Nest founder and author of Build. “Ambient Photonics’ revolutionary low light solar cells bring us within reach of the Holy Grail: a batteryless, wireless IoT network.”
Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund was launched with $2 billion in funding from Amazon and is intended to support the development of sustainable technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to meet climate goals a commitment to be net zero by 2040. Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded the commitment program, called The Climate Pledge. The Pledge includes a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement threshold ten years early. Verizon, Reckitt Benckiser (RB), and Infosys have also joined the Pledge.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/17/solv-energy-begins-1-3-gw-solar-project/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 17, 2022",SOLV Energy begins 1.3 GW solar project,"SOLV Energy, among the nation’s largest solar developers with a project pipeline of over 4 GW nationwide, has been selected as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm for the Mammoth North solar project in Northwest Indiana. SOLV will provide its services for the first phase of the project, which will total 400 MW of the planned 1.3 GW landmark solar facility.
The 400 MW built in the first phase are expected to come online in the next 15 to 18 months, providing electricity equivalent to the needs of 75,000 homes each year. Wholesale and retail energy supplier American Electric Power has signed on for the generation in a power purchase agreement.
Israel-based Doral Renewable Energy Group selected SOLV as EPC. The company reports a total of $1.3 billion has been invested in the project. Once complete, the 1.3 GW Mammoth North solar project will be among the largest solar facilities in the US and may rank top ten in the world in terms of capacity.
(Read: “The world’s largest solar power plants”)
“Mammoth North Solar is a landmark project that has garnered support of dozens of Indiana farmers who will be powering the new economy. The construction of this project speaks to the growing demand for cleaner energy sources right here at home by Americans across the country. As the EPC contractor building Mammoth North, SOLV Energy is proud to represent our industry and the significant job, economic and community service opportunities that large-scale solar projects bring to a region.” George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy
Large projects like these have been under threat for cancellation or delay this year, as the Department of Commerce launches its investigation into the alleged antidumping violations of Chinese solar goods into four Southeastern Asian countries.
In February, before the investigation was launched, Hershman joined pv magazine to offer insight into the potential damages of the investigation to clean energy buildout. SOLV‘s projects can exceed $300 million, so the potential 50-250% tariff that could be levied on solar imports would impose between $75 -$375 million in additional costs. This level of risk is untenable and is why Hershman described the case as “an affront to the solar industry.”
“There is no case law to support this, it is a meritless case. It has been determined that the conversion of wafer to cell is the country of origin,” said Hershman.
At the time, based on supply chain constraints alone, Wood Mackenzie lowered its 2022 utility-scale solar projection by 33%, a steep drop of 7.5GW. Since the investigation was announced by Commerce, the Solar Energy Industries Association cut its forecast for deployment this year by 46%.
“It has been a challenging year in the solar industry and we are happy to have the SOLV Energy team by our side as we navigate through these challenges,” said Amit Nadkarni, VP of project management at Doral.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/17/scout-clean-energy-buys-nearly-400-mw-of-first-solar-modules/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 17, 2022",Scout Clean Energy buys nearly 400 MW of First Solar modules,"Scout Clean Energy, a Boulder, Colorado-based renewable energy developer, owner and operator, announced it signed an agreement with First Solar to purchase 378 MW of the company’s advanced, low-carbon thin film photovoltaic solar modules.
Scout, a portfolio company of Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, currently has a solar development pipeline of more than 12 GW of solar PV, battery storage and onshore wind projects spread across 21 US states, and the modules purchased from First Solar will be used to begin construction on several late stage projects with start of operations expected in 2024.
In announcing the purchase, Michael Rucker, founder and CEO of Scout Clean Energy referenced the ongoing Department of Commerce (DOC) investigation into solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, noting that sourcing modules from an American-based manufacturer is critical to keeping up with project timelines.
“Sourcing our modules from a US-based supply partner at this challenging time solidifies our competitive advantage in meeting our customers urgent timing needs for solar power to meet their decarbonization goals,” Rucker said. “As we diversify Scout’s asset base and grow our solar portfolio, we want to source our panels through partners that we can trust to deliver with no compromise on quality, ethical sourcing of raw materials and who is committed to ongoing innovation. First Solar readily satisfies those critical criteria for Scout.”
With the uncertainty surrounding American module supply brought on by the investigation, First Solar, one of the largest utility-scale solar module manufacturers not subject to the investigation, has been able to complete some massive supply agreements. Although, in the company’s Q1 2022 earnings report call, CEO Mark Windmar stated that most of these bookings have been with repeat, legacy customers.
“We are encouraged by our strong bookings progress, as we booked 11.9 GWDC in less than 60 days since the prior earnings call, bringing our year-to-date bookings total to 16.7 GWDC, further setting ourselves up for 2023 and beyond,” said Windmar. “Our agile approach to contracting continues to attract customers looking for long-term certainty and value.”
Windmar did share that there is a “significant volume” with new customers, which points to their trust in the company, the value of the cadmium telluride technology, and the company’s adherence to “principles of responsible solar but also the risk of pursuing a ‘solar at any cost’ strategy.”
Speaking directly on the DOC investigation, Windmar highlighted the company’s stance. He said that First Solar sees the anti-circumvention inquiry as a positive step toward addressing the issue of modules being completed in Southeast Asia in an attempt to avoid tariffs. “For too long the American solar manufacturing industry has been under siege from Chinese headquartered and subsidize companies that have been violating the rules of free and fair trade.”
We’ve heard the ‘sky is falling’ narrative pushed by lobbyists advocating for China to have free reign in the US market. Their doom and gloom is telling. It suggests that they are afraid that the Department of Commerce will find that the Chinese solar manufacturers in fact engaged in circumvention and will hold them accountable for their unfair and unlawful trade practices. While the lobbyists characterize Auxin as a single company seeking to inappropriately exploit the law it is precisely cases like this that the laws are designed for.
Some of the notable supply deals and bookings that First Solar has closed since the announcement of the investigation include:
First Solar is investing $680 million in expanding America’s domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3GW annually, by building its third US manufacturing facility, in Lake Township, Ohio. The new facility is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023 and when fully operational will bring the company’s Northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6GW.
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. With First Solar’s expansion in the United States and India and optimization of its existing fleet, the company anticipates that its manufacturing capacity will double to 16 GW by 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/17/an-american-at-intersolar-part-i-amsterdam-to-munich/,"BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,NETHERLANDS",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 17, 2022","An American at Intersolar, Part I: Amsterdam to Munich","This author recently encountered some serendipity – a business trip to meet new business partners in the Netherlands coincided with the Intersolar Europe 2022 conference happening in nearby Munich. It was only logical to combine the events into a single trip, and to shake as many hands as possible.
Having never been to Northern Europe, but having read that plenty of wind farms and solar panels abound, the hope was to spot solar generation capacity everywhere. The energy revolution turned out to be a bit more subtle than expected.
It’s not all subtle though – as of course, there are the bicycles.
JFW
The first thing you might notice after landing in Amsterdam is that the cars are smaller, and that there is excellent public transport everywhere. There’s little need to get a cab or car from the airport – you can just get on one of several trains and head straight to central Amsterdam. It’s cheap, and clean, too.
Once you leave the highways surrounding the airport area, the famed bicycle culture becomes apparent. Wide red pathways sited in between the roads and pedestrian sidewalks give the cyclists their needed space. And unlike certain American cities, drivers are careful, and slow down for bicyclists and pedestrians.
I’m told the law defines that by default; it is the fault of the car driver if a bike and car collide.
JFW
Moving around downtown Amsterdam is pleasant, quick and easy. Google Maps often suggested that travel times to certain places were fastest via bicycle, while trams were ranked second, and cars the slowest.
There was not much wind or solar visible in this region, though, as the offshore wind farms are located in the northern part of the country. And when walking the streets of Amsterdam, you don’t see many factory roofs or industrial buildings.
On the overnight sleeper train to Intersolar 2022 in Munich, however, a significant amount of solar was easily spotted.

The sleeper train is an eight- to ten-hour ride through the countryside of the Netherlands and Germany. The best part of this leg of the journey was chatting with the three gentlemen I bunked with, including Mr. Iliyan Georgiev of Bulgaria, who was also on his way to Intersolar.
Iliyan and his father had recently started a new solar installation company – Go Big Green. His goal was to introduce his company to manufacturers seeking buyers in the market. One challenge Iliyan has encountered in the nascent Bulgarian solar market is getting bank finance for residential and small business customers.
As you approach the German border, you start to see wind turbines and solar panels. As you enter Germany, you begin to see a lot of solar panels along the highway.
These solar panels typically take the form of the highway barriers above, rooftop systems on local houses and buildings, or ground-mount systems that are located close to the highways and tracks. Most of these systems appear to be smaller than one megawatt, and most were co-located with actual farms. After a few hours, spotting solar farms along the train tracks began to feel somewhat ordinary.

Arriving in Munich at the train station, you turn the corner to catch the underground railway and it takes you straight to the conference hall. Floating in the lake, we see a few solar panels – and we know we’ve arrived at Intersolar Europe 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/17/solar-om-why-a-long-term-maintenance-plan-is-essential/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 17, 2022",Solar O&M: Why a long-term maintenance plan is essential,"With many facilities across the country struggling to perform at a production capacity that was promised in the development phase, solar operations and maintenance (O&M) is now understood to be an integral part of any PV system’s operational requirements. Without question, the value proposition of solar O&M has been established in the last fifteen years, for a variety of reasons from low ROI on projects to safety hazards that result in costly repairs. The requirement to maintain and optimize site performance should be in every contract.
What we have seen in the industry is that due to system aging and new technology, the requirement to remove and replace part or all of an existing system is being considered and becoming more common. This requirement is often accelerated due to deferred or ignored scheduled maintenance plans.
It’s difficult to understand how a system could be left without a maintenance plan or needed repairs but it happens regularly and at different times in the energy production lifecycle. The reasons for this deferred maintenance or even abandonment is varied but run the gamut from poor budgetary planning to company and asset management turnover. This can cause even a much bigger problem than underperformance.
The largest hidden cost is failed power production expectations and the potential of having to remove and replace some or even all the system’s costly components. Customers plan, forecast, and budget based on the expected power that is estimated during the design and construction phase. A PV developer’s future financing and business model can be seriously affected by an underperforming project or the missed opportunity to accurately forecast long-term system replacement costs.
Expensive repair costs, extensive downtime, and additional resources to manage and repair the asset can add up quickly. Any component of the system has potential for failure, and every component left uncared for will deteriorate and fail over time.
Finding and contracting with a reputable and experienced PV O&M provider can be time-consuming and challenging. Knowing how much service to contract for and at what price can be a difficult process to work through unless you find an experienced and qualified service partner. Many O&M service providers offer a standard menu of services that can be customized to address your specific site’s scope and schedule. Ask your service provider to explain and propose their full offerings in detail and inquire if they have the experience and capability to remove and replace an older existing system. Developing a relationship with a qualified full-service provider is more essential now than ever in assuring expected energy production.
It’s important to remember that not all sites are designed or constructed the same nor are they located in common environments. A well-scoped and scheduled maintenance plan is essential to the customer’s ROI. This maintenance plan should be customized to the system that it is being used to maintain and not a generic form that is good for every system in the “fleet”.
Preventative maintenance should be performed at least once a year. However, each site’s characteristics will vary. An agricultural packaging facility may need service multiple services a year, whereas a college campus may only require an annual visit. A utility site may require continuous service and repairs. It is important to seek a provider who can develop a maintenance package that suits each individual system’s needs. Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) can provide a suite of useful information that shows the service provider what and when essential maintenance services are needed.
The optimum time to clean solar modules or set a tracker program can be determined through a DAS, as well as the replacement of system fuses and modules. Visual inspections including drone fly-by and thermography play an important part in scheduling maintenance tasks and photographs of the site are always an important resource.
Reputable service providers will always provide reports upon completion of any maintenance service. This documentation is vital to the effective maintenance of the system. It details the scope, schedule, and service history that is unique to the system. It can and will save the manager or owner time and money in the short and long run of the power systems service life. Maintenance documentation can be an essential requirement when addressing warranty coverage and many warranty holders will not provide service without it.
Though documentation may require more involvement on the owner or manager’s side, it allows greater scrutiny and protection of your investment. Regular maintenance could mean the difference between a short-term year high production lifespan or an extended years-plus, decreased production lifespan, and ultimately a corresponding ROI. Reactionary services on a PV system tend to be costly, and full unit replacements may be necessary to return the system to operation. Systems that operate at 95%-99% availability for the production year typically earn a high ROI and increased customer and industry confidence
There comes a time in the life of every facility, system, or component that a decision needs to be made to repair or replace some or all of it. The alternative is to lose the asset and its expected value. An active and long-term maintenance plan is essential in maintaining and assuring production but even then, time may take its toll and a system will need to be remediated. When considering this tough decision, make sure to reach out to those companies that have experience in the full spectrum of services required for the work.
It’s very important that you select a company that can provide the critical service provisions that will assure your project is completed with the expected value and reliability, and that the most current design and components are utilized in the project. With a trusted O&M provider and long-term maintenance plan in place, your solar asset can be productive for years to come!

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/17/2022-pv-module-reliability-scorecard-results-show-resilience-of-the-industry/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 17, 2022",2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard results show resilience of the industry,"The 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard, published today by PV Evolution Labs (PVEL), names 122 models of PV modules from 25 manufacturers as Top Performers in PVEL’s testing. PVEL is the leading independent test lab for the downstream solar and energy storage industry.
Launched in 2014 and now in its 8th Edition, the Scorecard summarizes results from the PV Module Product Qualification Program (PQP), a testing regime that PVEL established in 2012 to provide empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial models.
Tristan Erion-Lorico, PVEL Vice President of sales and marketing, told pv magazine that as the industry matures, developers, investors and insurance companies have realized that there can be a significant difference between modules that are certified and those that go through the Product Qualification Program. Customers not only in US markets but around the world are requiring a report. “It unlocks a significant portion of the market,” said Erion-Lorico.
“The 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard is a testament to the resilience of an industry that is relentlessly pursuing the deployment of reliable solar power – no matter what obstacles arise. We know that the world is counting on us for the transition to clean energy. At PVEL, we create the data that matters for a greener future, and we’re pleased to report that results have improved across many of our tests.” Jenya Meydbray, PVEL CEO
Last year was the first time that the report was online-only, and 20,000 individuals from more than 100 different countries downloaded the the scorecard.
“People are using our data to help them determine manufacturers and modules that they should consider for the projects,” Erion-Lorico said. “It’s beneficial to the manufacturers who are in it because they are reaching 20,000 potential customers.”
Looking back over the eight years of PQP testing, Erion-Lorico noted that one of the biggest changes seen this year is the varying sizes of the modules and the wide range of power classes of modules.
This year a record of 12 manufacturers had one or more model types that were Top Performers in every reliability test – and six of these model types were also Top Performers in energy yield (PAN) performance. Top Performers came from four different designs, different cells sizes and from the US, China, Malaysia, and Thailand. Interestingly, all PAN Top Performers were bifacial modules.

“This is a good news story. No matter what they’re producing, they’re able to achieve excellent results that go across all tests,” said Erion-Lorico, emphasizing that it’s a sign of maturity in the industry.
The results of the Thermal Cycling and Damp Heat tests are good examples of the advancements being made in the industry. This year’s Thermal Cycling results are another good news story–they are the best in PVEL’s history. About 90% of modules tested degraded by less than 2%. As Erion-Lorico pointed out, this is basically a test of solder fatigue, which they are seeing much less of that, indicating the precision that has been achieved in this step of the manufacturing process.
Damp Heat testing, however, showed a wide range of performance with only half of test modules achieving top-performing results after the full test sequence, and one module degraded by 54%, the worst Damp Heat result in PVEL history. This is a test of the module’s lamination, Erion-Lorico said, noting that in the past, when mono PERC became more widely used there was a destabilization issue where there were high amounts of power loss.
In this year’s test, PVEL saw a 67% decrease in bill of materials (BOM) requiring boron-oxygen (BO) stabilization: Only 23% of top-performing BOMs required BO stabilization to achieve <2% degradation versus 70% in 2021. They’re not seeing that same level of destabilization but now the poor results are more related to corrosion, which could be a by-product of gallium dopant or could be related to metallization of cells, according to Erion-Lorico.
“Manufacturers overcame significant challenges in the last year, and compared to previous Scorecards, the 2022 results show that module technology is improving overall,” noted Erion-Lorico. “PVEL’s Scorecard showcases impressive examples of product performance and reliability across our rigorous testing program, allowing buyers to easily identify high-quality modules.”
PVEL generally releases new tests every two years as new failure modes evolve. For example, the Light and Elevated Temperature-Induced Degradation (LETID) test was added in 2018 to test for failure of what was mostly PERC cells. PVEL also recently added the hail stress sequence because hail became a significant issue in  recent years.
“As we see more n-type modules, TopCon and heterojunction modules, we might see failure modes specific to those module types. It’s important that the tests are relevant for the products being shipped,” said Erion-Lorico.
Participation in PVEL’s PQP and Scorecard is voluntary for manufacturers and only top-performing module model types are named in the Scorecard. To date, PVEL has tested over 500 BOMs from more than 50 manufacturers for the PV Module PQP. The Scorecard is publicly accessible in an interactive digital format, with a searchable database of Top Performing modules at. A downloadable PDF summary is also available.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/17/pulsed-joule-heating-tech-to-remove-snow-frost-ice-from-solar-modules/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ILLINOIS,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 17, 2022","‘Pulsed Joule heating’ tech to remove snow, frost, ice from solar modules","Scientists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have developed a multifunctional coating material to remove snow, frost and ice from PV modules by using “pulsed Joule heating,” which is the physical effect by which the passage of current through an electrical conductor produces thermal energy.
Compared to Joule heating alone, which would be too energy-dependent for the viability of the proposed technology, pulsed joule heating drastically reduces energy consumption and the time needed for desnowing, defrosting, and deicing.
“We tested the system on a lab-scale prototype where we used a solar simulator to simulate the sunlight, and we attached the solar cell to a low-temperature chiller and a humidifier to simulate the outside icing/snowing condition,” researcher Siavash Khodakarami told pv magazine. “The cost of the technology was not evaluated in our work. But we have studied the benefit of using this method rather than just leaving the snow on solar cells by themselves to melt over time.”
The scientists applied superhydrophobic (SHP) coating on the module glass, through a method that they describe as simple and ultra-scalable. They initially deposited a nanoscale-thick aluminum (Al) layer on the cover glass, followed by immersion in hot deionized water to create aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlO(OH)) nanostructures.
“The density and porosity of the nanostructures can be modified by varying the immersion time and temperature during fabrication,” they explained. “We chose the conditions used in order to achieve higher superhydrophobicity and minimized droplet–surface adhesion.”
The film becomes optically transparent after hydrothermal treatment. And as the surface roughness remains lower than 30 nm, it does not cause visible light scattering.
“The combination of optical transparency and superhydrophobicity in the same coating allows for multi-functionality to enable pulsed Joule heating for desnowing and defrosting on PV panels,” the researchers said. “For desnowing of PV panels, the cover glass needs to be capable of efficient pulsed surface heating, superhydrophobicity, and optical transparency.”
Indium tin oxide (ITO) was used as a layer for Joule heating, due to its remarkable optical transmittance of more than 85%, as well as certain electrical characteristics. The thin-film heater with a superhydrophobic surface acts at the interface of the substrate and snow/frost/ice and is said to achieve interfacial defrosting by confining the heat to a very thin region.
Through a series of tests, the academics found that pulsed Joule heating is divided into three different regimes of interfacial desnowing/defrosting, partial melting, and refreezing, depending on the energy input, pulse width, and inclination angle of the surface. The claim their new technique can remove snow and ice at a rate that is three times faster than convetional approaches.
“Our method only requires a single pulse of electrical current for heating the surface to completely remove accreted snow, frost, or ice,” they said.
The scientists introduced the technique in “Enabling Renewable Energy Technologies in Harsh Climates with Ultra-Efficient Electro-Thermal Desnowing, Defrosting, and Deicing,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.
“We are continuing the work to make it a possible commercial product for solar cells and other applications as well,” Khodakarami said.

Much like yesterday’s supply announcement between Pine Gate and alkaline battery startup, Urban Electric Power, EnerVenue’s batteries will be supplied to Pine Gate to provide a choice in storage technology for Pine Gate’s development partners and customers, giving said customers the freedom to choose a technology that meets long-term reliability, energy and capacity needs.
EnerVenue is betting on the success of metal hydrogen batteries, specifically nickel-hydrogen batteries. This chemistry has proven to be an incredibly powerful energy storage technology for the aerospace industry for quite some time, but was always held back from greater commercial success due to its high price. According to Dr. Yi Cui, chief technology advisor with EnerVenue, the company has been able to achieve commercialization via “a breakthrough competitive price using new low-cost materials.”
Unlike lithium-ion, EnerVenue’s metal-hydrogen batteries excel operating in conditions of extreme heat and extreme cold. Specifically, the solution operates optimally from -40° to 140°F ambient temperatures. Because of this, the battery comes with no risk of fire or thermal runaway and also includes no toxic materials, making it recyclable, a huge tip in its favor, as recycling of materials is only going to grow in importance as the renewable energy industry grows and evolves.
EnerVenue claims that the company’s batteries have a more than 30-year lifespan, can go through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation and offer exceptional overcharge, overdischarge, and deep-cycle capabilities. The company also claims cost-per-kilowatt-hour as low as a penny, as well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion. The company stresses its use of low-cost materials.
“EnerVenue batteries offer a differentiated value proposition – lower degradation across a wide temperature band, and lower cost for maintenance and augmentation, whilst posing no fire or thermal runaway risk. These batteries also have a stackable form factor and can last for more than 30-years while being able to cycle multiple times a day,” said Raafe Khan, director of Energy Storage at Pine Gate Renewables. “We are proud to partner with EnerVenue in bringing this technology to our customers, further bolstering our unwavering commitment to strengthen the domestic supply chain and build a sustainable energy storage ecosystem in the United States.”
EnerVenue signed its first major distribution agreement with Towngas, Hong Kong’s first public utility and one of the largest energy suppliers in greater China, in spring 2021. EnerVenue CEO Jorg Heinemann said, at the time of the deal, that securing large, anchor customers like Towngas quickly would be paramount to the company’s success, and a multi-GWh supply agreement with Pine Gate certainly qualifies.
As for meeting the product demand these large customers will bring, Heinemann said he is confident in his technology’s ability to scale.
“It’s designed for super-easy manufacturing and super-easy assembly,” Heinemann said. Expectations are that the manufacturing, tooling, and capital expenditure cost will be about one-fifth of that for equivalent lithium-ion capacity.
