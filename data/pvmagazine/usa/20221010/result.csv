“The housing cooperative chose a grid-autonomous direct current variant, in which solar power is used exclusively for water heating,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “In addition, we installed an independent system for monitoring and measuring data acquisition.”
The 14 flats are each connected to their own 1.36 kW PV systems, with four 340 W modules. The rooftop arrays are directly connected without inverters to my-PV’s Elwa DC electric hot water preparation system, which is connected to a 150-liter boiler.
“Our units can easily reach temperatures above 85 C [185 F],” the spokesperson said. “When in contact with drinking water, however, we recommend heating to a maximum of 60 C [140 F] to prevent calcification of the heating rod.”
The company initially told the housing cooperative to set the backup boost temperature to 50 C (or 122 F).
“At this value, all individual needs of the residents are usually met, but the residents agreed on a temperature of 60 C,” the spokesperson said.
The solar arrays were able to reach an all-time share of 81% in domestic hot water production in the year to July 2021, with grid electricity covering the remaining percentage. For all of 2020, solar had a share of 37% and in the following year it increased to around 50%.
The core technology provided by my-PV for the project is the photovoltaic heating rod.
“This costs less than €700 [$679] excluded VAT,” the spokesperson said. “The power electronics, the control system and the user interfaces are included. Extra costs compared to a normal electric boiler are, apart from the additional costs for our heating rod, only the four modules with substructure and cabling, which is not much when you consider how cheap PV modules already are.”
Last year, my-PV unveiled a rooftop PV solution for thermal concrete-core activation in commercial buildings. The special configuration conveys surplus electricity generated from the rooftop array to an electric underfloor heating system, which transfers the energy to the foundation. The company said the proposed solution could reduce a building’s annual water and power costs by around 67%, compared to standard heating.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/10/secret-solar-stories-revealed-in-new-solar-podcast/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 10, 2022",Secret solar stories revealed in new podcast,"UnThink Solar launched a new podcast, Probably True Solar Stories, that offers a fictional look at how solar energy is increasingly becoming part of American pop culture, careers, politics, family life, and urban legends.
The podcast is the brainchild of Tor Valenza, also known as Solar Fred, a veteran of the solar industry. Tor has served as solar public relations consultant at UnThink Solar, which is the producer of the podcast. Before Valenza became known as @SolarFred, his Twitter handle, Valenza wrote for several television series (Stargate SG-1, Dharma & Greg, The Dead Zone) and wrote numerous unproduced screenplays in development for MGM, Warner Bros. Pictures, TriStar Pictures, and Castle Rock Entertainment.
The first season’s ten episodes feature a three-part solar panel heist story, a humorous solar sci-fi story, and a haunted solar house story.  In addition to the fictionalized story, the podcasts have many facts and figures about the solar industry–explaining in plain language issue such as the Forced Labor Act, solar panel recycling, supply chain challenges, and more.
Upcoming stories in season one will include more realistic contemporary solar stories, such as the new solar homeowners with a pigeon problem; a story about neighbors competing to be the greenest solar home on the block; and other untold “probably true” solar-related encounters that might have happened to solar installers, politicians, consumers, utility executives, and other real and imaginary characters.
“The solar industry often tells the true stories behind manufacturing, construction, development, permitting, sales, hiring, and customer testimonials. But those stories mainly stay within the solar trades,” says Valenza. “Even if we could interview all the real people installing and using solar in their daily lives, it would be difficult to find the exciting stories that would capture the imagination of the mainstream media. That’s why I’ve started this podcast.”
Valenza points out that solar is now a multibillion-dollar industry that is quickly disrupting America’s 125-year old fossil-fuel-based electricity system. As the electric grid transforms, Probably True Solar Stories will dramatize how solar is increasingly part of life and society in the United States and beyond.
“I love a good lawyer, doctor, or dragon slayer story,” says Valenza. “But we’re in a climate crisis. So, it’s fitting that the solar industry should now have its own heroes, villains, fairy tales, and urban legends. These may not be true solar stories, but maybe they’ll inspire students, business owners, homeowners, job hunters, and politicians to be aware of our clean energy transition challenges. Maybe they’ll go solar. Maybe listeners will decide to become new solar workers—which we desperately need right now to meet our climate goals. Either way, I hope listeners will be entertained, but more importantly, I hope they’ll learn something about the industry and remember that there are real people and characters behind every solar installation, large and small.”
The podcast’s Season One preview and its first episode, “The Solar Heist, or How I Got into the Solar Business, Part 1: The Opportunity” are now streaming at ProbablyTrueSolar.com and on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and other major podcast platforms. New episodes will stream every Wednesday.

The US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, have collaborated the development of a novel fast-charging battery anode material via a scalable synthesis method. The researchers said in a recent paper in Advanced Energy Materials that a novel compound of molybdenum-tungsten-niobate (MWNO) with fast rechargeability and high efficiency could potentially replace graphite in commercial batteries. They focused on a problem that graphite anodes encounter during the charging process, when the electrolyte decomposes and forms a buildup on the anode. This buildup slows the movement of lithium ions and can limit battery stability and performance. “Because of this sluggish lithium-ion movement, graphite anodes are seen as a roadblock to extreme fast charging. We are looking for new, low-cost materials that can outperform graphite,” said ORNL postdoctoral researcher Runming Tao. The Department of Energy’s extreme fast-charging goal for EVs is set at 15 minutes or less to compete with refuel times on gas-powered vehicles – a milestone that has not been met with graphite. “This material operates at a higher voltage than graphite and is not prone to forming what is called a ‘passivation solid electrolyte layer’ that slows down the lithium-ion movement during charging. Its exceptional capacity and fast-charging rate, combined with a scalable synthesis method, make it an attractive candidate for future battery materials,” said Tao.
General Motors and EV battery developer OneD Battery Sciences have signed a joint R&D agreement focused for the potential use of OneD’s silicon nanotechnology in GM’s Ultium battery cells. GM Ventures and Volta Energy Technologies also participated in OneD’s Series C funding round, which the company recently closed at $25 million. The focus of the collaboration is OneD’s SINANODE platform, which adds more silicon onto the anode battery cells by fusing silicon nanowires into EV-grade graphite. Silicon can store 10 times more energy than graphite but most attempts to include more silicon in the anode faced challenges of silicon expansion and breakage. “This limited the amount used to extremely small percentages and only modest performance improvements,” OneD said. “Being able to add larger amounts of silicon – efficiently – is the essential breakthrough needed to produce competitive EVs that meet market demand for high-performance, affordable vehicles.” Under a licensing business model, GM will tap OneD’s 15-year, 240-patent track record, with a focus on increasing energy density and reducing the cost of future GM EV batteries. “GM designed Ultium to be a supremely flexible platform so we can continuously improve our cells as battery technology advances,” said Kent Helfrich, GM CTO, vice president of GM R&D. GM will scale its Ultium EV Platform to 1 million units of annual EV production capacity in North America by 2025. Earlier this year, GM’s first joint venture battery plant with LG Energy for Ultium Cells began production in Ohio, with two additional US plants now under construction and a fourth in the planning stage.
Volvo has unveiled it first electric vehicle with bidirectional charging. Its upcoming all-electric flagship SUV EX90 will support both V2G and V2H applications, so car owners will be able to decide whether to keep their electricity to power their homes or send it back to grid. The EVs will also operate as vehicle-to-load (V2L) battery storage systems. “With the Volvo EX90 you can power your life,” said Olivier Loedel, Volvo’s head of electrification ecosystem. “You could use its battery in many ways, from topping up your electric bike when you’re out and about, to hooking up an outdoor cooking appliance for your weekend camping trip. It could even power your house during the expensive peak hours of the day.” Volvo sees potential to pool EVs in virtual power plants to relieve strain on the grid and cover short periods of instability. But not all of those features and capabilities will be available in all markets, it said. “The bi-directional charging offer will initially be launched in selected markets,” said the carmaker. “We are currently investigating which use cases we will be able to offer in different markets.”
Shoals Technologies has achieved UL Standards certification for its first set of aboveground eMobility charging solutions. The listed products include its Fuel Power Center, Big Lead Assembly (BLA) for DC or AC power, raceways and quick connect bases for chargers. Shoals, a major provider of balance-of-system equipment for solar and energy storage projects, claims its system to lay cables and wires above the ground could help slash 20% of 40% off the cost of typical EV charger installations.
