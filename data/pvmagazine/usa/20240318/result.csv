With an eye to local job creation, shorter supply chains, and reduced carbon emissions from transportation, Nextracker is continuing to use locally produced steel for some major projects. The latest in the strategy is the 480 MW Aldoga Solar Farm in Queensland, which will use Bluescop steel torque tubes, produced in Brisbane.
Nextracker announced the deal at an event in Brisbane on Thursday, March. 15. The event was attended by local politicians, steel industry representatives, and Nextracker management.
The local supply deal involves Nextracker, Orrcon Steel, Bluescope, and Baojia.  It involves “critical steel components” being produced at the BlueScope steel coil at Orrcon Steel’s Salisbury Tube millin Brisbane. The toirque tubes will then be finished by Baojia – which works with Nextracker on a global basis.
The supply deal will underpin a decision to open a new steel manufacturing line. It will be equiped to produce 50,000 tonnes of torque tubes a year – a PV capacity of 2.5 GW.
“This foundation strengthens Nextracker’s commitment to deliver energy security to Australians with a local supply chain and new manufacturing jobs to make clean energy affordable and accessible. We support Queensland’s Energy and Jobs Plan and applaud their ambitions to create jobs for the clean energy economy,” said Peter Wheale, Nextracker GM for Australia, Southeast Asia, and New Zealand.
Thursday’s opening ceremony was attended by the Queensland Minister for Energy Mike de Brenni; Tania Archibald, Chief Executive BlueScope Australian Steel Products; Tony Schreiber, Chair of the Australian Steel Institute and General Manager of Orrcon Steel and Peter Wheale, General Manager of Nextracker Australia, Southeast Asia, New Zealand.
Rival tracker supplier Array Technologies announced in February that it would establish a manufacturing line in Australia. The decision was made on the back of project supply wins, including the 102 MW Glenrowan Solar Farm.
In announcing the supply deal, Nextracker pointed to Rystad Energy research that showed that the US tracker company had supplied 7.45 GW of projects in Australia – of a total fleet of 13.5 GW, making it the market leader. Other major projects Nextracker has supplied in Australia are the New England Solar Farm (521 MWd), Stubbo Solar Farm (520 MWd) and Western Downs (460 MWd).

Researchers led by Dartmouth College in the United States have identified zintl-phosphide (BaCd2P2) as a potential new absorber material for thin-film solar cells after conducting a high-throughput (HT) computational screening among 40,000 promising inorganic materials.
“Based on its dopability, this material could be used as a p-type absorber layer for pn junction cells or as an intrinsic absorber layer for p-i-n cells,” the research’s corresponding author, Zhenkun Yuan, told pv magazine.
The group selected the inorganic materials from the Materials Project database, which is an open-access database describing material properties that can be used to accelerate the development of a given technology by predicting how new materials, both real and hypothetical, can be potentially utilized.
Through the screening, the scientists initially identified materials that offer a suitable band gap, small effective masses, and promising defect properties. “Among these promising candidates, we select the zintl-phosphide (BaCd2P2) and explicitly show that the computed nonradiative recombination rates in BaCd2P2 are better than or comparable with those in high-efficiency solar absorbers such as the halide perovskites,” they explained.
After identifying the material, the group found that zintl-phosphide can be very stable both in air and water. “You can put it out for six months and it will stay the same,” added co-author Geoffroy Hautier. “When you don’t have to worry about moisture and air contamination, that significantly reduces your costs.”
By conducting bright photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC), it also found the material has a potential energy bandgap of 1.45 eV and a carrier lifetime of up to 30 ns.
“All of these results indicate that BaCd2P2 is a promising high-performance solar cell absorber with the potential to open a new avenue in PV for an entire family of Zintl AM2X2 solar absorbers, where A and M are +2 ions and X is a pnictogen,” the researchers said.
“We won’t have it as a solar panel tomorrow,” added Hautier, “but we think this family of materials is exceptional and worth looking at.”
Their findings were presented in the paper “Discovery of the Zintl-phosphide BaCd2P2 as a long carrier lifetime and stable solar absorber,” published in Joule.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/18/can-anything-topple-lithium-ion/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-03-18,Can anything topple lithium-ion?,"From pv magazine print edition 3/24
A perfect storm of lithium supply shocks, manufacturing repatriation efforts, and higher clean energy ambitions have highlighted the need for energy storage alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.
Long-duration storage will increasingly be required for grids as global clean power generation increases. Many alternatives to lithium ion offer lower life-cycle costs, better safety, easier maintenance, and, notably, less dependence on critical raw materials.
Lithium ion currently supplies more than 90% of the world’s energy storage capacity, mainly in short-duration, two- to four-hour applications. Eight-hour-plus storage is in relatively low demand, as renewables dominate in only a handful of locations.
Long-duration alternatives
There is no established long-term business model for long-duration storage either, but 2023 was a record year for long-duration storage procurement and non-lithium support schemes and strategic partnerships. The U.S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission, a state planning body, announced funding for more-than-10-hour, non-lithium energy storage. The United Kingdom is backing novel approaches for more-than-six-hour storage, including compressed air energy storage (CAES), flow batteries, liquid air energy storage (LAES), and pumped hydro storage (PHS).
Agreements have been made between utilities and non-lithium energy storage providers in the last year. In Germany, for instance, utilities are considering iron-zinc batteries and CAES to repurpose spent coal mines.
Other, technology agnostic, long duration energy storage procurement plans have also been announced recently. Such funding exercises, while attractive to alternative energy-storage approaches, also offer lithium ion projects the chance to be eligible for support.
Australia launched a long-duration energy storage tender for 2 GW worth of eight-hour-plus projects. Of the three announced winners to date, two are lithium ion projects and one is CAES. More recently, Italy announced a 9 GW procurement for eight-hour duration storage, to be held at the end of 2024. The relevant documents mention lithium ion and PHS as key contenders. Historically, it had been thought that scaling lithium ion up to such storage duration would not be cost effective. Over the past year, however, fierce competition between lithium ion suppliers in China, and falling metals prices have been driving down lithium ion costs, creating competition at storage durations previously thought to be uneconomic for the mainstream technology. Six-to-eight-hour lithium ion projects have already been seen in China, the United States, and Australia, and make up more than 50% of all planned storage projects with a duration of more than six hours. This adds an extra challenge for alternative technologies that aim to compete at that specification.

Another key challenge for many non-lithium storage approaches is the lack of manufacturing scale that lithium ion battery makers leverage from the electric vehicle (EV) industry. The rising popularity of EVs has enabled dramatic lithium ion cost reductions over the past decade.
Non-lithium storage technology that can leverage existing supply chains from adjacent industries in the same way lithium ion has – CAES, LAES, sodium ion batteries, and gravity storage, for instance – are well placed to scale production.
The components and equipment used for CAES, for example, have several decades worth of track record using off-the-shelf turbomachinery from the power generation industry. Existing supply chains for CAES are already well established.
Sodium-ion tech
Another notable development in the energy storage space is the growing number of sodium ion manufacturing announcements. Sodium ion technology benefits from well-established component supply chains and similar manufacturing processes to lithium ion. The much lower raw material cost of sodium means sodium ion batteries could, at scale, achieve a lower cost than lithium ion at durations even beyond eight hours. Proof of commercial projects and a ramp-up of manufacturing production needs to develop further for that to happen. The first 100 MWh sodium ion project announcement in China is a sign of rapid movement in that direction already.
Technology that only serves the energy storage industry may struggle to scale up manufacturing cost-effectively for more bespoke components, especially if suppliers are competing with lithium ion.
Looking ahead, a fundamental need for long duration storage solutions far beyond eight-hour duration is inevitable if fossil fuel-based grid flexibility is to be phased out and renewables are to account for the majority of power generation. It is critical that grid flexibility requirements are determined in advance of such a need actually arising. That will require dedicated flexibility assessments at a system level, something which we have already seen positive steps toward in Europe’s electricity market reform in 2023.
Inherent challenges also need to be overcome to create a long-term business case for long duration storage solutions, which will become increasingly important as renewables reach a tipping point in energy generation and therefore require multi-day storage solutions.
The persistent price competition that is leading to a reduction of lithium system costs poses a significant hurdle for alternative technology as suppliers strive to compete with the established approach. Further strategic partnerships and long-duration procurement plans will continue to drive future pipelines of non-lithium energy storage solutions, with those able to scale most effectively and prove commercial projects at scale taking a greater market share.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/18/teslas-new-power-play/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-03-18,Tesla’s new power play,"From pv magazine print edition 3/24
The annual SNEC solar exhibition in Shanghai is an exhausting affair. On his return from the 2015 event, seasoned energy storage analyst Sam Wilkinson took a call from a journalist at The Times newspaper. A drained Wilkinson provided what proved to be front-page analysis.
The United Kingdom-based title was after Wilkinson’s take on the new Tesla Powerwall, the American EV maker’s residential battery. The product had been revealed by Elon Musk, with trademark chutzpah, on social media.
“I was literally in a taxi on the way home from Heathrow Airport and the next day I got a call that somehow the story had made the front page,” said Wilkinson, a director of clean energy technology at S&P Global Commodity Insight.
“It showed that there was this level of interest in the idea of energy storage. At the time it was a very nascent, niche, techy thing to do – to have a battery in your house. Fast forward, eight or nine years and it has become a very well understood, common thing.”
The Times was not alone in its enthusiasm for the Powerwall. “Sleek, chic, and unmistakably touched by that Elon Musk magic,” enthused pv magazine when featuring the first iteration of the Tesla Powerwall on its June 2015 cover (see left). The battery came at a price point far below rival products. Musk said the 10 kWh Powerwall would retail for $3,500, with the 7 kWh model going for $3,000.
“At the time I noted the price of Tesla batteries was significantly cheaper than what we’ve seen in the market, which would bring competition among other suppliers and push prices down,” said Wilkinson. “Which turned out to be relatively true, in the end.” By setting such an aggressively low price, Tesla blew open a previously nascent market segment.
Next generation
At the time, Tesla embodied the cutting edge in EVs and uber-geek cool. Powerwall 3, launched in 2024, will be the most powerful iteration – offering backup power even to large homes. It became available to installers in the United States on Feb. 16, with the move announced on X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk’s social media platform.
The Powerwall 3 was unveiled in Las Vegas at the RE+ trade show, on Sept. 12, 2023. While it has the same storage capacity as the Powerwall 2 – 13.5 kWh – a key differentiator is that it can provide more than 50% more power, at 11.5 kW of continuous power. It is a hybrid battery with the solar and battery inverter fully integrated.
At RE+, Tesla engineers highlighted that the Powerwall 3 offers installers quicker installation through a series of innovations. The new battery is smaller and lighter, albeit slightly deeper. It is 110 cm long, 61 cm wide, and 19.3 cm deep and its inverter, battery cells, and battery management system weigh in at 130 kg.
To lighten the load, Tesla has also worked with partners to develop a “dolly” – to help installers to lift the hybrid battery up and onto walls for mounting. That may seem like a minor detail but, crucially, it allows a single installer to fix the battery in place.
At $11,500, the Powerwall 3 is not looking to shake up the residential market based on price, as its predecessor did. However, the Tesla team at RE+ were keen to impress that quicker installation will enable installers to carry out more jobs, bringing down their labor costs.
Integrated system
Tesla’s in-house engineers developed the solar inverter inside the Powerwall 3 – displaying the company’s growing technical proficiency. The product deploys six maximum power point trackers (MPPTs), to optimize rooftop PV output.
“That has been an evolution of the [energy storage] space in general,” said Wilkinson. “We call them ‘integrated systems,’ with batteries and inverters combined together. The integrated product is obviously looking to provide a lot of other functionality and slightly more futuristic things, like VPPs [virtual power plants] and systems that can respond to things like electricity prices.”
The integrated approach precludes retrofit applications in homes with existing rooftop arrays, which Tesla says it will continue to serve with the Powerwall 2.
“It is all about the Tesla brand and they have that unique position of being the place you can go to get solar, storage, and an EV – and no-one else offers that full ecosystem,” said Wilkinson.
In the United States, Tesla is planning to sell the Powerwall 3 in a bespoke offering for homeowners. The company’s sales team provides integrated solar-plus-storage quotes based on a home’s size and power consumption. For even larger homes, up to four Powerwalls can be installed in series, offering a whopping 40 kW of power.
“It is not completely unheard of to have three or four Powerwalls, in the States,” Wilkinson said. “It is not an economic decision, it is purely a backup power play. And people will pay for backup in the US because grid outages are relatively common, compared to Europe.”
Thunder Down Under
Sydney-based PV and battery retailer Natural Solar sold the world’s first Powerwall in January 2016. The company’s founder, Chris Williams, said that while the first Powerwall was largely for early adopters, the Powerwall 2 opened up more of a mass market, with some 500,000 units sold globally. He said the latest version represents the next phase of the product’s evolution – which he described as an “interesting and exciting” one.
“It is tackling a new market as a solar inverter and a battery,” said Williams. “Having that all in one ecosystem, with data flowing from the Tesla app – and you can add an EV charger – I think is the next stage of ecosystem, from a customer perspective.”
Australia is a significant market for Tesla, for its utility scale and distributed batteries and its EVs and chargers. With a vast and growing rooftop solar fleet, and power outages increasingly common as a result of extreme weather events, there is a growing appreciation of backup power provision through residential solar-plus-storage.
Around 600,000 homes in the state of Victoria lost power on Feb. 13, some for days, after a storm downed a major transmission line.
EUPD Research monitors EV charging and solar-plus-storage installers in Australia and Europe. EUPD analyst Finn Bee said that the Tesla residential EV charger has consistently had the highest installer satisfaction rating of any brand. When it comes to batteries in Europe, however, there is more of a mixed picture.

“Our installer monitor, for which we survey more than 1,600 installers in selected markets across Europe and Australia, shows that Tesla has lost some market penetration but is still one of the best-known brands in many countries,” said Bee. “They are doing particularly well in Australia and Italy, two of the strongest markets for storage but are lagging in Germany, for example.”
Future outlook
While Tesla helped to create the residential energy storage market segment in 2015, the dynamic in 2024 is one of oversupply. The residential segment in the United States is depressed on the back of net metering reforms in key solar states. In Europe, inventories remain high.
“The market has cooled off in 2023,” said Wilkinson. “We’ve now got a pretty grim situation, especially in Europe. Every company, especially the newer Chinese entrants, was shipping, into Europe, crazy volumes when the energy-crisis boom was under way.”
S&P Global forecasts incremental residential energy storage growth in the coming years, with slightly more than 17 GWh of installations expected globally in 2024.

Researchers from China and the United States have proposed a novel modular floating PV (FPV) solution to assess the behavior of offshore, multi-connected modules under combined wave-wind conditions. The team ─ which included scientists from Dalian University of Technology and the University of Maine ─ analyzed various types of fixed and hinged FPV systems to determine potential approaches to optimization.
“FPV is a complex multi-body system under the coupling action of wind, wave, current, and other multi-physical fields,” the study noted. “It is therefore of immense importance to develop robust engineering methodologies and models to design FPV systems applied to offshore environments.”
The analysis found that as the number of modules increases, motion responses become more pronounced, and the 2 x 2 platform experienced the most significant pitch response of the configurations studied. The team also observed that the additional movement generated by hinged connections resulted in “non-negligible” dynamic response for multi-body FPV systems, while systems using fixed connections showed no significant dynamic response. In addition, researchers observed that the mooring tension of systems with hinged connections was greater than that of systems with fixed connections.
For this study, the group introduced a novel modular design for FPV platforms that incorporated the concept of semi-submersible ocean engineering platforms. It used a catenary mooring system, which is based on a curve that has been commonly used in bridge, ship, and ocean platform moorings. An offshore site in China’s Shandong province was selected for the study, which used frequency-domain analysis and evaluated the overall hydrodynamic performance and behavioral characteristics of multiple types of FPV platforms.
The researchers created the FPV platforms using cylindrical pontoons and heave plates. They mounted solar panels with an inclination of 10 degrees onto steel trusses above the pontoons, with each steel truss providing at least 250 kW of power generation per platform. Motion responses under extreme conditions were examined for moored single, 2 x 2, and 3 x 3 FPV systems.
“The stability of FPV platforms is crucial in preventing the loss of power facilities caused by overturning and minimizes the damage to power transmission cables,” they said. “As a result, mooring design is critical to mitigate the dynamic response of FPV systems.”
The study emphasizes that heave response is influenced by the ratio of mass to stiffness. Researchers observed that the maximum pitch response for the 2 x 2 FPV systems is “obtained when the wave trough is just at the connection position of the two modules and the modules are V-shaped.” However, adding a third row of modules helped to reduce the relative movements, so that “the maximum pitch motion of the 3 x 3 platform” was less than the maximum of the 2 x 2 platform.
Based on their analysis, the team recommends an installation angle of at least 15 degrees for a multi-body FPV system, to reduce both motion and structural responses.
The group’s findings are available in the study “Assessing the dynamic behavior of multiconnected offshore floating photovoltaic systems under combined wave-wind loads: A comprehensive numerical analysis,” published in Sustainable Horizons.
“Optimization of mooring systems could be conducted to further enhance the performance and reduce platform motion responses, such optimizations can lead to potential cost savings, making the overall system more economically viable,” they concluded.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/18/oregon-makes-it-easier-to-connect-distributed-solar-and-storage/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,OREGON",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,2024-03-18,Oregon makes it easier to connect distributed solar and storage,"Solar and storage connected to Oregon’s distribution grid will be required to use smart inverters that meet the global standard for inverters known as IEEE 1547-2018, starting this June.
The requirement will enable Oregon’s grid to “accommodate more renewable energy with fewer costly upgrades,” said Radina Valova, regulatory vice president for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. IREC joined utilities and regulators in workshops that led to the requirement.
Oregon also recognized that distributed storage projects may be designed with export-limiting capability, and has established approved methods for projects to control power export, and new interconnection review processes for such projects.
In areas where export-limiting capability is not recognized, distributed storage projects may face barriers to interconnection because review processes may be based on inaccurate assumptions about how the systems will operate, IREC said in a statement.
New Mexico has also recognized export-limiting capabilities of distributed storage and updated its interconnection process for such projects, with regulators saying they drew on some provisions recommended in IREC’s “BATRIES” report.
States that have already adopted the IEEE smart inverter standard, according to IREC, include Hawaii, California, New Mexico, Maryland, New York and Massachusetts, while in some other states, individual utilities have adopted the IEEE standard.
Without the use of smart inverters, each new solar installation on a distribution circuit would slightly increase the circuit’s voltage, which ultimately would require a circuit upgrade or a limit on new solar.  But smart inverters can sense conditions on the circuit and regulate a resource’s voltage to support grid stability.
California and Hawaii have required smart inverters for several years, with good results.
Smart inverters that meet the IEEE standard can be set to a variety of voltage regulation settings. Oregon has required utilities to determine by June the voltage regulation settings for smart inverters to be used in their respective service areas.
IREC Regulatory Program Engineer Midhat Mafazy expects that “some form of voltage regulation will be activated by default,” based on IREC’s discussions with utilities as it participated in the workshops that led to Oregon’s requirements.
In Hawaii, thanks to that state’s smart inverter settings, Sunrun Policy Director for Grid Solutions Steven Rymsha said in 2021 that most customers in the state could “instantly interconnect” new solar despite high levels of solar already on distribution circuits.
Hawaii achieved this result by requiring the smart inverter setting known as volt-var for all new distributed solar, with the option for customers also to activate the volt-watt setting if the utility would otherwise require a study and circuit upgrades. Each setting works to keep voltage stable on distribution circuits as more solar is added.
Rymsha said that other states could follow Hawaii’s lead when evaluating smart inverter requirements, noting that delays in setting requirements could lead to “wasted infrastructure.”

FOB China prices for wafers have mostly fallen this week, mainly attributed to an oversupply scenario outweighing demand.
Monocrystalline PERC G12 wafer prices decreased by 2.24% week-over-week to $0.349 per piece (pc), while N-type M10 and G12 wafer prices dropped by 2.82% and 2.08% week to week-over-week to $0.241/pc and $0.377/pc, respectively.
The only exception was monocrystalline PERC M10 wafers, which trended flat week to week at $0.254/pc thanks to its manageable production output.

As outlined by a market expert, the fundamentals of the wafer market are currently defined by elevated inventory levels, high production costs, and heightened operating rates.
The high inventory level of wafers has placed a lot of strain on the wafer suppliers. A source from a major wafer producer expressed the challenge of sales being very tough, stating that without offering discounts on quotations, securing an order is practically impossible.
According to a source from a small-scale manufacturer, there’s a notable price variance among the quotes for N-type M10 wafers in the market. Despite the mainstream price standing at CNY1.93 ($0.27)/pc, some manufacturers have resorted to quoting as low as CNY1.8/pc to bolster sales.
According to the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, the wafer market’s average operating rate has currently exceeded 85%. The resurgence of downstream demand is one of the factors driving wafer manufacturers to maintain high operating rates, said a market participant.
Furthermore, the polysilicon prices stand relatively robust at present, which necessitates that wafer manufacturers maintain high operating rates to mitigate non-silicon production expenses, the source added.
Additionally, OPIS has gathered from market insights that certain downstream manufacturers are requesting wafer producers to slightly modify the size of current M10 wafers to enhance the power generation area of modules. Currently, wafers sized at 183.5 and 183.75mm are being explored based on the M10 182mm standard. Wafer factories can achieve these sizes without the need for equipment updates.
Moving forward, it’s inevitable that wafer inventory will continue to accumulate rapidly. A source observed that some wafer factories are contemplating production cuts to reduce inventory. It remains to be seen if the wafer production output in March can meet the 70 GW or more that the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association has projected.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The program funds research, development, and demonstration projects of clean hydrogen for industrial processes, transportation, energy storage, and grid support. 
The program is currently accepting funding applications for product development proposals and pilot demonstration projects. Applications will be accepted through July 15, 2024. 
Clean or “green” hydrogen differs from traditional “blue” hydrogen, by using renewable energy sources like solar and wind rather than fossil fuel-based electricity. The buildout of clean hydrogen is expected to address hard-to-decarbonize end uses. 
The funding round comes as part of the pursuit of New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal to transition to 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040, one of most ambitious state climate goals in the union. 
New York’s scoping plan calls for 18 GW of zero-carbon, firm, dispatchable long duration energy storage capacity is required by 2050. 
“New York is taking the lead to build a clean hydrogen ecosystem and growing the nascent industry,” said Governor Hochul. 
The program will be administered by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).  
“While tax credits included in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act will significantly improve the economics of clean hydrogen projects, the reality is that individual states must also take direct action to accelerate domestic clean hydrogen production and use,” said Hydrogen and Low Carbon Fuels Regional Head DNV Amit Goyal.  
Funding for these initiatives is through the New York’s 10-year, $6 billion Clean Energy Fund (CEF) and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). 
“NYSERDA’s initiative for industrial process heat applications, high volume dense storage, supporting microgrids and enabling heavy duty transport is exactly the kind of state-level support that is needed to complement federal incentives and help further catalyze the hydrogen economy,” said Goyal.
