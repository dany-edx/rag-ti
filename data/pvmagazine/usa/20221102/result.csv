ACP is a leading federation of renewable energy companies.
ACP projects that the United States may deploy 550 GW of new renewable energy projects by 2030. Solar, wind, and energy storage capacity will help pave the way for the nation to cut economy-wide emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. This progress will be accomplished by a clean power workforce of 1 million, said ACP.
Despite this optimism, there have been some near-term challenges for the industry to overcome. The ongoing ripples of supply issues due to COVID-19, anti-circumvention investigations, interconnection issues, Uyghur forced labor crackdowns, and rising shipping costs have made it increasingly difficult to deliver projects this year.
ACP reports clean power installations in Q3 were the lowest in a third quarter since 2019, with 3 to 4 GW brought online. This brings cumulative installations to 14.2 GW. These projects represent $4.6 billion in capital investment and the electricity demand equivalent of nearly 500,000 homes. Year-to-date installations are down 18% compared to last year’s deployment figure, and Q3 deployment was 22% lower year-over-year.
Project delays still persist, and  the report said as much as 14.2 GW of capacity has been delayed this quarter, more than half of which has already been delayed in preceding quarters. In total, ACP said 36.2 GW of renewable energy projects are suffering delays, while 3.5 GW has been cancelled altogether. Solar accounts for 63% of delayed projects, while land-based wind accounts for 23% of delays and battery storage the remaining 14%.
California led deployments with 1.4 GW installed, followed by Texas (1.27 GW), and Virginia (255 MW), and Iowa (105 MW). No other state activated more than 100 MW this quarter, said ACP.
Solar led the way in deployments with nearly 1.9 GW installed, bringing 2022 solar installations to over 7 GW. Battery energy storage deployment continues to grow precipitously, with 1.2 GW / 2.8 GWh rolled out. Only two wind projects were commissioned, combining for 356 MW in capacity this quarter.
Currently 132 GW of clean power capacity is in development across the nation, said the report. Included in this is 39 GW under construction and 93 GW in the advanced stages of development. Project pipelines grew three to four percent in Q1 and Q2, a fraction of the 12% quarterly growth witnessed in 2021. Q3 continued this same diminished trend, with project pipelines growing only 3%.
The makeup of the nation’s project pipeline is 59% solar, 30% wind, and 11% battery energy storage. Land-based wind contributes 17% to the total while offshore wind represents 11% of the nation’s clean energy project pipeline capacity.
Texas has the largest pipeline by a good measure, with nearly 24 GW of projects planned. California follows with 12.8 GW of queued projects, nearly all of which are hybrid solar and storage co-located projects. New York follows with 10.8 GW planned, 4.3 GW of which will be supported by offshore wind projects. The largest three developers in terms of capacity were NextEra Energy, Ørsted, and Invenergy.
Procurement has slowed, too. ACP said power purchase agreements (PPA) have been announced to the tune of 7.2 GW in Q3. This is 31% lower than last year’s third quarter. However, PPA announcements lag last year’s rate by only 3% due to high volume last quarter. Commercial and industrial customers represented 43% of PPA announcement capacity, while utilities represented about 25%, and undisclosed purchasers contributed the remaining 32%.
Solar was the clubhouse leader in PPA announcements, representing 90% of the capacity procured in-quarter and 81% year-to-date. Storage accounts for 7% of PPA announcements, and wind power the remaining 3%.
“President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law on August 16th. This unprecedented national commitment to clean power is the largest policy investment in clean energy on record. The IRA is set to catalyze clean energy growth, ultimately more than tripling annual installations of wind, solar, and battery storage by the end of the decade,” said the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/02/rplus-energies-hosts-200-mw-iron-county-utah-solar-facility-ground-breaking/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INTERVIEW,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,UTAH",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022",rPlus Energies hosts 200 MW Utah solar facility ground-breaking,"rPlus Energies, a Salt Lake City-based renewable energy developer, hosted a groundbreaking ceremony this week for the construction of the 200 MW Appaloosa I solar project in Iron County, Utah, the second largest utility solar facility in Utah to date.
The Appaloosa facility groundbreaking follows the 400 MW solar plus 200 MW storage Green River Energy Center earlier this year, and 80 MW Three Peaks Solar facility from 2016, both of which are rPlus Energies projects. It is among the largest projects in the state.
Despite a challenging year grappling with ongoing global supply chain disruption in the utility solar market, Luigi Resta, CEO of rPlus Energies, told pv magazine USA the project developer continues to execute on a 1.2 GW development portfolio against a broader 13 GW multi-year project pipeline with solar as well as energy storage, wind and pumped hydro storage assets.
For Appaloosa, the company circumnavigated supply chain and commodity market challenges by going with a new module supplier, ET Solar, utilizing ET-M772 540 watt bi-facial modules for the ground-mounted project, Resta said.  The 540W modules carry a 20.9% efficiency rating and feature a mono-crystalline PERC solar cell mounted in an anodized aluminum alloy frame.
Additional components used include Sungrow utility-scale inverters, Nextracker racking hardware and Shoals Technologies wire harnessing and coupling equipment, Resta said.
For Green River Energy Center, Resta said the company has yet to select the distributor of the 200 MW battery storage systems, but said the system would use a traditional two-hour dispatch lithium-ion battery system.
Sundt Construction, Bodec and BHICO are providing electrical and general contracting services for the Appaloosa project construction, Resta said.
Portfolio diversification
To date, rPlus has developed solar, wind power, storage and pumped hydro power projects in 16 states in the Western region of the U.S. While the company has felt direct exposure to commodity and supply chain disruptions following the Covid-19 pandemic, Resta said the company has tried to mitigate exposure to the solar market by developing projects across four asset classes.
The company has also sold projects and sought project equity and debt financing from Greenbacker Capital, which is investing in Appaloosa I as well as other prior projects, among other potential investors.
Salt Lake City-based rPlus Energies was formed in 2018 and is owned by the Gardner Company, a Utah-based family office and commercial real estate developer. Prior to rPlus, Resta spent over a decade at Scatec Solar, Onyx Renewable Partners, a Blackstone Group company, and AMG Energy, in various project development management roles.
Commercial offtake flexibility
Meta, the operator of Facebook, is the Schedule 34 offtake power purchaser of power generated by Appaloosa as well as Graphite Solar, an 80 MW solar project in Carbon County, Utah.  Pacificorp, a Berkshire Hathaway utility, also purchases power from Appaloosa as well as the other Utah solar facilities.
Resta explained that corporate purchasers like Meta are able to procure power from rPlus facilities in Utah under Rocky Mountain Power’s Schedule 34 green energy tariff, a utility tariff which allows the Utah utility to execute power agreements in excess of 5,000 kW on behalf of large corporate customers.
According to SEIA, Utah is the 12th largest installer of solar projects in the U.S. with 2.73 GW installed through September 30, of which utility projects remains the majority demographic, with a 1.9 GW development pipeline over the next five years across each sub-sector.  About $512 million in capital investment poured into the Beehive State in 2021.
Prior to the announced Green River Energy Center, D.E. Shaw Renewables Investments’ 230.6 MW Cove Mountain project in Beryl, Utah held the claim to largest solar PV project constructed in Utah.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/02/novel-redox-flow-battery-paves-way-for-low-cost-storage/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022",Novel redox flow battery paves way for low-cost storage,"Redox flow batteries are one of the most attractive technologies for large-scale stationary storage applications due to their low capital cost, excellent safety, and environmental credentials. Their most unique feature is the independent scalability of energy and power. However, the latter is normally not possible in hybrid flow battery systems.
Now, researchers at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio, have come up with a concept for a slurry iron redox flow battery. It offers the potential for very low-cost, large-scale energy storage with safe and sustainable materials. By incorporating a conducting carbon slurry into the negative electrolyte of an all-iron flow battery, the researchers have ensured that the iron plating reaction occurs in such a way that makes the decoupling of power from energy possible for their hybrid flow battery system.
“Our iron slurry battery has advantages over the hybrid iron flow battery, where metal is plated into the electrochemical cell,” Nicholas Sinclair, research engineer at the CWRU Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, told pv magazine.
The slurry electrode allows for the plated metal to be directed into tanks for long-duration energy storage, Sinclair said. The hybrid system is limited in how much energy they can store by how much metal fits into the cell.
“In the slurry system, you can simply add more electrolyte and make the tanks bigger without changing the size of the electrochemical cell, which determines the power output,” Sinclair said.
The researchers described the scalability of the novel redox flow battery in “A perspective on the design and scale up of a novel redox flow battery” which was recently published in MRS Energy and Sustainability. They said that while the scaling of flow batteries is simple due to their modular nature, it becomes complicated when making large-scale increases in a single step. Nonetheless, their  proposed battery technology is now edging toward commercialization.
“The battery technology was developed under an ARPA-E program for several years. During that project the technology matured to a point where commercial scale units are now being designed and tested by a company who licensed the technology from us,” said Sinclair. “We have follow-on funding for developing the technology further and expanding it to other battery chemistries as well.”
While the final price tag of the novel battery could change when it is commercialized, cost estimates calculated under the ARPA-E project stand at around $50/kWh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/02/the-mobility-revolution-pge-obtains-first-v2g-export-rate-for-commercial-evs-in-us/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: PG&E obtains first V2G export rate for commercial EVs in US,"from pv magazine global
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E) has secured approval to establish the first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) export compensation mechanism in the United States for commercial EV charging customers. The new export rate structure in its California service area was agreed between PG&E and the Vehicle-Grid Integration Council, Electrify America LLC, and the Public Advocates Office at the California Public Utilities Commission. Commercial EV owners will receive upfront incentives to help offset fleet costs, while encouraging vehicles to export power to support the grid during peak demand periods. The charging equipment will be paired with stationary energy storage systems, which will be available to support the grid and provide backup power to charge vehicles during grid outages. PG&E says more than 420,000 EVs have been sold in its service area, representing one in six EVs in the United States.
Sono Motors has brought its Sion EV for a seven-city US tour ahead of its expected delivery next year. The Sion is marketed as the world’s first affordable solar EV, with a price tag of about €25,000 ($24,700). Its outer shell features 456 solar half-cells to extend the time between charges and enable self-sufficiency on short journeys, according to the Munich-based manufacturer. Sion’s 54 kWh LFP battery will allow for a maximum charging capacity of up to 75 kW (DC) and 11 kW (AC). The vehicle also has an on-board bidirectional charger of up to 11 kW. The company says it has received more than 20,000 private reservations and more than 22,000 pre-orders from fleet operators to date. In partnership with Valmet Automotive, Sono Motors plans to start production in Finland in the second half of 2023, and aims to produce approximately 257,000 vehicles within seven years.
Toyota and Jera have commissioned a second-life battery at the Japanese utility’s Yokkaichi Thermal Power Station. They have combined lithium-ion, nickel metal-hydride and lead-acid batteries into a single system. The 485 kW/1,260 kWh Sweep Energy Storage System was built with batteries reclaimed from electric vehicles (HEV, PHEV, BEV, FCEV) and is connected to the grid to “feed around 100,000 kWh of electricity into the public grid by the middle of the decade.” Its sweep function, developed by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc., allows retired EV batteries to be reused regardless of their level of deterioration. It can freely control energy discharge by switching electricity flow on and off through series-connected batteries in microseconds. It also enables direct AC output from the batteries to reduce costs and avoid power loss when converting from AC to DC.
Solar Botanic Trees has agreed to supply UK-based Raw Charging with 200 solar trees for its network of commercial EV charging sites. Deliveries will start in mid-2023 and will finish in 2024. The solar trees feature thin-film cell technology, are 5 meters tall, with a 5-meter dome and 5 kW of output. The order was signed just six weeks after SolarBotanic Trees was launched as a company. “We are currently starting to look at various regional locations for our manufacturing,” says Chris Shelley, SolarBotanic CEO.
Evergrande has started deliveries of the Hengchi 5, its first electric vehicle model. The first 100 customers received their cars on Saturday, the Chinese company said on its official WeChat account. Evergrande plans to shift its parent company’s primary business from real estate to car manufacturing over the next decade. Its goal is to make 1 million vehicles by 2025.
BP Pulse has announced plans for a Gigahub network: a series of large, fast EV-charging hubs to serve taxi fleets in the United States. The first planned location will be built near Los Angeles International Airport in collaboration with Hertz and will be partially funded by a $2 million grant from the California Energy Commission. The initiative aims to mitigate the environmental impact of ride-hailing services in Los Angeles. “Vehicles employed by California’s ride-hailing fleets make up 2.5% of the vehicle population, but consume 30% of all public fast charging,” said Patty Monahan, Lead California Energy Commissioner for Transportation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/02/u-s-doe-offers-43-million-to-support-communities-in-building-resilience/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022",U.S. DOE offers $43 million to support communities in building resilience,"The Department of Energy (DOE)  announced $43 million the Renewables Advancing Community Energy Resilience (RACER) funding program for 20 research projects that will focus on increasing communities’ resilience to disruptions from disasters. Through the  Energyshed funding program, three projects will focus on building tools to help communities better evaluate and benefit from local energy resources. These projects will help communities secure their energy future and support the Biden administration’s goals of decarbonizing the electricity sector by 2035 and achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.
The work being done will be shared so that best practices can be replicated in communities across the country as they work to install clean energy and strengthen grid infrastructure.
“Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to giving local communities the tools to understand and make informed decisions about their own energy supply and needs,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “These critical projects will help deliver reliable, affordable energy to every pocket of America—strengthening the safety and resiliency of communities across the nation and improving the quality of life for Americans everywhere.”
Climate change has caused an increase in extreme weather events in recent years. According to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, the U.S. has sustained 15 climate disaster events in 2022 with losses exceeding $1 billion each. Overall, these events, including the recent hurricane in Puerto Rico. have cost $30 billion and had significant economic effects on the areas impacted.
RACER seeks to enable communities to use solar and solar-plus-storage solutions to prevent disruptions in power caused by extreme weather and other events, and to rapidly restore electricity if the power goes down. The 20 projects selected will help with energy planning and develop and demonstrate resilient clean energy technologies. These projects will assist more than 30 diverse communities from California to Puerto Rico, and include partners from local and state governments, national labs, universities, and nonprofit organizations.

Examples of some projects are listed below:
The Energyshed funding program aims to build data-driven tools to help communities better understand their current and future energy supply and demand landscape. These three projects will develop tools to empower communities to evaluate the impacts and benefits of locally generated energy ($10 million):
Both funding programs support President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure that the clean energy economy benefits all Americans, especially those in underserved communities and in areas vulnerable to extreme weather. By sharing best practices from these research projects, DOE aims to enable communities across the country to learn from the findings and develop a tailored approach to meet their own energy needs.

The microgrid features interconnected solar, battery energy storage, and all-electric smart appliances. The new home communities are located in Menifee, California, situated inland between San Diego and Los Angeles.
KB Home is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy, SunPower, the Advanced Power and Energy Program at the University of California, Irvine, Southern California Edison, Schneider Electric, and Kia to test the energy-efficient and resilient new homes at the Shadow Mountain master plan area in Menifee.
Each home is equipped with smart technologies and microgrid technology, meaning the community can flexibly and efficiently move the solar-generated electricity where and when it is needed most.
KB Home said its sustainable-design homes have cumulatively led to an estimated $856 million in reduced energy bills. To date, the company estimates it has abated 6.3 billion pounds of carbon emissions, the equivalent of taking 616,000 gas-powered cars off the road for a year. The homebuilder has delivered over 14,000 solar homes, achieving 44 MW of solar power installed.
A study by the University of Otago found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both energy load smoothing and peak demand shaving, meaning the flexible use of energy reduces the amount of infrastructure buildout to support demand. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90%  or peak shaving.
“Working with industry and academic leaders, we plan to explore how these energy-smart connected communities can help protect the environment and turn our homes into their own power centers designed to deliver resiliency while also reducing the overall cost of long-term homeownership,” said Jeffrey Mezger, KB Home’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.
The project partners will conduct research, measuring energy efficiency of the energy-smart community as compared to traditional residential solar communities. They will help develop methods to more effectively meet requirements of future energy codes. The partners will also seek to refine methods for maximizing the efficiency of smart-connected devices working in concert with each other. The study will continue beyond the development stage of the community.
KB Home said some of the benefits of the housing community include:
“KB Home has been at the forefront of deploying advanced technologies and energy solutions for the benefit of our homebuyers. In our pursuit of building better homes, better communities and a better future, we believe that our all-electric, solar- and battery-powered homes at Oak Shade and Durango in Menifee, California have the potential to deliver significant energy savings,” said Mezger.

The VPP network marks the first large-scale distributed storage program on the island to date.
Prone to repeat hurricanes over the past few years, Puerto Rico’s VPP network will harden the island’s power grid by networking more than 7,000 Sunrun residential solar plus energy storage systems.
The Governing Board of PREPA approved the terms of the VPP agreement on October 26, and the agreement is subject to further review by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau and the Fiscal Oversight Management Board.
Sunrun will enroll new Puerto Rico customers throughout 2023 in order to begin the VPP network dispatches in 2024. According to Sunrun, customers will benefit from on-site and back-up power cost savings, as well as receive compensation for providing battery storage back into PREPA’s power grid, creating grid resiliency. New customers who enroll in the VPP network can opt out at any time under the 10-year program, the company says.
“We’re solving energy insecurity on the island by switching the model so that solar energy is generated on rooftops and stored in batteries to power each home, and then shared with neighbors, creating a clean shared energy economy,” said Mary Powell, Sunrun CEO.
Following the destructive Hurricane Maria of 2017, the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act was passed by Puerto Rico’s government in April 2019 which created a framework for the installation of distributed generation resources such as solar and battery storage.
More than 3 million Puerto Rico residents were without power following Hurricane Fiona’s landfall on Puerto Rico on September 17, while Sunrun customers on the island were able to use power through extended outages, providing more than 350,000 hours of backup power to thousands of homes.
According to the EIA, renewable energy represented just 3% of Puerto Rico’s power mix through 2021, with the island generating the majority of its electricity from natural gas, oil and coal.
VPP systems allow utilities to provide power from local renewable energy resources rather than conventional power plants during daily peak power intervals and in emergency events, while allowing residential customers to participate by utilizing their home solar and storage systems to support grid resiliency.
Sunrun participates in more than 12 U.S. VPP networks, with its VPP systems provided 1.1 and 1.8 GWh of energy to local grids during recent extreme weather conditions.

Kentucky, which ranks 26th in population in the United States, ranks 46th in solar installations, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. With just 78 MW installed, or enough to power just over 7,500 homes, there’s much PV opportunity in the Bluegrass State. However, according to SEIA, the state is on track to install only 1,594 MW over the next five years, dropping it to number 30 in the country.

With electricity cost currently at just 13.24 cents per kWh (according to EIA data), residents and business owners don’t have as much incentive as in states with much higher electricity costs. Financial incentives for Kentucky residents to go solar are currently few and far between.
Kentucky does not have a renewable portfolio standard, nor does it have a voluntary renewable energy target. The status of net metering now varies depending upon the utility, but traditional 1:1 net metering remains in effect for much of the state. Rates are set by the Public Service Commission (PSC) in rate cases brought by each utility. To-date, only LG&E, KU, and KY Power Company have applied to change their net metering rates.
Energy communities
Help is on the way thanks to the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers commercial solar and energy storage projects up to 10% additional tax credit for projects built within an “energy community”, which is defined as an area that, after 2000, had “significant employment related to the extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil, or natural gas,” and as a “census tract in which after 2000, a coal mine has closed, or after December 31, 2009, a coal-fired electric generating unit has been retired, or which is directly adjoining to any census tract described in subclause.”
While Kentucky was a leading coal producing state, that industry has fallen on hard times. For example, at the end of 2011, nearly92,000 people were employed in the U.S. coal industry, but by 2016, that number had dropped to 51,800. Since 2012, more than 60 coal companies have filed for bankruptcy or liquidation. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic delivered another shock, with a further 7,000 jobs being shed by the coal industry that year. Needless to say, Kentucky is rife with “energy communities” that can take advantage of the incentives from the IRA.
Landmark projects
Under development by Savion, the Martin County Solar Project is a 200 MW solar project being constructed on 1,200 acres of the former Martiki coal mine site in Martin County, near the Kentucky-West Virginia border. Construction of the facility is expected to begin this year and it is expected to achieve commercial operation early 2024. The project is the largest in Kentucky known to pv magazine, unseating the former record holder, ACCIONA’s 188 MW Fleming County Solar Project, currently under construction.
To spur further investment, some utilities, such as TVA, offer programs. TVA’s Green Investment Program aims to help businesses, industry and municipalities to meet their sustainability goals.  General Motors and Facebook both signed up as offtakers for a solar-plus-storage project in Southern Kentucky.
The last stop on the pv magazine tour of the 50 states of solar incentives was Florida, and next we will continue onto Tennessee.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/02/wisconsin-groups-find-100-clean-energy-electrification-to-be-ambitious-but-feasible/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,WISCONSIN",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022",Wisconsin groups find 100% clean energy + electrification to be ambitious but feasible,"Wisconsin has “an ambitious but possible path” to zero carbon from all sectors by 2050, as shown by an economy-wide carbon modeling study that was “unprecedented” for the state, said Andrew Kell, policy analyst at Renew Wisconsin, a study sponsor.
Wisconsin would add 31 GW of solar, 21 GW of wind and 7 GW of battery storage under the study’s net-zero economy-wide scenario, while electrifying transportation, heating and industry. The state would also add transmission and flexible demand, and improve energy efficiency.
The economy-wide study builds on work by the Wisconsin Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change, and a clean energy plan prepared by the state government, said Chelsea Chandler, a program director with Clean Wisconsin, a study sponsor. The study showed that “the transition to a clean energy future is absolutely feasible for our state,” she said.
Economy-wide decarbonization by 2050 would cost about the same as both a baseline “business as usual” scenario and a 100% clean electricity scenario, the modeling showed. When counting the health benefits of reduced fine particulate pollution from ending fossil fuel combustion, the net-zero economy-wide scenario would yield net savings compared to business as usual. The economy-wide scenario would also reduce carbon emissions 40% by 2030, compared to the 2005 level.
The consultancy Evolved Energy Research conducted the modeling, using both the open source EnergyPATHWAYS model of all energy-using technologies in the economy, and its proprietary economy-wide RIO optimization model. The consultancy GridLab, a study sponsor, published the study, plus a summary and a companion report on economic and jobs impacts.
The companion study projected that pursuing the net-zero economy-wide path would create an additional 68,000 jobs in manufacturing, construction, electricity and other services. “Wisconsin’s labor market is well prepared to meet these new labor needs,” GridLab said, as the state awards 5,000 engineering degrees and certificates annually.
The summary report recommends 30 policy measures that the state legislature or the state utilities regulator could pursue, to help achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide.
Distributed solar
Distributed solar installations were assumed to total 2.5 GW by 2050, or 8% of the total solar installed. That amount was not selected by the model, said Clean Wisconsin attorney Brett Korte, because several factors that would most influence distributed solar adoption were not included in the modeling. Those factors include rate design and incentive programs, job promotion programs, and customer preference that goes beyond a cost/benefit analysis, he said.
Rooftop solar deployment was instead estimated based on a rooftop solar potential report prepared by the consultancy Cadmus, specifically for Wisconsin, which projected market adoption through 2034.
Other resources
The net-zero economy-wide scenario also called for 18 GW of added transmission capacity linking Wisconsin to three neighboring states, and demand flexibility achieved with 2 GW of hydrogen electrolyzers and 3 GW of dual-fuel electric boilers that could switch between pipeline gas and electricity. Gas-fired generating units by 2050 would be fueled by methane from anaerobic digestion of biomass, and would run only 5% of the time.
The report acknowledges that the changes in the economy required to follow the net-zero economy-wide scenario would be “significant,” including “demand-side transformation” to achieve a switch to electric vehicles and heating, associated expansion of the electricity distribution infrastructure, transmission expansion to access out-of-state resources, and rapid growth of renewables.
The study examined several other scenarios to achieve 100% clean energy if, for example, consumer purchases of electric vehicles and heat pumps lagged the central scenario’s expectations, or it was not possible to add transmission.
The Evolved Energy Research study is titled “Achieving 100% Clean Energy in Wisconsin.” Renew Wisconsin represents both the renewables industry and individual members, and is the state affiliate of the national solar trade group SEIA. Clean Wisconsin is a citizen’s group that works to protect Wisconsin’s clean water, clean air and natural heritage.
