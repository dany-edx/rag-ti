Since 1993, he’s grown his hobby into one of the top solar powered craft breweries in the United States and his Lagunitas beers are now available in more than 20 countries and counting.
Lagunitas Brewing Company, where thousands of people congregate annually for live music, food and of course – craft beer – produces millions of barrels a year, and as a result uses a great deal of power. This welcomed the idea of installing solar panels, not only to reduce the company’s utility bills, but also to reduce carbon emissions.
Through a hired consultant and rigorous bidding process, Westcoast Solar Energy – A boutique commercial solar integrator based just a few miles up the road from Lagunitas – was chosen to take on the project and ultimately recommended LG solar panels.
When the consultant provided Lagunitas with an energy analysis showing the brewery’s power requirements from solar, an estimate that they thought was going to be impossible to hit, they realized it was crucial to choose a solar panel manufacturer with high performing modules and a track record of reliability.
Given the property’s large footprint, the team sought to install three separate arrays. The first was placed on the administrative building which holds around 25 employees, the second on a cold storage building that houses the beer, and the third was installed as a ground mount on a farm owned by the brewery on an adjoining property. The working farm is home to a herd of cattle and sheep that are fed spent grain from the brewing process in addition to their grass diet.
A key challenge for West Coast Solar was configuring the installation in tight spaces on some of the buildings. This meant that adaptability was another criteria that had to strongly be considered when choosing the right solar manufacturer partner.

Having made a commitment to install a premium solar solution for the brewery, Westcoast Solar recommended LG’s 72-cell 340W solar panels, knowing those are well worth the value due to their high performance and reputation, in addition to their own custom racking systems. Westcoast designed and implemented a unique ground mount design that allowed the array to benefit the farm instead of taking away from valuable grazing land. The elevated “Cow-Port” structures were placed at a height where the cows and sheep could graze under the array and provided much needed shade for the herd in the hot California summers. The individual arrays were spaced far apart which allowed for light to reach under the arrays allowing the grass to continue growing.
“This was our first megawatt sized project using LG solar panels and since then, they’re our exclusive offering. As a premium integrator, we provide the best long-term solutions for our customers and continue to prioritize array operations and performance at year 20 as much, if not more than, at year one,” said Nate Gulbransen, President of Westcoast Solar Energy. “In looking at which manufacturer was the best fit for this project, we wanted a company that would match that same commitment and LG stood out. With LG solar panels, we’re confident that what we build today will be the best performing solar array possible and will produce the most amount of energy not just for the near term, but for a long time to come.”
The initial stages of the project were completed quickly, with new energy efficient roofs for the two penetrated flat-roof arrays. A 230 kW DC administrative building array and a 1.05 MW DC cold storage building array. The Cow-Port (ground-mount) however, located on the other side of the nearby train track took a bit more work to put together. Permits for the ground mount totaled over a year and a half due to the technicality of it being located in a separate jurisdiction on protected farm land. The feat of bringing power from one side of the train track to the other was another tricky situation to navigate. To top it off, amid the project development, Sonoma County suffered extensive damages from a massive wildfire which destroyed over 5,000 homes. Despite the delays, Lagunitas successfully received its third and final installment of the 850 kW Cow-Port.
Results:
The $5 million-dollar, 2.1 MW solar project, inclusive of more than 6,000 LG solar panels, was able to offset about two thirds (60%) of the brewery’s energy use and budget during that first year. Prior to the installation, the brewery spent about $1 million annually on electricity. For a different perspective, the solar panels generate enough power for more than 600 average-sized homes.
In 2020, the establishment was forced to close down temporarily given the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the solar panels were able to over produce energy given there were fewer visitors. This resulted in the return of some dollars over to the brewery at the end of the year after selling energy to local power utilities. Lagunitas has since reopened its doors following the state’s COVID guidelines.
“Operating the brewery through solar panels and offsetting the amount of energy that we are using is an incredible feeling,” said Keely Wachs, Head of Consumer Affairs & CSR of Lagunitas Brewing Company. “Not only are we excited to see this green energy do great things for Lagunitas, but we’re also proud to know that it’s doing great things for the environment and our community as well.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/16/residential-solar-pricing-down-6-3-hints-of-greater-drops-coming/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 16, 2021","Residential solar pricing down 6.3%, hints of greater drops coming","EnergySage has released its thirteenth Solar Marketplace Intel Report, in which the company shows that customers were quoted 27% lower prices in the first half of 2021 (H1‘21) versus 2014, and that residential solar pricing is down 6.3% since July of 2020.
This acceleration – starting in July 2020, and ending before July of this year – is compared to the slower price decreases Energysage saw starting in the first half of 2017, and ending with the first half of 2020.
The data shows a broad distribution of pricing, though, and a single national price average doesn’t do it justice. While the median price quoted was $2.67 per watt, greater than 25% of all quotes were $2.25/watt. The long tail of pricing going upward beyond $4.00/watt balanced out the heavy volumes of quotes below the national average.
That fact that so much capacity is being quoted below $2.25/watt is probably worthy of research, so we can better understand the pricing possibilities of the US residential solar market.

Oddly, the nation’s most expensive state, Colorado, at $3.15/watt, is a neighbor of the cheapest state, Arizona, at $2.25/watt.
Notably, while the price has fallen by 6.3% since last year, the average payback time for a similarly sized 10.2 kWdc project has actually increased – from 8.5 to 8.8 years.
A few hypotheses on what’s behind the increased average payback time:

Energy storage pricing is mixed, and on average it went up across the nation. However, in key markets like Florida, California, and Texas, pricing is down. Furthermore, we’re seeing Enphase take an increasingly larger share of the home storage market, passing by Tesla to become the number one supplier.
Interestingly, Enphase is tied with Sonnen as the most expensive home battery product tracked, at roughly 50% more than Tesla’s Powerwall. Enphase’s product success probably has something to do with the increase in energy storage pricing overall.

This nuance in pricing is also potentially indicative of why people are buying batteries: for a backup power source. The second most important reason is to save cash on their electricity bill.
We shouldn’t be surprised that a large number of people have been buying storage for resilience purposes. Generac, a new entrant to the solar+storage industry, has sold billions in home generators, which saved consumers nothing on their electricity bills. A generator’s payback is measured in units of comfort: air-conditioning, lights, and frozen foods.

While Energysage has found that customers have always had an interest in energy storage, there is a strong variance in this interest based on geographic location. Many of the states seeking storage are in the central region of the nation, and in places without policies as supportive of solar. Regions that have suffered recent power grid failures have shown a strong energy storage preference as well.
Energysage says that its data shows clear shifts toward greater demand for energy storage, which remained persistent throughout the past five months, following the Texas power grid failure in February of this year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/16/community-solar-brownfield-pilot-project-nears-completion-in-new-jersey/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW JERSEY",TIM SYLVIA,"AUGUST 16, 2021",Community solar brownfield pilot project nears completion in New Jersey,"The first round of projects awarded under New Jersey’s Community Solar Energy Pilot Program are starting to come to life, as developer Navisun has said that its Linden Hawk Rise, a 4.5 MW community solar project in Union County, is nearing completion.
The project is being built on the City of Linden’s former landfill, converting a previously unusable site into a productive solar farm. Navisun acquired the project back in January.
The state’s community solar pilot, administered by New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program, provides access to solar energy through a subscription-based model. In its first year of the pilot, regulators awarded slightly more than the allocated 75 MW, with 78 MW across 45 projects being approved.
A key stipulation of the program is that at least 40% of all approved projects reserve at least 51% of their capacity to serve low- and middle-income households. Of the roughly 800 New Jersey residents Linden Hawk Rise is expected to deliver energy to, more than half are low- or middle-income.
The 40% project requirement proved an easy stipulation to meet, as 100% of the projects approved in year one reserved at least 51% of their capacity for low- and middle-income customers. For year two of the pilot, where the total awarded capacity was doubled from 75 MW to 150 MW, all but one of the projects applied for approval, which represented more than 800.5 MW of total capacity, met the reservation criteria.
Linden Hawk Rise will be among the first projects awarded in round one of the program to achieve commercial operation. In January, the first community solar projects were energized as part of the pilot program’s first year. Projects included 7 MW in Perth Amboy, near New York City, constructed by New Jersey-based developer Solar Landscape. Following in their footsteps, developer Soltage announced the completion of a 3.1 MW installation this past May. That project was also constructed on a closed landfill.
