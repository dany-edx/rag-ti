https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/10/rmi-launches-virtual-power-plant-partnership-with-google-nest-and-gm/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 10, 2023",RMI launches virtual power plant partnership with Google Nest and GM,"RMI, a nonprofit dedicated to accelerating the global energy transformation, announced the formation of the Virtual Power Plant Partnership (VP3). Initial funding of the VP3 effort was made possible by General Motors and Google Nest. Founding members include Ford, General Motors, Google Nest, OhmConnect, Olivine, SPAN, SunPower, Sunrun, SwitchDin, and Virtual Peaker.
VPPs aggregate and coordinate distributed energy resources to benefit all those who rely on the electric grid. They are made up of portfolios of numerous households and businesses that have energy assets, such as electric vehicles, batteries, solar arrays, and other devices that support the grid.
Through a combination of software and hardware, VPPs “open the grid to a whole new utility-scale, behind-the-meter supply”, said Jigar Shaw in “Achieving a zero-carbon grid”. VPPs help balance the grid by using software to adjust charging, discharging, output, and demand from the DERs (with customer permission) in response to signals from markets and grid operators.
VP3 is an initiative based at RMI that intends to catalyze industry and transform policy to support scaling energy assets such as electric vehicles (EVs), smart thermostats, appliances, batteries, solar arrays, and others to support the grid. The initiative follows in the path of successful institutional spinoffs in the electric sector space previously incubated by RMI including the Clean Energy Buyers Association and the Energy Web Foundation.
Virtual power plants are poised for explosive growth, and RMI is committed to being at the forefront of their success by launching VP3. Our analysis shows that VPPs can reduce peak power demand and improve grid resilience in a world of increasingly extreme climate events. A growing VPP market also means revenue opportunities for hardware, software, and energy-service companies in the buildings and automotive industries. For large energy users, VPPs can significantly reduce energy spend while providing new revenue streams. Jon Creyts, chief executive, Rock Mountain Institute
VP3 is working toward a future where businesses, households, and communities are empowered through VPPs that can help to support cost-effective energy, emissions reductions, and a more resilient electricity grid. To achieve this, VP3 will work to:
“The next 12 to 24 months are critical for policy and program development to seize the potential offered by virtual power plants, and VP3 is here to ensure that the energy transition doesn’t miss a beat,” said Mark Dyson, RMI managing director for carbon-free electricity.
GM is supporting the initiative because of the role that VPPs can play in ensuring a more resilient grid. “This collaboration underscores GM’s commitment to creating a more resilient grid, with EVs and virtual power plants playing a key role in helping to advance our all-electric future,” said Mark Bole, vice president and head of V2X and battery solutions at GM.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/10/the-largest-solar-project-in-south-dakota-begins-construction/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH DAKOTA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 10, 2023",The largest solar project in South Dakota begins construction,"South Dakota is about to take its first step into the utility-scale solar space as National Grid Renewables announced it has broken ground on its 128 MW Wild Springs solar project. The Pennington County project is located in the Southwest Power Pool and will sell its production to utility Basin Electric Power Cooperative via a 114 MW power purchase agreement.
The project is set to change the presence of solar in the state considerably, as the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports only 2 MW currently in operation through Q3 2022, ranking it 50th in terms of deployment. At the present time the state has enough solar energy to power only about 245 homes and post-activation of Wild Springs it will have the capacity to power nearly 16,000 South Dakotan homes.
The project applied for interconnection in the Southwest Power Pool in 2017 and received approval from the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission in 2020. It is anticipated to reach commercial operations in 2023. The project is expected to lead to a total of $190 million in capital infrastructure improvements.
Ames Construction was selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction partner for the project, which is expected to create 250 jobs during peak construction.
First Solar Series 6 thin-film solar modules will be installed in the project. National Grid announced it secured a 2 GW order of modules from the provider in July 2022. The cadmium telluride solar modules are expected to be delivered in 2024 and 2025 for projects across the United States.
Once operational, Wild Springs is expected to avoid 190,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually and is estimated to produce $12 million in new tax revenue through the first 20 years of operation. National Grid said it anticipates donating over $500,000 during the first 20 years of operation to the local community through a planned charitable fund for the New Underwood school district.
The project is expected to lead to the modification or removal of 1,037 acres of land. However, 96% of the disturbed area will be revegetated with a rangeland seed mix, leading to about 47 acres of habitat removal in total.
“Wild Springs represents a continuation of our leadership in renewable energy and economic development in the state of South Dakota,” commented Blake Nixon, president of National Grid Renewables. “Our Crocker Wind Farm located in Clark County began operation in 2019, and now with Wild Springs, we will have nearly 330 MW of clean energy projects in the state, all of which contribute significantly to the tax base, as well as the local communities that host the projects.”

Sunnova’s EaaS offering is a holistic energy management system that integrates solar, energy storage, electric vehicle charging, standby generators, smart appliances, grid services, and home climate controls. Now, SolarEdge’s home battery will be offered alongside the full set of Sunnova EaaS products and services.
The home battery offers stability in an environment of energy price inflation and volatility, grid instability, and continually shifting rooftop solar utility net-metered credit payment calculations.
SolarEdge’s battery is characterized by its DC-coupled design, which requires just one power conversion when consuming solar-generated electricity. Traditional AC-coupled batteries require three power conversions, losing efficiency each time the power is shifted from DC to AC and back again.
The company said this efficiency adds up over time, and over the course of a year, it can lead to 10 full days of saved energy when compared to a typical 10 kW solar array in self-consumption mode (no battery). The battery is robust enough to provide continuous power, allowing users to consume stored power for large devices like washing machines and HVAC systems for longer periods of time.
Each battery comes equipped with 9.7 kWh of backup capacity, and up to nine batteries (three per inverter) can be stacked to achieve an 87.3 kWh backup system with 30 kW of continuous power. The battery has a round-trip efficiency of 94.5%. It is capable of being charged while simultaneously exporting power to the grid for utility bill credits.
“Homeowners’ energy demands are increasing at a time when utility bills are skyrocketing and grid instability is becoming more frequent,” said William Berger, chief executive of Sunnova. “[The partnership] marks an important next step forward in our mission to deliver highly robust, industry-leading solutions that meet homeowner demand to live in a more energy-efficient and energy-independent way.”
The battery is compliant with the UL9540A advanced safety standard. SolarEdge said the battery was designed to meet installer demand for a residential solution that is fast and cost-effective to install. The battery cabinet layout features accessible cable management and wireless communication to speed up installation and decrease commissioning times.
Sunnova (NOVA) and SolarEdge (SEDG) are among the largest publicly traded solar industry companies on the New York Stock Exchange.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/10/waste-to-hydrogen-facility-to-fuel-transportation-in-california/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Waste-to-hydrogen facility to fuel transportation in California,"Raven SR Inc., a renewable fuels company, Chevron New Energies, a division of Chevron U.S.A. Inc., and Hyzon Motors Inc., a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles, are collaborating on the commercialization of a green waste-to-hydrogen production facility in Richmond, California. The trio expects production to begin in Q1 2024, and the intention is to supply hydrogen fuel to transportation markets in Northern California.
The three entities have formed a new company, Raven SR S1 LLC, which will be the operator of the facility. Chevron New Energies owns a 50% equity stake in Raven SR S1, Raven SR holds a 30% stake, and Hyzon owns the remaining 20%.
The Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill will provide up to 99 wet tons of green and food waste every day to produce the hydrogen. Using a non-combustion steam/CO2 reforming process, the company expects to produce up to 2,400 metric-tons per year of renewable hydrogen.
The technology is a non-combustion thermal, chemical reductive process that results in hydrogen and Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuels. Unlike other hydrogen production technologies, the company said its steam/CO2 reformation process uses less than half the energy of electrolysis. The combustion process uses no fresh water, which is important in California, given its drought issues, and it is more efficient than conventional hydrogen production and can deliver fuel with low to negative carbon intensity.
Diversion of this organic waste will help fulfill the Organic Waste Reduction mandates of California’s SB 1383, potentially avoiding up to 7,200 metric-tons per year of CO2 emissions from the landfill.
The project is expected to be self-powered as it will produce at least 60% of its own electricity by upgrading the currently permitted and zoned landfill gas electric generators at the landfill for its non-combustion process.
Chevron plans to market its share of the hydrogen in Bay Area and Northern California fueling stations. Hyzon plans to provide refueling for hydrogen fuel cell trucks at a hydrogen hub in Richmond.
“Our strategic partners’ commitment to the first non-combustion Steam/CO2 facility in the world will help drive our commercial operations in Richmond and accelerate similar facilities globally. This facility will be the first hydrogen production plant in the world to reduce greenhouse gases, including critically important short-lived climate pollutants, through its process and its product. By removing waste from the landfill, it will help reduce methane emissions. Not only will the greater Richmond community benefit from reduced emissions, investments, and jobs, it will also see economic benefits as local gas stations have a consistent supply of clean, zero-carbon hydrogen fuel for fuel cell vehicles. We are grateful to work with partners who share our mission to make cleaner fuel options available as soon as possible.” Matt Murdock, CEO of Raven
Chevron and Hyzon were among Raven SR’s initial strategic investors, along with ITOCHU, Ascent Hydrogen Fund and Samsung Ventures.
“We are excited about this collaboration and our expanded commitment to Raven and its waste-to-hydrogen technology,” said Austin Knight, vice president of Hydrogen for Chevron New Energies. “Not only are we positioned to commercialize a first-of-its-kind lower carbon hydrogen project, we are working to reduce emissions in a community in which we have a long and proud history. With a relatively short lead time, we will be able to further develop the hydrogen ecosystem in the region.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/10/silicon-cost-per-watt-down-96-over-last-two-decades/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Silicon cost per watt down 96% over last two decades,"Silicon is the semiconductor material at the heart of most solar cells. Thanks to advancements in technology, solar is now powering the world with a lot less silicon.
Research by Fraunhofer ISE shows that since 2004, the material usage of polysilicon per watt of solar cell has dropped by approximately 87%. The data suggests that in 2004, 16 grams of silicon were needed to produce a single watt of solar cell. By 2021, that number had shrunk to just over 2 grams.

For example, when the world’s largest solar farm – at just over 5 MW – turned on in Germany in 2004, it was using 150 watt solar panels. At the time, constructing one of these modules would have consumed 2,400 grams of the processed material.
In 2021, Maxeon signed a deal that 1.8 million of its Performance 5 UPP solar modules would be the powerhouse of the world’s 8th largest solar facility – the Primergy Solar farm in Nevada. If we assume that this 545 watt panel uses 2.2 grams of silicon per watt, we get 1,199 grams per module.
That’s approximately 360% higher output per solar panel — using only half of the silicon!
Of course, we’re going to use massively more silicon in 2023 than we did in 2004. In 2004, we deployed 1,044 MW of solar power, using just over 16,000 t of silicon globally. According to Bloomberg, 268 GW of solar was deployed in 2022, which is over 250 times more capacity than what was deployed in 2004. At 2.2 grams per watt, the 268 GW used approximately 590,000 ktg of silicon, or 35 times more silicon than was used in 2004.
The volume of silicon used is only half the story.
During the 2004 to 2022 window, the price of polysilicon actually did not stray too far from its original price, if we ignore inflation, and a few “bumps” along the way.

Source: Bernreuter Research
Bernreuter Research’s excellent history on those bumps in polysilicon pricing shows that in 2004, the price of the material was roughly $45 per kilogram. Between the end of 2003 and the end of 2004, the price of silicon nearly doubled, due to an expansion of German solar programs. But the price movement didn’t stop there. As the world’s installed solar capacity grew over 600% between 2004 and 2008, the price of polysilicon grew by about 1000%.
The price increases led to bankruptcies and lawsuits.
What followed was another dramatic price movement, as the manufacturing might of the Chinese government took the industry by storm. The growing nation determined that solar energy would be a national security consideration, and as a result, polysilicon prices plunged. Over the next two decades, we saw the price below $10/kg – with spot market moments in the $6/kg range. $6/kg is only 1.3% of polysilicon’s 2008 peak price of $460/kg.
In the past two years, we’ve seen the price of polysilicon increase to nearly $45/kg on heavy demand. And in the last month or two, we have seen pricing falling 54%, to $17, as a potential 536 GW of manufacturing capacity comes online.
The last variable to complete our analysis is inflation.

Source: Inflation Calculator
When accounting for inflation of the U.S. dollar, the $45/kg cost in 2004 is equal to about $71/kg in 2022. If we consider that it took 16 grams to make a single watt in 2004, then the inflation-adjusted cost per watt of polysilicon in 2004 was approximately $1.14/watt. In 2022, at 2.2 grams per watt at $17/kg – the price is $0.04/watt.
So, the real cost per watt of silicon has come down by 96.7%.

The project, Arche Solar, is a 134 MWdc solar facility in Fulton County, Ohio, which has secured a corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) with social media company Meta for a data center in New Albany, Ohio.
The project uses ultra-low carbon thin-film modules supplied by First Solar, which holds a multi-year agreement with BP.  At the time of its 2021 supply agreement, the companies agreed to lightsource bp suppling clean energy to the solar module manufacturer’s Ohio operations. Arche Solar is located on 650 acres of private land in Gorham Township, Ohio, 50 miles due west of First Solar’s Perrysburg, Ohio facilities. Energy generated at the Arche Solar plant will be delivered to an existing substation located adjacent to a 138 kilovolt transmission line.
Arche Solar was part of a pipeline of projects BP purchased through its June 2021 acquisition of an 7X Energy project portfolio for $220 million.  As part of the deal, BP acquired a 9 GW project development pipeline which expanded its renewable energy pipeline from 14GW to 23GW.
During Arche Solar’s construction, the project will employ 200 workers for installation, while the project provides enough power to supply 20,000 homes with clean energy, the equivalent of 155,900 metric tons of greenhouse gases avoided per year.
The Ohio Power Siting Board approved 7X Energy’s site permit for the project in April 2021. The project is projected to generate $30 million in tax revenue over its anticipated lifespan of 35+ years.
The project is part of BP’s plans to develop 20 GW of net renewable generating capacity by 2025 and 50GW by 2030.
“This agreement shows how companies can create jobs, invest in the US economy, and at the same time support net zero ambitions and help the world reduce carbon emissions,” said David Lawler, chairman and president of BP America. “It’s another example of bp partnering to accelerate change and becoming an integrated energy company – one that can help corporations, countries and cities decarbonize.”
McCarthy Building Companies was retained as the main contractor for Arche Solar.
The project will use solar trackers from Nextracker.
In November 2021, BP and Lightsource bp and placed multi-year orders for up to 5.4 GWdc combined of First Solar solar modules.  Under the deal, Lightsource bp bought up to 4.3 GWdc of modules for its project portfolio share, while BP agreed to buy 1.1 GWdc of modules for its respective projects owned.
The framework agreements provide modules for delivery between 2023 and 2025. Under the BP agreement, First Solar has firm orders for 1.55 GWdc of modules in 2023, 1.3 GWdc in 2024, and 1.55 GWdc in 2025.
With 916 MW of solar installations, Ohio ranks 26th in the nation for solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The Buckeye State has an aggressive five-year development pipeline of 8.83 GW, which, like PJM states like Indiana and Pennsylvania, could push the Ohio up into the teens in SEIA rankings.
