The 18 total projects have been procured across the U.S., Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K., and total 5.6 GW in combined capacity. These new utility-scale wind and solar projects bring Amazon’s total committed renewable electricity production capacity to more than 12 GW and 33,700 gigawatt hours (GWh) when the projects become fully operational.
Those 274 projects are comprised of 105 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 169 solar rooftops on facilities and stores.
The newly-announced renewable projects include more than 1 GW of utility-scale solar projects in the U.S., including Amazon’s first solar projects in Arizona and Georgia, and additional projects in Ohio, Texas, and Virginia, as well as Amazon’s second solar project paired with energy storage. This project, located in Arizona, clocks in as a 300 MW solar project, paired with a 150-MW battery energy storage system, which brings Amazon’s U.S. battery storage project capacity to 220 MW.
In total, Amazon has developed or acquired more than 6 GW of renewable energy in the U.S. via 62 projects.
According to the company, Amazon is on track to power 100% of its business operations with renewable energy by 2025—five years earlier than its original 2030 commitment.
At the end of October, Amazon tapped into its Climate Pledge Fund to invest in Resilient Power, a transformer-based EV fast charging maker, as part of the company’s plan to have 100,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030. 
Resilient makes a solid-state transformer that integrates a traditional step-down transformer, charger, power management, and bi-directional inverter into a single device. The charger can handle solar and storage, vehicle to grid, and microgrid capabilities in the same unit.

The offer is available to first-time battery adopters, and cannot be retroactively applied to existing battery installations. For data sharing, owners are offered a rebate of $500 per kW of battery capacity, up to $2,500 per home. An additional $1,250 is offered for those who sign up for the peak-demand energy sharing program.
Eligible participants must be APS residential customers, and enrolled in a time-of-use rate structure or grandfathered in to solar rate rider programs. In both options, enrollment last three years.
In the data-sharing program, participants are expected to provide their contact information, date of the battery’s permission to operate, and a set of battery specs (such as model, manufacturer, capacity, charge/discharge capacity, solar energy production, battery mode, and so on). The battery must be grid-connected to qualify.

The company said the system is transportable, off-grid, and requires no construction, permitting, or electrical work. Beam said its units may readily be set in place.
Beam said the new units stand 9.5 feet tall, and are wind-rated to 120 mph. The unit features an emergency power panel to serve fleet operators and first responders during grid failures and extreme weather events.
The station can power up to 265 electric miles in a day, charge six electric vehicles simultaneously, and serves as many as 12 parking spaces.
The design is intended to allow EV chargers of the customer’s choice to be integrated into Beam’s system. Beam said it has worked with ENEL X Juiceboxes, Electrify America, ChargePoint, among others.
New York City continues to move to decarbonize and make energy and transportation infrastructure more resilient. In April, for example, the city committed to a 100% electric school bus fleet by 2035, with 75 electric buses planned in the next two years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/02/westbridge-acquires-a-236-mw-canadian-solar-project/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 2, 2021",Westbridge acquires a 236 MW Canadian solar project,"Westbridge Energy Corporation has acquired a 75% controlling interest in Sunnynook Solar Energy, the company developing a 236 MW solar and 100 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) project in Alberta, Canada.
The project is currently in Stage 1 of the Alberta Electric System Operator interconnection process, with environmental studies underway in accordance with Alberta Environment and Parks guidelines.
With this acquisition in hand, Westbridge now owns three utility-scale solar development projects totaling 735 MW in capacity. Westbridge has also initiated two BESS projects in Alberta which would add an additional 200MW of battery storage capacity to its portfolio.
While Canada is a relatively nascent solar market compared to the United States, the country’s commitment to solar has grown recently, and Canada ended 2020 with a total solar capacity of roughly 3,000 MW. About 70 MW of solar was installed in Canada in 2020.
That number is expected to grow pretty significantly, however, as the Canadian Renewable Energy Association expects close to 2 GW of wind and solar projects to begin construction or complete installation before the end of the year. The country is also seeing a rise in geographic diversity of projects; early Canadian installations were mostly contained to Ontario.
Alongside the Sunnynook project, Westbridge is developing the 230 MW Georgetown Solar Project, set to be constructed on 710 acres of privately owned cultivated farmland southeast of Calgary. Alberta is also set to be home to the under-development 400 MW Travers Solar project.
Westbridge’s lone U.S. solar asset is the 221 MW Accalia Point Solar project, which the company acquired from Aelius Solar in October. The project is located in Texas, near South Padre Island and the U.S. – Mexico border. Westbridge anticipates completion of the project and interconnection agreement to take place Q1 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/02/a-cleaner-grid-arrives-as-renewables-replace-fossil-fuels/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 2, 2021",A cleaner grid arrives as renewables replace fossil fuels,"Since sometime in late 2004, the United States has retired more fossil fuel capacity than it has built, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). During that period, the nation has seen cumulative solar power capacity grow from about 500 MW to 100 GW at the start of  2021.
Additionally, since 2011 through the end of 2020, the percentage of electricity from CO2 free sources has increased from 31% to greater than 41%; meanwhile, the percentage from solar and wind power alone has increased from less than 3% to greater than 11%.

The data come from EIA Form 860m, the “Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory.” To create the above chart, we added all new fossil facility capacities (blue line)–organized by new operating year in the “Operating” tab of the EIA 860m form–and then subtracted all retired fossil facilities based on when the year they closed (red line).
The yellow line is the annual net difference, which has been negative since sometime in 2012. Cumulatively, starting this year and looking backwards, if we subtract the retired fossil capacity from the new fossil capacity, we have to go all the way back to 2005/2004 before we see a net increase in fossil facility construction in the U.S.
Overall, during this roughly 18-year period, the U.S. has built 219 GW of fossil capacity, while retiring 211 GW.
More importantly, however, the power grid has been generating more clean electricity. The EIA’s Electric Power Monthly’s total electricity generation figures go back to 2011. Over the past decade, annual electricity demand remained between 4 to 4.2 million MWh.
Electricity generated by fossils dropped from 2.78 million MWh to 2.4 million, while renewables increased from 121 thousand to 470 thousand MWh — growing from 3% to over 11%.
Globally in 2020, and seemingly for the first time, the “entirety of new power generation growth in 2020 came from wind, solar, and hydropower,” according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Roughly 200 GW of that growth came from a combined wind and solar power.
And on December 1, the International Energy Agency announced that renewables are set to account for almost 95% of the increase in global power capacity through 2026, with solar PV alone providing more than half.
In 2022, the United States is projected to massively increase its solar and wind generating capacity. S&P Global Market Intelligence recently said that we will install 44 GW of new solar and 27 GW of new wind in 2022.
That would almost double last year’s record solar capacity deployment of approximately 23 GW, which itself was almost 50% higher than 2016’s prior record of approximately 14 GW.
