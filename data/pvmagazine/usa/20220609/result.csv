Joe Manchin (D-WV) sent a shockwave through the renewable energy industry, suddenly pulling back his must-have vote to push through the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act (BBBA), a $1.75 trillion spending plan that included a $550 billion climate package with significant incentives for the domestic manufacture of components throughout the entire solar value chain.
This week, the Biden Administration took executive action, including invoking the Defense Production Act and designating “super preference” for the federal procurement of solar goods, to lay the groundwork for a US-made solar supply chain. While industry leaders lauded the move, which coincided with a freeze of solar tariff imports for two years, the impact is expected to be minimal compared to what the BBBA could have provided.
Industry leaders and climate advocates have been calling for long-term industrial policy to create market certainty so the “solar coaster” can stabilize, and energy decarbonization can accelerate at levels needed to fend off the worst-case climate disaster scenario. Such policies would include the domestic manufacturing tax credits, and a long-term extension of the solar investment tax credit, which is planned to phase out from 26% this year to 10% by 2024 for commercial and utility-scale solar, and 0% for residential solar.
When Manchin announced he would not vote for BBBA in December, it was viewed as dead in the water. But now, sentiment among Democrats suggests there may be a deal on the way. Sen. Manchin has been meeting privately with majority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to discuss what it will take to earn his vote.
“Sen. Schumer and Sen. Manchin are keeping this very close to the vest, and I actually think that’s a good sign,” Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) told E&E News. “I’ve believed for a long time that the basic contours of an agreement have been kind of out there,” she added.
Democrats are aiming for the beginning of the August recess as a deadline, with fall midterm elections looming. “I haven’t heard anyone say, ‘Climate can be done another day,’” said Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).
Despite this optimism, Manchin told CNN this week there is currently no deal. “The bottom line is how do we fight inflation?” He said. “That’s all. If they’re not serious about really getting our financial house in order and fighting inflation, paying down debt, then it’s all for naught.”
“It’s all in Sen. Schumer’s hands,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) “(Schumer) informs us that there’s progress being made. There’s still a lot more to be done.”
US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said the infrastructure law passed last year was “the spine of the president’s clean energy and energy future agenda, but the tax credits (in the reconciliation bill) are the lungs of it,” Granholm told POLITICO’s Sustainability Summit. “They absolutely need to pass and I am feeling actually pretty bullish about it at this very moment.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/09/us-government-drops-solar-land-lease-rates-by-3-4-to-2-1/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 9, 2022",US Government drops solar land lease rates by 3.4% to 21%,"The Biden Administration has lowered the land lease rates that facilities must pay as part of a drive to deploy 25 GW of renewable energy on public lands. The announcement by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) suggests that rents and fees will decrease by over 50% due to lowered rents and a reduction to the standard per-megawatt fees.
According to the official documentation, the rental rate for acreage was adjusted in different ways. First, the average lease rate for land within the state was discounted from 0.7% for New Mexico to as much as 7.5% for Arizona (Equation Variable: A in below chart). This, of course, lowers the lease rate by those percentages.

The second, much larger adjustment, applies to the per acre rental charge. This change decreases the Rate of Return (Equation Variable: C) from 5.7% down to 2%. This downward revision will drop the price of the land lease rate by just over 62%.
BLM also adjusted the flat fee per megawatt deployed for all energy sources, down to $2,000. This downward adjustment ranged from $3,802/MW for wind, to $2,172/MW for solar power. The decrease in price for solar was 7.9% – leaving the cost at about two tenths of a cent per watt.
Combined, the two rate deductions for solar power provide a discount that ranges from 3% to 4% in Arizona, to just over 21% in California.
Along with their announcement on price reductions, BLM delivered a presentation to Congress highlighting the progress they have made, and showing off their project pipeline. The BLM aims to get 25 GW of renewables installed by their target date of 2025.

The presentation notes that BLM permitted twelve projects totaling 2,890 MW, from geothermal and solar power in 2021. The solar facilities make up 96.5% of the total capacity deployed across projects located in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, and California.
This represents a 35% increase in capacity over the 2,148 MW deployed in 2020.
Going forward, the BLM has enough capacity in the pipeline to meet the 2025 goals via solar power alone, because the 39 projects in the queue total 29,596 MW of capacity. 28 of these projects were driven by applicants, while 11 of the potential facilities were initiated by BLM offering up specific, pre-approved land up for development.
Among the BLM initiated lands is a 600 MW plot being developed in Utah. Wind power in the queue totals just over 2 GW, and geothermal capacity totals 188 MW. There are also six power lines in the planning stages, with a total of 1.7 GW of transmission capacity.

According to the press release, BLM has created five ‘Renewable Energy Coordination Offices’ in western states that will help push these projects through processing steps, and they are actively hiring project managers to accelerate the permitting work.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/09/solar-highway-noise-barriers-to-be-deployed-across-north-america/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 9, 2022",Solar highway noise barriers to be deployed across North America,"Mitrex, a buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) provider based in Toronto, announced it is teaming up with noise barrier industry leaders Durisol and Silentium Group to create photovoltaic highway noise barriers.
The made-in-Canada barriers are designed to improve highway aesthetics, while offering a noise reduction coefficient of up to 0.7 and emissions-free electricity production. Both transparent and opaque options are available. Three design types include a retrofit option, a vertical unitized system, and an angled design for increased production and aesthetics.
The integrated PV has a capacity of up to 22 W per square foot on a single face, and up to 37 W per square foot in bifacial applications. On average, each kilometer would become a power plant generating over 1.2 MW of electricity.
Rather than using conventional absorptive sound barriers dissipate the sound with low density porous materials such as concrete and foam,
the PV noise barrier panels are designed with a proprietary acoustic interlayer that minimizes sound transfer.
Mitrex said the product has a low carbon backpack, and a negative carbon embodiment of –1000 kg of C02 per square meter.
The three companies have partnered with the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario to establish product approval guidelines and create a pathway to retrofit the BIPV technology into existing highway noise barriers. As the guidelines are developed for the new technology, Durisol and Silentium Group have selected several existing highway barriers built for government entities to run pilot programs. The pilots will capture data and analyze the PV noise barriers performance.
“Partnerships like these allow us to decentralize energy and change the way we power our cities,” said Danial Hadizadeh, CEO, Mitrex. “We won’t stop here—we will continue to push the envelope to produce the next generation solar-integrated products. Cooperating with companies in other fields is where we can truly make a difference, and it’s essential to developing better, more efficient products and allows us to bring this technology to North America and beyond.”
Mitrex has a wide set of BIPV products including building facades, roofs, railings, windows, and more. The company said it has a mission for every surface touched by the sun to become a renewable energy producer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/09/fcc-considers-offshore-wireless-networks-for-renewable-projects/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SOFTWARE,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 9, 2022",FCC considers offshore wireless networks for renewable projects,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to begin gathering information on a Notice of Inquiry submitted by Nokia the development of offshore wireless 4G and 5G networks, which could be utilized by developers, owners, and operators renewable energy projects.
The FCC is now accepting comments regarding the the possible needs, uses, and impacts of opening up spectrum networks for offshore applications, with a specific focus on current and forecasted demand, as well as current and projected usage cases of these networks.
Nokia initially opened the inquiry as an opportunity to support the Nokia Wind Farm private wireless solution, a broadband connectivity platform Nokia has launched for connecting workers, sensors, cameras, and turbines at offshore wind installations. The company lauded the FCC’s decision in a statement:
“Nokia thanks the FCC for its actions today to advance a crucial need:  access to 4G/5G spectrum for offshore uses.  As a leader in providing broadband technologies to optimize renewable energy production at sea, Nokia sees the new FCC proceeding as an important step toward the U.S. increasing its access to sustainable energy for a greener planet.
“Specifically, the Nokia Wind Farm wireless solution provides mission-critical reliability and low-latency, broadband connectivity for connecting workers, sensors, cameras, and turbines.  Nokia already has implemented this solution for offshore wind platforms in other regions of the globe and we look forward to providing the solution in the US to achieve a more sustainable energy future.”
While wind is the first resource that comes to mind when thinking about offshore renewable energy development, these networks would be open to developers and operators of any style of project installed offshore, including solar and energy storage, though no plans for the development of either in offshore applications is known to pv magazine.
The ruling could be useful for any future development of wave energy generation. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that US waters hold enough wave energy to produce 80% of the country’s needs. While this energy cannot practically all be harnessed, NREL is exploring ways that marine wave energy can support the nation’s shift to non-emitting energy sources. 
Wave energy isn’t expected to rival solar or wind power, but NREL sees use cases for the technology, especially in remote island communities, which currently largely depend on costly, carbon-heavy diesel imports for power. NREL also sees avenues for ocean wave power in offshore fishing, marine research, or deep-sea military operations.

Wheatridge represents one of the first projects ever built in the United States to combine wind generation, a solar array, and an onsite battery energy storage system (BESS). NextEra said that more battery storage could be installed as the site as the technology matures and the system’s current battery ages. In NextEra’s second-quarter 2019 earnings call, the company revealed that battery duration is four hours, meaning the BESS clocks in at 120 MWh.
In the Supplemental Materials I and II of the project’s development documents, it is noted that the solar systems will be composed of single-axis trackers within the “micrositing corridors” of the project. In the image below, the solar inverters are the tiny red dots and the battery packs that make up the BESS are the blue dots within the orange solar border fences. Notice how they’re distributed among the solar in consistent patterns. These “micrositing” patterns were specifically chosen by NextEra’s engineers to maximize the production at the facilities.

PGE owns 100 MW of the wind project, while a subsidiary of NextEra owns the balance of the project and is selling the electricity generated to PGE under 30-year power purchase agreements.
Approximately 300 jobs were created at Wheatridge during construction, and 10 full-time employees will operate the combined facilities. A new transmission line was constructed to carry power from the project to PGE customers in Portland and the north Willamette Valley.
With the successful construction of Wheatridge, NextEra expects more facilities that locate three or more renewable resources at the same site to be considered for development and brought to life in the coming years.
A 2018 study by scientists at the University of California, Irvine; the California Institute of Technology; and the Carnegie Institution for Science, modeled a solar-heavy/wind power electricity grid, without nationwide HVDC, that could reliably deliver 80% of US electricity needs.
To achieve that feat, the United States would have to install massive amounts of storage with 12 total hours of duration. To raise the figure to a 100% wind+solar US electricity grid, the storage component would have to jump from 12 hours to 3 weeks in duration.

Local officials and residents joined ComEd and Nexamp representatives for a ribbon cutting ceremony at the recently completed project.

The 2.8 MW installation will move the state closer to meeting its ambitious clean energy goals. Illinois passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (SB 2408), last September, which sets the state on a trajectory toward 100% clean energy by 2050. The law also provides immediate steps that help accelerate the renewable energy transition that’s already underway in Illinois. The Act propelled solar forward in the state, after many projects were waitlisted. Since then over 250 MW of new community solar projects have been approved.
“Illinois is a national leader in setting ambitious renewable energy targets that will contribute to meaningful progress on decarbonization. Community solar is playing an important role as we rethink how we generate and distribute energy today,” said Matt Walsh, Director of Business Development, Midwest, Nexamp.
The French Road Solar project is located about 55 miles west of Chicago in ComEd territory. The installation has over 7,000 solar panels generating 2.8 MW of clean energy. Capable of offsetting the energy needs of approximately 400 average homes, it will also offset nearly 6 million pounds of CO2 annually.
Nexamp was founded in 2007 and has focused on community solar since before most people knew what it was. In an interview in 2019, CEO Zaid Ashai told pv magazine that “community solar is really interesting to watch because it allows that segment of ratepayers and customers to participate in solar. It also allows us to build larger power plants – they are still fairly closely located to load centers – and creative solutions.”
Nexamp has another dozen or more under community solar projects currently under development in Illinois. Nationwide, the company has operational community solar projects in seven states and is actively developing in many more states that have enabling legislation. In addition to community solar, Nexamp has existing commercial and industrial projects in other states including Calif., Georgia and Rhode Island.
