ABB plans to help Lumin accelerate its accessible home energy management solutions, which complement ABB’s residential portfolio.
“Our focus is on meeting the growing demand for integrated, easy to use, flexible products and solutions to help customers effectively manage their energy usage and lower energy costs as fast as possible,” said Mike Mustapha, president of ABB Electrification’s smart buildings division. “This latest collaboration is a testament not just to our commitment to the North American residential sector, but to strengthening customer value through partnerships globally. The data gathered through this partnership will hone future product innovation as customer needs evolve.”
Lumin currently offers homeowner and installer hardware and software solutions, including Lumin Edge, a modular system currently under development. 
Lumin Smart panel, available now, is an example of Lumin’s philosophy of “Control What Matters,” which, the company reports, means that by controlling no more than twelve circuits with one Lumin Smart Panel, it enables the product to sell at a lower price point and makes installation quicker and easier than the competition. As an addition to a circuit breaker, rather than a circuit breaker replacement, it enables it to be universally compatible with all existing circuit breakers, batteries, and inverters.
“As an established player in the industry, Lumin’s agility and expertise, coupled with a strong competitive position, align perfectly with our investment criteria,” says Mads Moeller, head of ventures at ABB Electrification. “This collaboration allows us to expand our home energy management capabilities in the North American residential sector, where we aim to bring value and affordability to home energy solutions.”
ABB has a broad range of power electronics product offerings including electric vehicle charging solutions from compact AC wallboxes, DC fast charging stations with robust connectivity, and more.
A first joint offering developed by Lumin in conjuction with ABB is expected to come to market in early 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/12/u-s-residential-solar-grows-24-through-q3-tempered-expectations-for-2024/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 12, 2023","U.S. residential solar grows 24% through Q3, tempered expectations for 2024","Residential solar posted modest growth in installations in the United States through three quarters of 2023, growing 24% year-over-year, according to Wood Mackenzie’s latest market insight report. 
As supply chain constraints of 2022 improved through the year and Californians rushed to secure solar under a more lucrative rate structure before it transitioned to NEM 3.0 in April, residential solar posted growth. 
Wood Mackenzie warns the market to temper its expectations for 2024, though, as high interest rates persist, lowering residential solar demand. The firm expects the California NEM 2.0 backlog of orders to continue into early 2024, temporarily buoying installations figures before they take a dive. California represents roughly 40% of the U.S. residential solar market and has noted a sharp 80% drop off in installation orders following the transition to NEM 3.0. 
In Q3 2023, the residential solar segment installed 1.8 GW, growing 12% year-over-year and setting a new quarterly record for the nation. However, Arizona, Florida, and Texas, all major residential solar markets, experienced quarterly and annual declines in installed capacity in the third quarter. Installers are meeting these challenges by focusing on operational efficiencies or experimenting with pricing and product offering tweaks to survive the slowdown. 
While high interest rates and policy changes like those seen in California are pushing down the 2024 outlook for residential solar, Wood Mackenzie noted there are some tailwinds at play. 
“While high interest rates persist, the segment has some tailwinds, such as module oversupply resulting in lower pricing,” said Wood Mackenzie. “Coupled with increasing retail rates, installers can still provide customers with a compelling value proposition in some states. With third-party ownership (TPO) products less sensitive to interest rate increases than loans, installers also continue to report an increase in TPO installations.” 
Wood Mackenzie forecasts 13% growth in the residential solar market in 2023. However, looking ahead to 2024, the firm expects a 12% national contraction.  
“The residential solar market will recover in 2025 and grow at an average annual rate of 10% between 2025-2028 as growth picks up in emerging markets,” said Wood Mackenzie. 
Battery competition 
As the residential solar-plus-storage market grows, competition is increasing among battery vendors. Wood Mackenzie said that in Q3 2023, 11% of residential solar and 5% of non-residential solar systems were paired with storage. 
According to Wood Mackenzie, Tesla, LG and Enphase remain the big three battery vendors, holding 80% of the cumulative market from 2018 through Q3 2023. However, new entrants are beginning to leave their mark on market share. In 2018, the big three providers were installed on 96% of solar-plus-storage systems, but in 2023 they represented 65%. 

Energy equipment companies like SunPower, Generac, and SolarEdge have carved out spots among the top seven providers. FranklinWH ranks eighth in storage only two years after launching its first product for the sector. 
“The top five players in the residential solar-plus-storage ranking hold 59% of the market, while the top five players in the residential solar market hold just 24%,” said Max Issokson, research analyst, Wood Mackenzie.

The company said the new product offers up to 45% more capacity and a 40% decrease in commissioning time compared to the previous 2.0 iteration.
The 20-foot containerized battery system offers power up to 2.35 MW and a capacity of 5 MWh. It features higher density energy cells, advanced safety systems, liquid cooling, and active balance controls.
SolBank 3.0 is comprised of lithium-ferro-phosphate cells and sports a 93% round-trip efficiency. It is offered in 2-hour and 4-hour duration configurations. The battery pack is IP-67 rated for safety.
The battery comes equipped with a pack and electrical redundancy protection system, abnormal performance detection, multi-level fire alarms, suppression protection, and more as part of its safety and controls system. An optimized thermal management system reduces auxiliary power consumption by up to 30% compared to the previous generation, said Canadian Solar.
“SolBank 3.0 features exceptional new elements like higher energy density cells and advanced safety design,” said Colin Parkin, president of e-Storage. “In addition, our e-STORAGE team also provides value-added services, such as system capacity maintenance and augmentations, operation and maintenance, and plant optimization.”
Earnings
Last month, Canadian Solar reported its Q3, 2023 earnings, noting a surprised miss on revenues and earnings per share.
The major global provider of solar cells and modules and developer of utility-scale solar and energy storage projects recorded an earnings per share of $0.32, falling short of Wall Street expectations by 54%. It also delivered $1.85 billion in revenue, short of the consensus estimate of $2.03 billion.
Solar module shipments totaled 8.3 GW, falling just short of expectations. However, the company’s module shipments have increased 39% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margins were 16.7%, falling short of the range of expectation between 17.5% to 19.5%. Falling module prices are likely driving the shrinking gross margins.
Canadian Solar expects module demand to rise sharply in 2024, with shipments rising roughly 50% year-over-year. Roth Capital Partners warned that this may be a bit optimistic as the company looks to clear excess inventory channels in Europe. Roth expects module demand to raise only 10% to 15% in 2024, driven mostly by utility-scale demand, while residential solar demand may further peel back in 2024.

While thermal energy storage (TES) has struggled to take off to date, U.S.-based Fourth Power is taking a new technological approach to some of the cost and scale challenges. Its high-density TES system is based on its Guinness World Record achievement for high temperature in its patented liquid metal heat transfer system, which allows for operation at almost half the sun’s temperature.
“Until this innovation, I don’t think there has been an innovation in thermal fluid infrastructure in almost 100 years,” Fourth Power CTO Asegun Henry told pv magazine. “Utilizing PVC, steel, or nickel-alloy pipes has been around for a very long time, and that’s what everyone is doing.”
He said Fourth Power’s approach is based on knowledge of the struggles that other TES companies have faced in trying to scale the technology.
“The key is our liquid metal handling infrastructure, which allows us to transfer heat at fluxes more than an order of magnitude higher than traditional thermofluid systems,” Henry said. “This leads to higher power density and lower cost.”
Fourth Power’s system converts renewable energy to heat, or thermal energy in a fully enclosed system roughly the size of half of a football field. The thermal battery heats liquid tin and moves it through a closed-loop piping system to heat stacks of carbon blocks until they glow white hot.
The system then exposes TPV cells to the light and converts it into electricity. This is similar to traditional solar generation but uses light from very hot — up to 2,400 C — graphite rather than light from the sun to produce electricity. The battery is sealed in a warehouse of argon gas to maximize system lifetime and ensure safety.
“We’re primarily focused on electricity and industrial heat,” Henry said. “To be more specific, we aspire for our technology to replace peaker plants in combination with renewable electricity generation.”
For power generation alone, Fourth Power’s roundtrip efficiency target is 50%.
“Our TPV cells have already set a world record at 41% – and we have designs to reach 50%,” Henry said. “For co-generation, the efficiency is near 100%.”
Finally, by using readily available and less expensive materials, the overall system cost is lower, enabling energy storage that is 10 times cheaper than lithium-ion batteries ($25/kWh-e vs. $330/kWh-e), according to the company.
On Tuesday, Fourth Power announced that it had received $19 million in Series A funding to scale its TES technology. The investment round was led by the venture capital firm DCVC, with participation from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Black Venture Capital Consortium.
“After more than 10 years of research and development, we are grateful to reach this crucial milestone in our journey thanks to our funding partners who recognized the innovation and potential of Fourth Power’s thermal battery technology,” said Henry, who developed Fourth Power’s thermal battery technology when he was a professor at Georgia Tech.
The funds will also support the construction of a 1 MWh-e prototype facility outside of Boston, with a targeted completion date in 2026. In addition, it will facilitate rigorous durability tests and expand the company’s engineering team.
“Following the 1 MWH-e prototype facility’s successful completion, we plan to partner with utilities to conduct pilot projects designed for commercialization throughout 2026 and 2027,” Henry said. “We anticipate achieving our goal of installing full-scale, 100 MWh-e systems by 2028.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/12/what-happens-when-the-sun-doesnt-shine/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 12, 2023",What happens when the sun doesn’t shine?,"The phenomenon that occurs when the sun doesn’t shine and wind doesn’t blow is known as a compound energy drought, and researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) studied these droughts and found that in some parts of the country, they can last nearly a week.
“When we have a completely decarbonized grid and depend heavily on solar and wind, energy droughts could have huge amounts of impact on the grid,” said Cameron Bracken, an Earth scientist at PNNL and lead author on the paper.
It’s important for grid operators to know where, when and for how long energy droughts occur so that they can call on other energy sources as well as manage grid-level battery systems to store enough electricity needed during times when energy is needed most.
The team published the findings October 31 in the journal Renewable Energy and will be presenting at this week’s annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. The researchers report that the paper is the first to provide a uniform standard of what a compound energy drought is and how long it can last in different parts of the country.
The researchers researched 40 years of weather data and then used historical energy demand data for the entire country in order to understand how often an energy drought occurs when that energy is needed the most. The weather data included wind speeds at the height of wind turbines as well as the intensity of solar energy on solar panels. The team focused on areas where there’s currently a lot of solar and wind generation and looked at the times when the weather data showed stagnant air and cloudy skies that resulted in lower energy generation.
“We essentially took a snapshot of the infrastructure as of 2020 and ran it through the 40 years of weather data, starting in 1980,” said Bracken. “We are basically saying ‘here is how the current infrastructure would have performed under historical weather conditions.’”
The researchers found that energy droughts happen at any time of year in various regions, and for varying frequency and duration. In some areas, Texas, for example, energy droughts are frequent but last only hours. While in other areas, such as in California, they may be of a longer duration but are less frequent. Researchers noted that the longest energy drought happened in California and lasted for six days. Understanding the duration and frequency will help predict the drought’s impact on the grid.
To understand how these droughts might affect energy demand, the researchers mapped their historical, hypothetical generation data onto 40 years of historical energy demand data across the continent. The data showed that “wind and solar droughts happen during peak demand events more than you would expect due to chance,” said Bracken.
What are grid operators to do during an energy drought? According to Bracken, energy droughts do not have to cause an energy shortage, as grid operators can enlist other energy sources such as hydropower, fossil fuels or energy transmitted from other regions. Understanding the frequency and duration of energy droughts will also help inform the deployment of long-duration energy storage projects, said Nathalie Voisin, an Earth scientist at PNNL and coauthor on the paper.
“We’re providing insight on how to adequately design and manage multi-day storage. So when you know an energy drought is going to last for five hours or five days, you can incentivize storage to be managed accordingly,” said Voisin.
The next step in the research is to learn how climate change will affect the frequency and duration of energy droughts. The researchers intend to model energy droughts through the end of the century combined with evolving infrastructure.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/12/solar-electricitys-modest-growth-post-2022-slowdown/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 12, 2023",Solar electricity’s modest growth post-2022 slowdown,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) has released its Electric Power Monthly report for the first three quarters of 2023. The data shows that solar growth is still recovering from lower installation volumes in 2022.
Data from PV Intel reveals that, up to September 2023, solar power constituted 5.7% of the electricity generated in the U.S. for the year, an increase from the 4.9% recorded at the same time last year. This represents 16% growth in solar power generation compared to the previous year.
In 2022, solar generation accounted for 4.7% of total U.S. electricity. Assuming a continued growth rate of 15% to 16%, the total for 2023 is projected to reach 5.4% to 5.46%.
Monthly data showed that solar electricity generation was 6.1% in July, 5.9% in August, and returned to 6.1% in September. The peak month for 2023 was May, with 7.3% of all electricity generated from solar.

A notable trend is the expected increase in growth percentages throughout the year. In 2023, the U.S. is on track to set a new deployment record, with recent projections suggesting 33 GW will be deployed. This new capacity will impact generation numbers later in the year as these facilities come online, and will significantly contribute to 2024’s generation capacity.
If the U.S. achieves the 33 GW deployment milestone, this would represent a 23% increase in total installed solar capacity from 2022. For context, the total installed solar capacity in 2022 was 141 GW, reflecting a 16.5% increase in the base installation capacity due to the addition of 20 GW.
Assuming electricity generation remains constant, a 23% increase in solar capacity could boost U.S. solar output to around 6.8% of all electricity in 2024. This would mark the first time solar energy achieves a full percentage point increase in national electricity generation within a single year.

In California, solar generation as a share of total electricity grew by 20%. Specifically, solar energy contributed to 25% of the state’s electricity in September of the previous year, and this figure rose to 30% in September 2023. This increase can be partially attributed to the milder temperatures in September 2023, which led to a reduced demand for electricity from other sources, contrasting with the higher demands during the record heatwaves of the previous year.
The EIA’s 860-M form, “Monthly Electric Generator Inventory,” reports that 97 utility-scale solar power facilities came online in the third quarter. Overall, 6.5 GW of capacity was deployed in the third quarter, setting a new record. In September alone, according to the EIA, 969 MWac of utility-scale facilities were installed.
