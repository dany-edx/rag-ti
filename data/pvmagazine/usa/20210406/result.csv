Michelle Lujan Grisham’s (D) signing Senate Bill 84 into law.
SB 84 calls on state regulators to evaluate existing community solar programs and develop rules for a state program to be adopted by April 2022. The bill sets its own guidelines for regulators as they form the program:
Kevin Cray, Mountain West regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access welcomed the law and said his organization looks forward to working with regulators to develop program rules to ensure the program is in place by early next year.
The law’s twin provisions for minimum subscriber counts and an anchor tenant are intended to offer greater certainty of a financial return to project developers.
The law also calls on regulators to develop a list of low-income service organizations and programs that may pre-qualify low-income customers. Similar features have been identified by Vote Solar’s Access & Equity Advisory Committee as a way to ensure successful and equitable solar expansion programs.

The panels were manufactured by Silfab Solar and use optical film to boost the PV modules’ energy generation. The approach redirects and concentrates otherwise discarded light onto the PV cells.
Morgan Solar said it is working with partners on variants that can be incorporated into buildings and mitigate the impact of single axis trackers’ shading on bifacial modules. The company said the films can be formatted for use in any panel manufacturer’s production processes. Morgan Solar develops light management solutions and sensors for the utility solar and building markets, was established in 2007, and is based in Toronto, Canada.
The Alberta project was co-developed by Enbridge and Morgan Solar, with $C$10 million ($7.96 million) in support from Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) and Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC). ERA was created in 2009 to help Alberta deliver on the province’s environmental and economic goals. ERA has committed C$646 million ($514 million) toward 204 projects worth C$4.5 billion ($3.58 billion).
Silfab Solar designs and develops ultra-high-efficiency PV modules. It has operations in Bellingham, Washington and Toronto.
Enbridge Inc. is an energy infrastructure company with interests in 33 facilities totaling nearly 1.8 GW of net renewable power generation capacity. Alberta Solar One will supply a portion of its Canadian Mainline crude oil and liquids network’s power requirements.

The project includes four 2.5 MW solar farms, three of which are fully operational. Subscribers save an average of 5-20% on annual electricity costs.
The project enables commercial and qualified low-income residential customers to buy energy from local solar farms. Daimler Trucks North America LLC, WorldMark Portland, and Clackamas County are among the initial commercial subscribers. The projects are all within Portland General Electric’s service territory.
The projects are using the Mana Monitoring Platform to track, report, and manage each farm’s energy production.
Neighborhood Power is a self-described renewable energy “micro utility” that sells solar power by the kilowatt-hour to residential, commercial, municipal, non-profit, and utility markets.

The projects are to be built over cranberry bogs, the first such installation known to pv magazine.
The 9 MW of solar capacity and corresponding storage will be divvied across two projects in Carver, about an hour southeast of Boston. Solar Carver 1 will be built on a 70-acre site that will generate 5 MW of solar energy, accompanied by 30 MWh of battery storage. Solar Carver 3 will have a capacity of 2 MW and house a 12 MWh battery storage system across a 35-acre site.
To keep the locations dual-use, Pine Gate’s EPC team will engineer the projects to rest on more than 3,300 40-foot-long wooden utility poles, which are expected to be more durable for the wet terrain. The poles will be driven 15-30 feet into the ground to keep the trackers at least 10 feet above the cranberry bogs and allow for annual harvesting.
The two installations also were selected for observation as part of a University of Massachusetts-Amherst study on the dual-use solar projects’ inter-row solar panel spacing atop the cranberry bogs.
Carver Solar 1 and 3 also mark Pine Gate Renewables’ first projects in Massachusetts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/06/making-the-numbers-work-for-a-residential-energy-storage-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 6, 2021",Making the numbers work for a residential energy storage system,"Let’s be blunt: In most states, adding batteries to a residential solar system will significantly slow down the payback period.
According to five-year-old Census data, around 18.3% of homes claim to have home generators. Those generators require maintenance and fuel, and they only pay off if you are served by a rural power grid or live in a disaster-prone area.
That must mean there is more value in residential battery backup systems than a simple return on investment calculation can show. And, after recent grid events in Texas and California, the value of a battery backup is impossible to ignore.
Michelle Davis from WoodMac Renewables & Power said that 7% of residential solar capacity was paired with storage in 2020. She said that growth rate is on track to more than double in 2021, to 16%.
Anecdotal evidence in “hot markets” suggests this value could be closer to 60% if batteries were available. Hawaii practically requires energy storage, because residents there may not export excess solar power to the grid.
Most residential solar+energy storage is not financially viable for two main reasons.

However, most residential solar+energy storage is not financially viable for two main reasons.
First, most solar installations occur in states where net metering is allowed. And since net metering enters a credit for excess daytime generation to a homeowner’s electricity account, there really isn’t a financial motivation to install batteries and store that electricity.
Second, there really isn’t any other path for a single home’s energy storage to make money. For instance, it was only two years ago that Sunrun won the rights for 5,000 residential solar+storage systems to participate in the New England ISO wholesale marketplace. Thus, for most people in most states, energy storage is an emotional purchase, based on a consumer’s confidence (or lack thereof) in their power grid’s resilience.
In key markets – without a doubt – energy storage is worth some money.
For example, in Massachusetts, two programs support residential energy storage economics. The first is the SMART program. We’ve covered how solar is paid handsomely in the Bay State; this same program also pays homeowners to couple batteries with solar.

The above image is from the state’s Energy Storage Calculator. Roughly, this depicts the outcome of an equation that calculates your energy storage incentive. The underlying data are in the table below.
The equation is based on the ratio of energy storage system size to solar system size. The state first looks at the ratio of your system’s solar panels to its battery inverter sizing, and then looks at the number of hours that the battery can output energy at that rate.
For example, a standard Tesla Powerwall that is 5 kW/13.5 kWh when installed with a 10 kWdc solar system would add around 3.8¢/kWh to the standard incentive price. This number is rough as there are other equipment nuances, but close enough. So, if a 10 kWdc residential solar system generates 12,000 kWh in a year, the customer stands to earn an additional $456/year.
But, when we consider the install price of roughly $12,500 for most Tesla Powerwall systems and subtract the 30% tax credit, that leaves a 19+ year payback. This does not “pencil.”

The second Massachusetts program is known as Connected Solutions. Here, solar homeowners are paid to allow the utility to use their battery to manage power grid peak demand moments. Vermont’s Green Mountain Power first figured this out, and they have saved state electricity payers millions of dollars over the years, all while offering home resilience.
The program offers homeowners a potential return of $1,375 per year. Combine that with the above SMART incentive cash and the payback period is shortened to 4.7 years. Now we’re cooking with electricity!
Beyond the SMART program, the markets where batteries make financial sense become scarce quickly.
As mentioned, Hawaii’s rate structure – no net metering and no export of electricity to the power grid – forces energy storage onto homeowners. Coupled with a high price of electricity, residential storage makes sense there.
California’s SGIP energy storage incentive program strongly supported residential energy storage, at least for a while. However, because of heightened concerns over wildfires, it is in extremely high demand and quickly running out of cash. Shifting residential solar installations into a “time of use model” marginally helps the financials, but not enough.
Enter Sunnova’s SunSafe offering and various other residential solar lease companies. While this author prefers a home energy generation ownership society, it’s hard to argue with Sunnova’s approach: No money down (typically), 25 years of operations and maintenance, and low interest rates.
Let’s be blunt one more time: For Texans who were without heat and power during the multi-day mid-February blackout that killed 200 people, our financial viability calculations for energy storage go straight into the trash.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/06/solar-fixed-charges-violate-federal-purpa-law-says-a-petition-to-ferc/,"POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 6, 2021","Solar fixed charges violate federal PURPA law, says a petition to FERC","Four owners of small PV systems and the Alabama nonprofit GASP asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to invalidate solar fixed charges they say are discriminatory and illegal under the federal PURPA law.
The petition asks FERC to compel the Alabama Public Service Commission to order Alabama Power to set non-discriminatory rates for electricity sales to owners of rooftop solar and other “qualifying facilities,” a term defined by PURPA. The petitioners’ four PV systems range in size from 2 to 6 kW and are qualifying facilities that are exempt from certification filing requirements, says the petition.
Since 2013 Alabama Power has charged a monthly fee, currently $5.41/kW of solar capacity, for service to customers who have solar power. State regulators have approved the fee.
The petitioners maintain that Alabama Power’s solar fixed charges violate the PURPA regulations, because those regulations prohibit rates for sales of electricity that discriminate against qualifying facilities.
The petition maintains that the solar fixed charges are not based on a cost-of-service study, or on consistent systemwide costing principles, saying both are required under PURPA. The petition adds that the charges are based on lost revenues resulting from reduced customer usage, which is not unique to solar adoption, and thus are discriminatory.
PURPA is the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. FERC developed the underlying PURPA regulations and has enforcement authority.
The Southern Environmental Law Center and the law firm Ragsdale LLC represent the petitioners. The petition is available at FERC docket EL21-64-000 or here.
