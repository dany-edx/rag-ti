In addition, nearly 200 other jurisdictions are interested in the tool, which is a free, DOE-developed web-based platform that allows local governments to instantly approve residential solar installation permits.
In the summer, Secretary Granholm issued a challenge, encouraging jurisdictions to sign onto SolarAPP+. The level of interest in SolarAPP+ and the number of permits processed suggests that the tool will have wide-spread adoption in communities across the United States. New goals are on the horizon for SolarAPP+.  By March 31, 2022, the program aims to be engaged with 300 jurisdictions. By 2023, the goal is to reach 600 jurisdictions.

States showing significant interest: California, Colorado, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Texas, Connecticut, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. States showing some interest: Idaho, Massachusetts, Virginia, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio, Hawaii, Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon, and Washington. Emerging states: Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming.  
Cities and counties across the country have shown their interest in adopting SolarAPP+cost of solar through direct and indirect costs of permitting. What used to take months for approval can now take less than a day. The jurisdictions are saving time on each application and customers have saved an estimated 12 business days from the time of project submission to the jurisdiction’s final inspection. 
In addition, SolarAPP+ will  support more types of home energy systems. Nine communities are piloting SolarAPP+ permitting for energy storage systems, with more than 215 permits processed so far. The SolarAPP+ team is also in the early stages of piloting permitting for building-integrated photovoltaic systems. 
Costs for solar permitting and the interconnection processes are higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries with strong solar markets, and SolarAPP+ is attempting to change that. In fact, SEIA estimates that approximately $1 per Watt is added to the
“We were the first to adopt SolarAPP+ and issue a permit through SolarAPP+,” said Sue Noack, mayor of Pleasant Hill, California. “With all the solar installations we’ve done, there have been no issues.” 
SolarAPP+ is playing a role in helping the U.S. meet its goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035. Secretary Granholm is encouraging mayors and local government officials to take action and reach out to the SolarAPP+ team.

The project is set to be nearly 7.5 MW in capacity, and Saddleback will serve as the project’s anchor tenant. It has not been made public yet how much of the capacity will be open for other subscribers. The project is a part of the sweeping renovations that Arctaris Impact Investors are undertaking at Saddleback, which has been closed since 2015.
Construction on the solar farm is expected to begin in early 2022 and is on track to be generating clean energy for the CMP grid by the start of the 2022-23 ski season. According to Saddleback’s General Counsel, Tom Federle, who led project development, the installation will comprises less than one percent of Saddleback’s real estate, with the development team placing emphasis on having the project harmonize with the mountain’s natural appeal.
The project has achieved an interconnection agreement with Central Maine Power.
In August, Nexamp secured a $240 million equity investment led by Generate Capital, on top of the $440 million in debt financing the company raised in March, bringing its total new funding to $680 million.
The company said it will use the most recent equity investment to expand to more markets. It will also continue to build its workforce to develop additional retail offerings. Nexamp said it has more than 300 employees, tripling its workforce in less than three years. To date, the company has put more than 300 MW of renewable generation into service.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/07/building-solar-as-long-term-resilient-infrastructure-could-save-billions/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,O&M,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",Building solar as long-term resilient infrastructure could save billions,"To effectively decarbonize the energy sector, solar PV needs to be reliable, resilient and built to last. Building the grid this way could also save the United States billions, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
As a global energy source, solar will need to operate in a wide range of climates. In an age of a shifting climate and extreme weather events, this range of conditions is widening, leading the reliability engineering team at NREL to call for tighter quality standards and more rigorous testing.
This concept of renewables as infrastructure was discussed by the panel of industry leaders and experts at the pv magazine annual USA Roundtables event: “Solar resiliency in an age of extremes.” A call for standardization, transparency, and quality was shared, but are we progressing in that direction?
The NREL team shared some trends. Solar energy is rising fast, with generation climbing 30% per year. Innovation is happening so quickly, that quality testing struggles to keep up, and defects might slip through the cracks. Every year, more products are released as innovation ramps up. Product warranties have also increased over time, but pressures on the industry may cause a downgrade in quality without intervention of standards.
Modern PV systems are highly optimized, leaving little room in the margins. As manufacturers seek higher energy yields and lower costs, long-term quality may be sacrificed. Supply chain disruptions may also lead to counterfeit or substandard parts, something that has reportedly already been a problem among solar connectors. Poor installation, operations, and maintenance can cost millions, as well.

for solar system fire negligence from a 2019 whistleblower complaint. Resilience and reliability planning have financial risk and safety benefits.
Solar can also be helpful in the short-term. In the wake of Hurricane Ida, which caused massive damages to New Orleans this summer, solar and energy storage packs were distributed as emergency response, and solar microgrids remained in operation while the grid was down for several weeks.
The NREL team offered five ways for planning solar PV as infrastructure:
Improvements in laboratory testing and computer modeling will offer a better vision of how the new generation of modules will perform in the field. Degradation, microcracking, and other impacts to long-term use need further study. 
Improvements in failure mechanism identification will be needed, and the NREL team said larger and more complex testing facilities are needed as technologies change and create new sets of problems. 
Quality standards cover individual components, but there is a lack of standardization for solar energy systems, said NREL. Holistic standards should be based on whole-system durability testing, not just of individual components. 
Harsher tests and a wider range of parameters will need to be set for systems and components in standardization. 
Identifying problems early will aid the PV industry in mitigating issues and predicting future issues. Sensors, monitoring, infrared sensing, electroluminescence (EL) imaging, drone inspection and more is commonplace in wind and fossil fuel generation, and can become an increased part of the solar PV ecosystem. 
These activities increase costs, but over decades, lowered downtimes and less maintenance needs would save in the long run, said NREL. 
Supply chain and content information is often not shared in the competitive industry. Bottlenecks and supply chain pressures can lead to swapping out for lower quality components. Carbon efficiencies for module and component production varies greatly by geography, and human rights issues exist in some manufacturing regions. 
Greater clarity in sourcing and tracking could improve all of these issues, said NREL. Product labeling could be facilitated by organizations like the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE). 
Proper installation and safety practices are another important component. Workforce training that is relevant to the specific needs of a given climate is helpful. 
At a global level, training programs are needed, ones like the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) solar certification process.
Power outages alone cost the U.S. $150 billion in 2018. These quality assurance techniques could save the country many more billions in the long run.

The donations came form 16 corporate sponsors and 60 individual donors, including REC Group, Alpine Bank, BayWa r.e., and Premier Members Credit Union.
Keep the Lights on Colorado was started in 2020 to honor Namaste Solar’s company vision of engaging in and creating holistic wealth for the community. The annual month-long campaign raises money for Energy Outreach Colorado, a Denver-based not-for-profit, that helps families throughout Colorado afford their energy costs. Energy Outreach Colorado gives families access to community solar subscriptions that provide long-term stability in the form of monthly bill credits, which will reduce their annual home energy costs by an average of 37%.
While Namaste Solar raises money for Energy Outreach Colorado, the subscriptions donated are not affiliated with projects built by or in benefit of Namasté Solar.
According to Energy Outreach Colorado, one-in-four Colorado households struggle with a high energy burden, which leads to such households spending a disproportionate amount of their income on energy bills, when compared to higher-income households, with the average burden being three times worse. Households that meet or are below the 80% area median income threshold can see energy bills take up to 20% of their monthly income.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/07/microgrid-energy-storage-and-control-platform-receives-ul-fire-safety-certification/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",Microgrid energy storage and control platform receives UL fire safety certification  ,"Emera Technologies announced that after rigorous testing, its BlockBox received UL 9540 fire safety certification. BlockBox is the distributed microgrid energy storage and control system of Emera’s BlockEnergy microgrid platform. The platform is a utility-owned community microgrid for residential and commercial-scale applications.
The BlockEnergy microgrid integrates renewable energy, storage, and smart distributed controls to facilitate scalable systems in new residential communities. The BlockBox energy storage and control system, equipped with EnerDel’s lithium-ion batteries, acts as a smart hub for the energy load it serves on the microgrid.
BlockBoxes are connected on a common bus at various end-load sources, incorporating the battery management system, controls, and communications for the load, thereby serving as the integration point of various energy sources into the battery.
“Less than two years ago we completed our proof of concept for the BlockEnergy microgrid and distributed BlockBox nanogrids at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Achieving the UL 9540 certification represents a crucial safety milestone in our engineering and development work,” says Rob Bennett, president and CEO of Emera Technologies. “We look forward to completing our first commercial and residential BlockEnergy microgrid installations in Tampa, Florida, and Fairmount Heights, Maryland, in early 2022.”
The fire safety certification is a significant milestone that allows BlockEnergy to be offered to utilities. BlockEnergy’s utility-centric model allows utilities to own and operate distributed energy resources that can be integrated with utility grid infrastructure. The system provides easy interoperability in both grid-connected mode and island mode, when outages are affecting the broader grid.
The testing and evaluation were conducted by independent, third-party lab TÜV Rheinland.
