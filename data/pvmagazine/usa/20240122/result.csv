Less than two years from its passage, the $369 billion in climate and energy spending contained within IRA has already attracted unprecedented levels of investment and job creation. 
“Every month we are seeing the spark ignited by the Inflation Reduction Act and other federal policies continue to heat up the economies of local communities nationwide. These policies are working – and now so is America,” said Bob Keefe, executive director, E2. “Clean energy is driving the biggest economic revolution we’ve seen in generations. That’s good news for workers and local economies in red states, blue states and in every region of America.” 
Included within IRA are incentives supporting both the supply and demand side for clean energy technologies. This includes a 30% investment tax credit (ITC), clean energy generation production tax credits (PTC), and manufacturing production tax credits. These credits can be transferred sold to businesses or individuals with a tax appetite, further spurring clean energy economic activity. 
IRA also provides tax credit bonus adders for projects that use U.S.-made components or are located in low-income communities or communities that disproportionately depend on fossil fuel production in their local economy. The Environmental Protection Agency is also administering the $7 billion Solar For All program, which extends solar access to low-income communities. 
E2 reported that in 2023, projects announced in 2023 combine for $64 billion in private investment and the creation of over 61,000 jobs. North Carolina received the most announced capital investments with $11.2 billion announced, followed by Georgia ($6.9 billion), Indiana ($5.8 billion), South Carolina ($5.7 billion), Michigan ($5.7 billion), and Nevada ($5.5 billion). 
More than 80% of all projects and 95% of capital investments announced in 2023 were in the manufacturing industry, said E2. 
In December, the most notable new manufacturing investment came from Waaree Energies, which announced a $1 billion solar cell and module manufacturing plant in Texas. The 3 GW plant is expected to bring over 1,500 jobs. 
E2’s dashboard tracking investment in energy storage, clean vehicles, grid and electrification, solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies can be found here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/22/vertical-solar-mount-first-of-kind-to-achieve-ul-certification/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Vertical solar mount first of kind to achieve UL certification,"Sunstall Inc. announced that Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certified its vertical PV mounting system, called Sunzaun.
Sunzaun achieved rigorous UL2703 standards, making it the first vertical solar mounting system to achieve such certification for safety and reliability in the United States.
The vertical configuration of the Sunzaun system saves space, allowing for energy production in limited spaces. Sunstall said the system is well-suited for agricultural lands, urban environments and areas with restricted land availability.
The vertical orientation of the panels leads to a grid-serving production curve, avoiding the midday production peak of traditional utility-scale arrays. It has other dual-use benefits, like providing shade to crops and saving irrigation water.
“We are thrilled to announce that our Vertical Solar System has successfully passed UL testing, making it the first of its kind nationwide to comply with the UL2703 standard,” said Helge Birenath, chief executive officer and president, Sunstall, Inc.
The German-designed Sunzaun vertical arrays were installed in 2022 at a Somerset, California winery, demonstrating the dual-use ability vertical PV. The solar array, installed within rows of grapevines, is composed of 43 modules with 450 W each, connected to a microinverter and two batteries.
(Read: “Vertical PV for clean energy and crop production”)
The design uses holes in the module frames to make a simple attachment to two piles, negating the need for a heavy racking system. The bifacial solar modules produce energy on both sides of the vertically oriented array.
In traditional systems designed with a landscape orientation, the rails used to mount panels onto the racking system are often cut to fit the expected panel size. If the size of the panel changes after all other component procurement has been completed, the project may face delays while the rails are reengineered to fit the updated panel size. Sunzaun’s design allows for easy adaptation to a change in panel size by adjusting the distance between each pile. It is also possible to adjust the height of the panels from the ground if needed.
Soiling and operating temperature
A study from Arizona State University observed varying levels of solar energy production losses related to soiling, or dirt and debris on the face of the panels, based on panel tilt. The study found significant differences in soiling related losses related to panel tilt, though the study only tested angles up to 40 degrees, suggesting more studies are needed for vertical PV soiling impacts. 
A group of researchers at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has conducted a series of tests and simulations to understand why vertical PV systems tend to provide unexpected yield gains compared to horizontal arrays and have found that vertical installations have much lower operating temperatures.
“Although better than expected performance for vertical installation of bifacial PV has been reported at conferences and workshops, we haven’t seen any publications that show that this is accompanied with a much lower operating temperature than you would expect for free-standing fixed tilt PV with the same total irradiance,” the research’s corresponding author, Bas B. Van Aken, told pv magazine. “These lower operating temperatures have a positive effect on the operating voltage. And thereby on the total energy generation, particularly under high irradiance conditions.”
In the study “Thermal model in digital twin of vertical PV system helps to explain unexpected yield gains,” published in EPJ Photovoltaics, Van Aken and his colleagues explained that the voltage is influenced both by the amount of light and by the temperature of the solar cells. With increasing irradiance conditions, the voltage increases logarithmically, while with increasing temperature, the voltage decreases, typically by 0.3-0.4% per C.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/22/electriq-power-to-launch-10-new-solar-plus-storage-networks-in-socal/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Electriq Power to launch 10 new solar-plus-storage networks in SoCal,"Energy storage and management solutions provider Electriq Power Holdings is gearing up to launch 10 new “sustainable community networks” – programs that incentivize the deployment of solar-plus-battery storage systems – in Los Angeles County.
The program, called the PoweredUp Network, essentially offers qualifying homeowners solar-plus-battery storage systems at zero upfront costs, and without income, credit or property lien requirements. The systems can also help residents reduce electricity costs by up to 20%, access back-up power, and avoid peak pricing periods on the grid, according to the company. 
“Our program is great for low-to-moderate income households because it gives them the ability to install solar + storage because we’ve removed those financial barriers,” said Frank Magnotti, CEO of Electriq Power. 
Electriq Power is aiming to launch the networks by the end of the first quarter, and estimates that around 400,000 residents in Southern California will be eligible for it. 
In November, the company expanded in New England, launching a similar network in the city of Derby, Connecticut to around 3,000 eligible homeowners. The company’s programs could be an especially good fit in areas that have high electricity costs – like Connecticut, where the retail price of electricity is around 10 cents/kWh higher than the national average, as well as other parts of New England, which the company is continuing to consider for additional sustainable community networks. 
California’s three large investor-owned utilities – Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric – have meanwhile seen residential electric rates increase by between 34% to 82% since 2014, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state has also been facing challenges with grid reliability, driven by increasing electricity demand – due in part to severe weather patterns – and the need to meet that demand during the evening hours, when solar power is declining on the grid. 
Electriq Power’s solar-plus-storage systems also have the ability to export back to the grid, according to Magnotti, and the battery component of the system is equipped with operational software using which owners can participate in virtual power plant (VPP) programs – essentially, sending power back to the grid when demand is high, helping to prevent blackouts. 
VPPs are aggregations of distributed energy resources, like rooftop solar, energy storage and demand response efforts, that can be designed to offer additional capacity when electricity demand on the grid is high, providing a potential alternative to natural gas peaker plants. One study, by the Brattle Group, estimates that utilities could see savings of $35 billion by 2033 by using VPPs for peaker capacity. 
Electriq Power reported preliminary fourth quarter revenue results earlier this month, expecting to record around $1.3 million in sales for the quarter, which Magnotti said represented year-over-year growth of over 100%. The company estimates that the Southern California contract could generate incremental “total contract value” – essentially, anticipated revenue over the next three years – of $30 million. The company has also more than 160 signed power purchase agreements via its sustainability community networks, which it says could generate around $5 million in revenue over the first and second quarters of the year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/22/concerns-over-77-billion-in-doe-funds-for-mostly-blue-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Concerns over $77 billion in DOE funds for mostly “blue” hydrogen,"Numerous concerns about federally funded hydrogen hubs add up to “a lot of bad news,” said Abbe Ramanan, a project director with Clean Energy Group, on a webinar with energy research group IEEFA and the Pipeline Safety Trust.
The hydrogen hubs are intended to pair large-scale clean hydrogen production with industrial and other end-uses for hydrogen. Yet most of the hydrogen hubs to be funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will produce “blue” hydrogen, Ramanan said.
Blue hydrogen involves fossil fuel combustion and is “not clean or low-carbon,” said Anika Juhn, an analyst with research group IEEFA. A report from the group says blue hydrogen “will be very dirty.”
“Green” hydrogen, made from electrolysis of water powered by renewables, has been seen as an option for multi-day or seasonal storage of renewable energy—for example, where salt caverns can be created to store hydrogen on-site. Research group Energy Innovation last year projected that green hydrogen production could be profitable in “wide swaths” of the U.S., mostly in the central U.S.
The seven hydrogen hubs selected for federal support are now engaged in an award negotiation process. Yet even though DOE committed, Ramanan said, to “heavily weigh community benefit plans and community engagement” in the negotiation process, Clean Energy Group has heard from “a lot” of community groups that have been unable to learn how to engage with the hubs, what hydrogen projects will be involved in each hub, or how those projects will impact and possibly benefit their communities.
No matter how hydrogen is produced, transporting it in pipelines presents risk, said Amanda McKay, policy manager with the Pipeline Safety Trust. Small hydrogen molecules interact with steel and certain polyethylene pipes, she said, leading to embrittlement and cracking. She said that a hydrogen pipeline is “more likely to explode” than methane pipelines. McKay began her presentation with a tragic story of a gasoline pipeline leak and fireball in Washington State that claimed the lives of three boys.
Regarding proposals to mix a small portion of hydrogen with methane, McKay said that because hydrogen has less energy content than methane per unit of volume, mixing 10% hydrogen with 90% methane reduces combustion CO2 emissions by only 3%. Moreover, hydrogen is an indirect greenhouse gas, she said.
The seven hydrogen hubs selected by DOE for $7 billion in awards would also receive federal tax incentives estimated by Clean Energy Group at $70 billion in over ten years, consisting of hydrogen production incentives for all projects and carbon capture incentives for blue hydrogen production.
Carbon capture incentives are key to the economics of blue hydrogen projects, said IEEFA’s Anika Juhn, yet federal incentives will not lead to a high rate of carbon capture. She described a project in Louisiana to produce hydrogen from coal gasification that is set to receive $425 million per year in carbon capture credits, while capturing only 64% of the associated lifetime CO2-equivalent emissions.
Juhn critiqued the GREET model used by DOE to project a hydrogen project’s carbon emissions, challenging four assumptions used in the model.
David Schlissel, an analyst at IEEFA, said “there’s not enough demand” for the hydrogen to be produced by “these projects that we’re going to pay to build.” He forecasted potential markets for hydrogen for ammonia production and iron production, but not for transportation or home heating.
Schlissel and Suzanne Mattei, also an IEEFA analyst, wrote in an op-ed last fall that “full funding of these projects is not yet guaranteed. DOE will now enter into negotiations with the selected project sponsors about funding, which will be allocated in four decision-making phases.”

The end of the pandemic brought challenges to the fitness firm, with its stock dropping over 95% since 2021. First Solar, U.S.-based thin film solar module manufacturer, announced it has acquired the unfinished facility, which it plans to transform into a distribution center to distribute solar panels manufactured at First Solar’s three Ohio manufacturing facilities.
In 2023, these Ohio facilities had a reported combined annual capacity of approximately 6 GW. And First Solar plans to expand that capacity by almost a gigawatt in 2024, according to Mike Koralewski, chief supply chain officer at First Solar.
“We intend to use this facility to ensure the efficient and timely shipping of modules to our customers, repurposing it into a dedicated distribution hub for the largest solar manufacturing footprint in the Western Hemisphere, said Koralewski. “We expect that this approach will allow us to streamline logistics operations, while reducing operating costs and contributing to our cost reduction roadmap.”
In addition to expanding its Ohio footprint this year, the company expects to invest over $2 billion in new manufacturing facilities in Alabama and Louisiana. The new Alabama factory represents an investment of approximately $1.1 billion and is expected to be commissioned by 2025, with a planned annual capacity of 3.5 GWDC.
First Solar expects to have 14 GW of fully vertically integrated U.S. solar manufacturing capacity by 2026. Additionally, First Solar is investing up to $370 million in a dedicated R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio, which is expected to be completed in 2024.
While the Troy Township center will be used primarily for distribution, the company is eyeing using part of it for satellite manufacturing as well.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/22/decarbonizing-disaster-response/,"MARKETS,MICROGRID,HAWAII,PUERTO RICO,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MATTHEW LYNAS,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Decarbonizing disaster response,"From pv magazine 12/23-01/24
Water, power, and shelter. Whether earthquakes, extreme weather, or sudden refugee crises occur, all three are crucial when disaster strikes. Solar is playing an increasing role in providing all three for first responders.
While a mature technology, solar is a relative newcomer to emergency response. PV’s technological advances and affordable price mean non-profits and private companies are taking solar to places in desperate need of power.
In September 2017, Hurricane Maria struck the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico causing destruction and almost 3,000 deaths. Energy infrastructure was wrecked and more than 90% of the island’s residents lost power. US-based non-profit Empowered by Light was one of the first groups on the ground.
Founded in 2011, Empowered by Light began as a charity providing solar to remote schools in Zambia. It has completed more than 80 solar and energy storage projects in nine countries. Developmental work still makes up the core of the non-profit’s activity but executive director and co-founder Moira Hanes told pv magazine that when Hurricane Maria hit, Empowered by Light had the chance to show how quickly solar can be deployed.
“We’re not normally an emergency response disaster relief organization,” she said. “But after the hurricane, we immediately went out to the island. We started putting solar energy [with] storage on fire stations so that they could continue to operate, or be operating again because a lot of them had been on these generators which had broken down. They couldn’t even receive 911 calls or effectively dispatch their personnel.”
Why solar?
Reliability was a main benefit of solar on Puerto Rico, Hanes said. Not only were some diesel backup generators failing, it was occurring at the worst possible time regarding replacement parts.
“Diesel generators break down and you can’t get the part in a timely manner because your supply chain and supply routes have been constrained because of the disaster,” said Hanes, “PV is reliable and renewable and it’s not polluting.”
Empowered by Light has installed solar arrays on 11 Puerto Rican fire stations, in partnership with other charitable groups and businesses. The charity has also provided PV support to communities on Maui, Hawaii, following the outbreak of wildfires on the U.S. island in early August 2023. In Maui, innovative approaches to disaster PV included the use of what Hanes described as “powerfield buckets,” made up of rows of solar modules connected to donated Tesla Powerwall batteries.
“That was immediately deployed to power the aid distribution site,” said Hanes. “It’s powering refrigeration, lighting. They’re cooking three meals a day there.”
Empowered by Light is not a manufacturer or installer. The charity works with local PV companies where possible, ensuring relief efforts provide new opportunities for a community’s solar industry.
“We will use a local [engineering, procurement and construction company] that is as close to that community as possible,” said Hanes. “That way, we’re helping build local capacity. We have advisers, our engineers can weigh in on the design but we’re trying to make certain everything is done on as local a level as possible. We’re also trying to procure hardware in the country, wherever possible. So you’re not shipping modules from the US, for example, to Africa, which is cost prohibitive.”
Cost is the other factor that comes up when discussing PV in a disaster context. A can of diesel is a lot cheaper than a PV module and cash is a precious resource in communities facing the cost of rebuilding. Empowered by Light has a diverse group of backers providing financial assistance. OpenSolar in particular has made a significant contribution to Empowered by Light, with the solar design software company pledging to donate 1% of its annual revenue to the charity’s projects.
Duck curve financing
Footprint Project is another charity supporting solar relief efforts on Maui. The organization has partnered with Empowered by Light in the past and the pair expect to collaborate on longer-term solar projects on the island.
When it comes to disaster funding, Footprint Project operations director and co-founder Will Heegaard said he would like to see greater investment ahead of time – although that can be a challenge for relief organizations. Much as with solar generation and grid capacity, there is a gap between the peak funding period for disaster relief and demand for finance. Most donations come in the wake of a disaster. The money is obviously welcome but a cash injection in the weeks and months before incidents occur could arguably go further. That way, more resources and infrastructure would be in place to react.
“We need to solve the duck curve of disaster financing,” said Heegaard. “If we’re going to be successful in expanding adoption of renewable technologies in disaster affected communities, we need the industry to pony up and invest in our work ahead of time. Otherwise, we will not be as successful as we could be.”
The resources deployed can vary at Footprint Project. Jamie Swezey, the organization’s program director, described his employer as technology agnostic.
Broadly, the non-profit seeks to replace the 2 kW to 10 kW diesel generator. Its microgrids, therefore, operate in and around that range. That can mean a 2 kW or smaller set-up handy for charging cell phones in a crisis or a converted shipping container fitted with 10 kW to 20 kW solar arrays and 100 kW of battery storage. Footprint Project’s biggest microgrid to date, with a capacity of around 80 kW, can be found in Napili Park, on Maui.
Those PV installations don’t just supply power for relief work, they improve quality of life for first responders, according to Footprint Project. Swezey said that the non-profit has considered finding a way to record decibel levels, as one of the most frequent benefits cited by first responders when PV is installed is the reduction in noise level.
Sound isn’t the only thing that can make diesel generators a pain. First responders working around generators often complain of headaches, which Heegaard described as a symptom of low-grade carbon monoxide poisoning. Things can get much worse depending on where and how fossil fuel generators are used.
“After Hurricane Laura hit the gulf [of Mexico], more people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from running their gas generators in their garage, to power their house, than died from the hurricane itself,” said Heegaard. “It’s a huge health risk for a number of reasons.”
Business case
Using solar in disaster response is more than a charitable endeavor. At Michigan-based start-up Sesame Solar, the potential to use mobile “nanogrids” in a crisis serves as the foundation of a business – one that’s been steadily expanding. Founded in 2017, the nanogrid manufacturer has picked up a diverse range of clients with an interest in disaster response.
US communications giant Comcast has used Sesame Solar nanogrids in the aftermath of hurricanes in both Louisiana and Florida. The U.S. Air Force makes use of the company’s nanogrids as a mobile medical base and for command and security. In Santa Barbara County, California, the local government has invested in Sesame Solar nanogrids that are towed to locations using all-electric Ford-150 trucks.
Now with financial backing from institutional investors such as Morgan Stanley, VSC Ventures, PAX Momentum, and Belle Capital, as well as endorsements from the likes of President Bill Clinton’s non-profit Clinton Foundation and “Time” magazine, Sesame Solar is well positioned to make the shift to a global business, as co-founder and chief executive officer Lauren Flanagan explained.
“We’re already international,” she said. “I would like to be global through our partnerships. We have a subsidiary in India already but we still make everything in the United States. But it’s a global set of problems with a global marketplace.”
At Sesame Solar, the focus has been on creating a turnkey solution that requires no installation and is simple to use. Flanagan said the company’s trailer-mounted nanogrids can be operated with a small amount of training. Once up and running, she said, Sesame Solar offers a continuous energy loop that allows for consistent power, from 5 kW to 20 kW, depending on system specification. The trailer which houses the nanogrid also provides shelter from the elements.
Consistency is key. The intermittent nature of solar is not ideal in a disaster relief context, if left unaddressed. Sesame Solar solves this problem through a combination of battery storage and hydrogen electrolyzing capability.
It is a straightforward concept. Solar power is generated during daylight hours and can be used to power disaster response and charge the nanogrid’s battery storage. Stored power can then be deployed and any excess can be used to power hydrogen generation on board. Nanogrids fitted with a green hydrogen system for backup power include a large tank of deionized water. When the tank gets low, there is an integrated atmospheric water generator that generates distilled water, which is then deionized for use in hydrogen production. The hydrogen itself is stored as a solid, at low pressure, which means transportation does not trigger permit requirements.
“We make the deionized water we need to make the hydrogen gas we need, and you don’t do it all at once,” said Flanagan. “It’s in a sequence. You start out with full tanks of hydrogen and water and then you’re topping them up as needed because you’re not running the fuel cell full time. The whole point is that it’s a continuous green energy loop that allows for consistent, continuous power draw.”
Potable water is also on the menu, thanks to a partnership between Sesame Solar and Watergen Ltd. The Israeli company manufactures atmospheric drinking water devices that create potable water from the air.
It’s a total solution, according to Flanagan, with further scope for innovation in areas such as electric vehicle charging.
“That’s the idea,” she added. “Trying to eliminate the supply chain of having to bring hydrogen or fossil fuel or water into an emergency zone.”

Copernican is a sustainable energy solutions provider throughout Washington, Maryland and Virginia. 
The 125 kW portfolio comprises nine residential solar installations in underserved communities in Washington. The project builds on a 208 kW portfolio, financed by DC Green Bank, that now provides solar power to 23 low-to-moderate income households in Wards 7 and 8. 
According to Coalition for Green Capital, green banks are “mission-driven institutions that use innovative financing to accelerate the transition to clean energy and fight climate change”.
DC Green Bank states that this joint effort will help to increase employment opportunities in the area, moving Washington closer to meeting its climate and inclusive development goals. In terms of growth, the city wants to ensure that all residents benefit from the continued economic prosperity and population increase. Washington also wants to be climate resilient and carbon neutral by 2050.  
“This deal is a significant milestone for Copernican because this collaboration with DC Green Bank and City First Enterprises demonstrates how mission-driven lending creates an ecosystem for flexible and innovative financing that emerging developers need,” said Chris Turner, a partner at Copernican Energy. “As we continue to scale our business, having capital partners that fill the gaps is crucial to the feasibility of these projects.”
Investing in local enterprises, especially to deliver clean energy solutions, is also critical to Mayor Muriel Browser’s strategy for Washington to achieve carbon neutrality and climate resiliency by 2050. According to the executive office of the mayor, this scheme involves four steps: phasing out on-site fossil fuel combustion in buildings, bringing housing, jobs and daily needs closer together, enabling more residents to walk, bike and take public transit to reach their destination, and assessing how to decarbonize Washington’s consumption-based methods.  
DC Green Bank states that the 125kW portfolio will result in greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to removing 2,040 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air over 20 years. The installation is also expected to generate about 50% of savings in energy bills for participating low-to-moderate income households. According to The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, residents of D.C. paid $0.15/kWh as of December 2022, which EnergySage states is 20% lower than the national average of 0.19/kWh.

SolarEdge announced a global workforce-reduction plan that will affect approximately 900 employees, or about 16% of its total workforce.
The company said the reduction is part of a restructuring plan “designed to reduce operating expenses and align its cost structure to current market dynamics.” It said it will provide more details in an upcoming end-of-year earnings release.
“We are making every effort to treat our departing colleagues with respect and gratitude for their contributions and support them in their transition. We remain confident in the long-term growth of the solar energy market and our leading position in the smart energy space,” Chief Executive Zvi Lando said. “These changes do not impact our strategic direction and priorities and we remain committed to continue to drive the renewable energy transformation, while providing best in class technology and support to our customers.”
The company said the job losses are the latest in a series of measures it has taken to align with current market conditions. It has shut down manufacturing in Mexico, reduced manufacturing capacity in China, and terminated its light commercial vehicle e-mobility activity.
Earlier this month, U.S. investment firm BlackRock, which is SolarEdge’s biggest shareholder, increased its stake in the company to 15.8%.
After a poor Q3, 2023 earnings report in early November, SolarEdge saw its stock drop precipitously. The company had reported a Q3 adjusted loss of 55 cents per share, which missed earnings estimates of 68 cents, and in the hours following the report, its stock price immediately fell 10% to 20%.
In December pv magazine USA reported that the S&P Dow Jones Indices will move SolarEdge (NASD: SEDG) from the S&P 500 to the S&P SmallCap 600 prior to the open of trading on December 18. For Q3 2023, the company posted revenues of $725 million, $676 million of which is from its solar segment.
The company’s share price dropped by 67% in 2023 and falling by almost 80% from its peak in 2021. However, looking ahead to Q4, SolarEdge provided guidance of $325 million in revenues.
