The 365 Pronto software platform serves two sides of the market: the buyers, who are the asset owners, and the sellers, who are the service providers.
For asset owners, the platform matches the attributes of their asset and scope of work requirements to a local, compliant, and qualified service provider.
For service providers, the platform matches the availability, location, and skillsets of their technicians with the requirements of a customer’s work order. The service providers include third-party installers that service residential and commercial solar, battery storage and EV charging stations. Hundreds of service providers have been qualified by the 365 Pronto platform.
The way 365 Pronto works begins with the buyer (asset owner) placing a pre-priced work order. The platform then matches and dispatches a qualified service provider to complete the work order.
“We are pleased to welcome 365 Pronto’s customers, service providers, and employees to Enphase,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO at Enphase. “The company’s software platform will provide our installers the ability to service their own O&M contracts with an on-demand network of service providers. We are excited about this opportunity to improve the installer experience as we continue to expand our digital platform.”
This acquisition follows Enphase’s November acquisition of California-based ClipperCreek, which offers electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/21/iron-flow-battery-pv-microgrid-for-fire-prone-california/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",Iron flow battery PV microgrid for fire-prone California,"Utility-scale and commercial long-duration flow battery manufacturer ESS Inc. announced its iron flow batteries are being deployed by San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) in a microgrid project aimed at bolstering energy resilience and providing critical backup power to a fire-prone town in southern California.
The microgrid is planned to integrate an on-site solar array and is designed to provide backup power to several critical community facilities, including a health center, fire station, and key telecommunications equipment. When the microgrid is not in use, excess energy stored in the flow batteries will be exported to the California wholesale energy market. The project is pegged for activation in the first quarter of 2022.
A flow battery design is comprised of an electrochemical cell where a membrane separates two chemical solutions. Chemical energy and electricity are produced by exchanging ions across the membrane.
ESS said its iron-flow batteries have a chemistry that lasts 20 years or more with no capacity fade or degradation. This differs from conventional battery chemistries, which generally achieve a 7-to-10-year lifecycle before the need for augmentation. The batteries use earth-abundant iron, salt and water for electrolyte, foregoing the use of rare minerals like vanadium and lithium, which have some environmental concerns in their extraction processes.
ESS flow batteries present no fire, chemical or explosive risk, which means they can be deployed without suppression equipment, secondary containment, or hazmat restrictions. The company said its batteries, which range from 6-12 hours durations, can offer among the lowest levelized cost of storage (LCOS) available for battery energy storage.
Microgrid-based energy resilience projects are on the rise in tandem with the rise of extreme weather events and climate-driven catastrophes like the wildfires of California. The U.S. Department of Energy reports 575 active microgrids with a combined capacity of 4.25 GW.
Long-duration energy storage has also come under focus as more renewable energy is interconnected with the grid. The Long-Duration Energy Storage (LDES) council was launched at the international COP26 climate summit this November. The council said it plans to guide governments and grid operators on how LDES technologies will support decarbonization of the grid as the lowest-cost option to society.
Between 85 and 140 terawatt-hours of LDES deployment will be required to achieve a net-zero grid by 2040, according to the council’s projections. The council also estimates a need of 1 TWh of LDES deployment by 2025 to pace for decarbonization by 2040, as well.
The LDES Council comprises 24 tech companies, users, and investors. ESS CEO Eric Dressselhuys entered the council as a founding member.
These deployment projections would entail a $1.5 to $3 trillion investment. The council said renewable energy stored in these technologies could eliminate 1.5 to 2.3 Gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, or about 10-15% of global power emissions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/21/aes-acquires-community-energy-solar/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PENNSYLVANIA",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",AES acquires Community Energy Solar,"AES announced that it has acquired Pennsylvania-based solar developer, Community Energy Solar, as well as Community Energy’s 10 GW project pipeline.
According to AES, the move is part of a greater plan for future company expansion efforts, and the acquisition of Community Energy will bolster those efforts with a strong development pipeline and skilled development workforce.
Community Energy has developed more than 3 GW of solar and storage projects and opened the market for utility-scale solar as the first to develop a 100 MW scale project in seven states. With the acquisition, AES’ US renewables portfolio now includes 4.4 GW of operating assets and 5.7 GW of signed PPAs.
In total, the merger brings AES U.S. solar development pipeline to more than 40 GW.
“AES is the ideal partner for us because of their conviction on climate, their industry-leading innovation and most importantly, their people,” said Brent Beerley, Community Energy CEO. “Having worked closely with the AES team over the past several years, we have found a deep alignment on values and culture, which was essential to us. I am beyond grateful to our team, our board and AES for this opportunity.”
In 2020, the University of Pennsylvania signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the creation of a 220 MW solar project, the largest in the state, set to be developed by Community Energy.
The University is planned to purchase all the power produced at the two sites in Central Pennsylvania – equivalent to about 75% of the total electricity demand of the campus and the University’s Health System – for 25 years at a rate competitive with conventional electricity prices.
The associated generation is set to bring the University closer to its goal of a 100% carbon neutral campus by 2042 and the state closer to the 6 GW solar goals of advocates like Pennsylvania’s solar trade association, PASEIA.

The project, dubbed Lily solar + storage, marks Enel’s first co-located solar and storage facility in North America. The 55 MW of battery capacity is part of a planned 600 MW pipeline of energy storage to be added to the Texas ERCOT grid by 2022.
The project consists of 421,400 bifacial PV modules, and 12,444 batteries. It is estimated the project will abate annual emissions of over 242,000 tons of carbon dioxide.
“By pairing renewable energy with storage technology, we are supporting a cleaner and more flexible grid,” said Paolo Romanacci, Head of Enel Green Power in the US and Canada.
As storms this February caused massive outages in Texas, there is increasing demand for bolstering the grid, adding extreme weather resilience, and integrating energy storage.
In March, a Colorado-based grid analysis firm Vibrant Clean Energy released a whitepaper that modeled the impact of energy storage on reliability. It found that in a “high renewables” attachment rate to the grid, about 40,000 MW of storage would have met all February blackout requirements in the state “with room to spare.”
Enel said it plans several more hybrid co-located renewables plus storage projects in the state. It also plans to add 57 MW energy storage systems to its 500 MW High Lonesome wind field and 497 MW Roadrunner solar facility. The company said it plans a growth strategy of 6.5 GW of renewables and 1.4 GW of storage capacity by the end of 2024 as part of an $8 billion growth plan revealed in November.

Here are the articles most widely read and shared articles at pv magazine USA in 2021:

This energy storage technology, based on gravity and kinetic energy, shows much promise in theory but the tide was turned when it landed its first customer order. Watch the video here to see how it works. DG Fuels signed a $520 million deal for 1.6 GWh of energy storage from Energy Vault to manufacture synthetic aviation fuels with no carbon emissions. Energy Vault estimates that this agreement will generate up to $520 million in revenue across three projects, the first of which expected to commence in mid-2022.

When Boston-based startup Form Energy introduced its new battery technology, they claimed would “reform the global electricity system to run on 100% low-cost renewable energy.” The rechargeable iron-air battery can store electricity for 100 hours at costs– the company says–are competitive with legacy power plants. In July the company had secured $200 million Series D funding and announced that its first project is a 1 MW / 150 MWh pilot installation with Minnesota-based utility Great River Energy, which Form Energy said it expects to have deployed by 2023.

Ryan Kennedy’s three-part series took a look at the cost of individual components of residential solar installations including rooftop residential solar panels, residential energy storage batteries, and this one on inverters. While all three articles topped the charts in our most-read category, this one garnered the most attention likely because the inverter is a critical piece to the installation due to the fact they have the shortest lifespan of all the components and are the leading cause of system failure.

According to a report issued last spring by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, electric vehicles made up only 3% of all global car sales but that figure is expected to jump to 58% of global passenger vehicle sales in 2040. The ramp in EV adoption will be led initially by reaching price parity with internal combustion engine, which is dependent on policies and regulations such as those on fuel economy and CO2 emissions.

In May, Maxeon launched a line of solar panels based on its Air technology platform, which was unique because it promised to bring solar to previously inaccessible roof spaces. According to Maxeon, the Air solar panels can be adhered directly to the roof without the need for racking or other mounting systems. Because of their adhesive and low-weight nature, the technology will initially target installations on roofs that are not engineered to support the weight of conventional solar systems. Maxeon recently announced that the Air panels would be launched first in Europe.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/21/nrel-launches-international-consortium-to-advance-high-tech-mirrors-used-in-concentrating-solar-plants/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",NREL launches international consortium to advance high-tech mirrors used in concentrating solar plants,"Heliostats are key components of concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP) technologies, and the Heliostat Consortium aims to drive down costs and advance manufacturing. The consortium, HelioCon, is led by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), with partners at Sandia National Laboratories and the Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute.
A heliostat is a device that contains a mirror, and they work by tracking the sun in order to reflect sunlight to a receiver, where it can be stored as heat for long duration energy storage and converted into electricity. There can be more than 10,000 heliostats in a single CSP plant, representing up to half the cost of system construction and a primary driver of operations and maintenance costs. In order to bring down the cost of energy from CSP plants, it’s imperative to bring down the costs of heliostats.
(Read “Heliogen CSP advances to equipment procurement stage for 5 MW project“.)
DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) has a target of $50 per square meter, to reach its goal of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour for next-generation CSP plants with thermal energy storage. To address costs, HelioCon will develop standards, metrology, techno-economic analysis, and field deployment technologies. In addition, the consortium seeks to increase domestic manufacturing of solar technologies and to bring more professionals into clean energy careers.
“Low-cost CSP can help us achieve a net-zero energy sector,” said Avi Shultz, SETO CSP program manager. “CSP’s ability to directly generate high temperatures at low cost will directly address many industrial applications whose emissions can’t be easily reduced with other technologies or electrified.”
In support of these goals, HelioCon is actively seeking to broaden the community working on this technology through its industry board of advisors and future requests for proposals, which will engage new leaders in this area.
