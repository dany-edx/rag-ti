The bill would amend the state’s 2004 Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) Act to increase Pennsylvania’s renewable energy goal from 8% by 2026 to 18%.
Beyond that renewable energy mandate, the bill includes a carveout calling for 5.5% to come from solar energy by 2026, a bump over the current 0.5% goal, which Vote Solar said it expects to be surpassed this May.
That carveout isn’t intended just to put more solar on the grid. The Finding Pennsylvania Solar Future Project claimed that increasing the solar portion of the state’s electricity mix from 0.5% to 10% by 2030 would create upwards of 100,000 jobs and result in a net economic benefit of $1.6 billion annually. Ratcheting up the goal to 5% is a first step.
This March has been one of the busiest months ever for solar in Pennsylvania, at least from a legislative/commitment perspective.
On March 22, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) announced that the state would power nearly half of the government’s electricity needs through seven new solar energy arrays totaling 191 MW, while it also would cut its energy use at least 3% annually. The state also would replace one-quarter of its vehicle fleet with electric vehicles, and aim for high-performance energy standards in building construction, lease, or renovation.
Two days later, lawmakers introduced legislation that would make it possible for two or more entities to subscribe for electricity generated by a solar photovoltaic system no larger than 5 MW in size, a way of legalizing community solar.
Many solar developers in the state also anticipate a pair of key solar programs, HB531 and SB705, to be implemented in the near future. An analysis done by the College of Agricultural Studies at Penn State University found that around 1 GW of solar power is ready to break ground, pending the approval of those two bills. The projects reportedly have signed agreements, as well as some sort of interconnection and permitting in place.
Taken together, all this legislation, if enacted, would vault Pennsylvania nationally in terms of state commitments to and procurement of solar energy. Once a mid-Atlantic haven for coal and fracked natural gas, the Keystone State could be making a swift solar transition right before our eyes.

The project will deliver electricity to state-owned utility Santee Cooper under a long-term power purchase agreement.
The project was completed in less than a year, with construction starting last June. The installation consists of more than 246,000 solar panels across 590 acres. Details about the panel manufacturer and mounting hardware were not available.
Centerfield Solar marks Pine Gate’s 18th operational project in South Carolina with more than a dozen under construction and in development across the state. Overall, South Carolina has seen a solar boom in the last several years, with most of the state’s operational solar capacity coming online since 2019.
This growth is expected to slow, however, as the Solar Energy Industries association predicts that the state will add 1,344 MW of solar over the next five years, good for just 26th in the nation.
While one of the state’s utilities, Dominion, has committed to shuttering its entire coal fleet and adding as much as 2 GW of solar and up to 900 MW of battery storage, the first project isn’t expected to enter service until 2026, and the additions are set to come in 50-100 MW annual increments over 20 years.
Duke Energy recently expanded its Green Source Advantage program into South Carolina. It remains too early to estimate how much solar will result.

U.K.-based market observer IHS Markit has significantly raised its forecast PV installation figures for this year, from 158 GW to 181 GW.
In the white paper IHS Markit Top 10 Cleantech Trends in 2021, the analyst said this growth would represent a 27% year-on-year increase compared to 2020 and would materialize in a scenario that the analyst described as characterized by strong demand despite increased module prices, long lead times, and rising freight costs.
“Leading module manufacturers are sold out for the first half of the year,” said Josefin Berg, research manager for clean energy technology at IHS Markit. “There is no indication of price weakness for July shipments yet, manufacturing capacity remains sufficient, and no major material bottlenecks have arisen to change our forecast for 181 GW in global solar PV installations.”
Increasing prices for polysilicon, copper, and steel will contribute to maintaining PV module prices at current levels, although prices of solar glass may begin declining from the second quarter of the year. Demand, on the other hand, is expected to grow from May, both in China and the international markets.
“The solar supply chain is entering a new phase with a bigger focus on profitability, technology leadership, and consolidation,” IHS Markit stated. “Increasing consolidation on the manufacturing side–approximately 72% of modules were produced by the top 10 companies in 2020, according to IHS Markit research–in addition to high production costs and investors’ pressure to increase profitability, will be major factors in maintaining stable module prices this year.”
Profitability in the PV supply chain remains critical for all major manufacturers, as they require liquidity and capital for new investments in research and development and plans to roll-out the mass production of innovative PV technologies from 2023. “Investments will also be needed to adapt [the] module supply chain to [the] lower-carbon and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards demanded by the market,” said Edurne Zoco, executive director for clean energy technology at IHS Markit.
China is expected to be, once again, the world’s largest PV market in 2021, with around 60 GW of newly installed solar power. The U.S. market is expected to install 27 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/29/2020-solar-installer-survey-shows-the-pandemic-cant-crack-industry-confidence/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 29, 2021",2020 Solar Installer Survey shows the pandemic can’t crack industry confidence,"Installer confidence in the solar industry has never been higher, according to the results of EnergySage and the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners’ sixth annual Solar Installer Survey.
The survey, which included responses from over 650 residential and commercial installers across 48 states and two territories: Washington DC and Puerto Rico, offers a snapshot of what the solar industry looks like through the lens of its installers.
As a start, more than 50% of respondents reported that their businesses were negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Even so, confidence in the health of the solar industry has never been higher, the report said.
One pandemic-induced shift, selling solar systems remotely, is here to stay.

The report credits some of the confidence to the survey’s timing: responses were collected after both the November election and extension of the federal investment tax credit, and before the blackouts in Texas.
One pandemic-induced shift, selling solar systems remotely, is here to stay, at least in some capacity, the report said. Some 12% of installers surveyed said they plan to sell entirely remotely. Others said they plan to use online selling as a tool, but not rely on it entirely. The split largely was over whether or not respondents had already begun to sell in person again, or if they planned on doing so in the near future.
On the installations front, 2020 marked the “best year ever” for residential energy storage installations, with the storage attachment rate jumping more than 30% between 2019 and 2020. That resulted in a nationwide average attachment rate of 20%.
Respondents said that nearly half of all customers showed interest in energy storage in 2020. Interest was high in states that experience frequent headline-grabbing weather events, like California and North Carolina.
Resilience was found to be the overall largest driver of storage interest and adoption, and cost remained the biggest barrier. More than three-quarters of respondents named battery costs as the primary barrier to increasing storage attachment rates. Two-fifths of respondents said a lack of storage incentives was a barrier to adoption.
Among the residential storage options available to customers, Tesla was the most widely requested brand; installers also said they are most likely to stock LG Energy Solutions batteries. The percentage of installers stocking LG batteries fell, however, from 56% in 2019 to 44% in 2020.
As for other hardware, the most-requested solar modules by consumers were LG. And the most-requested inverters were Enphase and SolarEdge.
Satisfaction with battery offerings has also become an issue among installers. Roughly 14% of installers said they were very satisfied with their battery brand, while three out of a small sample of five survey respondents said they have a neutral or unfavorable view toward their battery brand.

The Logan County project will include 173 MW of solar and a 30 MW/120 MWh battery system, which TVA said will help increase grid resilience. The power authority and Warren Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. partnered with Nashville-based developer Silicon Ranch on the project.
TVA signed a long-term power purchase agreement with Silicon Ranch to develop, own, operate, and maintain the solar-plus-storage facility. Construction is expected to begin in 2022 and be completed in fall 2023, pending environmental reviews.
TVA said Green Invest has attracted nearly $2.7 billion in solar investment and procured over 2.1 GW of solar on behalf of its customers since 2018.
To support Facebook’s regional data center operations, the social media giant will receive 145 MW of the Logan County project’s solar renewable energy credits (RECs) and all of the storage attributes through TVA’s Green Invest program.
The deal is Facebook’s fifth renewable energy agreement with TVA, following a deal for Mississippi solar and storage in early March. Facebook’s renewable commitments in the TVA region now total 742 MW of solar and 80 MW of battery storage.
The social media firm, which ranks among the Top 10 corporate renewable energy buyers of 2020 in the U.S. and globally, has said it aims to power all of its operations with renewable energy.
Meanwhile, General Motors agreed to receive 28 MW of the Logan County project’s solar RECs through same TVA program. The solar will support the automaker’s Bowling Green assembly plant, which is 30 miles from the project and produces the Chevrolet Corvette.
Last May, General Motors agreed to use Green Invest to power its Spring Hill, Tennessee, manufacturing plant with 100% renewable energy. The company has said it plans to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. operations by 2030 and become carbon-neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. The automaker also ranked among the Top 10 corporate renewable energy buyers of 2020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/29/california-adds-more-layers-to-its-summer-2021-electric-reliability-effort/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 29, 2021",California adds more layers to its summer 2021 electric reliability effort,"California utility regulators ordered the state’s three investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to put in place a range of programs intended to cut energy demand and boost energy supply during critical hours of the day in an effort to ensure reliability in the case of an extreme heat event in the summers of 2021 and 2022.
The decision requires the state’s IOUs to collectively procure at least 1,000 MW of demand- and supply-side resources for this summer. More than 500 MW in supply-side resources have already been contracted for at the direction of earlier action by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The PUC’s most recent decision is intended to spur roughly 500 MW in additional demand-side resources (such as demand response and batteries) by this summer. By summer 2022, demand-side resources are expected to total nearly 1,000 MW.
In addition, the PUC said that another 2,000 MW of battery storage will be ready to serve the grid next summer, and that 8,000 MW of clean energy resources are under development to be online over the next three years.
(Read: “Sunrise brief: LADWP can reach 100% renewable energy as early as 2035, NREL study says.”)
The PUC opened a regulatory docket last November in response to a mid-August 2020 extreme heat event that required the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to impose rotating power outages. In an effort to ensure grid reliability this summer, the PUC ordered the following new initiatives and enhancements to existing programs:
• Increased Overall Utility Procurement Requirements: Regulators ordered utilities to procure a least an additional 2.5% of resources for all customers in their service areas. Doing so would increase the planning reserve margin from 15% to 17.5%. The change sets minimum demand- and supply-side resource targets for this summer of 450 MW for Pacific Gas and Electric, 450 MW for Southern California Edison, and 100 MW for San Diego Gas and Electric. For supply-side resources, utilities must give preference to storage contracts and upgrades in the efficiency of existing generation resources, and for shorter contract terms.
New Demand Response Programs: Regulators ordered the three IOUs to pilot an Emergency Load Reduction Program. The program would give demand response providers (and other companies providing new services to manage electricity demand) the ability to show how their programs can support the grid.
Improved Rate Plans to Encourage Conservation: Regulators ordered utilities to modify their Critical Peak Pricing programs to ensure the program is more effective and responsive to the critical hours of a grid emergency. Revisions include shifting the Critical Peak Pricing event window for residential and non-residential customers to 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., increasing the maximum number of Critical Peak Pricing events allowed per year, and providing customer education to boost participation.
Improved Existing Demand Response Programs: The PUC ordered that existing demand response programs be modified to expand participation, including temporarily allowing year-round enrollment in utility “interruptible programs.” These programs allow industrial and large commercial customers to pay a lower rate in exchange for allowing the utility to curtail their energy usage when energy demand is high and the reliability of the electric grid is threatened.
Last November, the PUC ordered utilities to procure 3,300 MW of new, non-emitting electricity resources, and make 10-year, long-term investments in new in-state generation.
All of these actions followed a mid-August 2020 heat wave that forced the CAISO to initiate rotating power outages in California. Last January, a root cause analysis of the heat event outlined short-term and longer-term actions to mitigate electricity shortages.
The report confirmed the CAISO’s initial findings that a trio of factors were responsible for the blackouts: extreme weather conditions, resource adequacy and planning processes, and market practices. The report included analysis of how a range of energy resources performed, including solar, energy storage, and natural gas.
Among the recommended actions was expediting the regulatory and procurement processes to develop more resources that can be online by this summer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/29/the-solar-install-game-is-changing-will-you-be-ready/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 29, 2021",The solar install game is changing: Will you be ready?,"Massachusetts is again considering a new-construction rooftop solar mandate, seeking to join California and, if polling is anything to believe, other states as well.
The two states total 46.5 million people, representing almost 15% of the U.S. population, and hundreds of thousands of new structures each year.
Mandates such as these make this a good time to take a hard look at the retrofit rooftop solar industry’s evolving business structure and consider the need for it to drive down installation pricing.
The U.S. has nearly 140 million homes, and solar installs will top only 3 million of them by the end of the year

However, business models are evolving, and that’s before we even get to the new-construction mandates.
For example, national solar companies such as Sunrun, Sungevity, Tesla, and others have largely replaced “mom and pop” solar companies that for years knocked on doors and sent out their electricians to install rooftop solar.
As with a mom-and-pop, the first touch with a homeowner for these big companies is most often a visit from a salesperson, or a website click by a prospective customer. But unlike a mom-and-pop, the salesperson is probably a contractor or a freelance “1099” employee who doesn’t work for the national company or the local installer. These salespeople complete and sign a pre-approved sales contract from one of the national companies, and move on to the next door.

After that, independent teams of engineers and project managers move the project forward by working with the various local authorities that claim jurisdiction over a project.
Typically, when the mechanical install team arrives at the site, the hardware has already been delivered. The electrical install team shows up later; here, too, this often is a separate company. Finally, long-term operations and maintenance is usually performed by – you guessed it – another company that specializes in O&M.
As you can see, the mom-and-pop team of not-so-very-long ago has evolved into five unique companies for sales, management/engineering, mechanical installation, electrical installation, and post-sales technical support.
In 2018, when California implemented its rooftop mandate, we expressed our opinion about what might happen to the cost of residential solar if it were installed at the time of construction. We said that this monumental move by California was about to revolutionize residential solar all across the country. For one thing, residential solar was in a much better position to leverage economies of scale across a wide variety of soft costs in ways that just weren’t possible before.
Today, we see that small solar at roughly $1 a watt is already happening in other places around the world, so the numbers in the above table — $1.12/watt installed — are within reach.
Solar at the time of new construction can be split into four elements:
This very much looks like what is already happening within national solar company ecosystems.
Dennis Schroeder/NREL
So far, anecdotal data on California’s new-home solar has revealed no price decreases, with homeowners sometimes forced to use a solar contractor that controls the new housing development’s installation rights. This model will not last when Tesla is offering solar at $2/watt.
Hawaii is already allowing solar+storage to be connected to the power grid before it is officially approved, and the state no longer allows net metering. This means less solar paperwork expertise is needed. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s SolarApp, which seeks to streamline permitting, also lowers barriers to entry.
Finally, because solar power on a new home is much cheaper, it raises an important question: How will the marketplace and the policy makers work this out? Will retrofit solar installations receive unique incentives not offered for new-home solar construction? Will market forces drive down the price of solar+storage, so much that they approach the price of new-home solar installations?
The retrofit solar expert isn’t going anywhere. They’re going to use new tools to compete, and they’re going to fight at the political level. The U.S. has nearly 140 million homes, and solar installs will top only 3 million of them by the end of the year – meaning we’ve got 98% to go.
As the venerable Cypress Hill might say, “I ain’t goin’ out like that.”
However, as national solar lease companies layer the industry, as fully integrated groups like Tesla aggressively cut prices, and as millions of new homes are built with solar each year, the pace of change can only accelerate.
And the rooftop experts? Well, they had better be ready.

The 45 proposals were recommended by committee members of the Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund. Local reports said the proposals include everything from energy retrofits for Black homeowners to rooftop gardens run by a local yoga studio.
Portland’s mayor and commissioners could authorize up to $8.6 million in grants, a portion of the grant program’s projected $160 million bank account. The program is funded by an annual tax on large retailers approved by voters in 2018.
City officials estimate the tax will generate up to $60 million a year. The fund can be used for any project related to clean energy, green infrastructure, and regenerative agriculture or workforce development programs in those fields.
Lots of folks head outside to cut stress and recharge their batteries. Now, Jeep and Electrify America say they plan to set up trailhead charging sites for electric vehicle batteries at three sites: Moab, Utah; the Rubicon Trail in Pollock Pines, California; and Big Bear, California.

Other charging stations are slated to be in place by the end of 2021. The stations either will be grid connected or use solar power to generate electricity.
The chargers will use Level 2 (240-volt) charging. The automaker said that with Level 2 charging, the 17 kWh battery pack in its Jeep Wrangler 4xe can be recharged in about two hours, providing around 21 miles of electric range.
Jeep 4xe owners would unlock free charging via an Electrify America app, which also would allow drivers to monitor their charging session.
Wood Mackenzie said that 114 GW of new wind capacity was added globally in 2020, an 82% increase year-over-year. The total was the highest global annual installation total on record, the firm said.
China’s National Energy Administration reported 72 GW of installed capacity in 2020; that alone would have qualified as the most capacity added globally in a single year.
The rest of the world added nearly 43 GW in 2020, a 15% increase from a year earlier. Big additions came from the U.S. (+6,565 MW), Brazil (+1,055 MW), the Netherlands (+1,878 MW), and Australia (+1,363 MW).
A Wyoming bill that would have directed utility regulators to review the state’s net metering program suffered a setback after a legislative committee voted to postpone a decision on the matter.
The bill was tabled and is not expected to be brought back.

Renewable Power Capital, an investment platform backed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, said it plans to develop 3.4 GW of solar energy projects in Spain. The Canadian investor formed a 50:50 joint venture partner with Spanish PV developer Benbros Solar S.L. Financial details were not disclosed.
Together, the partners agreed to work on 14 projects in the five regions around the country. The investment group said the Spanish market was attractive due to the country’s target of 50 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2025 and one of Europe’s lowest solar levelized cost of energy.
Enphase Energy said it signed a deal with Rubicon Energy to distribute Enphase IQ microinverters for grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) applications to residential and commercial installers in South Africa. The deal signals Enphase’s entry into the market.
The microinverters are grid-tied and compatible with 60-, 66-, or 72-cell solar modules up to 465 W. In addition, all Enphase solar systems distributed by Rubicon Energy will be outfitted to connect with software monitoring software for operations and maintenance.
Enphase said that the African continent represents approximately 40% of the world’s solar potential, but currently produces about 1% of the solar electricity generated globally.
