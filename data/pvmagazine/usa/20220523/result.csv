Development of the 150 MW Elora Solar project, which was led by NextEra Energy Resources, began in 2019, while construction efforts to build the center, which contains more than 500,000 solar modules, lasted 17 months and created approximately 250 construction jobs.
In November 2021, a unit of NextEra Energy Resources agreed to sell a 50% non-controlling interest in a 2.52 GW portfolio of long-term contracted renewable assets, including the Elora Solar Project, to the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board for $849 million, while the remaining 50% interest was sold by NextEra Energy Resources to NextEra Energy Partners for almost $850 million.
The project also provides a significant boost to the capacity of solar operating under TVA. TVA itself owns 1 MW of operable solar capacity and reports no ownership of wind energy assets, as of its FY 2021 report. TVA instead has developers play the role of owner-operator, so that they can access the federal investment tax credit incentive, an option that TVA, as a government entity, cannot access. A company spokesperson told pv magazine that, as of February 1, TVA has 642 MW operating solar, which means the Elora project will bring TVA just under 800 MW of solar capacity, and the entity has visons of up to 10 GW of solar by 2035, and more than 200,000 EVs on TVA roadways by 2028.
TVA currently has 5.38 GW of renewable energy capacity, nearly all of which is hydropower.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/23/new-record-for-solar-cell-efficiency-39-5-built-upon-quantum-wells/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 23, 2022",New record for solar cell efficiency – 39.5% – built upon quantum wells,"The Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has set a new solar cell efficiency record in normal sunlight at 39.5%. The triple-junction solar cell was able to set this record through improvements to the middle layer of the cell via making use of new techniques for constructing quantum wells.
The High-Efficiency Crystalline Photovoltaics (PV) Group at NREL made the solar cell with hundreds of layers of materials, each optimized based off of prior iterations of solar cell technology over multiple decades of research and development on this product class.
The solar cell is composed of three different materials: the top junction is made of gallium indium phosphide (GaInP), the middle layer is made from gallium arsenide, (GaAs), which is surrounded by aforementioned quantum wells, and the bottom is lattice-mismatched gallium indium arsenide (GaInAs). These materials have been used in solar cells before, and dominate the space solar power market.
The prior record for standard sunlight solar cells was 39.2%, and while that is almost as efficient as this new record, that cell was a six junction unit. This solar cell, using similar materials, was able to increase generation efficiency by taking advantage of the advancing research in quantum well layers.

The authors noted that hundreds of the quantum well layers sit between the central layer and the materials above and below it. These wells modify how the electrons, energized by photons, are captured and moved through the solar cell into the solar panels’ circuit. During the experiment, the number of quantum wells was varied between 100 and 300, to gain the specific current versus voltage characteristics the researchers were seeking. The quantum wells have a thickness of five to ten nanometers, which increased the cumulative thickness of the middle layer – of GaAs – from 850 nm to 2.5 mm, respectively.
The main challenges of this product class is that it is very expensive, at $10 per watt, compared to 10¢ for standard solar cells, and the manufacturing is relatively slow compared to standard polysilicon solar cells. Also, considering the inevitable future of global solar domination, the material availability is limited.
For instance, the growth time of the quantum well region of the solar cell was 55 minutes, and the total growth time of the total cell was four hours. And while this is not entirely a fair comparison, a standard polysilicon based 250 MW/year manufacturing line seeks to move tens of thousands of solar cells per hour.

The high costs mean that these cells are used primarily in expensive markets. The most common market is space, as the International Space Station uses triple junction cells with over 30% efficiency. Cells of this style have also been used in yet to be released solar powered cars.
Without a doubt, these are among the most efficient solar cells ever designed, as can be seen by the cutout above from the famed NREL Research Cell Record Efficiency Chart. The outlined red box is the current record solar cell efficiency. The class of solar cells located above and to the left of the outlined cell set their records using concentrated sunlight via mirrors, and other techniques.
In previous research, the scientists noted that a theoretical 85% efficiency is possible for an infinite number of junctions at maximum sunlight concentration. However, using a variety of reasonable assumptions, conservative calculations suggest that a 62% solar cell efficiency could be achieved using sunlight that is concentrated 1,000 times.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/23/enphase-energy-microinverter-receives-first-ul-interconnection-certification/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 23, 2022",Enphase Energy microinverter receives first UL interconnection certification,"Enphase Energy announced today that its IQ8 Microinverter system is certified to UL 1741 3rd edition including the Supplement SB, the new interconnection standard for connecting inverters, energy storage, and distributed energy resources (DER) in compliance with IEEE 1547-2018 and IEEE 1547-1 2020.
Enphase was involved in the development of the UL and IEEE standards and was a member of the committees that created the rules. Included in the new standards are requirements for several advanced interconnection functions that will allow the grid to accommodate much higher levels of renewable DERs. One of these is the interoperability function, which standardizes the way utilities communicate with and control DERs such as solar and battery systems.
“Enphase is pleased that our industry-leading IQ8 Microinverter system is the first product in North America to receive this critical certification from UL,” said Raghu Belur, co-founder and chief product officer at Enphase Energy. “Our close partnership with UL has allowed us to quickly reach compliance with all applicable North America safety standards. We selected UL as our global certification partner and our close working relationship with them has been invaluable in this effort. We look forward to further collaboration with UL to expand our innovative product offerings and help transform the grid.”
The Enphase IQ8 microinverter started shipping last December, and what sets it apart is that it can form a microgrid during a power outage, providing backup power even without a battery. The way it works is that the microinverter can limit energy capture to just what the home is consuming, so in the event that the grid suffers a power failure, a proprietary, intelligent chip within the IQ8 will seamlessly switch between on or off grid.
When paired with the IQ Combiner 4/4C and IQ Gateway, the IQ8 forms the first complete residential DER system certified to the new UL standard, which many US states will soon require for interconnecting products.
“We are at the start of a new era in which distributed energy resources, such as solar PV and battery systems, will become a foundational element of the way we think about electricity for our homes, buildings, and tools for utility use,” said Jeff Smidt, senior vice president of Industrial Testing, Inspection and Certification at UL. “With the Enphase IQ8 Microinverter as the first ever distributed energy resources product certified by UL to UL 1741, 3rd edition with the SB Supplement, Enphase has taken a significant step in helping advance the safety and security of reliable, clean, and smart energy available in the home or on the grid.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/23/in-a-big-win-for-solar-arkansas-judge-upholds-full-rate-net-metering-and-denies-a-grid-fee/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,ARKANSAS",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 23, 2022","In a big win for solar, Arkansas judge upholds full rate net-metering and denies a grid fee","In a state that ranked 30th in solar installed in 2021, the recent ruling in favor of net metering could boost Arkansas, “the land of opportunity,” to a new level of sustainability. Recently the Arkansas Court of Appeals ruled in favor of solar power, ending a battle among the Arkansas Public Utilities Commission, solar companies including Scenic Hill Solar, utilities including the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. and Petit Jean Electric Cooperative of Clinton.  The ruling essentially upheld the rate structure for net metering, which previously had stated that solar customers would receive the full retail rate for excess energy they send to the grid. In addition, the ruling simplifies the approval process for small solar systems and to aggregate smaller systems.
The history of this legislation dates back to 2001, when the Arkansas General Assembly enacted the Arkansas Renewable Energy Development Act (AREDA). In the ruling, the found that the increasing consumption of renewable resources “promotes the wise use of Arkansas’s natural-energy resources,” Calling solar an “indigenous energy fuel,” the ruling states that increased solar reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels. The General Assembly further found that “net energy metering encourages the use of renewable energy resources and renewable energy technologies by reducing utility interconnection and administrative costs for small consumers of electricity” and that “net-metering would help to . . . attract energy-technology manufacturers, to provide a foothold for these technologies in the Arkansas economy, and to make it easier for customer access to these technologies.”
The AREDA required the Commission to establish appropriate rates, terms, and conditions for net-metering contracts. The Commission instituted a rate structure directing that net-metering customers would be credited for excess energy at full retail rate.
As in other states, such as California, where utilities object to crediting solar customers the full retail rate, Arkansas utilities alleged that net-metering customers were not paying their share of costs of transmission and distribution. The utilities instead wanted to discontinue 1:1 compensation for net-metering customers and adopt “two-channel billing” in which those customers got a credit for what the utilities call “avoided costs.” Alternatively, the electric utilities argued that net-metering customers could pay their share of maintaining the grid through a monthly grid charge.
The Commission stated that it was approving the continuation of 1:1 full retail credit “for now” as the default net metering structure. It also rejected two-channel billing for residential and nonresidential customers without a demand component. The Commission also found that after December 31, 2022, “a utility may request approval of an alternative [rate structure] that is in the public interest and will not result in an unreasonable allocation of, or increase in, the costs to other utility customers.”
Additionally the Commission found “that there is some evidence of potential cost-shifting”, and while it retained the 1:1 compensation for demand-component facilities generating over 1,000 kW it also added a grid charge that the Commission “initially . . . set at zero.” According to the Commission, “once the Net-Metering Rules become effective, a utility may request approval of a revised grid charge rate based upon evidence that an unreasonable cost shift to non-net-metering customers is occurring or has already occurred on a cumulative basis.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/23/museum-to-spread-solar-energy-savings-to-local-nonprofits/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 23, 2022",Museum to spread solar energy savings to local nonprofits,"Resonant Energy installed a 326 kW solar array above a reconfigured parking lot canopy for the Discovery Museum in Acton, Mass.
The solar canopy project was estimated to cost slightly more than $1 million, while the total 25-year savings is expected to close to $1.3 million. The system is designed to produce 365.89 MWh each year, equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 307 acres of US forests each year.
The array consists of 808 Jinko Solar 405 W PV modules. The Eagle 72HM modules have a 25-year standard output warranty, 20.13% efficiency, and 2.8 W rated power per cell. The modules are warranted to have an output of 83.1% at the end of the 25-year warranty.
Four Solectria PVI 60TL inverters were selected for this project, and Solectria provided monitoring for the system, built-in with the inverter capabilities. The string inverters have integrated arc fault protection, three maximum power point trackers with five inputs each, modbus connectors, remote diagnostics, and are compliant with UL 1741SA.
RBI Solar was the racking manufacturer, which supplied its CP-Truss model racking for the installation.
The array was oversized so that 50% of the power generated will serve all the needs of the museum, and the other 50% will be sold to local nonprofit organizations at a discounted rate. Currently, the Haley House, a soup kitchen in Roxbury, Massachusetts, has signed on for discounted renewable energy, and three more nonprofits will be announced.
The array comes as part of Discovery Museum’s five-year sustainability plan, unanimously approved by its board of directors last June. The plan calls for activities like becoming carbon-neutral, reducing water usage, minimizing waste, and sustainable investment.
“Our move to 100% on-site generated solar electricity is a cornerstone of our action plan to reduce the environmental impact of the Museum’s operations and lead by example to inspire others to take action on behalf of our planet,” said Neil Gordon, CEO. “We hope to set the bar for what museums and other cultural institutions should be looking to do to help combat climate change and educate their communities about planning for sustainable and resilient futures.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/23/ferc-chairman-glick-nominated-for-another-term/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,EMPLOYMENT,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 23, 2022","Renewable energy and storage advocate, Glick, nominated for another FERC term","The longest-tenured chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and current Chairman, Richard Glick, has been nominated by President Joe Biden to serve another term as one of FERC’s five chairs. Originally appointed to the position on November 29, 2017, Glick was named chairman of FERC on January 21, 2021, and his original term was set to expire on June 30, 2022. Assuming Glick’s re-nomination is confirmed by the senate, he will serve another 5-year term until some time in 2027.

News of the nomination has been met with praise across the renewable energy landscape, due in large part to Glick’s commitment to transmission reform and FERC’s recent action to initiate a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reform the Commission’s electric regional transmission planning and cost allocation requirements.
“At a critical moment in our nation’s clean energy transition, when emergence from a pandemic, global conflict, and extreme weather events are all dramatically impacting energy costs and resource availability, Chair Glick has provided steady leadership at FERC,” said Jeff Dennis, Advanced Energy Economy general counsel and managing director. “Chair Glick understands we need to better prepare the transmission grid to deliver the cost-effective advanced energy resources that states and customers are demanding. Glick’s continued leadership at FERC will also position the agency to improve the way distributed energy resources are utilized to power the grid of the future and meet changing customer needs.”
In July 2021, more than two dozen organizations, including the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), sent a letter to FERC Commissioners expressing their support for large-scale transmission reform, which led to an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on regional transmission planning, cost allocation and generator interconnection following later that month. Since that initial point and through FERC’s April 2021 decision, the agency has been working alongside a number of consumer advocate and policy organizations, also including ACORE to finalize some of the energy world’s longest-awaited reforms.
“Richard Glick has been exceptionally effective as Chair of FERC, and we are thrilled to see him renominated,” said Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the ACORE. “He has an in-depth understanding of the regulatory barriers facing the transition to a 21st century grid, and pragmatic approaches to address them. We look forward to continuing to work with him on critical reforms, like FERC’s new rulemaking on transmission, that help move the country forward on our path to a clean energy future.”
The WATT Coalition issued similar praise and reference the ongoing work that Glick is making in transmission planning, work which will be allowed to continue, assuming the senate confirms Glick’s renomination.
“The WATT Coalition congratulates Chairman Glick on his renomination to the Federal Energy Regulatory chairmanship, announced today by President Biden,” said WATT Chair Ted Bloch-Rubin. “Under Chairman Glick’s leadership, FERC has made great strides towards policy to improve the United States’ transmission system planning and operation, in service of just and reasonable rates for Americans. Chairman Glick responded to a letter from House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Chair Kathy Castor and other Members of Congress today about his progress on transmission issues, including Grid Enhancing Technologies – a long list that demonstrates his efficacy as chairman. Our coalition of technology providers, renewable energy developers and transmission providers encourages the Senate to move swiftly to reconfirm him to the position so that this important work can continue.”
