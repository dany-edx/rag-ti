This marks significant growth despite a year of challenges for the industry. This figure includes both large-scale and small-scale generation, as reported by the Energy Information Association (EIA) Electric Power Monthly, which shows updated capacity and generation data through February 2022.
Through the first two months of the year, all solar PV generation reported by EIA combined for 23,862 GWh, up from 17,593 GWh through the first two months of 2021.
As a portion of all electrical generation, all solar PV reported by EIA generated 167,047 GWh on a 12-month rolling basis through February, just under 4% of total generation in the United States. This compares to the 12-month rolling basis a year before, in which solar PV generated 130,511 GWh, a 3.24% share in US electricity generation.
This boost in generation is thanks to the hard work of the US solar industry, which together installed 23.6 GW of capacity in 2021, enough to power the equivalent of 23.3 million American homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Solar accounted for 46% of all new capacity brought online in 2021, marking the third year in a row that PV held the largest share of new capacity additions in the US.
Small-scale generation projects, which are projects less than 1 MW, were estimated to provide 50,301 GWh on a 12-month rolling basis, up 19% from the previous year’s rolling 12-month generation of 42,257 GWh. This level of generation means that small-scale solar projects have now eclipsed 1% of total generation throughout the year at 1.2%.
In a previous look at EIA figures, pv magazine reviewed differences between “renewable” and “sustainable” energy. Johns Hopkins University describes renewable energy as something that comes from sources that naturally renew themselves to meet our energy needs. This can include such technologies as biomass, hydropower, etc. “Sustainable” energy is defined as energy that can support both the current generation as well as future generations. John Hopkins considers solar and wind as primary sources of sustainable energy.
Sustainable electricity generation (all solar PV and wind) started 2022 strong, growing by greater than 33% through two months versus the prior year.
Solar and wind generation totaled 616,149 GWh on a 12-month rolling basis. Year-to-date through the available February data, solar and wind have combined for 107,164 GWh, a 15% share in the US electricity supply thus far in 2022. Last year, sustainable electricity held an 11.8% share through the first two months of 2021.
We are eager to analyze the figures for this spring, where demand lowers and solar production ramps up, and it will be interesting to see the PV total share of electric generation, with CO2 free generation (including nuclear and hydropower) possibly reaching 50%. Emissions-free generation peaked in May of 2020 and then March of 2021, contributing 46.5% and 45.8%, respectively.
Dips in nuclear and hydropower contribution, which are expected to continue, contributed to a smaller share of electricity generation being emissions free in 2021 vs. 2020, suggesting that solar PV and wind will need to deploy even more rapidly to carry the torch for climate friendly energy generation.
Recently, California celebrated a milestone where 101% of real-time demand was matched with renewable energy generation for about fifteen minutes on a sunny Saturday afternoon. While there were still other sources of energy powering the grid at the time, including natural gas and nuclear power, the milestone was a glimpse into the future of the renewably powered economy the state has mandated.
“Twenty years ago no one thought we could get to 100% renewable energy. But bit by bit, bill by bill, and solar panel by solar panel we did it,” said Dan Jacobson, senior advisor to Environment California.
Based on the EIA short term outlook for deployment, 2023 may be the year solar PV capacity surpasses wind.
EIA reports a net capacity of 95 GW of solar and 133 GW of wind as of February 2022. Through 2023, EIA expects 10 GW of small-scale solar with 44 GW of utility-scale solar, and 14 GW of wind. This means by year’s end 2023, solar would reach 149 GW installed capacity, and wind would achieve 147 GW.
However, capacity doesn’t tell the whole story. Capacity factor, or how often the plant is actually generating versus its total theoretical capacity, is significantly higher with wind energy than with solar PV.
In 2021, wind capacity factor averaged 34.6% while for solar PV it was an average of 24.6%. Adjusted for capacity factor, solar would still be about 37% behind wind energy’s contribution at the end of 2023. This is a step ahead of today’s generation numbers, where solar currently provided about 58% less electricity than wind on a rolling 12- month basis.
Additionally, renewable energy, including solar, wind, biomass, hydropower, etc., has left nuclear generation in the dust, providing 23% more output over this period, and is widening the gap above coal generation, now providing 2.9% more power. Coal is a rapidly declining energy source, and FERC queues suggest it will continue to fall from about 18% of capacity today to about 15% by 2025.
Solar and wind will have a lot of work to do over the next decade to make up for retired fossil fuels and to support increasing demand. Electrification of buildings, especially heating and cooling systems, and of transportation from the EV revolution will further drive demand. In the next installment of EIA data breakdown, pv magazine will explore the decline of hydropower and nuclear power generation, and how more sustainable energy generation will need to take its place.

According to the company, NJR will use an innovative floating racking system to install 16,510 solar panels on a reservoir located at the New Jersey American Water Canoe Brook Water Treatment Plant. The clean power generated by the array will provide approximately 95% of the facility’s annual power needs through a power purchase agreement with NJR. The installation has been dubbed the Canoe Brook project and was developed by Solar Renewable Energy LLC, with RETTEW providing engineering, procurement and construction services. NJR acquired the fully permitted and approved project in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. With construction underway, the installation is expected to be fully operational in the fall of 2022.
In addition to generating renewable electricity, the floatovoltaics installation will help to slow evaporation on the reservoir and limit the growth of algae.
“Floating solar technology creates new opportunities for bodies of water to be a home for large-scale renewable energy generation and bring the benefits of clean energy to even more customers,” said Steve Westhoven, president and CEO of New Jersey Resources. “As a leader in New Jersey’s solar marketplace, we look forward to working with New Jersey American Water to support their power needs and advance the state’s clean energy and climate goals.”
The Canoe Brook project is set to be NJR’s second floating solar installation in New Jersey, as well as the second to claim the throne of largest floating solar project in the US. The first was the 4.4. MW floating array in Sayreville, New Jersey. The project, which you can watch a super nifty YouTube video on below, came about in response to a 2015 request for proposals by the city for a solar installation under a power purchase agreement (PPA) to offset power use at a water treatment facility, as well as a handful of other government facilities.
The current claimant to the largest floating solar crown is White Pine Renewables’  4.8 MW Healdsburg Floating Solar Project, which was installed on ponds at the City of Healdsburg’s wastewater treatment plant. It  will deliver energy to the city under under a 25-year power purchase agreement. The solar-generated electricity will cover around 8% of the city’s total energy demand, moving it toward a goal of 60% renewable energy usage before 2030.
Noria Energy co-developed the project with White Pine and provided installation services. The behind-the-meter project’s entire installation, from procurement to commissioning, was completed in less than six months.
Bonus points, this project also has a nifty YouTube overview:
Floating solar has been pegged by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL) as a “rapidly emerging technology.” A report outlined the technology’s potential to produce just under 10% of current electricity generation.
The technology also offers generally higher energy production, due to the cooling effects of water and wind. Even so, the floating solar has not reached widespread adoption, due in part to higher overall costs than traditional PV plants.

This is the first of the dwellings being built under ‘Project TexFlex’. PearlX awarded an EPC contract to Austin-based Native Solar to design and construct Project TexFlex.
The 640 square foot unit, which will be owned by the Houston affordable housing non-profit Avenue CDC, will source its power from rooftop solar PV modules, donated by Freedom Solar, and a contiguous SolarEdge Energy Hub inverter, and Energy Bank battery donated by PearlX.
The style of the dwelling is that of a traditional Texan Dogtrot home, which is a single-floor home made up of two units on either side of an open breezeway in the middle. The advantage from a sustainability point of view is that one side houses the bedrooms and the other side the cooking facilities, so—in theory—each side would be powered only when in use.
PearlX will be asset managing the project with its proprietary management software, PearlX Flex, and will be integrating the installation with a virtual power plant currently being developed at the multifamily community 2410 Waugh in Montrose, Houston. This will allow the physically detached installations to operate as one synchronized virtual power plant (VPP), delivering excess generated power to the grid. Using the SolarEdge Energy Hub inverter and Energy Bank battery, energy storage will be both a grid asset and community storage asset
“Developments in software are providing the grid with much needed control to optimize the use of solar for different communities. This is making solar power more available and flexible, so that even renters can benefit from renewable energy,” said Peter Mathews, SolarEdge General Manager, North America.
Founded in 2019, PearlX is a veteran-led company whose mission is to deliver the benefits of distributed generation to the multifamily sector.  PearlX will purchase hardware and cloud-based grid services technology from SolarEdge, while SolarEdge will provide design and engineering support. PearlX uses an underwriting method that allows tenant subscribers to access the rewards of solar generation and battery storage without being required to demonstrate an industry-defined adequate credit score.
This is the first net-positive energy project for the Rice University students of architecture. The energy performance data will be made available to Professor Dan Cohan’s class “Energy and the Environment” for students to learn from operating, smart distributed generation projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/03/22-senators-call-on-biden-to-end-anti-circumvention-investigation/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WASHINGTON, D.C.",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 3, 2022",22 Senators call on Biden to end anti-circumvention investigation,"22 US Senators have composed a letter, sent to President Biden, urging the president to review ongoing Department of Commerce (DOC) investigation into solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam “swiftly” and make an expedited preliminary decision, one that they hope will consider “the significant policy ramifications on American businesses, workers, and ratepayers.”
The letter references the data points first put forward by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and research firm Wood Mackenzie, specifically the expectations that a prolonged investigation with a preliminary decision to institute tariffs would mean the loss of 16 GW of planned solar projects, 100,000 jobs lost across the industry at large, and 18,000 jobs lost in manufacturing alone.
Signers of the letter include Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Tim Kaine (D-VA) showing that, as was the case with the net metering flight in Florida, the fight for a clean energy future can be a bipartisan one.
The bipartisanship of the letter was noted by George Hershman, the CEO of SOLV Energy, who issued a statement in response:
Nearly two dozen Senators from both sides of the aisle agree that it’s time to end the meritless investigation that has frozen our renewable energy progress. Tens of thousands of jobs and President Biden’s climate goals are on the line. Instead of tariffs, we need clean energy tax credits that will grow American manufacturing and solar deployment.
Just a few days before the release of this letter, California Governor Gavin Newsome sent a letter to DOC Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, laying out the devastating impact the investigation will have on California’s development market and ability to reach its climate goals. In the letter, Newsom asked the DOC to “resolve this issue as soon as possible and restore certainty in the market.”
Senator Rosen has been particularly active in urging DOC to end the investigation and reject Auxin Solar’s petition. Rosen was also at the helm of last year’s fight for the DOC to reject a series of anonymously filed petitions seeking a Commerce Department investigation into its allegations that module imports from the three countries represented an attempt by the companies to skirt existing US rules against dumping, with these petitions ultimately being thrown out. The thrown out petitions were nearly identical to this year’s Auxin petition, except they focused on specific companies, rather than the countries at large.
Yet, as successful as Rosen has been in the past, the DOC seems determined to see this current case through.
A letter that Secretary Raimondo sent just a few days ago to 14 legislators, including Senator Jacky Rosen (NV), offers the DOC’s perspective as to why the investigation can’t be dropped like a hot and highly unpopular potato.
The letter starts off by addressing one of the biggest criticisms of the investigation: that it is oxymoronic for an administration that used renewable energy expansion as one of its key platforms to then pursue an investigation that would essentially halt those same expansion efforts.
First, let me assure you that the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to addressing climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. We stand ready to work with you and Congress to advance legislation that would provide incentives to bolster renewable energy. In addition, the Department of Commerce stands ready to work with Congress to diversify our supply chains and develop greater domestic solar manufacturing capacity here at home.
After some case background, Raimondo identically assures each of the 14 legislators that “like all trade remedy proceedings, Commerce will conduct these circumvention inquiries in a fair and transparent manner, and in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations.” As Raimondo puts it, the DOC is required by statute to investigate a claim that companies operating in other countries in the region are trying to circumvent existing duties. in other words, the DOC is merely doing its job.
Last week, SEIA released updated data anticipating that the case will result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021. By 2025, imposition of tariffs will cause solar capacity to fall 75 GW short of the pace needed to reach the president’s goal, equal to the size of the entire US solar market prior to 2020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/03/solar-and-energy-developer-origis-energy-closes-375-million-credit-facility/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 3, 2022",Solar and energy storage developer Origis Energy closes $375 million credit facility,"Origis Energy, a Miami, Florida-based developer of renewable energy projects announced the closing of a bundled $375 million credit facility that included both a letter of credit and equipment financing. The funds are expected to support the developer’s growing pipeline of solar and energy storage projects.
Origis has a large development platform, with a 20+ GW pipeline of utility-scale and distributed projects. The company builds solar, solar-plus-storage, and standalone energy storage projects. It has a history of working with investor owned utilities, community choice aggregators, municipal electric providers, cooperatives, and large corporate buyers.
The credit facility was oversubscribed, suggesting a positive long-term assessment by numerous financial backers. This round of funding was led by CIT, a division of First Citizens Bank, along with Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Nomura, Rabobank, and Santander. Latham and Watkins represented Origis Energy in the transaction and Norton Rose Fulbright acted as lender counsel.
“As structuring bank, CIT demonstrated persistent leadership, bringing together a leading roster of financial partners,” said Jamie Edwards, managing director of finance and accounting for Origis.
Origis has developed 170 projects worldwide totaling more than 4 GW of solar and energy storage capacity. The company performs financing, engineering, procurement, and construction, operations, maintenance and asset management across the United States.
“As one of the most active renewable energy developers in the country, Origis was uniquely suited for financing of this type,” said Mike Lorusso, managing director CIT’s power and energy unit.
Antin Infrastructure firms, a leading global infrastructure investment firm, acquired majority stake in the developer late last year.
Origis Energy has been active in procuring PV modules in recent months, aiming for a steady supply to support its pipeline. Module supply has tightened considerably this year for utility-scale developers due to the antidumping investigation on four Southeastern Asian countries that supply 80% of US polysilicon-based solar panels.
Earlier in April, the company announced a 750 MW supply deal with US-based manufacturer First Solar. The deal was an “agile contracting” approach, meaning Origis will benefit from any technological advances made to the cadmium telluride  thin-film module maker’s products.
In March, Origis booked a 400 MW module supply deal with Maxeon for high-efficiency bifacial modules. The deliveries are expected to take place in June 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/03/top-ten-hybrid-solar-and-storage-plant-observations/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 3, 2022",Top ten hybrid solar and storage plant observations,"The Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has released a top ten list of observations on co-located wind or solar plus energy storage (hybrid), with each of the unique ideas referencing a research paper developed by the group.
LBNL is covering this topic primarily due to the recent increases in deployment, and interest in these hybrid facilities. Assuming that future project queues can be used to predict the number of actual hybrid power projects that will get built, then let it be known that hybrid systems already make up 42% of the United State’s future potential 675 GW of solar generation capacity. California’s solar queue, for all intents and purposes, is a solar-plus-storage queue, with its 95% coupling rate.

As of the end of 2021, 5.9 GW of solar was coupled with energy storage, along with 750 MW of wind-plus-solar-plus-storage. LBNL noted the exponential growth of this type of capacity, which is up 133% since the end of 2020.
The fundamental reason that solar-plus-storage works is that the price of batteries has come down to a point where it now makes financial sense. Battery pricing has declined by roughly 25%, from $40 to $95/MWh-PV in 2017, to $30 to $75/MWh PV in 2021.

Second, and more importantly, LBNL modeled the revenues versus the costs of adding batteries to solar. They found that the value gained by adding energy storage to solar and wind exceeds the costs. 
Taking into account the battery inverter versus solar plant inverter size, LBNL found that adding four hours of energy storage to a power purchase agreement (PPA) increased the price of that agreement pretty linearly. Considering the most popular ratio of solar vs battery inverter capacities — 1 MW solar to 0.5 MW batteries providing four hours of storage — the addition of energy storage increases PPAs by 1¢/kWh.

LBNL says that when modeling various markets across the United States, this penny adder is mostly covered as revenue increases from 0.8 to 2.2¢/kWh when adding energy storage to the mix.
However, LBNL also sees that there are financial penalties associated with the current techniques of coupling solar with energy storage. For instance, if the solar power is fully utilizing the site’s interconnection at any point — the batteries cannot. Also, if the batteries must fully charge from the onsite solar to meet incentive requirements, that can be a penalty for hybrid systems, resulting in a slightly less financially efficient system.

In terms of financial incentives, the Federal Investment Tax Credit seems to be motivating hybridization. Without this incentive, it is hypothesized that there would be more standalone energy storage.
Since California dominates the volumes of hybrid solar plants in the queues, it also heavily influences the averages. Leaving California’s 4-hour heavy market (which is at least partially driven by an evening peak period that lasts 4 to 5 hours), the researchers found that California’s batteries tend to have shorter durations in most other markets.

 
The chart above models the value of energy being delivered by hybrid systems as more battery duration – from two to eight hours – is added to a facility in various power grid regions around the nation.
There is still a lot of learning going on with these technologies.
For instance, a 100 MW solar farm plus a 50 MW battery does not equal a 150 MW power plant in terms of capability. Having an intermittent, highly predictable solar generation resource, coupled with an instantly dispatchable multi-talented re-generation battery resource means that sometimes interconnection must be shared — and it’s usually the battery that takes a backseat to the solar facility during generation periods.
This is the hybrid penalization referenced earlier.

Asset owners and markets are still learning how to maximize the utilization of these resources.
The document notes that the ancillary service markets provide valuable revenue streams to this young battery market, but that this service market quickly sells out. These large scale markets of ISOs — where wholesale electricity rates and ancillary services exist — are not where most batteries are earning their revenue these days.
LBNL notes that as of the end of 2020, most operating hybrids earned revenue via incentive programs or capacity & transmission demand charge markets, instead of wholesale market price signals.
For instance, a battery used for peak shaving behind the meter at a business, or to maximize onsite solar utilization, does little for the broader wholesale market — although they do offer some general peak demand reduction. A battery at a home only running during power outages offers far less than a peak shaving solution; however, some VPPs are beginning to step into this space to monetize these underutilized resources.

We’re also observing a separation of attachment rates, as residential solar-plus-storage is growing faster than small business, commercial, and industrial. LBNL has also observed that residential energy storage solutions are getting larger.
This split — where residential storage is surpassing commercial and industrial storage — is mirrored by residential solar as well, as it outpaces business, commercial, and industrial solar in terms of capacity deployed annually.

The California-based company, which also manufactures batteries, posted revenue of $441 million in the January-March window, up 7% from the $413 million recorded in the final quarter of 2021. It said it expects $490 million to $520 million worth of business in the current trading period.
Those numbers translated into net income of $51.8 million, down from $52.6 million in the previous quarter, with no obvious explanation offered in the first-quarter update published on the Enphase website. However, the company did add that its own, non-generally accepted accounting principle figure would have been $110 million, helped along by the inclusion of $47.8 million of stock-based compensation.
Enphase said it expects shift 130 MW to 140 MW of its IQ Batteries in the current quarter. It shipped around 2.84 million of its microinverters in the January-March period – down 6% on the previous quarter – for a total capacity of 1,029 MWdc, plus 120 MW worth of  IQ Batteries.
The company expects operating expenses in the current three-month period to rise to $128 million to $131 million because of a share incentive scheme and acquisition costs, which it expects will amount to $57 million.
A slashing in net interest costs for Enphase, from $12.7 million at the end of 2021 to $2.74 million at the end of March, helped the company’s cash balance rise from $119 million to $252 million over the same period. At the same time, its non-current debts rose from $952 million to $1.2 billion, with the manufacturer having acquired business leads company SolarLeadFactory LLC in March.

The company has enlisted the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) as a development partner, which will pay a foundational commitment of $10,000 per month for up to 18 months to help with construction of the solar farm at a location to be determined in Baltimore City.
WeSolar was founded on Juneteenth 2020 by Kristal Hansley, who, after a career in government learning how solar could reduce the cost of electricity for households, decided to get involved with community solar. She began at Neighborhood Sun, a regional solar company in Maryland, where she worked with solar developers and Baltimore City leadership to help thousands of low- to moderate-income residents save on their utility bills.
“The Community Solar model directly challenges the hundred-year-old monopoly where utility companies dominated the energy industry,” said Hansley. “Our company’s mission is about equity.”
The Baltimore City solar farm is expected to generate 8 MW of energy, of which UMMS has committed to purchasing up to 50%. The rest will be available to UMMS team members who earn less than $67,000 and are connected to the Baltimore Gas & Electric grid. These residents will receive a discount of up to 25%.
“Not only does this project make good business and economic sense for our System, but it is also an opportunity to demonstrate our responsibility as anchor institutions in the communities in which we are privileged to serve,” said Mohan Suntha, MD, MBA, President and CEO of UMMS.
This is the second solar energy-related project for the medical center. UMMS currently receives about 2% of its electricity from a 25-acre solar farm on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. In 2013, UMMS entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Bithenergy and Constellation on the 3.66-MW solar generation project in Somerset County, Maryland.
