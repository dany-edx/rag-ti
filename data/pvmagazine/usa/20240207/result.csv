2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/07/utah-bill-proposes-rooftop-solar-net-metering-rate-protection/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UTAH",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-07,Utah bill proposes rooftop solar net metering rate protection,"Rooftop solar has historically been supported by net metering regulations across the United States. The process involves customers exporting excess electricity generation to the grid, receiving a credit on their bill for exporting local clean energy to their neighbors.
In Utah, legislators have introduced SB189, which would raise the rate paid under net metering and build consumer protection into future rates. Utility Rocky Mountain Power currently charges about $0.10 per kWh and credits its customers half as much, about $0.05 per kWh for exported rooftop solar generation.
The new policy would require utilities to credit solar owners at least 84% of the cost-per-kilowatt.
“This bill is about providing Utahns with the energy choice they deserve at a fair price,” said Josh Craft, the government and corporate relations manager for Utah Clean Energy.
Historically, Utah has updated its net metering rates on an annual basis. This creates complexity and confusion in the market and makes it difficult for homeowners to make the decision to move forward with a rooftop solar array. Legislators say the new law will help simplify the process and make it easier and more financially attractive to go solar.
The 84% compensation rate seeks to strike a balance between utilities and rooftop solar customers in their territory. The utility incurs some costs by maintaining and repairing a local distribution grid to transmit rooftop solar, so the 16% it shaves off the retail value of exported solar helps maintain those costs.
 “By updating rooftop solar policies, we can ensure that clean energy remains an accessible option for all residents,” said Craft in an interview with KSL News Radio.
California anti-corruption
The bill proposed in Utah bucks a nationwide trend of anti-rooftop solar regulatory moves by electric utilities.
Net metering has come under attack in several states, most notably in California, which represented about 50% of the nation’s rooftop solar market before enacting Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0. Post-NEM 3.0, California’s rooftop solar installations have dropped as much as 80%, with tens of thousands of employees being laid off and numerous companies announcing bankruptcy.
The sharply rising electricity rates in California coupled with a track record of anti-consumer regulations has led legislators in California to introduce laws aimed at weeding out potential corruption within the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Assembly Bill 2054 imposes a 10-year cooling-off period under which commissioners cannot take a high-paying position with a utility company after serving.
“It is crucial to safeguard against potential conflicts of interest and undue industry influence on regulatory bodies,” said Assemblymember Bauer Kahan (D, Orinda).

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/07/super-bowl-to-be-hosted-in-first-100-renewable-energy-nfl-stadium/,"EVENTS,SUSTAINABILITY,NEVADA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-07,Super Bowl to be hosted in first 100% renewable energy NFL stadium,"Super Bowl LVIII will pit the Kansas City Chiefs against the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, February 11. This will be the first Super Bowl that takes place in Allegiant Stadium, home of the Raiders, which is 100% powered by renewable energy.
A 100% renewable sports stadium is no easy feat. During a game, an NFL sports stadium can use as much as 10 MW of power for five hours, or 50 MWh. Electric utility NV Energy told a CBS reporter that 10 MW is roughly the equivalent consumption of 46,000 homes.
Allegiant Stadium is taking an all-kinds approach to its sustainability and renewable energy goals. Solar energy is the dominant renewable energy source for the Las Vegas Raiders stadium, whose organization in 2019 entered a 25-year energy supply agreement with NV Energy to purchase generation from an off-site solar array managed by the utility.
The stadium subscribes to a portion of a massive 621,000 solar panel system that also has supply contracts with some of the resorts on the Las Vegas strip.

The solar supply deal took a two-stage approach in which the facility purchases power from the wholesale market, with excess capacity purchased from NV Energy’s current fleet of power plants. Beginning in the second half of 2023, new off-site renewable energy and energy storage facilities will reach commercial operations, and the stadium will source power from these new sites.
The $1.9 billion state-of-the-art stadium has taken many other measures for energy efficiency and emissions reduction. The building is LEED Gold certified, and additionally sources electricity from hydroelectric dams, geothermal energy and wind power.
Other Raiders and Allegiant Stadium sustainability measures include:
“It has been and will continue to be our mission to develop and improve sustainable policies that reduce our environmental footprint while bringing world-class concerts, sporting events, and corporate events to Las Vegas,” said Chris Wright, general manager, Allegiant Stadium.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/07/rfp-alert-doe-to-provide-1-2-billion-for-transmission-buildout/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-07,RFP alert: DOE to provide $1.2 billion for transmission buildout,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced a request for proposals (RFP) for the second round of the Transmission Facilitation Program.
The DOE plans to deploy up to $1.2 billion to accelerate transmission buildout through capacity contracts. The goal is to help unlock billions of dollars of state and private sector capital to build projects to modernize the power grid and increase its reliability.
DOE’s National Transmission Needs Study, released October 30, 2023, estimates that the U.S. must more than double existing regional transmission capacity by 2035 and expand existing interregional transmission capacity by more than fivefold to maintain reliability, improve resilience to extreme weather and other disruptive events, relieve congestion, and provide access to low-cost clean energy. In addition, the study found that 54,500 GW-miles of within-region transmission must be added for a clean grid under “the most likely power sector future.” Interregional transfer capacities to transmit electricity between regions would also need to increase by nearly 125 GW, the study said.
“There’s no way around it: to realize the full benefit of the nation’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, we need to more than double our grid capacity,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic clean energy legislation is helping modernize the nation’s transmission to deliver reliable, more affordable energy to every American community in turn driving down costs for American families and generating good paying jobs for American workers.”
The RFP will use capacity contracts to commit DOE to purchase up to 50% of the maximum capacity of a transmission line. Transmission infrastructure financing relies on demonstrating to potential investors that the line has committed customers; however, customers often can’t commit until they are sure a project will be developed and available when needed. To increase the confidence of investors and potential customers, the capacity contract establishes the agency as an anchor customer who can provide certainty and reduce the risk of project developers under-sizing needed transmission capacity projects. DOE will sell its capacity rights in these projects to other customers to recover its costs.
The RFP builds on the first solicitation issued in 2022. DOE announced it entered into the first round of capacity contract negotiations in October 2023 for up to a total of $1.3 billion with three transmission lines crossing six states that will add 3.5 GW of additional grid capacity throughout the U.S., equivalent to powering approximately 3 million homes, and creating more than 13,000 direct and indirect jobs. The selected projects include the Cross-Tie 500kV Transmission Line in Nevada and Utah, Southline Transmission Project in Arizona and New Mexico, and Twin States Clean Energy Link in New Hampshire and Vermont.
A public webinar will be held at 3 p.m. Eastern on February 21, 2024. The Grid and Transmission Programs Conductor provides more information on programs administered by DOE, as well as questions concerning the ability to pair different funding opportunities offered across the Department.
DOE’s Grid Deployment Office expects to release a separate RFP focused on public-private partnerships to build transmission infrastructure that connects isolated microgrids to the grid in Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/07/battery-storage-plus-hydrogen-can-enable-a-reliable-cheap-clean-energy-transition/,"HYDROGEN,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-02-07,"Battery storage plus hydrogen can enable a reliable, cheap clean energy transition","A combination of battery storage and hydrogen fuel cells can help the U.S., as well as most countries, transition to a 100% clean electricity grid in a low cost and reliable fashion, according to a new report from Stanford University.
The report, published in iScience, took a closer look at the costs involved with ensuring a reliable grid in 145 countries, that used renewable energy – including solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal resources – to power their grids, transportation, buildings, industry, agriculture, forestry, fishing and the military. The main energy storage options it took into account included hydropower, batteries and green hydrogen, which is produced using renewables. 
The study found that transitioning to clean energy could enable these countries to achieve overall annual energy cost reductions of around 61%. 
“The first step is to electrify all energy sectors as much as possible… the efficiency of electricity over combustion reduces energy demand by 38.0%,” when averaged over 145 countries, Mark Z. Jacobson, the author of the study and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, told pv magazine USA. 
The second step is to provide the electricity with just wind-water-solar sources and storage, and eliminating energy to mine, transport, and refine fossil fuels and uranium saves another 11.3% of all energy worldwide, he added. End-use energy efficiency improvements beyond business-as-usual reduce energy requirements another 6.6%, and a forecasted reduction in the cost per unit of energy of about 9% results in an overall annual cost savings to a country of 61%. 
The study will help electricity system planners create a more efficient and cost-effective future energy system based on clean, renewable electricity, Jacobson said.
“The results provide countries with concrete evidence and the confidence that 100% clean, renewable grids not only lower costs but are also just as reliable as the current grid system,” he added. 
The study employed three kinds of computer modeling: a “three-dimensional global weather-climate-air pollution model, a spreadsheet model and a model that matches electricity, heat, cold, and hydrogen demand with supply, storage and demand response assuming perfect grid interconnection,” according to a statement. 
It found that while existing hydropower and batteries can ensure grid reliability, adding green hydrogen to the system can reduce the energy costs in some regions, although a combination of hydropower and green hydrogen with no batteries is always more expensive than a combination of the three. This is because every region with a highly renewable grid will need short-term bursts of power, such as that provided by hydropower or batteries, but not every region necessarily needs the long-term energy storage provided by hydrogen.
Green hydrogen storage can absorb excess electricity when there is too much wind or solar on the grid, and then provide storage on scales of hours to a few days, when wind and solar are not available and hydropower and batteries are depleted, Jacobson said. 
But the technology still faces challenges; like any storage type, up-front cost is always an issue, although the cost benefits are large in comparison, he added. Policy makers can help address these challenges by focusing funding on solutions like battery storage and green hydrogen, rather than on carbon capture, direct air capture, blue hydrogen, non-hydrogen electro-fuels, small nuclear reactors, and bioenergy, Jacobson said.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/07/nextracker-makes-its-mark-in-distributed-energy-generation/,"MARKETING,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-07,Nextracker makes its mark in distributed energy generation,"Nextracker, known for its solar technology tracker solutions used in large utility-scale solar projects, announced 600 projects delivered in its distributed generation (DG) portfolio. The company also announced the signing of two new agreements in the DG space.
The agreements are with channel partners RP Construction Services and Vergo who are trained to resell the company’s flagship NX Horizon solar tracker to help scale Nextracker’s DG sales to the commercial and industrial segment.
“Distributed generation technology plays a key role in solving energy grid infrastructure challenges to meet rising global demand for clean energy,” said Dan Shugar, Nextracker founder and CEO.“ We are appreciative to be working with leading channel partners, RPCS and Vergo. Together we are supporting DG customers with design, inventory, logistics, construction management, commissioning, and service support.”
DG resources with ground mount solar tracker systems are typically up to 30 MW each in capacity. When paired with batteries they can form microgrids that are connected to the distribution grid but can also disconnect to form its own system when needed.
An example of such a tracker-based microgrid is California National Guard’s Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) in Los Alamitos, which provides critical support during events such as wildfires and earthquakes. The installation includes 31 MW of solar, 40 MWh of battery energy storage and 3 MW of backup generators. During every day operation, the power generated goes to the grid. But when the grid is down, the microgrid can disconnect from the grid and “island,” so that the electricity generated by the microgrid serves the training base’s operations.
Nextracker reports that its NX Horizon’s smart solar trackers are well-suited for both utility-scale and DG solar projects and that it has 90 GW of smart solar trackers operational or under fulfillment around the world. The NX Horizon platform allows EPCs to conform to sites with irregular and rolling terrain layouts, the company says.
“The combination of Nextracker’s technology performance advantages, proven total project cost savings, and ability to be deployed just about anywhere including challenging project sites on tight schedules is a big win for us and our DG customers,” said Eb Russell, CEO RPCS.
In January, Nextracker completed its spin-off from Flex, becoming its own entity. Founded in 2013, Nextracker was acquired in 2015 by Flex for $330 million, and it has become a leader in the U.S. solar tracker market with its integrated solar tracker and software solutions used in utility-scale and distributed generation solar power plants around the world.
The company achieved a record third quarter 2023, with quarterly revenue reaching $710 million, but 38% year-over-year. It raised its guidance for fiscal year 2024 to between $2.425 billion and $2.475 billion, up from previous estimate of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion.
