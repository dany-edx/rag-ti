Backing the project is the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NYSERDA), which, through its Environmental Research Program provided a $198,000 research grant. NYSERDA is joined in supporting the work by the New England Division of American Farmland Trust and Juniper Economic Consulting.

The study will collect data from solar installation sites co-located with beekeepers and/or grazing herds, as well as conventional, stand-alone operations for comparison. Lexie Hain, executive director of the American Solar Grazing Association, said that they researchers are looking for most sites to be grazed.
Data will be collected during the 2022 and 2023 grazing seasons. The study will aim to address questions regarding the quality and profitability of farm products from solar sites, trends in soil health on agriculturally managed solar sites, and the benefits to farmers of working with the solar industry.
The full list of solar sites to be studied has not yet been finalized, but a number of sites owned and operated by Nexamp, a leading developer of community solar in New York State, will be included. Two sites will be grazed with sheep owned by a family-owned grazing operation in Orleans, New York.
Nexamp is looking to quadruple the number of solar sites being grazed in the 2021 season. The company said that sheep are less likely to cause damage to photovoltaic equipment than traditional vegetation management, like weed whackers and lawn mowers.
The American Solar Grazing Association is still looking for solar participants in the study, however, and will be accepting applications here until the end of August.
Beekeeper Mike Kiernan of Vermont-based Bee The Change will also take part in the study. Kiernen said he sees solar sites as vital habitat for honey bees, as well as the hundreds of species of native bees, butterflies, and wasps that collectively transform blossoms into vegetables and field crops.
And while the project is funded by NYSERDA and is largely confined to New York and adjacent states, Hain said that the findings should be useful to farmers and solar developers across the country.
“Regardless of where the site is, we’ll have that data that says ‘Is the site in good shape after the first or second year of grazing?’ ‘How many incidents of broken panels do you have?’ ‘How much erosion is onsite?'” Hain said.
The work builds on a 2018 pilot study by Cornell University, called Grazing Sheep on Solar Sites in New York State: Opportunities and Challenges. The study was preliminary in nature and the solar industry has undergone significant change since 2018, but the basics still hold true: sheep can provide vegetation management for solar farms, the vegetation that the sheep ingest is healthy for them, and economic opportunity exists for farmers who want to develop additional revenue streams.
As Hain describes it, the newly launched study aims to evolve the idea from a niche business opportunity to a legitimate industry adjacent to solar. Researchers know that sheep can be symbiotic to solar installations; now they want to grow the scale of that relationship and develop diverse, credible testimony both from solar project owners and the grazers and beekeepers involved.

The assessment projects the energy grid will have more capacity to meet demand in 2021 than it did in 2020. The ISO said this is a “critical element for averting rotating power outages,” such as those that occurred last August.
CAISO said the additional capacity is the result of state-ordered resource procurement. And a series of market redesigns and policy changes in the CAISO’s system since September 2020, along with what it said are improved communication and coordination protocols, has improved overall preparedness for this summer.

However, if a repeat of last summer’s heat events occurs, then the CAISO warned that imported energy from other states “could be limited.” It said the power grid could be “at risk of supply shortages and possible emergency conditions.”
This year’s outlook includes roughly 2,000 MW of additional resources coming online to serve CAISO net peak demand compared to this time last year. Resources include battery storage that CAISO said is expected to absorb excess renewable energy in the middle of the day, and inject it back into the grid after sunset when solar generation goes offline.
The state and CAISO are continuing to pursue an additional 1,000 MW to 1,500 MW of new resources to the system by summer.
CAISO said that the state’s hydroelectric energy supplies will also be “significantly lower” than normal, with the state experiencing a second consecutive year of below-normal precipitation. Snowpack water content peaked at 60% of normal, similar to last year’s conditions, and reservoir levels have dropped to 70% of normal.

CAISO said that conservation will be “pivotal to cushioning the grid when it needs it the most,” typically during hot summer evenings when demand remains high for air conditioning use and solar production is going offline. In coordination with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the CAISO will issue voluntary calls to consumers to cut down on electricity use from 4 – 9 p.m. when system conditions are forecast to be tight.
In March, the CPUC directed investor-owned utilities to procure additional resources. In particular, it ordered utilities to procure a minimum of an additional 2.5% of resources for all customers in their territories, representing an effective increase of the planning reserve margin from the existing 15% to 17.5%.
Regulators also ordered the utilities to pilot an Emergency Load Reduction Program to give demand response providers and other companies providing new services to manage electricity demand, the ability to demonstrate how their innovative programs can support the grid.
For its part, the ISO in March implemented a number of market reforms that are designed to:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/12/interconnection-is-broken-radical-rethinking-is-needed-to-achieve-clean-energy-goals/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 12, 2021",Interconnection is broken: Radical rethinking is needed to achieve clean energy goals,"Significant progress has been made to decarbonize U.S. electricity, largely driven by impressive renewable energy growth. But one critical issue, left unaddressed, will almost certainly derail ambitious climate and clean energy goals: interconnection.
Interconnection policies determine how efficiently distributed energy resources (DERs), like solar and energy storage, can connect to the electric grid. The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) has participated in state-level regulatory processes to reform interconnection policies for DERs for over a decade, in over 35 states.
In that time, we’ve come to realize that without a radical rethinking of interconnection policies, it is highly unlikely that the U.S. will be able to deploy DERs at the speed and scale needed to meet bold climate goals.
Historically, there have typically been two or three state interconnection dockets active in a given year. Today, we are seeing a flood of interconnection dockets across the country, showing how this issue is already coming to a head.
Some states are opening interconnection dockets proactively, realizing reform will be needed to meet clean energy targets. For many others, it’s because the failures of current interconnection policies are becoming apparent as DER deployment grows.
Interconnection policies that were developed at a time of lower DER penetrations are failing in a number of areas, including interconnection timelines; compatibility with energy storage; distribution of grid upgrade costs; and lack of data accessibility.
Interconnection processes are often slow and cumbersome, and timeline accountability is hard to come by. When an excess of complaints about interconnection delays led Minnesota regulators to fine Xcel Energy $1 million in January, it was a rare victory for solar customers and project developers.
Beyond the need for accountability to reasonable timelines, interconnection policies need to move away from project-by-project approval toward a more streamlined approach. California is one state exploring expedited screening for certain types of projects.
Another major shortcoming of most interconnection policies is how they deal with energy storage, which will be a critical component on a grid with high levels of renewables. Most interconnection policies do not recognize the unique characteristics of storage, and the process of interconnecting this technology remains complex and unclear in many states.
Currently, if upgrades are required to accommodate additional DERs on a circuit, the project that “triggers” the upgrades must pay the full cost.

The allocation of grid upgrade costs is another area where significant interconnection reform will be needed to enable a future of high renewables. Currently, if upgrades are required to accommodate additional DERs on a circuit, the project that “triggers” the upgrades must pay the full cost.
These costs, often hundreds of thousands of dollars, can kill the economics of a project. This limits project development, delays needed infrastructure investments and leaves whole sections of the distribution grid closed to DER development. A few states, including Massachusetts and Maryland, are exploring new approaches to distribute upgrade costs across multiple projects and ratepayers and enable proactive grid investments.
Accessibility of data on grid conditions is another element of interconnection policies that needs reform. This data, such as which circuits have room for additional DER capacity, could significantly streamline the interconnection process. It could also allow developers to tailor projects to grid conditions—such as by choosing locations that don’t require upgrades, or proposing operating “schedules” to limit export to the grid at certain times.

Currently, few utilities make this data easily available with the level of detail and accuracy to make it actionable. States including California and Minnesota are making progress in this area and provide lessons for other states.
While interconnection reform is complex, solutions exist for each of these challenges. But commitment to holistic interconnection reform will be essential to achieving the change needed to reach high levels of renewables.
In subsequent articles in this series, IREC will delve into several of these issues, drawing from solutions developed in states around the nation.
Gwen Brown is communications director at the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.  This article is part of a four-part series on interconnection reform. In the next article, we will explore why power control systems are essential to unlock the full value of energy storage on the grid and how interconnection policies must change to enable this. Subsequent articles will explore the need for greater accountability and data access and transparency in the interconnection process.

“We’ve been warned repeatedly during the last several years by major U.S intelligence agencies that a crippling cyberattack on our critical infrastructure was not a question of if, but when,” said Jim Cunningham, executive director of the grid advocacy group. The group said that the Colonial pipeline cyberattack and last year’s SolarWinds attack, “makes it clear that our electric infrastructure is vulnerable” and in need of “significant” security upgrades.
The group pointed to the weather-related outages in Texas in February as an example of the financial and social costs that could result by losing power “even for a short period of time.”
The group has recommended that around $22 billion be provided over five years to:
Protect Our Power also suggested providing funding for programs such as testing centers to ensure the integrity of critical grid hardware and software components prior to installation, facilitate the rapid tech transfer of government-developed cyber protection technologies to electric utilities for commercial implementation, and to establish a supply chain protocol and provide seed money to create a quasi-governmental oversight entity to ensure that the products and services used to build and maintain a reliable electric grid and related systems are not intentionally infected by foreign suppliers.
pv magazine reported earlier this year that President Joe Biden said the government had elevated the status of cyber issues and was launching an “urgent initiative” to improve U.S. capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace. The earlier reporting said that solar energy systems of all sizes could pose a risk to the grid in much the same way that an attack on a conventional power plant could result in widespread blackouts.
The consequences of a cyberattack could be as minor as reducing a solar array’s power output, or as major as overloading a battery energy storage system to the point of failure. In a worst-case scenario, an intruder could initiate plausible, yet inappropriate commands that disable large portions of the grid.
Protect Our Power said it has worked since 2016 with key stakeholders, including power companies and federal and state officials, to drive needed physical and regulatory improvements and advocate for a national policy to address what it said is a “national threat.”

While the capacity of solar installed at schools is up, so to is the total number of schools with solar installations, rising 81% since 2014. As of 2020, 7,332 schools nationwide have solar systems accounting for 1,337 MW of capacity.
Solar schools now make up 5.5% of all public and private K-12 schools, almost doubling from 3% in 2014. The decision to go solar at public schools is typically made at the district level, and 16% of K-12 school districts, 2,231 in total, have embraced PV.
According to the report, the average school solar installation size is 182 kW.
As with most things solar, California led the way on schools’ solar adoption, as 2,430 schools have deployed 616 MW of solar. More than 2 million California schoolchildren attend a solar school.
Next comes New Jersey with 621 schools, 181 MW, and 407,751 students. After that each respective category has some variation, with Illinois (455 schools), Arizona (400) and Massachusetts (292) rounding out the top-5 for solar schools; Arizona (125 MW), Massachusetts (71 MW), and Indiana (41 MW) taking the top-5 for installed MW; and Florida (302,699), Illinois (271,990), and Arizona (270,233) having the third-most, fourth-most, and fifth-most, respectively, students attending solar schools.
The report also highlighted the shortcomings of North Carolina, as the state has third-most installed solar solar capacity (7,000 MW), but comes in at 31st nationally for solar schools. Only 57 schools in North Carolina have solar energy systems installed on campus, according to the report.
Virginia jumped from 20th place to 8th place nationwide between 2017 and 2020, driven primarily by the legalization of power purchase agreements in Dominion’s service area. This change enabled the number of schools with solar on them to grow from 29 to 89 in two years, as the installed capacity expanded 10-fold, from 1.9 MW to more than 20 MW.
Similar growth will not be able to be replicated in North Carolina, as PPAs are not yet allowed anywhere in North Carolina. Even so, the state began a solar leasing program in 2017, which allows for a service agreement that offers some of the same benefits, including solar on campus at no upfront cost.

The state utilities commission gave the project the green light to begin construction. Duke Energy and Buncombe County will team up on the project. Duke Energy will own and operate the 5 MW solar power plant located in Woodfin.
The Woodfin facility will consist of around 5 MW alternating current/6.3 MW direct current solar photovoltaic capacity. The PV panels will be fixed to a ballasted foundation system, with 20 degree fixed-tilt racking, solar inverters, electrical protection and switching equipment, and step-up transformers. Additional equipment will include circuit breakers, combiners, surge arrestors, conductors, disconnect switches, and connection cabling.
The Woodfin Facility is expected to produce more than 9,413 MWh per year, yielding a 21.5% capacity factor. The service life of the asset is 25 years. The facility will be interconnected to a single Duke Energy-owned 24 kV distribution feeder.
Black Hills Energy wants a new tariff that would charge customers with solar panels the “true cost” of their energy. According to a report from South Dakota Public Broadcasting, the utility says people who generate their own electricity cost the rest of their customers more money.
The company wants state utility regulators to approve a new tariff that would charge solar customers market rate for the energy they generate. The utility would buy excess energy for about 25% less than its market price.
An online Solar Energy Basics course offered by the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry on the Coursera platform recently hit a milestone of 50,000-plus enrollments since it launched back in 2019.
The course was developed by Dr. Neal Abrams, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry at the New York State university, with instructional design and technical support from the Open Academy.
The course has a global reach, and has been subtitled into eight languages in addition to English. It’s one of three courses on solar energy for Coursera developed by Abrams to provide learners with a foundation for designing photovoltaic systems. The second course, Solar Energy System Design, launched last summer. A third course will be offered this summer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/12/regulators-approve-energy-storage-plans-but-question-their-cost-and-overall-benefits/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,POLICY,MARYLAND",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 12, 2021","Regulators approve energy storage plans, but question their cost and overall benefits","Potomac Edison, a unit of FirstEnergy Corp., received approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission for two battery energy storage projects in Allegany and Frederick counties, the latter of which will be paired with a new electric vehicle (EV) fast-charging station.
Potomac Edison proposed the two projects in response to the state’s Energy Storage Pilot Program, which was established in 2019 to examine new technologies that could have a transformative impact on electric distribution systems. The program required all investor-owned electric utilities to submit at least two energy storage proposals for the commission’s consideration.
The 1.75 MW, 8.4 MWh battery energy storage project in Allegany County would provide back-up power to more than 1,000 customers in Allegany and Washington counties during outages, enhancing service reliability in an area west of the town of Hancock.
The circuit is located in a rural area and has suffered from challenging tree-related reliability issues. Tree trimming alone is not expected to be enough to improve reliability across the circuit. The battery will offer islanding capability, providing power to customers in the event of loss of power at the local substation or a fault on the line. The battery is an alternative to building a connection to another circuit, which Potomac Edison said could cost $1.9 to $2.06 million.
Potomac Edison plans to partner with storage developer Convergent Energy + Power on the project. Under an early agreement with Convergent, Potomac Edison would have been able to reserve the system (and charge it to full capacity) for up to 20 days each calendar year. The utility said that would be sufficient to cover all high-risk days based on historical weather and outages. Following an objection from the regulatory commission’s staff, however, Convergent raised the number of available days to 50.
The project is expected to participate in PJM wholesale markets, but no revenues will flow directly to the utility or its customers. Instead, revenues will lower the annual contract price. All market risk remains with the contractor, Convergent.
Potomac Edison estimates a total cost of the project at $5.55 million over a 10-year period. Potomac Edison also foresees that the project will produce benefits equal to around $3.5 million.
In the second project, Potomac Edison will install a battery energy storage system at the Maryland Department of Transportation Park and Ride Lot in Urbana, located in Frederick County. The project will be adjacent to a new Potomac Edison electric vehicle (EV) fast-charging station, located near the Interstate 270 and Route 80 interchange, and will bundle battery energy storage with EV charging.
Owned and operated by Potomac Edison, the $1.1 million system will include a 500 kW battery. The BESS would provide 1,000 kWh during a two-hour discharge period, providing around eight hours of DCFC EV charging at a charging rate of 125 kW, and require 4.8 hours to charge to full capacity.

Potomac Edison also intends to use the BESS for demand management, frequency regulation, and energy arbitrage (via PJM markets); revenues earned will offset the overall costs of the BESS.
In the event of an outage, the Urbana fast-charging station will be able to run off of battery-supplied energy. The battery system is expected to provide 1,000 kWh of energy.
Potomac Edison estimates the cost of the Urbana Proposal at around $1.1 million for capital costs and another $1 million of O&M costs through December 2036, including a 25% contingency. The utility estimated quantifiable benefits of $305,626, including air emissions reductions; public health adverse-impact reductions; peak shaving; EV charging payments; energy arbitrage; PJM markets; and reliability.
In comments, both the staff and the state’s Office of People’s Counsel (OPC) voiced concerns with the proposed project’s low benefit-to-cost ratio. After several adjustments, OPC calculated the present value benefit-to-cost ratio at 0.07. It said that the low benefit-to-cost ratio casts doubt on whether the project is in the ratepayer interest.
OPC also estimated that the charging station will, as a result of round-trip efficiency losses, result in a “substantial increase” in carbon dioxide emissions, which it estimated at 1.1 tons of increased carbon dioxide emissions in the first year of operation. OPC argued that Potomac Edison improperly claimed emissions benefits during periods when the project is participating in PJM’s RegD market, during which OPC said the project would likely result in increased emissions.
“…with a projected cost-effectiveness ratio at or near zero, we do not find that spending several million dollars in ratepayer funds to develop this project is in the public interest.”

The commission concluded that the Potomac Edison projects appear well conceived to produce valuable additional data and experience which will form the foundation for the next phase of utility-scale energy storage in Maryland.
Two commissioners—Jason Stanek and Mindy Herman—offered a partial dissent to the order, saying that the potential benefits of pairing a lithium-ion battery with an electric vehicle DC fast charger, when compared to the costs, “is concerning.”
They said that it “appears unlikely” that the costs to develop, operate, and maintain the project will be offset by the projected benefit streams, some of which are “unquantifiable.” They also expressed concern over the possible rise in air emissions. They said “with a projected cost-effectiveness ratio at or near zero, we do not find that spending several million dollars in ratepayer funds to develop this project is in the public interest.”
