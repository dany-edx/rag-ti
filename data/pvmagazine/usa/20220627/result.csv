https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/27/community-solar-leader-new-york-state-gets-another-25-4-mw-across-five-projects/,"COMMUNITY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RACKING,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 27, 2022",Community solar leader New York State gets another 25.4 MW across five projects,"A series of developers have announced a partnership that is set to bring roughly 25 MW on new community solar to New York.
The five community solar projects developed by Amp Energy, Castillo Engineering and CS Energy range from 3.9 MW to 6.2 MW in size. Four of the projects are currently under construction, and construction is about to begin on the fifth. All are expected to achieve commercial operation by Q4 2022.
Amp Energy is a solar developer that has built, constructed, or has under contract 7 GW of solar, wind and storage as well as a growing portfolio of green hydrogen developments. Castillo Engineering is a design and engineering firm. CCS Energy is an engineering, procurement and construction energy firm.
 “We are excited to be able to work alongside CS Energy on this portfolio of projects, given their leadership in New York, diversified labor base, and competitive pricing, even despite current market conditions,” said Kevin Foster, Director of US Projects at Amp Energy. “Through this partnership, we will be able to deliver more affordable clean energy to local communities throughout New York state, while also contributing to the state’s ambitious renewable portfolio standards.”
This portfolio of projects contributes to the continued growth of community solar in New York state, which has ambitious goals of sourcing 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable, increasing solar deployment to 10 GW by 2030, and ultimately achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. New York is an established leader in community solar in the United States, hitting the milestone of 1 GW of cumulative installations earlier this year, and currently holding a pipeline of more than 700 potential projects on the way.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/27/it-takes-more-than-recycling-to-establish-a-circular-clean-economy-says-nrel/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 27, 2022","It takes more than recycling to establish a circular clean economy, says NREL","Researchers with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in a literature review of more than 3,000 scientific publications exploring the life cycle of the most common solar and lithium-ion battery technologies, have found that alternatives to recycling may have untapped potential to build an effective circular economy for solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery technologies.
The review does not dismiss recycling, instead it promotes other less-explored aspects of manufacturing and hardware usage to develop supplemental strategies to create a more efficient, cost effective and circular economy for clean energy technologies, allowing these technologies to become cleaner in their own right. According to the researchers, Garvin A. Heath, Dwarakanath Ravikumar, Brianna Hansen, and Elaine Kupets, the emphasis on recycling, while valuable, may overlook the challenges and opportunities that research into other strategies could reveal.
“If you can keep them as a working product for longer, that’s better than deconstructing it all the way down to the elements that occurs during recycling,” said Garvin Heath, senior environmental scientist and energy analyst and Distinguished Member of Research Staff at NREL. “And when a product does reach the end of its life, recycling is not the only option.”
According to Heath, this is because the deconstruction, recycling and reconstruction process takes more energy and generates more associated greenhouse gas emissions than building products with longer usage and service lives does in comparison.
The researchers share that designing products with fewer overall materials, especially hazardous materials, will improve those products’ environmental impacts more than recycling can. Recycling itself is also an imperfect process, as there are currently no integrated recycling processes that can recover all the materials for either technology, and existing research has focused more on lab-scale methods, rather than commercial-scale.
“People often summarize the product life cycle as ‘take, make, waste.’” Heath said. “Recycling has received a lot of attention because it addresses the waste part, but there are ways to support a circular economy in the take part and the make part, too.”
The Biden Administration has also committed $3.1 billion in funding to increase American-made batteries and components, bolster domestic supply chains, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs. The plan is to support the creation of new, retrofitted, and expanded commercial facilities as well as manufacturing demonstrations, and battery recycling.While all of these initiatives support increased recycling on the commercial level, there have yet been no federally funded initiatives to lower materials’ usage in PV and storage applications, although such conclusions could be reached by organizations funded by either of these announcements.
In September 2021, NREL scientists published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry.
The research was published in Nature Energy and offers a real number for policy makers to consider: a $10 to 18 per panel subsidy to pay for recycling at the end of the panel’s life.
The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. At that price, a profitable and sustainable solar panel recycling industry could establish itself by 2032.
The NREL research said that specific tools could be effective at minimizing the landfilling of solar panels. The first simply would ban solar panels from landfills. The second option would subsidize solar panel recycling in order to lower the effective cost of recycling solar panels as the industry scales.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/27/leyline-invests-10-million-to-support-1gw-of-solar-development/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 27, 2022",Leyline invests $10 million to support 1 GW of solar development,"Leyline Renewable Capital said that it has invested $10 million in early-stage growth and development capital to support up to 1 GW of distributed generation (DG) and utility-scale solar energy projects across the eastern United States, though a partnership with Charlotte, North Carolina-based developer, Solterra Energy.
The company said Solterra plans to use the funding for both project-related expenses and working capital costs for the company. Its portfolio is expected to include utility-scale solar projects within Southeastern US, PJM and MISO service territories that are planned to be operational prior to 2030. In addition to the funding, Leyline will provide on-call development support for Solterra.
The 1 GW development target intended to be facilitated by this investment will represent significant project capacity growth for Solterra. The company has roughly 450 MW of projects either completed or under development.
“Solar energy is critical to our green energy future, but developers often can’t get the funding needed cover their growth needs, and project expenses like site control, interconnection fees, and other development costs,” said Erik Lensch, CEO of Leyline. “By partnering with Solterra, we can support a new venture and ensure their portfolio moves forward to eventually deliver carbon-free power.”
This deal marks Leyline’s second major investment in a solar platform in as many years. In June 2021, the company invested a $10 million construction facility in SaveSolar, a Washington D.C.-based solar company that finances and develops community solar projects, to develop 10.3 MW of solar capacity in the city. The investment provided SaveSolar with the working capital and initial construction equity to develop and retain ownership of approximately 17 residential, commercial, and government rooftop solar projects.
Leyline is a member of Renewables Forward, a diversity, equity, and inclusion initiative of leading US renewable and clean energy companies, having joined in Jan. 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/27/lithium-ion-battery-fire-danger-causes-recall-of-433000-solar-led-umbrellas/,"BATTERY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,PRODUCTS,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 27, 2022","Lithium-ion battery fire danger causes recall of 433,000 solar LED umbrellas","A joint recall with Health Canada, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (US CPSC) and SunVilla Corporation has been issued for all 10-foot solar LED Market Umbrellas. The umbrellas have LED lights on the arms of the umbrella that are powered by a lithium-ion battery charged with a small solar panel.
The recall was issued after reports of batteries overheating and causing fires in the United States and Canada. In three reported incidents, the solar panels caught fire while charging via the AC adapter indoors.
Consumers are advised to immediately stop using the umbrellas, remove the solar panel puck containing a lithium-ion battery from the top of the umbrella, store the puck out of the sun and away from combustible material, and not charge the puck with the AC adapter.
Lithium-ion batteries have been known to cause fires in the past. Last year LG Energy Solution Michigan issued a recall for its RESU 10H batteries in the US market that affected about 10,000 storage systems. “The home batteries can overheat, posing a risk of fire and emission of harmful smoke,” the manufacturer said at the time.
Battery manufacturers are increasingly turning to less hazardous solutions. After its recall, LG transitioned from nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry to lithium iron phosphate in its future products. Briggs & Stratton’s SimpliPHI Energy Storage System uses lithium-ferro-phosphate chemistry, which does not use cobalt, a metal associated with health hazards, and a key culprit in battery fires. And the new Canadian company, Salient Energy, developed a zinc-ion battery, which is a water-based chemistry that the company says eliminates the risk of fire, making the batteries more applicable for residential energy storage.
The umbrellas affected by the recall are made in China by SunVilla and sold at Costco in the United States and Canada. Consumers can return them to any Costco Warehouse for a full refund. SunVilla and Costco are also attempting to contact known purchasers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/27/california-moves-a-step-closer-to-opt-in-dynamic-pricing-to-help-balance-renewables/,"EV,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 27, 2022",California moves a step closer to opt-in dynamic pricing to help balance renewables,"Energy division staff of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have proposed that the commission launch a rulemaking proceeding on opt-in dynamic pricing of electricity.
For customers that have equipment that can automatically respond to price signals, opt-in dynamic pricing would shift some electricity consumption to times when prices are low, for instance at times of high renewable generation, while reducing consumption when the grid is under stress and prices are high.
The staff proposal envisions that the CPUC, by acting on dynamic pricing, could drive widespread customer adoption of technologies that can respond to price signals.
Following a successful dynamic pricing pilot funded by the California Energy Commission, the CPUC recently approved two more dynamic rate pilots. Customer equipment eligible for the pilots has included air conditioners, heat pumps, electric vehicle chargers, battery storage, agricultural irrigation pumps, and industrial process equipment.
The CPUC favors cost-based dynamic rates that improve grid resource utilization and “equitable” grid integration of DERs, the staff proposal says, citing the CPUC’s DER Action Plan. The staff proposal would achieve “fair” compensation for customer-owned DERs that is “linked to avoided marginal costs,” the proposal says.
With an opt-in dynamic pricing program, both participants and non-participants would save money on their electric bills, according to a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory modeling study described in the CPUC staff proposal. Customer bills would be reduced 10% to 17%, and savings from nationwide adoption would range from $33 billion to $50 billion per year, PNNL’s modeling showed.
DER industry support
Nine DER providers and advocacy groups supported a draft version of the CPUC staff proposal, in joint informal comments submitted last year following a CPUC workshop, according to a summary provided in the staff proposal. Their joint comments said that the scope of a rulemaking should include the “method for crediting exported energy at retail price, and interaction with reforms to net energy metering being contemplated” under a CPUC rulemaking. The nine parties were Enel X, California Energy Storage Alliance, California Solar & Storage Association, Sunrun, Vote Solar, Tesla, EDF Renewables, Nuvve, and Stem.
Customer protection
Dynamic prices under the CPUC staff’s proposal would include several price components, beginning with the location-specific real-time wholesale price of electricity.
The proposal discusses the extremely high wholesale electricity prices in Texas in February 2021, when extreme cold weather led to multiple days of large-scale outages. The high wholesale prices were passed on to the real-time pricing customers of Griddy, a retail electricity provider. California dynamic pricing customers would be protected from extreme prices, the staff proposal says, in part because California has grid connections to neighboring regions, while the Texas grid is isolated, and because California has a resource adequacy program, or capacity market, which is designed to help ensure an adequate reserve of generating capacity, and which Texas does not have.
The staff proposal recommends that a CPUC rulemaking should explore assurances of customer protection during such reliability events.
Bi-directional pricing
Other electricity price components, besides the location-specific real-time wholesale price, would be a dynamic capacity charge based on real-time grid utilization, and price components to recover costs of generation, transmission and distribution services and other fixed costs.
Ultimately, the proposal envisions “bi-directional” electricity prices, with customers importing or exporting energy at the same dynamic composite price.
The California Energy Commission has created an online, universally-accessible customer rate database known as MIDAS, and has proposed to adopt regulations that would facilitate the use of MIDAS for a dynamic pricing program, the CPUC staff proposal says.
California has reached this stage of preparedness for dynamic pricing at a time when solar provides more than 25% of the state’s electricity, and wind power provides nearly 8%.
The CPUC staff proposal, which incorporates a white paper discussing the need for demand flexibility and the limitations of current approaches, is titled “Advanced strategies for demand flexibility management and customer DER compensation.” A workshop on the proposal is planned for July 21, 2022.
