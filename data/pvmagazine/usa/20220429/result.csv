Not only is the infrastructure antiquated, but with incoming smart power electronics that control solar and wind energy coming onto the grid—as well as energy storage systems—a shift in grid technology from electro-mechanical to digital—and programmable—is needed. At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers have developed the Power Electronic Grid Interface (PEGI) platform that will help control and deploy upcoming power electronic devices for energy systems.
PEGI is part of NREL’s Advanced Research on Integrated Energy Systems (ARIES) platform, a research site for proving advanced energy system concepts. ARIES allows PEGI to explore the diverse grid impacts of power electronics, including everything from consumer electronics such as modern refrigerators and electric vehicles, to inverter-based resources such as wind, solar photovoltaics, and battery systems, and the next generation of grid technologies that are revolutionizing medium- and low-voltage power systems.
As part of its research efforts, NREL hosts 20 MW of wind, solar, hydrogen, vehicles, storage, and other resources, all of which can be used to emulate an extensive range of power system events and configurations. 
“This is a critical moment for the industry and grid planners to understand the technologies shaping their systems and find solutions to their specific needs. PEGI is foremost an asset for partners to experiment in a realistic and risk-free environment,” said Barry Mather, manager of integrated devices and systems research at NREL.
PEGI is able to model grid scenarios at the megawatt scale, and is focused on addressing grid stability questions such as grid-forming inverter control, operating the grid with high amounts of inverter-based resources, and the interconnection of wind and solar plants.
Inventing grid scenarios
On the NREL campuses, power comes in from the local utility and first passes through a controllable grid interface, allowing researchers to customize power conditions. At this interface, researchers can invent grid scenarios such as a fault, a blackout, or a 100% renewable energy system. Down-line from the grid interface, PEGI equipment then evaluates the responses and interactions of power electronic devices under test.
PEGI provides users with a way to play out device operations for any power technology under any scenario, NREL reports. Overall, it is offers a realistic environment that can take the risk out of future technologies.
PEGI offers answers to the imminent question: How best to integrate inverter-based generation for different systems?  It does this by allowing researchers to adjust the share of traditional or renewable resources, and experience its impacts at a power level relevant to industry.
“If they aren’t already, many operators will soon be facing questions about how to maintain system stability, as renewable energy mandates lead to larger shares of inverter-based resources. But realistically, there is no single answer besides that every system is different. The special role of PEGI is to show very precisely how a system would operate under future scenarios, and future mixes of renewable and conventional resources.” Mather said.
Power electronics are a fundamentally different type of generation than past electro-mechanical machines. An advantage of such power electronics is that engineers can program and access a wide variety of controls, which are now being explored for inverter-based resources in a global consortium.
PEGI in action
The NREL co-led Universal Interoperability for Grid Forming Inverters (UNIFI) Consortium is taking up this topic by uniting over 40 organizations across industry, academia, utilities, and government to share knowledge and remove the risk from the frontier of grid-supportive controls. PEGI has a prominent role in this effort by allowing the collaborators to develop and demonstrate inverter controls in many operational environments. Among other projects, the UNIFI Consortium will use PEGI to validate specifications that ensure interoperability requirements for grid-forming inverters from various manufacturers.
As an example of PEGI in action, NREL has pioneered and proved grid-forming controls in several applications. One will be support the island of Maui, where the instantaneous share of renewables is tipping toward 100%. NREL has created a tool, the Multi-Timescale Integrated Dynamic and Scheduling Model (MIDAS), to help operators manage the scheduling and stability of renewable resources. Having validated baseline aspects of the tool, researchers will use PEGI to deploy it on a scaled system with support from the DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office, as part of the SAPPHIRE project. PEGI will represent Maui’s soon-to-exceed 300 MW of renewable assets, in combination with other generation, to show that MIDAS can inform operations when renewables make a larger share of the generation mix.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/29/elon-musk-wins-solarcity-lawsuit-avoids-over-2-billion-judgement/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,DELAWARE,TEXAS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 29, 2022","Elon Musk wins SolarCity lawsuit, avoids over $2 billion judgement","Tesla founder Elon Musk will avoid paying over $2 billion in a shareholder lawsuit over the acquisition of former top residential installer SolarCity.
“The Tesla Board meaningfully vetted the Acquisition, and Elon did not stand in its way, “said Delaware court Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights, who decided the case.
The suit alleged that the Tesla purchase of major installer SolarCity was an attempt to bail out Musk’s cousin’s struggling company, of which Musk was the largest investor and chairman. The shareholders’ suit also accused Tesla’s board of having a lax approach to corporate governance.
Much of this lawsuit revolved around why SolarCity was purchased to begin with. Peter and Lyndon Rive founded SolarCity in 2006 with encouragement from their cousin, Elon Musk. By the time Tesla purchased the company, Musk owned 22.2% and was chair of the board. Though it had grown to be the largest US installer in 2016, earning record revenues of $730 million, losses were mounting, with $820 million in net losses that year. The company had accumulated more than $1.5 billion in debt by the year of the purchase.
SolarCity’s business model relied on marketing, spending heavily on advertising and door-to-door sales, all while offering low-priced, no-upfront cost long-term leases. Post-purchase, the strategy changed, as Tesla began to slash marketing costs, moving sales to direct-from-website and in-store sales. Musk noted in a 2019 deposition on the lawsuit that the door-to-door and other sales channel strategies did not match Tesla’s brand.
Musk said in the deposition that problems with the Tesla Model 3 caused the company to reassign much of its SolarCity workforce to bolster its vehicle production operations. He could not confirm exactly what portion of the workforce was reassigned. In his testimony, Musk argued that SolarCity could not have raised capital if it had not been acquired by Tesla. There is no doubt that Tesla’s shareholder value has increased impressively since the acquisition.
The development of Tesla’s solar roof program has taken things in a different direction than SolarCity’s model. SolarCity installed panels and equipment from top manufacturers and focused on getting customers signed to long-term leases. Tesla’s solar program now focuses on direct sales and uses proprietary solar tiles in their “solar roof” installations.
“Tesla continued to rely on other solar companies to manufacture, produce, install and sell parts of its solar products. In other words, the synergistic integration that Tesla hoped for is still a work in progress. Despite these challenges, Tesla’s value has massively increased following the Acquisition,” said Slights.
Tesla’s power division is now mostly focused on the home energy storage system, PowerWall. The product accounted for the largest portion of the power division’s $1.99 billion in revenue last year. Meanwhile, solar installations have fallen behind, with 205 MW installed in 2020, a fraction of the 803 MW SolarCity deployed in 2016. Recently, Tesla fell out of the top three ranking for residential solar installers, being squeezed out by Freedom Forever, a company that posted an impressive 80% installation volume growth in 2021.
Also included in the purchase of SolarCity was a Buffalo, NY panel manufacturing plant. Tesla aimed for a 1 GW a year of solar production, but its partner, Panasonic, has since walked away from the project. It is now unclear what volume of panels or roof tiles Tesla currently produces at the facility.
Musk’s victory means he avoided paying over $2 billion in the shareholder suit, something that may be of relief as he attempts to buy social media platform Twitter for an estimated $44 billion.

In late 2021 they connected their first unit to the UK grid. The company describes its technology as “sonar for the power grid”.
Reactive starts by installing a shipping container full of gear that sits behind an ultracapacitor. This grid connected unit injects small, specific, bursts of energy — signals one might call them — into the power grid. The company listens to how the signals are distorted using in-house designed ‘measurement units’ strategically located on the grid. 

The company’s Grid-Sonar software suite then collects the distortion data, and calculates the power grid’s system inertia, as well as other parameters. This information is then delivered to the grid operator’s management platforms so they can more discretely deploy grid supporting resources, and avoid turning on an entire coal plant to service a ‘tiny wobble’ that could be fixed with a much smaller and faster battery.
The company connected their first unit to the grid in the United Kingdom to support National Grid in October of 2021. In general, National Grid has been active in the budding “green inertia” space.
Grid stability is becoming a greater concern for operators in many markets as we transition into this brave new world. Recent events in California and Texas, which affected solar power generation heavily, bring this topic into even greater focus.
Solar-plus-storage has been running large off-grid solar power projects for decades, providing ample evidence that full size power grids could be run by the same technology.
Sonnen first made whole communities capable of going off-grid over a decade ago in Europe, and since 2017 in the United States. First Solar also proved its ability to provide grid forming services from modules in 2017.  With ongoing inverter research, the full suite of solar gear (modules, inverters, and batteries) will be ready to run the grid very soon.
AEMO, the manager of Australia’s heavily renewable energy power grid, is investing significant time into solar inverters and batteries doing this work. The Philippines recently installed its first grid stability battery. The US’ PJM region also has a lot of energy storage grid services experience.
 
 

Keeping close to what we already understand, four ‘synchronous condensers’ were installed on Australia’s grid, allowing for more than a gigawatt of wind and solar to and avoid frequent curtailment, and to be almost fully utilized. These were the first units installed in the very advanced Australian renewables marketplace.
Synchronous condensers are very large metal flywheels that spin at 50 or 60 revolutions per minute, stabilizing the electromagnetic fields of the grid. These units are powered by electricity, rather than the steam from burning gas or coal. The hardware has been around for many decades, but is not needed on fossil heavy grids, since fossil generators already have spinning resources built in.

The large infrastructure investment firm, Quinbrook, recently installed the first synchronous condenser in the UK. Additional units will be deployed at three more UK sites this summer.

It also seeks 125 MW/500 MWh of energy storage capacity.
An informational webinar for bidders will be held on June 9, 2022. Different than past annual RFPs, Dominion will accept proposals on a continuous basis throughout the year. The company said this will increase transparency and boost the company’s ability to select the best resources available.
Solar PV and hybrid solar plus storage, wind and wind paired with storage, and stand-alone energy storage projects will all be considered.
Utility-scale solar projects 3 MW or greater will be accepted, as well as distributed projects smaller than 3 MW. The smaller, distributed projects must be sited in Dominion’s territory where the location supports local grid benefits.
Dominion said the projects will support the company’s projected customer load as outlined in its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Dominion has set a goal of zero carbon emissions by 2050, following goals set by the Virginia Clean Economy Act.
The intent to bid form can be found on the Dominion Energy Virginia website. The company announced it will issue a separate RFP for power purchase agreements on September 1.
Dominion Energy Virginia serves 2.6 million customers over a 30,000 square mile area of Virginia and North Carolina. In its IRP, Dominion noted it retired 770 MW of oil-fired generation in 2020 and placed 250 MW of solar in operation that same year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/29/convergent-announces-operation-of-maryland-solar-and-storage-portfolio/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MARYLAND",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 29, 2022",Convergent announces operation of Maryland solar and storage portfolio,"Energy storage provider Convergent Energy + Power said it has reached operations on a three-project portfolio of solar-plus-storage systems developed for Choptank Electrical Cooperative, which serves Maryland’s Eastern Shore.
The three projects in the portfolio combine to contribute 4 MW/8 MWh of storage and over 2 MW of solar PV to Convergent’s existing portfolio in the Delmarva peninsula. Across the peninsula, the company has developed and now operates a portfolio of five solar and storage projects, in addition to the eight solar and storage systems totalling 37 MW/121 MWh of storage and 56 MW of solar PV that the company is currently developing in Upstate New York.
The Delmarva peninsula experiences a litany of extreme weather events that can compromise the region’s energy resiliency, namely hurricanes, flooding and extreme wind. Convergent’s portfolio was selected and constructed to increase the electrical system’s resilience in the face of these weather events, as well as to lower customer bills.
“Adding an energy storage system to existing solar PV is one of the best ways to optimize solar performance, lower energy costs, and increase reliability,” said Frank Genova, Convergent’s Chief Operating and Financial Officer.
Convergent was launched as a startup in 2011 to develop, own and operate large-scale storage for industrial customers and utilities. It initially self-funded its projects, raising $70 million to do so. Acquired by Energy Capital Partners in 2019, the company now has over $400 million invested in or committed to projects in operation or under development in 40 states and the Province of Ontario.
Convergent is also operating and overseeing maintenance for the 9 MW/36 MWh and 6 MW/24 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage systems at one of Southern California Edison’s (SCE) substations in Santa Ana, California using Convergent’s energy storage intelligence, PEAK IQ.
The company’s PEAK IQ uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to ensure energy is stored and dispatched at the most strategic times.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/29/first-solar-q1-earnings-drop-while-bookings-remain-strong/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,ASIA,CHINA,INDIA,OHIO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 29, 2022","First Solar Q1 earnings drop, while bookings remain strong","First Solar announced financial results for the first quarter that ended March 31, 2022, noting a drop in net sales of $540 million and a loss per share of $0.41.
Net sales for the first quarter were $367 million, and the company attributed the $540 million decrease from the prior quarter to a decrease in volume of modules sold, a decrease in the module average selling price, and lower project revenue in Japan.

The first quarter loss per share was $0.41, compared to earnings per diluted share of $1.23 in the fourth quarter of 2021. On the earnings call, Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar, noted that the $0.41 loss per share was within their internal expectations, and “is reflective of what is projected to be a challenging 2022 from an earnings standpoint”.
Cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities also saw a drop from $1.8 billion at the end of the prior quarter to $1.6 billion in Q1 2022. The company attributes this decrease to capital expenditures related to expansion in India and Ohio and operating expenses.
“We are encouraged by our strong bookings progress, as we booked 11.9 GWDC in less than 60 days since the prior earnings call, bringing our year-to-date bookings total to 16.7 GWDC, further setting ourselves up for 2023 and beyond,” said Widmar. “Our agile approach to contracting continues to attract customers looking for long-term certainty and value.”

Widmar noted that recent bookings are mostly with long-term repeat customers, but that there is a “significant volume” with new customers, which points to their trust in the company, the value of the cadmium telluride technology, and the company’s adherence to “principles of responsible solar but also the risk of pursuing a ‘solar at any cost’ strategy”.
The technology roadmap includes development of bi-facial cadmium telluride technology as well as plans to scale into the residential market–likely with the technology under development in partnership with SunPower.
On the earnings call, Widmar expressed the company’s view of trade policy and the Forced Labor Act, saying that trade and industrial policy decisions “play a role in impacting market dynamics”.  He pointed out that First Solar was the first US solar manufacturer to join the Responsible Business Alliance, which he said offers the leading standard, adding that “the transition to sustainable energy future must not come at the price of human rights”.

As for the petition by Auxin, Widmar highlighted the company’s stance. He said that First Solar sees the anti-circumvention inquiry as a positive step toward addressing the issue of modules being completed in Southeast Asia in an attempt to avoid tariffs. “For too long the American solar manufacturing industry has been under siege from Chinese headquartered and subsidize companies that have been violating the rules of free and fair trade.”
We’ve heard the ‘sky is falling’ narrative pushed by lobbyists advocating for China to have free reign in the US market. Their doom and gloom is telling. It suggests that they are afraid that the Dept of Commerce will find that the Chinese solar manufacturers in fact engaged in circumvention and will hold them accountable for their unfair and unlawful trade practices. While the lobbyists characterize Auxin as a single company seeking to inappropriately exploit the law it is precisely cases like this that the laws are designed for.
Widmar called for a “combination of durable industrial policy, smart trade policy and enforcement of the rule of law in order to build back American solar manufacturing and innovation”.
