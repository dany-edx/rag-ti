https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/21/solar-will-be-in-unassailable-position-as-cheapest-source-of-electricity/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 21, 2023",Solar will be in “unassailable position” as cheapest source of electricity,"DNV, a global risk management firm, offered its annual outlook on the global energy transition. Solar was placed in the spotlight as the leader in renewable energy supply. 
“In 2050, solar PV will be in unassailable position as the cheapest source of new electricity globally,” said DNV. 
As the world transitions toward carbon emissions-free electricity generation, DNV expects the share in generation mix for coal to decrease 4% and gas to decrease 8% by mid-century. As the global fossil fuel industry becomes a metaphorical fossil itself, DNV expects the world energy mix to be 70% reliant on variable renewable sources like solar and wind power. Fossil fuels will represent just over 10% of the energy mix by that time. 
Along this path, solar capacity increases 22-fold in DNV’s energy transition vision. The firm said it views variable renewables as the cheapest and quickest route to both decarbonization and energy security. 
Costs are expected to improve by mid-decade. The global weighted average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar is currently around $50 per MWh for solar and $120 per MWh for solar-plus-storage. DNV expects solar LCOE to drop to $30 per MWh by mid-century, with some individual project costs well under $20 per MWh.
“The main driver for this reduction in LCOE is the reduction of unit investments costs, which are around $900 per kW as a global average now. This will fall significantly with every doubling of solar PV installation globally, reaching $650 per kW in 2050,” said the report.

Currently, the levelized cost of solar-plus-storage is currently more than double that of standalone solar. A continuous decline in battery prices will narrow this gap to around 50% by mid-century, said DNV.
Despite its higher costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.
DNV highlighted the impressive growth ramp of solar globally, which was 1 GW per year in 2004, 10 GW in 2010, and 100 GW in 2019. Despite global disruptions in supply chains due to COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 150 GW was added worldwide in 2021. DNV expects global annual installations to continue to rise, reaching 550 GW per year.
“By mid-century, total installed capacity will be 9.5 TW for solar PV and 5 TW for solar and storage. The resulting 14.5 TW of solar capacity is 24 times greater than in 2020,” said DNV. “While solar will have a share of 54% of installed capacity in mid-century, it will account for 30% of global on-grid electricity generation.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/21/ten-most-common-rooftop-solar-safety-risks/,"INSURANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,QUALITY,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 21, 2023",Ten most common rooftop solar safety risks,"Clean Energy Associaties, a clean energy advisory company, performed over 600 safety audits at sites all over the world and found that 97% had safety concerns.
The vast majority of these hazards are caused by poor installation practices, according to CEA. This means most of them can be identified and resolved relatively easily before they lead to fires, safety risks and potentially costly liabilities.
The top ten safety concerns include:

Nearly half of the sites surveyed had damaged modules caused by incorrect installation or cleaning methods, extreme weather, electrical short circuits in the module or heavy soiling on the modules. And while damaged modules can cause underperformance, they can also cause electrical faults, shock hazards and fire safety risk.
Cross-mated connectors were found in 41% of the sites. This typically occurs due to installer error or a lack of understanding UL-listed connector pairings, or the use of incorrect installation techniques. It can also happen when field-made connectors don’t match the module connector. The effect can be water intrusion or corrosion. Or it can potentially lead to fire from arcing in the connector housing.
Poor terminations were seen at 40% of the sites. The issue can be caused by untrained technicians using the wrong crimp, wrong die, poor wire stripping and/or trimming methods. Poor terminations can arc to one another or to wire clippings within the inverter housing. This can also increase heat at the terminal, causing safety and longevity concerns.
Improperly assembled connectors were found at 40% of the inspected sites, another risk possibly caused by untrained workers or lack of standards. The problem cannot be identified during a visual inspection and requires thermal imaging (shown below) or destructive testing. Left unchecked, poorly assembled connectors can cause extreme thermal signatures that result in safety and reliability issues.

Module hotspots were found in 31% of sites. Hotspots can be caused by manufacturing defects, module shading or soiling or damage during shipment. This issue can lead to voltage mismatch between modules, causing string underperformance. If the modules get too hot they can melt the backsheet, potentially causing arcing or fire.
Cables rubbing against sharp edges were found at 27% of sites surveyed. This can be caused by untrained workers or by weather variations. The expansion and contraction that takes place through seasonal heat changes can cause enough movement to allow sharp edges to eventually cut through the cable installation. Once the conducts is exposed, a short circuit can develop and may lead to fire.
Broken and damaged connectors were found in just over one-quarter of sites. While this can be cause by untrained workers or lack of standards, it can also be caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight, rain, etc.
All installations are expected to resist a certain level of water from rain and snow, however, water ingress was found to be an issue at 26% of sites. This can be caused by improperly installed equipment covers, missing or damaged conduit seals or missing weep holes, leaving no way for water to exit enclosures. Electrical failure and potential thermal events can result, caused by compromised component protection or the creation of unintended electrical paths.
Enclosure hotspots were identified at 19% of sites. These hotspots can be caused by installation problems or from faulty fuses or unsafe system operation. The issue can affect production output, or can risk component breakdown and electrical failure.
Co-authors Chris Chappell, CEA’s senior director of engineering services, and Ankil Sanghvi, engineering manager, will discuss these findings and their experiences inspecting solar rooftops for some of the largest retailers in the U.S. at 1 p.m. EDT June 29, on a free webcast, “From Sunlight to Spotlight: Avoiding Fire Hazards in Your Rooftop Solar Installations.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/21/top-risks-for-solar-assets-extreme-weather/,"FINANCE,INSURANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,QUALITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 21, 2023",Top risks for solar assets: Extreme weather,"The solar industry is forecast to build as much capacity in the next five years as it has over the previous two decades. As the industry matures, risk assessments support the build out of bankable projects that perform at a high level.
This is the motivation behind the annual kWh Analytics Solar Risk Assessment report, now in its fifth year. In the 2023 report, the firm highlights key risks in extreme weather, finance, and asset operations.
“Mitigation of these risks will be critical to our industry’s shared goal: investment of capital into solar to attain sustainable growth,” said Jason Kaminsky, chief executive officer, kWh Analytics. “Doing so will require industry leaders to continue working together as new environmental, technological, legislative, and economic challenges arise.” 
1) Proactive hail stow program can reduce property insurance premiums
Hail is an increasingly prominent issue for PV assets. As more sites are built in the central U.S. “hailstorm alley” and modules trend towards larger formats with thinner glass, the risk for significant damage increases.
Tilting modules to a stowed position to avoid direct hail impact can protect them. However, the stow process is often delayed until hail starts falling, diminishing the effectiveness of the protective measure.
Due to this, a predictive, proactive approach to hail stowing is recommended by many asset operators. Other industry members push against this idea, arguing that hail stowing ahead of time diminishes the total output of the solar array, missing out on productive hours with the optimal angle.
kWh Analytics modeled this scenario, comparing proactive stowing with a no-stow method. Assuming a $22/MWh PPA, moving into hail stow during predicted hail events throughout the year led to a total production loss of $12,000, or 0.1% of the $9.75 million of estimated annual revenue. Meanwhile, this stow program would result in a property insurance premium reduction.
“The choice is clear: stow early and stow often when there is a chance of severe weather near your PV project,” said Nicole Thompson, data scientist, kWh Analytics.
2) Tempered-glass modules are twice as resilient to hail as heat-strengthened glass modules
Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) runs hail durability tests on various module formats. After a three-year test, the firm found that PV modules with a 3.2 mm tempered front glass over a polymer backsheet are approximately twice as resilient to impact as dual-glass modules with 2.0 mm heat-strengthened glass.
“Using RETC’s HDT (Hail Durability Test) data to identify and select hail-resilient modules, stakeholders can significantly reduce financial risk exposure in hail-prone regions,” said Cherif Kedir, president and chief executive officer, RETC.
“Moreover, hail risk mitigation specialists like VDE Americas can use these impact resiliency data to inform probabilistic financial loss estimates that also consider site-specific hailstorm severity and frequency, tracker-specific defensive stow capabilities, and operator-specific weather-alert response protocols,” said Kedir.
Watch our pv magazine webinar on hail risk mitigation with RETC’s Cherif Kedir and VDE America’s John Sedgwick.
3) Glass/glass modules break twice as much as glass/backsheet
Glass/glass (G//G) modules are gaining popularity due to an industry preference for bifacial modules and are being adopted due to concerns with glass/backsheet (G//BS) reliability. However, G//G modules have been showing risks in breakage from impacts.
“While we have observed that G//G modules have lower mean and median power degradation than G//BS modules in thermal cycling, damp heat, and potential-induced degradation testing, the results for two other critical durability tests present breakage concerns for G//G modules,” said Tristain Erion-Lorico, vice president of sales and marketing, PVEL.
Results from PVEL’s hail stress sequence testing, which launches ice balls at module surfaces, show that 89% of G//G modules experienced broken glass during testing, compared to only 39% for G//BS modules. PVEL’s mechanical stress tests also found a higher rate of breakage for G//G modules.
“Current G//G module designs may not be suited for extreme hail or heavy wind/snow locations. As discussed further in PVEL’s 2023 PV Module Reliability Scorecard, extended testing helps determine which modules to procure for long-term project success,” said Erion-Lorico.
This article, the first of a three-part series, will focus on the extreme weather risks, and next up, pv magazine USA will highlight kWh Analytics’ risk warnings for financial modeling and asset operations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/21/community-solar-workforce-canopies-in-focus-at-nyseia-conference/,"COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 21, 2023","Community solar, workforce, canopies in focus at CUNY/NYSEIA conference","Rooftop solar canopies, building electrification and employing new solar installers in the metropolitan New York City region were top topics at the City University New York and New York Solar Energy Industries Association’s (NYSEIA) NYC Solar plus Storage Summit 2023.
Held Tuesday at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at the John Jay College for Criminal Justice campus in New York, N.Y., the 14th annual conference saw a record 600 plus attendees and 32 exhibiting companies grace the city university campus.
According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the city region saw 23% growth in solar installations in Q1 2023, while on an annual basis the city has sustained 41% compounded annual growth rate for citywide installations since 2012, said Luke Forster, senior business analyst at NYSERDA.
New York City is about 45% of the way towards its 2030 goal of having 1 gigawatt of installed solar capacity resources. To date, 450 MW of solar projects have been installed in New York City across 46,164 projects, Forster said.
In 2019, city ordinance Local Law 97 was passed, which facilitated the rapid development of solar canopies on city rooftops. Many conference attendees heralded the city’s LL97 as the gateway to unlocking solar across 75,000 building rooftops, covering more than 40,000 acres.
Under LL97, solar energy is considered a distributed generation resource. Starting in 2024, buildings larger than 25,000 square feet will be penalized per year if they continue to produce carbon emissions from natural gas, fuel oil or other fossil fuel energy sources. Meanwhile for every 100,000 kWh of solar energy generated, the city will deduct 29 million metric tons of building emissions, saving building owners from incurring penalties of $7,700 per year by installing electric systems over fossil fuels.
Julia Casagrande, deputy director of Mayor Eric Adams’ Office of Climate and Environment Justice, said solar canopies are allowed to be installed on building rooftops at up to 15-feet of mounted height, on residential buildings of up to 10,000 square feet.
Community solar
With New York state remaining as the number one U.S. market for community solar development, the city region has also benefited from 45 MW of total community solar projects across rooftop and ground-mounted systems, NYSERDA’s Forster said.
The state’s N.Y. Green Bank has committed to funding $250 million through the Community Decarbonization Fund, which funds community solar development into low-income and disadvantaged communities around the state.
Laura Humphrey, director of sustainability for L+M Development Partners, a New York residential and commercial building owner, said the organization has already seen more than 140 rooftop solar projects under active management with 3 MW of aggregate power capacity.
“Community solar is the primary strategy for our residents. It creates such an immediate benefit and it’s so easy to do,” Humphreys said, adding that L+M Development has seen its tenants procure more than 6 MWh of community solar power.  
In December 2021, the real estate developer became the first citywide owner of a net zero building, the Arverne East project, located in the Far Rockaways, Queens. On a 35-acre site, a mixed-use 1,650 unit housing complex deployed closed-loop geothermal energy systems with 12.7 MWh of rooftop solar providing additional energy to low-income residents in the Rockaways neighborhood.
Workforce development
For workforce development, Anthony Fiore, chief program officer of NYSERDA said the state’s energy authority has already invested more than $70 million in citywide training programs to spur more licensed electricians, technicians and solar installers.
Charles Callaway, director of workforce development and founder of workforce development agency, WE ACT for Environmental Justice, told pv magazine USA that his agency started a solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business, Solar Uptown Now Services (SUNS).
With 11 employees that graduated from the WE ACT worker training program, Callaway said the SUNS group is deploying rooftop solar projects across about 14 MW of new solar projects in The Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn neighborhoods of New York City.
“We keep developing and want to become a full-fledged solar company and developer in the city. Being a small company, it’s a challenge,” Callaway said. “We hear about this flow of money, but we don’t see it at the community level yet,” he said, referring to the federal Inflation Reduction Act shoring up funding for low- and moderate-income bracket housing groups to install solar systems.
Callaway said the city’s 250,000 plus solar industry has seen just 10% African-American representation, a margin that he hopes to see increased through WE-ACT and promoting workforce development across inner-city neighborhoods in the five city boroughs.
Resiliency
In an afternoon keynote speech, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said after major Canadian wildfires saw smoke lurk over the city from June 5 to 7, 2023, the realness of climate change is a threat that needs to be addressed through clean energy leadership and innovation.
Mayor Adams prioritized energy equity, technology innovation and government investment as the three main pillars to unlocking more solar plus storage deployments across the densely populated city region. Disadvantaged communities suffering from decades of neglect due to residing near fossil fuel operations should have access to abundant community solar resources, he said. Meanwhile the city’s communities should increase the hiring of solar installers from marginalized communities, he added.  For technology, the mayor emphasized solar systems paired with distributed storage resources for resiliency measures.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/21/lunar-releases-residential-energy-storage-cabinet-system/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 21, 2023",Lunar releases residential energy storage cabinet system,"In honor of the Summer Solstice, the day of the year with the most daily sunlight, a distributed energy start-up company is releasing a residential integrated energy management cabinet system that stores solar energy on its 5 kWh battery systems to provide up to 30 kWh of back-up power in the event of a power outage.
Lunar Energy announced the release of its first consumer hardware product, the Lunar System, a residential distributed generation cabinet that integrates rooftop solar generation, battery storage, and load control in one product suite.
The DG cabinet includes the company’s Lunar Battery, a lithium-ion battery which ranges from 10 kWh to 30 kWh capacity, configurable in 5 kWh battery block increments, and a hybrid 10 kW inverter, providing enough power to back-up home heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and common household appliances.
The residential cabinet can be connected with an on-site solar array, which the company does not provide, and uses the Lunar Bridge, an electric panel monitoring system that toggles between the grid and off-grid battery power in 30 milliseconds. During a grid outage, the Lunar Switch automatically turns off non-essential appliances like EV chargers or pool pumps to prioritize necessary appliance usage.
The company said the residential battery is 47% smaller and more compact than other comparable batteries currently on the market.
Lunar Energy said that in a high solar penetration market like California, given recent net energy metering changes taking less value away from solar output, an average home using a 20 kWh Lunar System paired with a 5 kW solar array would see a payback period for the system’s installation within seven years. Such an installed configuration could cost between $20,000 and $30,000, the company said.
Sunrun, the company’s solar installation partner, will begin taking orders over the Fall of 2023 to install Lunar Systems paired with Sunrun solar systems, the company said. Installers seeking to learn more about the Lunar System can click the link above, including how to become a licensed installer.
In February, Sunrun and Lunar Energy partnered on a nationwide virtual power plant (VPP) network. The solar installer currently has VPP operations in New England, New York, California, Arizona, and Hawaii, with plans tens of thousands of new home distributed generation systems in additional states and territories. Before partnering, Lunar Energy had deployed 35,000 Lunar Gridshare interconnected home battery systems in Japan and 1,600 across Europe.
Lunar is partnered with Sunrun and other solar installers to integrate residential PV solutions with the Lunar System. Interested customers can configure their own system on Lunar Energy’s website.
Founded in 2020, Lunar Energy is based in Mountain View, Calif., and has raised about $300 million in equity funding to date. The company’s management team includes chief executive officer Kunal Girotra and senior vice president of engineering Kevin Fine, the former head and engineering director of Tesla Energy, the solar business of the EV manufacturer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/21/local-solar-offers-the-lowest-cost-pathway-to-100-clean-energy/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 21, 2023",Local solar offers the lowest-cost pathway to 100% clean energy,"Last month, the World Meteorological Organization announced that we will experience the hottest year ever recorded in the next five years. In the near future, we can expect more extreme summer heat that will, in turn, expose our vulnerability to wildfires, droughts, heat waves, and other natural disasters. Energy consumers across America will, quite literally, pay the price for Mother Nature’s fury as utility costs spike and frequent outages or rolling blackouts become the norm. Just last month, climate scientists warned us about the potential turmoil that blackouts during heatwaves could cause this summer.
Prioritizing the deployment of local solar technologies like rooftop and community solar in conjunction with battery storage unlocks a stronger, more flexible electric grid. It also creates the lowest-cost pathway to a 100% clean energy future. A clean grid with mainstream local solar and storage is $88 billion less expensive and more resilient than the grid of today. The alternative is higher costs for everyone, with some paying the ultimate price.
Research published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology estimates that mass power outages that occur during extreme heat waves can cripple cities and cause a substantial death toll. Experts estimate that 13,000 people could die in Phoenix and even northern cities like Detroit would be unable to prevent several hundred deaths in this scenario. We need electricity and air conditioning during extreme heat to survive, and that means the electric grid needs to be fully prepared to meet our needs.
Over the last several decades we have seen extreme weather events become increasingly common with over 350 weather and climate disasters recorded domestically since 1980. Put together, these events were responsible for nearly 16,000 deaths and over $2.5 trillion in damages. 18 of these severe weather and climate disasters occurred just last year and cost us more than $165 billion to clean up. It was the third most expensive year since 1980, trailing only 2017 and 2005. In just weather-related disasters alone, climate change is costing Americans more than $5000 per second.
Extreme weather, more often than not, means blackouts. Between 2000 and 2021, extreme weather events caused roughly 83% of power outages across the U.S., and the average number of these weather-related blackouts grew by 78 percent between the first and the second half of the period. On average, American consumers endured seven hours and 20 minutes of outages in 2021, with five hours attributed exclusively to weather-related disruptions.
The truth remains that our electric grid is unequipped to handle peoples’ electric needs during extreme weather; for instance, when everyone in a town blasts their AC through a heatwave but the utility can’t get enough electricity through their wires. Most households and businesses have no alternative but to receive electricity through their utility from far-away large power plants. When the grid strains under the pressure of extreme heat, consumers are left without power. That means food, baby formula, and medicine spoils. Residents have dialysis machines that can’t function. Hospitals and emergency shelters cannot render aid to those in need. It is no surprise that most experts consider an unreliable grid to be a national security threat. The stakes are life and death.
As extreme weather events become more frequent and more severe, distributed, local clean energy can modernize the electric grid to be more flexible and responsive. Especially if consumers adopt grid-connected technologies. This, of course, enables consumers to help their utility maintain a more reliable electric grid by feeding excess electricity they produce into it, while simultaneously being compensated for their contributions. Families and businesses can feel the benefits on normal days as much as during extreme weather.
Locally-generated clean energy, such as rooftop solar or community solar, along with battery storage solutions are cheaper, stabler alternatives to polluting fossil fuels. Deploying at least 247 GW of local solar and 160 GW in local battery storage would save all energy consumers US $473 billion by 2050 by crowdsourcing improved grid resilience and reliability on the path to cutting carbon emissions to 95% of 1990 levels. The firm, The Brattle Group, released analysis in May that showed virtual power plants, such as local solar and storage, can provide the grid with 40-60% lower cost resource adequacy. These new technologies can improve the grid’s bottom line and reverse the trend where consumers are on the hook for decreasing grid reliability and higher electric bills.
Not only that, but DERs like community solar projects, neighborhood microgrids, virtual power plants, and income- based energy efficiency programs can lower the energy burdens on low-income communities and deliver on environmental justice.
Solar energy and battery storage technologies can revamp the grid into something that is cheaper, more stable and more equitable. With the historic investments passed by congress in 2022, clean energy technology, like solar, can be deployed faster and further than ever before. And, regardless of your position on clean energy or the climate, solar and battery storage technologies are a solution to needed grid failures. That’s the simple fact. We need clean energy to power the economy of the future and harnessing today’s local solar and storage technology can do the job. 
Robin Dutta is campaign director of Local Solar for All (LS4A), a non-profit business association focused on creating a modern and equitable distributed energy grid, LS4A works to amplify the benefits of smaller, distributed energy resources that produce power closer to the homes and communities where it’s being used.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/21/50-states-of-solar-incentives-alaska/,"EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ALASKA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 21, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Alaska,"Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area and the most sparsely populated. With diminishing oil reserves and residents in extremely rural areas reliant on diesel fuel for power, it is surprising how little solar energy provides power to Alaskans. While one deterrent to relying on solar may be the lack of sun in the winter, particularly in northern areas, they also have an equal number of days of sunshine. According to the Department of Energy, annual insolation and thus, power production per capacity, is similar to Germany, which has been a leader in worldwide solar power use.
 
A similar insolation level, however, is where the comparison to European countries ends. Alaska has 18 MW of solar installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), ranking it 49th, down from 48th last year. Only South Dakota has less solar installed. The state receives 0.23% of electricity from solar. And while SEIA anticipates that 50 MW will be installed over next five years, Alaska will drop into last place in the U.S. for solar installations.
Unfortunately, this is in a state that has some of the highest electric rates (20.02 cents per kWh) per Energy Information Administration. A cost of living study by the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation revealed that utility costs in some cases are 33% higher than the national average.
Incentives
As in all states, federal incentives apply to solar projects in Alaska. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 established an Investment Tax Credit that covers 30% of the installed system costs. Considered the most significant climate legislation in history, the IRA encourages clean energy adoption in overburdened communities. For example, the IRA includes the Justice40 Initiative, which supports programs that improve clean transit and workforce development while also investing in programs that make clean energy more affordable and accessible and strengthen resilience to climate change in underserved areas.
source: SEIA
While federal support for solar adoption in all states is currently at an all-time high, Alaskan state policy lags behind. One policy, however, allows for municipalities to decide whether solar installations are property tax-exempt, meaning that even though the assessed value of property may rise as a result of a solar installation, property taxes will not rise correspondingly.
The state also has a net metering policy for systems of up to 25 kW. Payment for excess energy generation is credited to the customers’ next bill and it carries over indefinitely, according to DSIRE.
The state may soon have a renewable portfolio standard (RPS), as Alaska Senator Löki Tobin introduced Senate Bill 101 in March to establish a RPS for the Railbelt region in Alaska. Representative Jesse Sumner followed with House Bill 121, companion RPS legislation. The Railbelt is the interconnected power grid that runs from Fairbanks through Anchorage to the Kenai Peninsula. The legislation would require the five utilities in the area to generate 25% of their electricity from renewable resources by the end of 2027; 55% by the end of 2035; and 80% by the close of 2040. The bill aims to foster collaboration by imposing penalties only if the whole region fails to meet the standard.
Landmark installations
Energy49, a spinoff of Renewable Independent Power Producers (IPP), is the Alaskan solar developer of the 8.5 MW Houston solar project, which will be the largest installation in Alaska. Renewable IPP is also responsible for the 1.2 MW Willow solar project, previously the largest in the state.
Construction began last year on the Houston project, which is owned by New York-based CleanCapital, and expected to provide enough electricity to power 1,400 homes. The Alaska Energy Authority (AEA) provided a $4.9 million loan from its Power Project Fund to the project and CleanCapital provided the balance of project equity financing. Instrumental in getting the project off the ground is Launch Alaska, a non-profit with a goal of supporting deployment of $1 billion in climate tech projects across Alaska by 2030.
The Houston project, on track to be completed in August, will cover 45 acres with ballasted bifacial solar modules. Matanuska Electric Association has committed to purchasing all energy generated at the solar farm.
Another Alaskan solar installation was recently completed north of the Arctic Circle in the village of Shungnak, where residents had become accustomed to burning diesel fuel for its electricity.
A solar-plus-battery energy storage project funded by the Department of Agriculture and the Northwest Arctic Borough is changing how the village sources its electricity. With equipment developed by Blue Planet Energy, the solar and battery project forms a microgrid that is designed to meet the numerous challenges of operating in an extreme climate.
A 225 kW solar array offsets much of the village’s energy needs, which generally ranges between 200 kW and a peak of 300 kW. LG 405 W NeON 2 bifacial solar modules were selected for the array. The microgrid is intelligently designed to operate and supply power in times where diesel generation would be most expensive.
“Thanks to the energy storage system, we can turn the diesels off but keep the lights on in the community. It also gives the local utility the ability to run on 100% clean energy for hours at a time,” said Rob Roys, CIO, Launch Alaska.
Alaska’s future energy plan
Launch Alaska conducted a survey in early 2023 in which the IRA was shown to have major implications for Alaska project deployment. The non-profit will have a hand in Alaska’s future energy plan as Isaac Vanderburg, chief executive officer of Launch Alaska was recently appointed to the Governor’s Energy Security Task Force, charged with developing strategies to lower the cost of electricity statewide and think comprehensively about Alaska’s energy plan.
