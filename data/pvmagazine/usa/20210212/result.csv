Oregon-based manufacturer ESS Inc. has launched Energy Center, a flexible utility-scale storage system designed and sized to the specific needs of front-of-the-meter use cases and larger commercial and industrial facilities.
In contrast to the company’s Energy Warehouse, a standalone 75 kW/500 kWh containerized system, the Energy Center can be tailored and scaled to accommodate specific projects and enable the stacking of a range of storage applications. The systems can be configured in different power capacities, starting at 3 MW, with energy durations ranging from 6 to 16 hours. More info available here.
Sunnova Energy International Inc. will begin offering its services to the District of Columbia. Homeowners in D.C. will now have access to all of Sunnova’s loan products, including the solar-only system, Sunnova SunSafe solar + battery storage service, and +SunSafe add-on battery service.
For homeowners that are looking to go solar but require a new roof, Sunnova said it also will coordinate roof replacement service by a licensed contractor. The company said its systems are covered by a 25-year Sunnova Protect warranty. More info available here.
North American PV manufacturer Silfab Solar has launched a line of back-contact modules made exclusively for the U.S. residential market. The company said its Elite line–SIL 370-380 BK–has an efficiency rating of up to 21.4%, representing the company’s most powerful residential panel to date.
Silfab said it has already secured distribution partners for the new model. The company said the panel operates at lower temperatures in concert with superior low-light performance, which together increase energy yield by as much as 6% on a kWh/kWp basis. More info available here.
Stem Inc., a provider of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven clean energy storage systems, has teamed up with Arkansas-based renewable energy company Today’s Power Inc. (TPI). As a certified partner in Stem’s Partner Program, TPI will use Stem’s smart energy storage solution to deliver energy flexibility in electric cooperative projects, starting in northwest Arkansas.
TPI builds, owns and operates its projects, and Stem will provide the turnkey smart storage solution. Stem said its solution for electric cooperatives and other utilities includes its Athena smart storage software, battery hardware procurement, an interface for the utility to schedule battery dispatch in real-time or ahead of time, monitoring network operation center services, and the capability for TPI to monitor battery status and historical performance data. More info available here.
LineVision Inc., a provider of non-contact overhead power line sensor solutions, has launched a line rating offering to help utilities comply with rules proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). LineVision claimed its new LineRate AAR+ provides utilities with a scalable, turnkey solution for FERC compliance while enhancing grid reliability by reducing the times when traditional Ambient Adjusted Rating (AAR) methods would inaccurately overestimate line ratings.

FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) that would require utilities to implement, at a minimum, AAR while instructing grid operators to prepare to operationalize Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) technologies. LineVision said these methods can increase line ratings, reduce grid congestion, and enable renewable energy integration. The company’s solutions directly monitor the sag and temperature of the conductors and are powered by Velodyne LiDAR sensors, the same technology used in autonomous vehicles. More info available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/12/new-york-oks-major-transmission-build-out-community-clean-energy-incentives/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021","New York OKs major transmission build-out, community clean energy incentives","New York State officials are pushing forward with climate and clean energy goals outlined by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his recent State of the State address.
Cuomo and the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) announced final approvals to build the state’s “green energy transmission superhighway,” as well as a “first-of-its-kind” developer-funded program to directly pay residents whose communities host large renewable energy projects.
The PSC approved the New York Energy Solution Project, a 54.5-mile, 345 kV transmission line starting in Rensselaer County and extending to Dutchess County in the far eastern part of the state. According to the PSC, the project is valued at an estimated $530 million and will speed the flow of energy from upstate New York to high-demand markets and consumers downstate.
The PSC also granted NextEra Energy Transmission New York Inc. approvals to exercise municipal agreements to build the Empire State Line. Located in Niagara and Erie counties in the western part of the state and valued at an estimated $180 million, the 20-mile, 345 kV transmission line is designed to help relieve congestion and maximize the flow of renewable resources.
The PSC said these are the final set of major approvals required to start construction on 250 miles of a so-called electric transmission superhighway this year. Cuomo first announced the $2 billion superhighway project during his State of the State address in January.
In a statement, Cuomo called the projects “key investments” to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the state’s energy infrastructure and “essential” for developing a clean energy economy.
The PSC also approved the Host Community Benefit Program. It will provide bill credits directly to residential electric customers in municipalities where major renewable energy facilities are located. The PSC said the initiative will require developers to fund the credits and claimed this “first-of-its-kind” program will incentivize more clean energy projects to be built across the state.
Commission Chair John B. Rhodes said the program will provide “direct benefits to residents, while keeping in place negotiated community-wide benefits, such as payments in lieu of taxes and host community agreements.”
The program will provide an annual bill credit to residential electric utility customers within a city or town where newly built facilities 25 MW or greater are sited for the first 10 years a facility is operational.
The PSC said project developers will be required to fund the bill credits, whose amount would correlate to the type and size of the facility. According to the commission, solar and wind project developers would pay an annual fee of $500/MW and $1,000/MW of nameplate capacity, respectively.
That means a 50 MW solar farm would provide annual customer credits totaling $25,000, and a 100 MW wind farm would provide annual customer credits totaling $100,000. The PSC said the money would be shared by all residential customers in the host municipality, regardless of proximity to the facility.

Facility owners would pay the annual fee to the utility serving the affected municipalities. Utilities then would apply a bill credit to eligible customers’ accounts and be tasked with reporting relevant information annually.
The PSC said the credit will be paid by any new project 25 MW or greater that goes into service after the effective date of the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act, which was April 2020.
According to the PSC, the Host Community Benefit Program received strong support from stakeholders participating in the review, including many local elected officials and project developers.
The Host Community Benefit Program is among a host of newly approved initiatives designed to bolster renewables and help New York communities.
The PSC also signed off on $112.5 million in funding to support residents impacted by aging power plant closures as the state moves toward cleaner energy resources. Furthermore, Cuomo recently announced more than $17 million in new funding under the state’s Clean Energy Communities program, with additional support for projects located in disadvantaged communities.
New York’s latest efforts will help the state meet its 70% by 2030 renewable portfolio standard and climate goals. According to the PSC, the initiatives build on New York’s ramp-up of clean energy, including more than $4 billion invested in 91 large-scale renewable projects across the state, the creation of more than 150,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector, and a commitment to develop 9 GW of offshore wind by 2035.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/12/energy-and-climate-legislation-led-a-busy-week-in-washington-d-c/,"POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021","Energy and climate legislation led a busy week in Washington, D.C.","The Biden administration this week launched a new research working group, outlined its innovation agenda, and announced a $100 million funding opportunity from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support transformational low-carbon energy technologies.
Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers on the U.S. House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue recently reintroduced the Growing Renewable Energy and Efficiency Now (GREEN) Act, which includes a five-year extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC).
Also in Congress, bills to create a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator aimed at leveraging $100 billion of public funds to finance up to $463 billion in total investment over the next four years were recently introduced in the House and Senate.
And, in an exclusive interview with pv magazine USA, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said the organization plans to “go big” in its efforts to drive pro-solar energy initiatives.
“We think that there is a climate crisis under way, we think that there is an economic crisis under way, and we think that solar can help address both of those and bring equity to our energy systems,” Ross Hopper said. “This is the time to be aggressive.”
Even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is upping its environmental game, announcing that it will create a new senior environmental justice and equity position to ensure that FERC decisions don’t unfairly impact “historically marginalized communities.”
Lots to cover. Here are key developments reported over the last week:
White House Creates ARPA-C: The Biden administration on February 11 announced a Climate Innovation Working Group as part of the National Climate Task Force and also launched an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Climate (ARPA-C). The working group is intended to help coordinate and strengthen federal government-wide efforts to foster technologies that can help reach the goal of net-zero economy-wide emissions by 2050. It will be co-chaired by the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, Office of Science of Technology and Policy, and Office of Management and Budget.
Key areas that the group will take on include:
Department of Energy/Quentin Kruger
ARPA-E Funding Opportunity: The DOE announced $100 million in funding via the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support what it said would be “transformational low-carbon energy technologies.” The ARPA-E announcement seeks proposals for early-stage research into potentially disruptive energy technologies. Details on the opportunity can be found here.
GREEN Act Reintroduction: Lawmakers on the U.S. House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue recently reintroduced the GREEN Act, which includes a five-year extension of the solar ITC.
The legislation is expected to make comprehensive use of the federal tax code to help combat the threat of climate change and expand the use of renewable energy. SEIA called the bill “critical” and noted several key solar provisions, such as the five-year ITC extension and a direct pay option for large projects.
National Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator bills: Legislation to create a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator that can leverage $100 billion of public funds to finance up to $463 billion in total investment over the next four years were recently introduced in the House and Senate.
The expectation is that the Accelerator eventually will be pulled into a larger bill, most likely an infrastructure and climate package. The Accelerator would make up a significant piece of President Biden’s goal of $2 trillion in infrastructure spending.
As currently envisioned, the Accelerator would seek investment and procurements in areas such as renewables, storage, transportation, transmission, resiliency, efficiency, reforestation, agriculture, and industrial de-carbonization. The bills currently structure the Accelerator as an independent nonprofit capitalized with $50 billion and topped up with $10 billion a year for its first five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/12/sunrise-brief-intel-signs-on-to-138-mw-avangrid-solar-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",Sunrise brief: Intel signs on to 138 MW Avangrid solar project,"Intel signed a 15-year offtake agreement with Portland General Electric, enabling the Oregon-based utility to move ahead with a new 138 MW solar facility being developed by Avangrid Renewables.
The solar facility, Daybreak Solar, will produce a portion of the energy needed to power Intel’s advanced technology development and manufacturing facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon. Intel will be the only power purchaser from this new facility.
As part of the agreement, Intel will also buy and retire the associated renewable energy credits from Avangrid Renewables. Since 2004, Intel has been the largest buyer of the utility’s Green Future Enterprise (formerly Clean Wind) product.
Avangrid Renewables will develop the Daybreak project on 1,100 acres of privately owned land. The project is expected to enter service in 2022.
PGE’s agreement with Avangrid Renewables marks the second local renewable energy project made possible through the utility’s Green Future Impact program. In 2020, the two announced development of a 162 MW solar facility to serve 17 Green Future Impact subscribers, including businesses and municipalities. That project is expected to come online in late 2021.
The U.S. Department of Energy announced up to $100 million in funding for “transformative clean energy technology” research and development through its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy’s (ARPA-E) OPEN 2021 funding opportunity.
DOE said the funding represents the first of “billions of dollars” of R&D opportunities to be announced this year. The initial release is intended to help identify what it said would be “cutting-edge, disruptive clean energy technologies” to address the climate crisis.
DOE also said it will participate in the National Climate Task Force’s Climate Innovation Working Group, announced February 11 by the White House. The group will coordinate federal government-wide efforts to foster technologies that can help achieve the goal of net zero economy-wide emissions by 2050, and emphasize research to bolster and build domestic clean energy supply chains and strengthen domestic manufacturing.
Senator Joe Manchin, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, welcomed the announcement and said he will “continue supporting the Department’s investment in these much needed technologies of the future.” Manchin is widely seen as the gatekeeper for much of the Biden Administration’s planned investment in energy and climate initiatives.
Potential applicants can visit ARPA-E’s newly launched OPEN 2021 website for information and resources.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) ordered Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric to immediately contract for energy resources that can be online in time to serve peak and net peak demand this summer.
Regulators worry that extreme weather events like those that forced rolling blackouts last August could re-occur this summer. The order is part of a series of actions the CPUC is taking in an effort to ensure that enough demand-side and supply-side resources are procured for the state to maintain electricity reliability.
The Commission directed all load-serving entities serving load within the region known as the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to procure 3,300 MW of incremental capacity as a “least regrets” strategy. It also encouraged load serving entities to exceed the minimum requirements to address what the CPUC referred to as “potential” system reliability challenges that it said are now “actual system reliability challenges.”
Both utility-owned generation and third party-owned generation may provide the capacity to meet the summer 2021 peak and net peak demand.
The decision focuses on utility procurement of new generation resources. The CPUC said it will release a separate decision in early March focused mainly on increasing the amount of demand-side resources.
CIT Group Inc. said that its Power and Energy business served as a co-lead arranger on $93.3 million in financing for six battery energy storage systems in Texas.
The battery energy storage systems (BESS) are owned by Key Capture Energy, an Albany, New York-based developer, owner, and operator of projects in the United States.
Together, the six BESS projects represent a total of 230 MW of energy storage capacity. Three of the six projects are operational, and completion of the other three is expected by the end of the year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/12/four-key-solar-market-trends-from-2020/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 12, 2021",Four key solar market trends from 2020,"Buying and selling solar energy is complicated by constant changes in weather, congestion on nearby transmission wires, project downtime for maintenance or repair, and other market conditions outside of an owner or buyer’s control.
REsurety has identified four key insights on how solar markets performed in 2020, as well as the data behind them.
1. Texas solar outshines all others. The value of utility-scale solar project generation in 2020 ranged from around $19/MWh in MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) to roughly $31/MWh in ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas). Here, value is measured as the value of project generation, sold at the real-time Locational Marginal Price (LMP) at the hub, and where project generation is either observed or modeled depending on data availability.
Overall, realized values hovered relatively close to the market average of roughly $25/MWh at the hubs reviewed. Only projects with a full year of data (and thus had become fully operational prior to 2020) were included in our analysis.
The highest realized prices of 2020 were in ERCOT, where solar is expected to—but hasn’t yet—come online in impressive numbers in the next couple of years. Solar projects that are able to be built and fully operational sooner rather than later will likely take advantage of a positive solar shape scalar (defined as the ratio between the as-generated value of power and the around-the-clock value of power). However, solar shape degradation is sure to arrive in Texas as it already has in California.
Here is a summary of project values observed in 2020 across various markets. Note that ATC refers to the around-the-clock hub price:
2. Localized congestion chooses winners and losers. The highest-value solar project in ERCOT this past year was in far west Texas. In spring 2020, “West of the Pecos Solar” benefited from local congestion that elevated node-to-hub basis to a high of over $80/MWh in March.
Unfortunately for nearby solar projects, the benefits of congestion were not widespread; most other projects saw limited benefit from the localized congestion, and some were negatively impacted. Being on the right side of congestion will continue to be a key determinant to a project’s financial success.
3. Are we past the days of $9,000/MWh pricing? Most project owners and operators in Texas remember that exceptional summer of 2019 when real-time power prices met their upper limit of $9,000/MWh for the first time in ERCOT’s history.
This was welcome news for solar project owners and offtakers, provided the project was operational and generating during those exceptionally high-priced hours.
The situation was painful for any renewable energy project (wind or solar) that was not generating due to operational outages or poor resource availability and still had to meet any firm volume commitments (as detailed in our P99 Hedge That Wasn’t white paper).
This is precisely what happened on Aug. 15, 2019, between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. Cloud cover developed over much of West Texas, causing a drop in solar generation that contributed to real-time power prices reaching $9,000/MWh. Solar projects with a fixed volume swap and affected by the cloud coverage were left in a very painful financial position, as they would need to pay market prices for the generation they were short under their contract.

In 2020, Texas experienced significantly lower power prices. ERCOT West ATC real-time prices averaged $33/MWh in August 2020, compared to $131/MWh in August 2019, a 75% drop.
Solar-specific value dropped as well: Solar generation in the ERCOT West region was worth just $52/MWh in August 2020, an 80% reduction in value from August 2019.
One thing is clear: Projects and offtakers that benefited from 2019’s volatility were much less profitable in 2020. For solar projects with firm volume commitments, summer 2020 offered a reprieve, as lower weather-driven volatility resulted in more stable contract performance.
Projects and offtakers alike in Texas will be watching the weather closely in 2021, as they remain highly sensitive to price volatility and whether or not their projects are performing as expected during high-priced hours.

4. Solar in CAISO stabilizes after five years of shape decline. After five years of consistent degradation in shape scalar, solar projects in CAISO (the California Independent System Operator region) bounced back in 2020 with a slight uptick in value.
While solar shape remained near record lows of around 80% of the ATC price, this is a material uptick from the prior year’s value, which for many California solar projects was below 70%. The increase is attributable in part to price spikes driven by the heatwave in August.
Going forward, we will be watching this shape value closely as hundreds of megawatts of battery storage capacity come online in 2021 and increase the grid’s ability to shift solar generation to meet market demand.
