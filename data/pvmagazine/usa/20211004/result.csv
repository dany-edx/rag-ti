The projects, which are expected to be operational by Q3 2022, are located in Cortland, Onondaga, and Madison Counties.
As for the electricity generated by the portfolio, 40% of the offtake is purchased by large commercial and industrial customers, managed by DSD. The other 60% will be managed by Source Renewables and be purchased by residential and small commercial customers. The companies did not share what percentage of the generation will be going to low- and middle-income (LMI) customers. Projects that seek NY-Sun incentives must have at least 35% of nameplate capacity dedicated to LMI customers.
This deal marks the second transaction between DSD and Source Renewables in the last 10 months. Last December, DSD announced the acquisition of a three-project, 17 MW community solar energy portfolio in New York.
“Source Renewables was a great partner the first time around, and we were ecstatic to re-engage and do more business together,” says Kevin Hu, Manager, Asset Acquisitions at DSD. “Their disciplined and entrepreneurial approach makes it easy to work with them and saves us money, time, and resources.”

DTE said this is one of many new solar projects it plans to bring online by 2025.
The array will be built on a capped landfill and greenfield sites owned by the City of Ann Arbor. When built, the city will serve as the project’s anchor tenant, buying any power not subscribed to by other customers. A township will receive priority as the project’s first subscriber, helping it achieve its 100% renewable energy goal.
DTE is issuing a request for proposal for the project’s engineering, procurement and construction. The project has an anticipated commercial operation date in 2023.
The MIGreenPower program has subscriptions from the University of Michigan, Washtenaw Community College, Ann Arbor SPARK,  small businesses, and more than 6,000 residential customers.
DTE has a portfolio of more than 50 solar and wind facilities that generate enough power for 700,000 homes. Over the next two years, DTE said it will double its clean energy generation, and inject $2 billion into renewable energy infrastructure.

The finalized energy storage guidelines state that if an energy storage project doesn’t run for 15% out of of a 52 week period, it will be disqualified for the whole year. If that level of performance occurs in a second year, then the project loses its SMART incentive entirely.
A second energy storage-related item includes a technical financial “true up” on DC coupled solar-plus-energy storage. This true up takes into account current conversions as the electricity moves from solar production to battery storage and then to the power grid. Using the equation below, the state will calculate the financial difference once a year based on what is measured at the meter, and submit a payment to the project owner.

The changes also refine community solar incentives and maps, including a requirement for additional monthly and annual data, as well as updated maps of impacted populations.

The DOER also opened public comment periods on two items. The state will now use the online OLIVER Maps tool to determine prime farmland. Developers must also follow land use guidelines as the state seeks to protect more prime land from development.
According to some solar developers, these new limitations will remove 90% of Massachusetts land from solar development opportunities.
When the SMART program launched, pv magazine USA predicted that the National Grid portion would fill up immediately due to a build up of projects, and it did. National Grid suggested that this was a surprise as it put hundreds of megawatts of projects into long-term studies. The state later opened an investigation to determine the source of the failure.
The DOER has since moved forward by doubling the solar capacity of the SMART program. But as the article stated, these regulations have not been finalized. This leaves that same segment of the state partially on hold for the SMART program – along with the new solar construction that entails – while SMART II is finalized.
Predictably, these accounts – which have been put on hold – are growing in volume.

The LOGR-S integrates with NRG’s solar resource monitoring (SRM) system, allowing users to plug in to their solar array’s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network.
NRG Systems said its LOGR-S is compatible with most commonly-used SRM sensors. It receives both analog and digital measurements, and has an optional PV soiling measurement input channel. The device has a 1 Hz sampling interval, and a one-minute averaging interval. It is equipped with 14 analog channels, 24 serial channels, two PV input channels for soiling measurement.
The data logger has 8 GB storage capacity to keep up to a 90-day backlog of historical real-time data, and can be programmed for automated delivery of historical data.
The aluminum enclosure measures 190.5 x 101.6 x 101.6 millimeters. Modular design makes the data logger scalable, and NRG said its applications are applicable to projects of all types.
NRG said it offers customers in-the-field remote trainings and installation services, and the logger includes a two-year warranty.
The data logger joins NRG’s SRM system, which delivers site-specific data including solar irradiance, module temperature, soiling conditions, and other relevant meteorological conditions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/04/why-the-u-s-would-gain-from-a-domestic-renewable-energy-supply-chain/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",Why the U.S. would gain from a domestic renewable energy supply chain,"The Center for American Progress (CAP) released an analysis that said the next decade presents the best opportunity to onshore supply chains, creating thousands of U.S. jobs, pursuing environmental and human well-being goals, and improving national resilience in times of global struggle.
Manufacturing is a boon to the economy; it supports local communities, often providing quality middle-class livelihoods for working people, said CAP. The 11 million manufacturing workers in the U.S. earn 13% more in hourly compensation than comparable workers in other industries, and have advantages in healthcare and retirement benefits, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
(Read: “Crossroads Solar: Panels made by former prison inmates“)
Manufacturing can have other impacts on the broader economy, as well. CAP said that the value of manufacturing when downstream outputs aren’t considered is about 11% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Its value is closer to one-third of GDP when the downstream effect on other industries is included. For example, a domestically sourced solar module would support industries including metals sourcing, refining, component manufacturing, assembly, and final end-user sale. 
Manufacturing is responsible for one-third of global GHG emissions, and iron and steel production alone produces about 11% of emissions, said CAP. China accounts for more than half of the world’s steel production, and it produces the metal with upwards of double the emissions intensity of U.S.-made steel.

CAP said onshoring renewable energy supply chains comes with national security benefits to the U.S. The Covid-19 pandemic exposed some of the risks to health and well-being of U.S. citizens created by “just-in-time” supply chains. While current global goods sourcing methods have cost advantages in ordinary times, they have proven fragile and unreliable in times of global struggle. 
(Read: “Recycling: a key in the U.S. quest for lithium-ion battery supply chain relevancy”) 
If renewable energy supply chains remain concentrated in foreign jurisdictions, policymakers will face a choice between improving U.S. energy sustainability and tying the U.S. economy to foreign influence and coercion. 
The CAP analysis suggested that federal policy is one lever that can be used to activate U.S. domestic renewable supply chain growth. The recently introduced Clean Energy for America Act sets a 30% tax credit for investments in renewable energy facilities or electric grid improvements. Qualifying facilities in disadvantaged communities could increase the credit to 40%. 
To support U.S. sourcing, a domestic content credit under the act would increase the tax credit by an additional 10% of the total investment. “Domestically made” means at least 55% of the total cost of the components can be attributed to domestically produced items. 
And, developers that are unable to take advantage of the tax credit due to limited tax liability can receive a direct cash payment, with the caveat that they must be “domestically made” to qualify for this payment type. 
The strategy is new in that it incentivizes onshoring through the tax code, rather than by setting public procurement requirements. It also extends incentives to private actors, unlike the Buy American Act, which only applies to federal agencies and their contractors. CAP said by guiding private markets, the credit has the potential to influence the renewable energy sector to move toward domestic sourcing in a way that was only previously possible for industries that heavily depend on federal contracts, like aerospace and defense.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/04/greenbacker-adds-two-denver-airport-solar-projects-to-its-portfolio/,"ACQUISITIONS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COLORADO",DAVID WAGMAN,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",Greenbacker adds two Denver airport solar projects to its portfolio,"Denver International Airport said it started work on two solar arrays with a combined generating capacity of 18.5 MW. The arrays will produce around 36 million kWh of electricity every year.
Work is underway on the first solar array, which is slated to enter service in the first quarter of 2022. The second array then will start construction with a goal to enter service in the third quarter.
Through a partnership with Greenbacker Renewable Energy, the airport will buy electricity via long-term power purchase agreements that are expected to save it $3 million over 25 years.
Greenbacker bought the two pre-development projects from Denver-based Oak Leaf Energy Partners. The projects are known as DIA 7 and DIA 8 (12.4 MWdc and 6.0 MWdc, respectively). They will join several operational solar assets that Greenbacker already owns at the airport—including two community solar gardens.
Airports across the country have been looking to increase power resilience and reliability after several high-profile power outages led to thousands of cancelled flights and passenger travel disruptions.
The issue gained international attention a week before Christmas in 2017 when a fire in an underground electrical system knocked out power for 11 hours at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International airport, one of the world’s busiest. Air traffic was disrupted across the United States, and more than 1,000 flights into and out of Atlanta were canceled.
Federal aviation regulators previously worried that siting solar energy systems at U.S. airports could produce a potentially dangerous glint and glare effect on pilots on final approach. The FAA has since concluded that, in most cases, the glint and glare is not much different than what pilots routinely deal with from lakes and streams, glass-faced buildings, parking lots, and similar features.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/04/interconnecting-solar-to-the-grid-an-aggressively-opaque-process/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",Interconnecting solar to the grid: An aggressively opaque process,"A pair of newly released documents reveal how the work of renewable energy developers has brought about major improvements to the accessibility and quality of publicly available power grid data.
The documents also show that renewable project development has been bankrolling grid upgrades for years.
First, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) released Key Decisions for Hosting Capacity Analysis. The document is described as a tool for regulatory staff and stakeholders to identify the critical decisions that go into developing a public facing, state level, power grid Hosting Capacity Analysis (HCA) map set.
And while the analysis was released as a tool for policy makers to learn how HCA maps are deployed, it also painted a picture of the data collection work needed to catalogues the vast, detailed information describing the “largest machines in the world.” The broad volume of information needed by solar developers also drove the development of these tools.

IREC proposed three main options for using the HCA map tool:
Solar developers already use these hosting capacity maps to mitigate siting challenges. If a local substation or set of power lines appear to be overloaded, developers are more likely to avoid the location.

The above hosting capacity map of solar-heavy New Bedford, Massachusetts, shows that many power lines in the region are already at maximum capacity (burgundy colored lines). By itself, this information does not fully signal whether or not solar can be installed.
The type of information delivered in these maps varies by state, with IREC’s report presenting a commonly shared set of information. The substation information below shows some of what might be found in the maps.
Of course, the electric utilities have had this information all along, they simply weren’t collecting or sharing it in an organized manner. Access to the information required the sort of byzantine search process that only a monopoly industry with little outside pressure can get away with.

So why is this information being made available now? Well, mostly because the distributed solar industry spent years pressuring the electric utility companies with their projects. Electric utilities hold billions of dollars in publicly funded assets, and yet were unable to provide clear records.
Developers had to challenge utilities so that their projects could exist. Interconneting solar to the grid was – and still is – an aggressively opaque process.
The other emerging reality is that on the large scale, solar and wind power are upgrading the transmission power grids as part of their required installations.
The second report, from the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), Just and Reasonable? Transmission Upgrades Charged to Interconnecting Generators Are Delivering System-Wide Benefits, showed that utility-scale upgrades by wind and solar power in the Midwest are bringing greater benefit to all electricity generators. It also showed that utilities have frequently violated standard cost sharing rules.
Per ACORE’s report, interconnection rules in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region stipulate that 90% of the cost of significant upgrades – 345 kilovolt powerlines and larger – are to be paid for by the newly interconnecting generators. Others already connected to the grid pay 10% of those upgrade fees. In the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) managed region, newly interconnecting generation must pay all of the upgrade costs.
It might, intuitively, seem as if newly connected generation should foot the bill for its own, necessary grid upgrades. However, evidence shows that these upgrade costs are not equitable.
The first point is that practically all new generation across the nation now comes from solar and wind (including the MISO and SPP power grid regions). New solar and wind developments are currently shouldering nearly all the costs of upgrades across the power grid.
The second point is that the massive benefits these grid upgrades provide – many tens of millions of dollars annually – are passed on to existing generators, and society in general.
In the chart below, ACORE research lists 12 power grid upgrades driven by renewable energy, along with the costs for and benefits of those upgrades. Across all the projects, roughly $1 billion in benefits (APC Savings) flowed not to renewable projects, but to the whole of the power grid.

If we’re honest about our current power grid development reality, we will accept that it is renewables that have clearly been footing the bill for upgrades to the power grid. Cost-benefit accounting has revealed inequities which hamper technological progress, potentially affecting future grid security.
As soon as we admit these faults exist, utilities and developers can start to compromise on more equitable process development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/04/california-legislators-show-support-for-community-solar-proposal/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",California legislators show support for community solar proposal,"A group of California state lawmakers sent a letter to state regulators voicing their support for a Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) proposal to compensate subscribers to community solar projects based on the value of a project’s generation at the time it’s provided to the grid.
Under the “Net Value Billing Tariff” developers would build solar systems 5 MW or smaller in capacity. This capacity would be open for subscription to low-income and disadvantaged customers, who would otherwise be limited in their access to solar. The proposal also includes an Environmental Justice-Low Income market transition credit to boost the value of the program.
Advocates for the proposal call it a cost-effective way to drive the development of a community solar-plus-storage market that will expand equity and solar access to underserved communities, save consumers money, create jobs, and help meet state energy and climate mandates.
Image: Neighborhood Power
CCSA said up to 50% of Californians currently cannot access solar energy for various reasons, including the up-front costs of rooftop, or not being able to put panels on the roofs of their dwellings because they are renters. According to the letter, only 11% of net-metered rooftop solar systems have been deployed in the state’s 25% most disadvantaged communities to date.
Last year, the California Energy Commission adopted the Sacramento Municipal Utility District’s (SMUD) community solar proposal, the first adopted under the 2019 Energy Code. This program allows customers to subscribe to community solar projects 20 MW or less in capacity, and SMUD said participants will see charges and receive credits on their bill at a guaranteed annual net benefit of $10 per kilowatt per year.
The proposal essentially looks to expand community solar to the state’s investor-owned utilities, tweaking the model that SMUD set in place.
“Going forward, community solar will be a critical tool needed for compliance with the CEC’s renewable energy mandates for residential and soon, non-residential construction,” said Chris Ochoa, Senior Counsel for Codes, Regulatory and Legislative Affairs for the California Building Industry Association. “There are currently no viable community solar options for meeting these mandates for the majority of the state, and CCSA’s proposal would provide a much-needed solution.”
The proposal is supplemented by a recent report from Vibrant Clean Energy , which found that enabling the continued growth of local, distributed solar can save California $120 billion by 2050. It said community solar is an essential ingredient in the distributed energy mix to build the lowest cost grid, along with rooftop and battery storage. It said the addition of community solar helps to drive the lowest-cost, most efficient grid for underserved communities, the residents of which have traditionally been left behind in the clean energy economy.
Signers of the letter include: State Senator Connie Leyva, State Senator Anna Caballero, State Senator Scott Wiener, State Assembly member David Chiu, and State Assembly member Buffy Wicks.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/04/meyer-burger-coming-to-america/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 4, 2021",Meyer Burger: Coming to America,"Meyer Burger said that it entered the planning stages to construct a 400 MW solar panel assembly facility in the United States.
The company said it currently is in talks with multiple locations to determine the best site, and hopes to begin delivering solar panels from the facility before the end of 2022.
Capital raises and factory announcements at Meyer Burger now appear to be a regular thing. Its European manufactured solar panels will be available in the United States around Thanksgiving via the distribution channel CED Greentech, and it may add other channels at a later date.
This announcement is genuinely exciting. Meyer Burger is one of the world’s leading research and implementation companies developing new solar power technology.
The company was the first to figure out how to deploy monocrystalline passivated emitter and rear contact (monoPERC) solar cells in mass manufacturing via SolarWorld. It also was the first to apply diamond wire cutting in the solar industry, taking advantage of technology which it had previously used in its watch manufacturing business.
The Chinese government deemed monoPERC so important that it deployed military hackers to steal it. The theft resulted in the United States placing tariffs on Chinese solar cells under the Obama administration.
The technology also helped drive the wave of solar cell efficiency growth for commodity solar panels that took us from just past 16% toward and beyond our current 22%.
In a repeat of history, solar diamond wire cutting technology has also spread broadly and quickly away from Meyer Burger’s control. Both monoPERC and diamond wire cutting are now dominant industry technologies.
 Meyer Burger August 2021 Corporate Presentation
Today, Meyer Burger’s path has changed. The company will no longer provide its technology to third parties. Instead, it will manufacture the solar panels that arise from its own technological prowess.
The company published a 2027 corporate goal of a modest 7 GW per year cell and module manufacturing capacity. Presumably, an assessment of the proposed 7 GW/year capacity delivered by Meyer Burger’s solar team convinced the company to pivot downstream into a very competitive marketplace.
The analysis below is from one of the company’s corporate presentations.

This pivot came mostly as a surprise.
Only two years ago, Meyer Burger made an impression with this author via deploying hardware into the REC Solar Group’s heterojunction Alpha solar panel. Meyer Burger’s equipment was also briefly inside of short-lived SolarTech Universal of South Florida.
Additionally, it had a “special relationship” with perovskite company Oxford PV. Meyer Burger put $43 million directly into the company, and likely hired employees to service Oxford’s unique machinery needs. In a spiritual sense, Oxford PV was seen by some as the tip of Meyer Burger’s technological spear.
That relationship has now changed. Meyer Burger will now be the sole global supplier of its own heterojunction solar panels, and later, advanced solar panels.
This move wasn’t as surprising. Meyer’s Burger’s disappointment in intellectual property law was made public when it exited the diamond wire manufacturing market several years ago.
 Meyer Burger January Investor Presentation
The new U.S. factory announcement made reference to the company’s standard heterojunction solar module and SMART wire technologies. pv magazine USA was informed that Meyer Burger aims to deliver its recently announced solar roof tiles to the United States, as well as its home European markets.
In a podcast interview this summer, Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt was asked about the complex relationship with perovskite tandem solar cell manufacturer Oxford PV.
He stated that Meyer Burger is among a few companies with the skills needed to advance perovskite tandem cells from research labs into the real world, much like its previous accomplishments with monoPERC.
