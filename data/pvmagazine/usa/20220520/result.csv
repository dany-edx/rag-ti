The loan program connects homeowners with 25-year loans with low annual interest rates starting at about 3.1%. Typically, 25-year loans carry interest rates of 7% or more, so the program offers significant savings, plus access to financing that may otherwise be inaccessible to low- to middle-income families.
“At a time of rising energy prices and geopolitical instability, it is more important than ever that all families have access to affordable, reliable, homegrown clean energy. A person’s FICO score shouldn’t prevent them from being able to lower their energy bills and participate in the solution to the climate crisis,” said Andy Posner, Capital Good Fund Founder and CEO.
One of the program’s most recent customers, Maria Hildalgo, received a $38,000 loan for her 8 kW solar array, making her one of the first in her community to have residential solar.
“I decided I wanted to own my solar panels for many reasons. It is cheaper than my electric bill, the tax credits are great, and it is good for the environment. As a mother, I want to protect my children’s future, financially and environmentally. By giving me this loan, Capital Good Fund has made it possible for me to realize this dream,” said Hidalgo. “I hope to see more solar around me and I also hope others who choose solar are as lucky as me to work with a community-oriented lender like Capital Good Fund.”
Capital Good Fund is a US Treasury-certified community development financial institution that works to advance a poverty-free, inclusive green economy through equitable loans. It assists with a variety of needs, including renewable energy and energy efficiency home upgrades, immigration expense assistance, and COVID-19 related expense assistance.
Conrad Geyser, principal at Cotuit Solar, praised the program, commenting, “It offers an easy, non-secured, fixed-rate loan that gives clients financing to adopt solar without a lot of trouble.”
Ronald Bennett, president of Got Sun Go Solar agreed, sharing, “Solar energy is an affordable alternative, and Capital Good Fund is making that statement more of a reality with their financial solutions. I am proud to work with a partner who shares in this passion and works to promote an overall greener environment.”
Since its founding in 2009, the Capital Good Fund has financed over 9,000 loans totaling more than $20 million with a 95% repayment rate and graduated over 1,800 people from their community coaching program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/20/no-cost-solar-plus-storage-planned-for-residents-and-businesses-in-washington-d-c-area/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,WASHINGTON, D.C.",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 20, 2022",No cost solar-plus-storage planned for residents and businesses in Washington D.C. area,"Electriq Power, Inc. a provider of intelligent and integrated energy storage solutions, announces its partnership with SEDC Solar, that aims to provide complete solar and battery storage systems to low- to middle-income (LMI) homeowners, churches, and businesses across the Washington D.C. metro area.
The program will provide rooftop solar panels, battery installation, and ongoing repairs and maintenance for 20 years at no cost to the home or business owner. Financed through local and federal government tax incentives, the program will help lower utility costs and provide reliable backup energy to some of Washington’s most economically distressed wards, as well as other areas of the National Capital Region.
“We’re proud to continue our efforts to expand access to reliable and affordable clean energy in communities that will be impacted by climate change,” said Michele Tihami, Chief Revenue Officer of Electriq Power. “We’re happy to have found a partner in SEDC Solar that believes the benefits of energy storage and renewable energy generation should be available to all, regardless of economic status.”
Electriq is no stranger to such a program. The company is currently partnering on a similar program with the City of Parlier, Calif., a rural farming community in the state’s Central Valley. Both programs seek to expand access to renewable energy where home solar and storage would typically be economically out of reach. Definitions of LMI households vary, but in the United States are commonly considered to be those earning less than 80% of the area median income. In California’s San Francisco County, for example, the household would have to make less than around $95,310 to qualify
The benefits extend to the local community with job creation and training in technical installation and repairs, as well as roles in both sales and marketing. As an example, for every 50 homes or 12 churches, the program hires and trains one employee to ensure system efficiency, quality, and to further the program’s reach within local communities.
Another potential effect of such programs is spillover, which has been shown in several studies to occur when a neighbor sees that a neighbor has installed solar, and they become interested and are “primed” for adopting solar themselves. It appears that is true for LMI households as well as others, according to recent research from Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.
“SEDC Solar is a vehicle for people to Do Well and Do Good at the same time,” says Thomas Jones, Manager of SEDC Solar. “There is a true opportunity to provide equitable solutions to communities in the D.C. area and we’re proud to call Electriq Power a partner in this endeavor.”
SEDC Solar is a Washington D.C. based Opportunity Zone Business whose mission is to deliver solar, create jobs and enrich the communities that they serve. Their initial focus in Washington D.C. is in Wards 8,7, and 4, providing solar and storage to homes, businesses, and churches at no cost. SEDC Solar gets its funding from the NetZero Opportunity Zone Fund.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/20/solar-jobs-80000-trained-in-the-last-three-decades-over-the-next-three-years-double-that/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 20, 2022","Solar jobs: 80,000 trained in the last three decades, over the next three years… double that","Solar has gone on an impressive journey, rising from a fledgling technology to a relevant part of the overall power generation mix, and the dominant technology in newly deployed projects. In 2012, about 2.7 GW of solar was reported to be active by the Energy Information Administration, and now, as of the end of 2021, 92.5 GW are installed. That’s an increase of over 3000% in nine short years. 
Now, solar is set to go through another stage of rapid growth, spurred by high targets of clean energy procurement set at the federal, state, utility, and corporate levels.  The Biden Administration has set its target for 100% carbon pollution-free energy by 2035, suggesting this ramp-up must continue to accelerate if we are to hit the target.
This equates to a lot of panels on the ground and on our roofs, but it also means that a new generation of solar workers will need to be trained. That is the aim of Solar Energy International (SEI), to train and prepare a skilled solar workforce to carry us through the energy transition. Elizabeth Sanderson, executive director of SEI joined pv magazine to discuss this growth.
“We as an organization are trying to help fill that pipeline. In 30 years, we trained 80,000 people, in the next three years, we are going to be training double that,” said Sanderson.
Sanderson said that anywhere from 900,000 to 1.5 million US solar jobs will be needed by 2035 to stay on target. That’s multiples above the roughly 230,000 solar workers today. The range accounts for the fact that the US may find itself supporting a new generation of domestic manufacturing jobs.

That kind of growth is exciting, but there are some near-term hurdles the industry must vault for the growth to stay on track. The highest hurdle, Commerce’s investigation into the alleged anti-circumvention violations of Chinese solar panel exporters, is causing pains this year. The uncertainty caused by the potential 50 to 250% tariffs is causing many developers to have to cancel projects, and that in turn leads to job losses.
As a result, the Solar Energy Industries Association cut its deployment forecast in half for the year and said as many as 100,000 jobs could be lost. Sanderson joins the industry in calling for Commerce to swiftly end the investigation in whatever legal capacity they have to do so. 
Commerce’s decision is due in August, though it will likely take longer for the tariffs to be implemented, if they are implemented at all. Until then, Sanderson said delays and cancellations represent an opportunity to reinvest in the workforce, making sure that employees are well trained for when the installations start rolling out again.
SEI is actively expanding both its online and hands-on solar training programs, which include training for energy storage and other ancillary components to a solar array. It is also preparing for a new generation of domestic manufacturing jobs, though Sanderson said the current policy landscape needs improvement to better support these jobs.
Domestic manufacturing
Sanderson said recent policy actions at the federal level are poorly aligned with federal deployment goals. The Commerce investigation puts a lot of existing jobs in jeopardy, and it doesn’t create a long-term solution to support domestic manufacturing.
“You can’t cut off the supply chain now and expect to have a healthy industry,” said Sanderson.
She said policy like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America bill, which is tied up political purgatory in the Build Back Better Act, and a long-term extension of the solar investment tax credit would be more legitimate, long-term industrial policy that could make a real impact on this new generation of solar careers.
Sanderson said, “There can’t just be a stick, there needs to be a big carrot, and it has to be focused and not waiting for big agreements [like Build Back Better.]”
Impactful training
Solar Energy International has a global reach, training in North America, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. For the US, it has translated all its learning materials into both English and Spanish and has an evolving set of tools to serve a diversifying workforce.

The organization trains both using online resources and has an increasing hands-on training impact. SEI has developed expertise in hands-on learning for over 30 years, and it continues to refine its practice, partnering with community colleges, universities, social organizations, private companies, and more, to establish learning laboratories for the long-term.
SEI also works with Invenergy and Lafayette Square on a program called Reactivate, a community solar platform supporting development in marginalized communities. It is working with the organization to build labs directly in these communities, creating customized hands-on educational centers within the community.
SEI’s work expands beyond just training, as well. It works closely with private companies to launch markets and support a healthy job market in the communities it trains. The company also gets involved in community and stakeholder engagement, educating decision makers on the many benefits of solar.
Globally, solar is set to take center stage over the next couple of decades. As many as 12 million solar workers may be in employment worldwide in 2050, and as we build our decarbonized future, Solar Energy International will be ramping up its capabilities to support an educated, diverse, quality workforce for years to come.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/20/nextracker-announces-second-dedicated-steel-line-for-tracker-components/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TRACKERS,ARIZONA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 20, 2022",Nextracker announces second dedicated steel line for tracker components,"Tracker manufacturer, Nextracker, announced a new manufacturing line dedicated to producing steel tracker components for use in utility-scale solar power plants at Atkore’ Phoenix, Arizona facility, which has been expanded and reconfigured with new capacity dedicated to Nextracker products.
According to Nextracker, the move was made in part to ensure that the company has a dedicated supply of critical materials in the strategic solar market of the Southwestern United States and is well-positioned to support key customers in the region, with the company highlighting Arizona utility, Arizona Public Service (APS), as one such key customer.
“Building out our manufacturing capacity with partners across the US allows us to protect customers from cost volatility, steel supply risk and delays in logistics,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “Partnering with Atkore in Phoenix provides product in the epicenter of the Southwest’s rapidly growing region from a population and power perspective and ensures that best in class product is available to enable that demand to be served with clean, affordable solar power.”
Nextracker already has plans for the first components created in the Atkore facility. According to the company, newly-manufactured components will be used in the construction of APS’ 150 MW Agave solar project. That project will be Arizona to its core, featuring First Solar modules and being constructed by Arizona-based McCarthy Building Companies.
Securing steel
Today’s announcement marks the second steel manufacturer to add a dedicated Nextracker production line in as many months. In April, Nextracker and JM Steel, a division of JENNMAR USA, announced a partnership under which a dedicated solar tracker production line was built on the campus of a new Steel Dynamics manufacturing facility near Corpus Christi, Texas.
The Steel Dynamics facility utilizes electric arc furnaces in its manufacturing, which have been described as a “next-generation” process for steel fabrication, one which can lead to electric arc furnace facilities being up to 75% less carbon-intensive than traditional blast furnaces. As for the new Atkore manufacturing line, it has not yet been shared whether or not the company will look to institute low-carbon fabrication practices.
Securing steel fabrication to alleviate supply chain concerns and shipping volatility is an emerging trend in the tracker and racking space, one that could hold momentum if the aforementioned market concerns persist. Another prominent name in the space, Terrasmart fabricates its own steel structures in house. In a prior interview with pv magazine, Terrasmart President, Ed McKiernan said that such an approach allows his company to switch up their operations “on a dime,” and to accommodate design and timeline changes for customers.
One issue that Terrasmart has run into, however, is sourcing the steel to enable this process, as steel supply markets have had historically high demand, and can be difficult to navigate as a somewhat-newer entrant. In partnering with an existing name in the industry, Nextracker should be able to forgo some of these sourcing concerns, while still keeping overall costs down and product innovation flexible.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/20/bifacial-solar-modules-shine-in-snowy-environments/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 20, 2022",Bifacial solar modules shine in snowy environments,"As solar costs have dropped, it now makes economic sense to implement them even in the deep north, yet there is concern about the effects of snow on energy generation. While solar panels operate best in colder temperatures, panels covered in snow will generate less energy, known as snow loss.  A study conducted at Western University in Ontario, Canada, shows how to beat snow losses using solar energy systems.
The difference between bifacial and monofacial modules is that bifacial modules absorb light from the front and back, while monofacial only collect sunlight on the front. The study analyzed snow losses on these two types of systems using hourly data including energy, solar irradiation and albedo, the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation.
The researchers found by using bifacial solar modules instead of trading monofacial, snow losses could be cut from double digits to just 2% on an annual basis. The bifacial solar installation had a 19% gain largely from the reflection of the snow compared to the traditional monofacial systems.
The study was conducted at a pair of solar arrays that used both monofacial and bifacial modules, and data was generated in both summer and winter to determine snow loss. A camera was aimed at each of the arrays to track snow cover. A total of 4,826 images were analyzed for each module from November 2020 to March 2021.  Each day 32 images were taken at 15 minute intervals. The researchers used image processing to identify and quantify the snow cover on each module automatically.
The researchers used this information to figure out what the impact of snow was on both arrays when we coupled it with the pyranometer data and energy values coming off the modules, according to Joshua Pearce, lead researcher and John M. Thompson Chair in Information Technology and Innovation at Western University’s Thompson Centre for Engineering Leadership & Innovation.
 
The two major results of this study are that 1) bifacial essentially crush snow losses because they help clear modules much faster than traditional modules, and  2) bifacial modules get a major bump in the winter from snow albedo. The results found monofacial snow losses are in average 33% for winter period, and 16% on an annual basis.
Bifacial systems perform better than monofacial in severe winter conditions as average winter snow losses was 16% and the annual losses were 2% in the worst-case scenario. In addition, there was a bifacial gain of 19% compared to monofacial system during winter.
“Preliminary results suggested bifacial systems performed better, but this study has put the nail in the coffin for monofacial systems in the northern United States and Canada. It is clear all northern solar farms should be using bifacial PV,” said Joshua Pearce.
The paper is published in Renewable Energy. It comes with free software so anyone can replicate the experiment or do other type of snow-PV study using a single camera monitoring of their own. 
A previous study, conducted two  years ago at Sandia National Labs, looked at bifacial modules and trackers and found that bifacial modules overall produced 14% more energy than monofacial modules, in addition to the estimated 35% to 40% boost provided by the dual-axis tracker.
