The bill would allow HOAs to regulate, but not ban, the installation of solar systems.
The rules regarding residential solar that HF 257 would allow mainly pertain to the general health and safety of a system, such as making sure the system is installed by a professional and that panels do not hang off of roofs.
Minnesota is one of 23 states where HOAs may forbid members from adding solar to their homes. Associations typically cite aesthetics and the dubious claim that solar panels lower property values. In fact, a 2019 Zillow report found that homes with residential solar systems sold for 4.1% more than their non-solar neighbors.
(Read “Good solar makes good neighbors, researchers say.”)
Outside of aesthetic concerns, some HOAs have denied homeowners’ requests because the association’s bylaws lack specific rules or that the bylaws were written before residential solar installations became prevalent.
For homeowners,  the Minnesota bill restricts HOA bylaws from reducing a solar system’s power output by more than 20% and from increasing costs by more than $2,000 due to any required modifications. That framework is common in other states and further checks the control that HOAs can have on systems.
HF 257 is currently working its way through the Minnesota House. A companion bill has not yet been introduced in the state Senate.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/22/solar-leaders-urge-biden-to-revoke-trump-tariff-proclamation/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 22, 2021",Solar leaders urge Biden to revoke Trump tariff proclamation,"Seventeen U.S. clean energy CEOs have urged President Joe Biden to repeal the Trump administration’s October 2020 solar tariff proclamation, which the leaders called “punitive” and “ill conceived.”
In a letter to Biden, the CEOs noted that the proclamation increased the 2021 trade tariff rate for imported solar cells and modules and argued that the decision “arbitrarily” revoked the exclusion for bifacial solar panels.
Led by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and supported by the American Clean Power Association (ACP), the letter called attention to the proclamation’s impact to existing solar contracts and discussed how harmful the Section 201 tariffs are to the U.S. economy and the industry’s ability to address climate change. The CEOs asked Biden to return the tariffs to status quo and restore business certainty.
“Billions of dollars’ worth of solar contracts are now at risk because of the October 10 proclamation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA, in a statement. “The president has the opportunity to build a clean energy economy with millions of well-paying jobs, strengthen our nation’s infrastructure, bolster domestic manufacturing, and uplift communities across America. Removing the tariffs is the first step to achieving this vision.”
The CEOs said the letter comes as clean energy companies continue to feel the effects of the tariffs. According to analysis from SEIA, the tariffs have led to a loss of 62,000 solar jobs, $19 billion in missed private-sector investment, and a 26 million metric-ton increase in carbon emissions.
APC CEO Heather Zichal said, “Our country has an industrious and determined solar workforce, from installers and operators to engineers and innovators, and every single one of them will benefit from the repeal of the last administration’s proclamation, which injected uncertainty into the marketplace.”
SEIA and ACP vowed they will continue to work with the Biden administration, the next U.S. trade representative, and other organizations to create more opportunities for domestic solar jobs and products.

Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, has introduced a bill that would implement automated solar permitting in local jurisdictions with over 10,000 residents.
S.B.617, the Solar Access Act, would allow for remote inspections and approvals of residential solar and solar-plus-storage systems, greatly decreasing approval times, cutting permitting costs for local governments and homeowners, and helping California meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals through an easier installation process.
S.B.617 is co-sponsored by SPUR, a California nonprofit focused on logistical solutions for large cities, and Environment California. Assemblymember David Chiu is a principal co-author of the bill, and Sen. Josh Becker San Mateo and Assemblymember Robert Rivas are co-authors.
To institute the automated solar permitting, the bill would lean on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s SolarAPP+: a web-based portal that streamlines and automates permit reviews. The bill attested that the app can be easily implemented into existing local government permitting software.
Pleasant Hill is the first city in California to adopt SolarAPP+ and has already begun processing permits. The City of San Jose also uses online solar permitting and has seen a 600% increase in approvals since upgrading in 2016.
“To fight climate change, we need to dramatically and quickly expand solar energy and energy storage,” said Wiener. “We have seen highly successful examples of automated solar permitting on the local level. It’s time we take the next step and implement a better process in municipalities across the state.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/22/at-a-crossroads-pennsylvania-is-poised-to-turn-to-solar/,"COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,PENNSYLVANIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 22, 2021","At a crossroads, Pennsylvania is poised to turn to solar","Pennsylvania is at a crossroads. The state still mines coal, albeit much less than in the past. And, there’s plenty of fracked natural gas being pumped, but the land rush is gone.
Now, solar developers represent the opportunity knocking at the door with billions of dollars in financial benefits via land lease agreements, construction employment, hardware sales, engineering support, many peripheral jobs — and the research to back the potential solar boom.
Developers anticipate a pair of key Pennsylvania solar programs – Pennsylvania HB531 and SB705 – to be implemented in some manner, sometime “soon.” Anecdotal evidence shows many national solar development companies are now hiring in the state.
What’s more, analysis by the College of Agricultural Studies at Penn State University found that around 1 GW of solar power — on just over 4,000 acres of land — was ready to break ground, pending the approval of those two bills. The anticipated projects already have signed agreements, and have some sort of interconnection and permitting in place.
Multiple revenue streams would go to local firms and landowners from this construction.
Using lease rates of $700 to $1,000 per acre, the Penn State researchers found that landowners would gain $2.9 to $4.2 million a year for 25 to 35 years. There would be a roughly one-off $1.8 billion economic benefit from construction costs flowing to the region’s laborers, engineers, and hardware distributors. Ongoing O&M benefits of $83 million a year would flow to electricians and land management. And, there’d be almost $100 million in general power grid savings spread among all ratepayers.
Lobbyists, researchers, and other groups have variously suggested 6 GW, 7.5 GWac, and 11 GW of solar power through 2030 as potential goals. A total of 11 GW of solar would mean around $1.1 billion in land lease payments alone on 45,000 acres spread over 30 years.
However, the percentage of the state’s electricity from solar power is still small, on the order of 0.31% based on 664 MWdc of total installed capacity. Some might argue that means solar is ripe for opportunity with wide open power lines and substations.
Last year, solar developer Prospect14 (at the time known as Glidepath) said it had sold about as much capacity — 1 GW — in a development deal as the Penn State study covered, and more than is presently installed in Pennsylvania. That offers possible evidence that Pennsylvania solar is positioned for a breakout.
A recent utility integrated resource plan covering half the state seeks roughly 90 MW a year of solar. That bit of evidence, along with the Prospect14 deal and other larger buyer success, suggests that projects at scale can pencil financially with a combination of Renewable Energy Certificates, plus wholesales electricity rates.
If the laws that are being considered move forward, then smaller-sized solar projects soon will be able to sell their electricity into the Pennsylvania market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/22/the-texas-blackout-is-a-man-made-disaster-of-epic-proportions/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,TEXAS",,"FEBRUARY 22, 2021",The Texas blackout is a man-made disaster of epic proportions,"Since the discovery of oil at Spindletop in 1901, Texas has held a strong claim to the title of America’s energy capital.
Based on pre-pandemic production, Texas would rank among the top five countries in the world in terms of oil and gas production. Moreover, it is the top wind power producer in the U.S. and the number two state market for solar.
Founded as an independent Republic, the Lone Star State proudly operates its own independent electric power system, which serves 90% of the state’s electric load.
As my wife and I melted snow this past week to flush the toilets in our 100-year-old East Austin home, located a short walking distance from the Texas State Capitol, it occurred to me more than once that the slope from pride to hubris is slippery and treacherous, much like the steps out our front door and streets all across our frozen and paralyzed state.
For three days we had no heat or power as overnight lows fell to 5°F (-15°C). A week later, line crews were still restoring power to some homes and businesses.
Based on a cruel combination of metrics, the Arctic air that wobbled down from the North Pole and parked itself over Texas is a clear contender for the worst winter storm in a century.
This was a record-breaking storm that likely inflicted record insured losses. Many insurance industry experts and associations already project that this winter storm will constitute the largest insurance claim event in Texas history, both in terms of the cumulative number and the total value of claims.
Some will argue that this is first and foremost a natural disaster. However, the root causes of increasingly severe and extreme weather are proudly made right here in Texas, which is by far the nation’s leading emitter of carbon dioxide.
The electrical blackouts and cascading system failures associated with the 2021 Valentine’s Day weekend Arctic blast were both predicted and entirely avoidable. The power system operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and the state’s natural gas infrastructure suffered similarly in February 2011. Reading the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) report, “Outages and Curtailments During the Southwest Cold Weather Event of February 1–5, 2011: Causes and Recommendations,” we see that the past is prologue for the recent failures.
In February 2011, extreme cold weather caused energy demand to peak even as thermal power plants and natural gas supplies froze up. In order to protect the power system, ERCOT had to call on load-serving entities to shed load by implementing rolling blackouts across their service territories. Over 4 million people were affected and it was many days before heat and power were restored to all customers.
In 2011, Rick Perry was the governor of Texas. One presumes he read the FERC report or knew of its existence. We know for a fact that the winterization and operational measures called for in the report were not implemented. Oops. In reward for a job well done, Perry was awarded leadership of the Department of Energy—a department he famously could not name during a 2012 presidential campaign debate.
Texas politicians, utility regulators, power generators, and grid operators had advance warning regarding the systemic weaknesses associated with un-winterized power generation and natural gas assets. The blackouts and cascading failures associated with the recent deep freeze represent an epic and unconscionable failure of leadership, management, and market design.
In a Harvard Electric Policy Group report, William Hogan, the architect of ERCOT’s energy-only market, notes that, “ERCOT employs an open wholesale market as the basis of short-term reliable electric supply as well as for long-term investments to maintain reliability in the future.”

Scarcity pricing is central to the design of the ERCOT market, which does not include capacity payments, a common mechanism in other wholesale electricity markets for ensuring resource adequacy in the event of an emergency. Faced with a predictably severe cold-weather event, the ERCOT market failed to supply electricity reliably.
For more than 100 hours, energy traded on ERCOT at the market cap price of $9,000 per megawatt-hour. Based on daily load profiles, energy-only revenues following the statewide blackout were likely on the order of $10 billion per day or $40 billion over four days. By comparison, analysts at Houston-based Wood Mackenzie estimate that ERCOT’s energy-only market produced $10 billion in revenues in all of 2020.
The ERCOT market is in many ways the pride of Texas, the embodiment of the state’s independent go-it-alone spirit and its laissez-faire approach to an unregulated free market. By and large, this market has served Texans well, producing low energy costs and the nation’s leading market for renewable energy. This same system also failed the state’s residents and businesses spectacularly in a moment of great need.
Various state leaders offered red meat to their political base, blaming wind turbines, ignoring facts on the ground, sidestepping their own culpability, and otherwise tilting at culture-war windmills. Former governor Perry put forth the straw man that, “Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business.” Happily, one presumes.
One wonders whether Rick Perry himself spent three or more days without electricity during a once-in-a-century winter storm. Watching his breath hang in the air. Watching the thermostat fall. Waiting helplessly for pipes to burst. Taking shelter at a crowded warming center during a virulent pandemic. Raging against the darkness as flames destroyed memories and futures. Sliding into unconsciousness inside a running car parked within a closed garage. Losing loved ones to a frozen slumber.

Electric vehicle registrations in the U.S. in 2020 reached a market share of 1.8%, demonstrating “increased consumer interest for electric vehicles,” according to new analysis from IHS Markit.
December represented the highest monthly share for EV new registrations, at 2.5% of the industry. The firm said that was a record monthly level since it began tracking new vehicle registration data by fuel type.
IHS Markit forecasts EV sales will pass 3.5% nationally in 2021, and continue to increase to more than 10% in 2025. It said that with more than 100 new EV options expected between 2021 and 2025, a continued increase in consumer acceptance and demand will grow as internal combustion engine options are displaced.
EV market share is highest in the Western Region, where 4.8% of all new vehicles registered are EVs. The share is 1.6% in the Northeast, 1.1% in the Southeast, 0.9% in the Southwest Region, and 0.8% in the Midwest region.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chair Richard Glick called on Congress and the Texas state legislature to “rethink” the state’s grid operator’s “go it alone approach” in the wake of rolling blackouts that occurred as generating units failed as demand grew due to a winter storm.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is regulated by the Texas Public Utilities Commission, not by FERC. FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) opened an inquiry to assess what went wrong across the region. Glick was quoted as saying that grid operators such as ERCOT that find themselves “in a bind” may want to reassess their model.
And, in what may be the first of many legal actions stemming from the blackouts, a Dallas law firm filed a lawsuit alleging that ERCOT and electricity transmission company American Electric Power “consciously ignored repeated warnings about weaknesses in the state’s power infrastructure” and therefore are liable for property damage and business interruptions.
The lawsuit is Donald McCarley v Electric Reliability Council of Texas et al., case no. 2021CCV-60188-1, filed in the Nueces County Court at Law.
