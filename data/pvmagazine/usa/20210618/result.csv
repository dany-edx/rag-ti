https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/18/schneider-electric-releases-digital-economy-and-climate-impact-report-offers-efficient-it-solutions/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 18, 2021",Schneider Electric releases digital economy and climate impact report,"Boston-based Schneider Electric released a report outlining its view of how digitized and smart applications will be powered in the coming years.
The Digital Economy and Climate Impact white paper examines the key risks associated with the rise of information technology (IT) in terms of electricity consumption. 
The report predicted an IT-sector related electricity demand increase of nearly 50% by 2030. Despite this sharp increase, Schneider Electric said decarbonization efforts will limit emissions to an increase by 26% over the same period. 
The rise in edge computing was under focus in this report, which explained that these systems are expected to have lower efficiency than hyperscale data centers. 
The report echoed some of the problems proliferated by the high energy use of cryptocurrency mining, and the call for renewables to decarbonize the sector. 
Schneider Electric recommended continued efforts in achieving efficiencies on both IT and energy sides, at both component and system levels.  
Schneider Electric also introduced what it claimed to be one of the industry’s most compact 3 kW uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), dubbed the APC Smart-UPS Ultra. Schneider said the device increases power density by a factor of 2.4 times when compared to prevailing technology.  
The lithium-ion-containing UPS frees up space for edge applications, and reduces time and operational expenditure on maintenance. The use of lithium-ion batteries represents an improvement to the typical lead-acid batteries, extending the life of the storage unit to 8-10 years. 
The company said it has a flexible mounting system, allowing rack, tower, wall or ceiling positions, potentially freeing up space in IT applications. A proprietary cloud-based monitoring system, EcoStruxure, is intended to optimize performance and permits remote monitoring.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/18/two-duke-irps-have-been-shot-down-by-south-carolina-regulators/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,TECHNOLOGY,SOUTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 18, 2021",Two Duke IRPs shot down by South Carolina regulators,"South Carolina regulators rejected Duke Energy’s most recent Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) for two of its subsidiary utilities, Duke Energy Carolina (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), by a 4-2 vote.
A printed copy of the decision was unavailable and the full ruling may not be made public for weeks, if not longer. Even so, the South Carolina Public Service Commission (PSC) demanded that the utilities present modified plans that make a single and clear recommendation, rather than the six scenarios presented across the two IRPs. Regulators also ordered more rigorously calculated future gas prices that take account of solar contract prices.
A representative for Duke told pv magazine that the utility was evaluating the PSC’s decision and that the utility will better understand the implications of the decision once they receive the commission’s order.
The rejected IRPs are the same ones that received poor grades back in February in a report card evaluating the utilities’ generation plans. That report card was handed out by more than a dozen clean energy and environmental justice organizations. It took issue with Duke’s carbon reduction goals, plans to increase customer bills across all IRP scenarios, and low commitment to renewable energy.

“We appreciate there are diverse views on transitioning to a lower carbon future, and we actively engaged stakeholders across South Carolina and North Carolina to solicit input from them to inform the planning process,” the representative told pv magazine.
In response to the PSC’s decision, Tyler Fitch, Vote Solar’s regulatory director for the Southeast said, “Duke Energy’s plans failed to serve the people of South Carolina. He said it was clear that the company “failed to consider the impacts of a changing climate, and its own commitment to a zero-carbon energy system by 2050.” By ignoring these considerations, Fitch said that Duke’s plans would “hurt their own bottom line and their ratepayers’ wallets.”
Vote Solar was one of the clean energy and environmental justice organizations to contribute to Duke’s failing IRP report card.
The two Duke IRPs marked the second and third IRPs to go before South Carolina’s PSC since the state enacted its 2019 Energy Freedom Act. All three IRPs presented since then have been rejected, including Dominion Energy South Carolina’s in December.
The Dominion IRP failed to include a demand-side management resource or power purchasing options. The IRP also did not model any renewable energy additions prior to 2026, or any coal retirements prior to 2028. It also would have raised solar customers’ basic service charge to $19.50 a month, added a “solar subscription fee” of $5.40/kW a month, and slashed the solar export credit that customers could receive.
The rejected IRPs are identical to the two plans Duke utilities submitted to North Carolina, which have yet to be ruled on. The South Carolina ruling is certain to draw attention as there is an ongoing dispute over to whether North Carolina regulators can reject an IRP, an action without precedent. Adding more contention to the matter, the state’s Attorney General asked the commission to reject the plans, and the North Carolina commission’s general counsel said he believes it has the authority to require changes it sees fit before accepting the plans, even without outright rejecting them.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/18/solar-is-as-popular-as-apple-pie-but-some-folks-still-prefer-pecan/,"MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 18, 2021",Solar is as popular as apple pie (but some folks still prefer pecan),"The Pew Research Center published its annual study of American perceptions on climate, energy, and environmental issues. The report broadly found bipartisan, Gen Z, and Millennial preferences for environmental activism.
It found that most Americans support an expansion of solar and wind generation, a cleaner environment for future generations, as well as locally available, affordable renewable energy and the jobs that go along with it.
And, while support for solar and wind remains strong, the support among certain demographics has recently declined.
The report found that expansion of solar and wind is favored by large majorities of U.S. adults. However, support for both soar and wind was down since last year’s poll (in which solar was soaring at 90%).
The poll also found that support increased for nuclear and fossil power. Notably, 50% of the nation’s population approved of the expansion of nuclear power.
But these are only the broad numbers. When Pew accounted for political leanings (Republican/leaning Republican, Democratic/leaning Democratic), and age (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, and Boomer and older), clear demarcations arose.
For instance, Gen Z Democrats – at 60% – were 10 times more likely favor a complete phase out of fossil fuels than Boomers and older Republicans, at 6%.
Predictably, when it comes to phasing out gas and diesel cars, Gen Z was over 5 times as likely to approve – at 73% – than older Republicans – at 14%. Even the statement that the “U.S. should prioritize developing alternative energy” – which 71% of adults agreed with – showed a 50%+ difference in response between the political left and right.
Here it might be interesting to note that while Millennials represent the largest generation in the U.S., the “Boomers and older” category actually spans three generations, and was the largest group in the Pew survey.
When it came to solar and wind power specifically, a large majority of Americans “favor more,” according to the report. Solar topped the charts at greater than two-third support across all ages and political groups. No other energy source had such a high level of support.
However, Republican support for solar and wind has been waning since 2016, with a 13-15 point decline over the past two years.
The research offered no insight into why the trend had occurred.
However, even with this decline, solar power still has broad support on both sides of the political spectrum: about the same as apple pie (polls came out nice and toasty at 92% support in recent polling by Crisco and the American Pie Council).
In contrast to the near universal support for solar power, the question of whether “stricter environmental laws and regulations” were worth the cost resulted in clear partisan separation. Fully 81% of Democrats thought it was worth the economic costs, while 71% of Republicans responded that regulations cost too many jobs and would hurt the economy.
One revealing takeaway is that while almost half of Americans said they believe they are doing enough to combat climate change, their opinions regarding other Americans were not so charitable. Of those polled, 66% said that they believe other Americans are not doing enough.
And, when it came to the work that environmental advocacy groups do, about the same percentage said that advocates are doing too much as those who said they are doing too little.
Americans clearly seem to think that politicians, energy companies, and large corporations have to do more.
When asked, “what to do,” about half of the respondents said that major lifestyle changes will be needed to deal with climate change impact. The other half said that it’s more likely that new developments in technology will address the problems caused by climate change.
And there was broad disagreement on whether those actions should be driven by government or individual choice.
Among the many pieces of legislation President Biden has proposed, at least three showed support, including among three-quarters of those surveyed who said they agree with a requirement that electric utilities use more sources of renewable energy.
A positive political feedback loop may be found here. First, Americans believe Biden’s infrastructure plan will generate clean energy jobs. Second, Americans seem to like the idea of clean local energy jobs. And, last they prefer the clean energy that goes along with creating those jobs.
This synergy is surely a recipe for deploying massive quantities of wind and solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/18/solar-101-it-all-comes-down-to-curb-appeal/,"PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 18, 2021",Solar 101: It all comes down to curb appeal,"When it comes to buying residential solar panels in the United States, the most important factor is curb appeal.
U.S. home equity collectively represents the largest savings account in the country. And because aesthetics are among the most important factors in determining the value of a home, America’s residential solar consumers tend to get a bit, well, persnickety.
So what is it, exactly, that makes a solar panel attractive? At pv magazine USA we believe that all solar panels are beautiful. But we are aware that grumpy neighbors and local HOAs have opinions, too.
The residential solar industry has taken notice of the demand for beautiful, hidden panels, and is now exploring techniques to provide creative and attractive designs.
Image: Tesla
Tesla answered the call by designing a new roofing product – Solar Glass – to hold the solar cells. This product is drop-dead gorgeous, though, sadly, it seems to have been made from unobtanium. So far, Tesla has been struggling to deliver these roofs on time, and growing pains have resulted in startling price increases.
Other manufacturers are experimenting with the “solar shingle” form factor, including Luma Solar and Certainteed. These groups are seeking to replace the standard asphalt shingle with a shingle that contains a solar panel.
GAF Energy is installing a standard solar panel, but adding refinements to smooth the hard edges, and replacing the shingles, but not other roofing material layers. In mid-June, the company said it had finished work on its largest-ever residential solar roofing system, a 31 kW system in California that is expected to produce 50,455 kWh of energy annually.
In Europe, Viridian Solar panels attach flush to the roof, completely replacing roofing material. Sadly, these clever panels are not yet available in the U.S. And for now, nearly all of these designer panels are still niche products.
Standard solar panels with finer aesthetic qualities – thinner, black frames and black backsheets – remain the most common product available.
Installations like Solaria’s, above, represent some of the cleanest lines to be found. The company’s shingled solar cells make it so you only see the black surface of silicon and aluminum framing.
One leading solar panel for residential customers is manufactured in Georgia at the Hanwha Q Cell factory. They’re available, reasonably priced (no import tariffs), and they offer adequate specs and aesthetics.
The Solar Marketplace Intel Report from EnergySage provides a list of potential pieces of hardware to buy. Note that EnergySage’s data does not represent 100% of the residential solar market, although it does offer a solid cross section of higher quality components.
Beyond looks, the reasons to choose one panel over another vary greatly. Efficiency, price, panel size, availability, country of origin, and even the environmental impacts of a panel’s manufacturing process all factor in.
Because the price of solar power systems has fallen, with solar panel prices decreasing even more so, pricing has stopped being the most important factor in a solar purchasing decision. The most important factors today are a combination of efficiency and product quality.
In the most recent Tracking the Sun report from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we see a few the trends emerge as prices drop and efficiencies rise:
However, there is still a premium paid for more efficient solar panels. Sunpower’s Maxeon has  always been the most efficient, and typically the most expensive. Others, like the REC Alpha, LG’s Neon series, Solaria, and soon Meyer Burger’s heterojunction product, are moving into the same higher tier of efficiency greater than 22%.
After this tradeoff of looks vs. efficiency vs. price vs. availability, we turn toward less tangible factors such as location of manufacture, the specific technologies used, and even how much CO2 was emitted during the manufacturing process. These factors lead to the broad variety of panels we see in the market today. Because there are hundreds of different solar panels in the market, it is tough to cover all of them.
For instance, solar panels can be bought from many countries in the world, including the U.S. Some companies exclusively manufacture solar panels, while others – like LG or Panasonic – are part of international conglomerates. You could even buy a solar panel with polysilicon made via mostly hydropower.
Since 2014, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research has shown the viability of painting the surface of a solar panel painted with nano-materials in the factory. And the company Sistine Solar sells its “solar skin”, a custom graphic overlay that preserves 92%-99% of a solar panel’s efficiency while matching the aesthetic of any building.
One final consideration is how much space you have available.
Those with limited roof space may want to take a close look at panel dimensions in order to maximize energy production. Residential panels tend to be roughly 65” long by 39” wide, but sizes are not written in stone (or polysilicon). For example, Sunpower has manufactured 425W panels that measure 72.2” by 40”. And Solaria’s PowerXT 400W panel is extra wide, at 64.72” by 47.4”.
If you’re sketching various configurations, add about 1” between panels for mid-clamps. Also remember that most states require panels to be set back 36” or more from the roof’s ridge. Some states like Massachusetts and Florida do not have any setback restrictions, which allows installation right up to the edge of your roof. Your local building inspectors and contractors should know exactly how much setback is required.
With all of these variables, you can get overwhelmed with choices; it’s kind of like buying a car.
One of the better pieces of advice might be to find a contractor you like and trust, and have her or him recommend products for your home. Lessons you’ve gleaned from this article will help you vet those panels.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/18/how-do-factors-related-to-solar-modules-impact-site-wide-tracker-costs/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 18, 2021",How do factors related to solar modules impact site-wide tracker costs?,"Solar module cell size and module form factor as a whole have increased steadily, leading to module power ratings exceeding 600 W from a 60-cell PERC module. 
The module mounting world, specifically the tracker industry, has had to adjust quickly to these new form factors. The changes that tracker companies must make can send ripple effects through a project and its economics.
Because trackers are tied to high-functioning and profitable solar sites, understanding the tied-in costs associated with different module weights and form factors will significantly impact planning for optimal project profitability.
Array Technologies
In an attempt to inform developers, EPCs, and module manufacturers about trends in module characteristics and how they impact tracker costs, Array Technologies and PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) released a new whitepaper, Larger PV Modules: Breaking Down Site-wide Costs.
The report examined 13 modules from various manufacturers, and compared optimized tracker designs for each module. The study used relative tracker costs and module characteristics to determine the primary factors affecting tracker cost.
Tracker designs included in the study were based on Array’s DuraTrack HZ v3 product, although results generally apply to other horizontal single-axis solar tracker products with similar architecture. All of the included cases were evaluated with minimal snow/wind/ seismic load values and only full-row configurations were considered, no partial rows were included.
The intent of the study was to provide perspective into the module-tracker cost relationship for developers’ project roadmaps. It was written to offer a general look at how module tweaks and adjustments take monetary shape in tracker costs.
The study partners found a strong correlation between module length per weight ratio and lower tracker costs. This means that a longer, lighter module will regularly improve tracker cost per watt.

The report said this is because lower module weight allows for longer tracker rows. Longer rows are a frequent design goal for reducing tracker cost because they maximize tube span lengths and minimize the number of required foundations. Foundation count makes up a large part of the tracker cost stack.
Long modules also have more length in the East-West axis to generate power, so as modules are added to the tracker their power per unit length in the North-South axis is greater. Because of this, module length typically correlates to higher tracker row power, reducing tracker cost per watt.
That conclusion naturally raises questions, as it seems to contradict itself. Would a longer module not also be heavier because of increased material?
“One of the bigger contributing factors to this is the thickness of the glass used [in the module].” Director of Applications Engineering at Array Technologies and co-author of the study, Cody Norman, told pv magazine. Norman said that thicker glass and heavier modules do not have a direct, linear correlation to tracker costs. However, greater module weights require more damping force in the tracker. That means either larger dampers or extra dampers have to be added to support the module’s weight.
Module efficiency is the most direct correlation between module characteristics and reduced tracker costs.

Norman explained that as modules become more efficient, more watts per area are generated, improving the resulting cost per watt for the tracker. “I expect that extends to other primary components in the PV system, as well,” he said.
The long module correlation may not always hold true as hardware was analyzed under ideal conditions. The downside of long modules is that they increase the total module area supported by the tracker structure. In turn, this proportionally increases the tributary area of wind and snow pressure on the tracker structure. On sites with high design wind speeds or ground snow loads, a relatively long module will have higher tracker structure costs than a relatively short module.
Although longer module lengths over module weight seems to correlate well with reducing tracker costs per watt, as wind loads increase, Norman said, “your structure costs will increase faster.” He said that a longer module “is going to require more structural support as those wind speeds increase, compared to a smaller module, and that’s just because that module length turns directly into more area that’s increasing those forces on the structure.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/18/sunrise-brief-lg-energy-batteries-for-1-2-gwh-moss-landing-energy-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 18, 2021",Sunrise brief: LG Energy batteries for 1.2 GWh Moss Landing energy storage project,"South Korea-based LG Energy Solution said it supplied Vistra’s Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in California with its Transportable Rack (TR1300). The 300 MW/1.2 GWh facility connected to the power grid in December, and LG Energy announced details of its involvement in mid-June.
The Moss Landing project uses more than 4,500 TR1300 battery racks. The TR1300s were pre-assembled at the factory prior to shipment to reduce construction time and associated installation costs. Factory assembly also ensured consistent quality of the assembled rack systems, the company said.
LG Energy said the TR1300 was double-stacked to boost energy density and enabled the full 1.2 GWh of battery capacity to fit inside the existing turbine house.
LG Energy said the TR1300 meets fire safety standards, and racks have been tested to ensure any fire event is not propagated to adjacent battery racks.

In late May, LG Energy Solution said it would replace, at its own cost, lithium-ion battery cells used for certain energy storage products that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program came after overheating incidents were reported.
The company said in a statement that it determined that there were issues in the early production processes for electrodes used in potentially affected batteries. Reports said the batteries were produced at the company’s Nanjing factory in China. The replacement program could cost around $350 million.
New batteries will incorporate manufacturing process improvements. The company said it also would implement remote modifications to reduce the potential for overheating while owners wait for their replacement units. LG Energy Solution also will update its battery diagnostic and control software. And it said that field inspections would be undertaken to monitor and minimize the potential for further incidents.
In an April 2019 accident involving one of the company’s utility-scale lithium-ion battery arrays at an Arizona Public Service location, a thermal runaway event in a lithium-ion cell triggered a chain of events that led to an accumulation of gases in the container that housed the batteries. Those gases exploded when first responders opened an access door to investigate reports of smoke coming from the container. Two firefighters were seriously injured in the explosion.
In a report released last July, the utility and its third-party investigator said that evidence pointed to the failure of a single lithium-ion cell as triggering the events. LG challenged that finding, saying that the utility’s report missed a number of details about the accident. Those details indicated, LG said, that the cell thermal runaway began due to “intense heating” caused by a heat source “such as external electrical arcing” on one of the battery racks.
Quidnet Energy and Emissions Reduction Alberta with funding from the Government of Alberta, launched a project to develop a low-cost, multi-gigawatt geologic energy storage resource in Alberta, using Quidnet’s modular pumped hydro storage technology.
The project received C$5 million ($4.04 million) in funding from ERA and will take place at Quidnet’s geologic test site in Brooks, Alberta.
The technology stores energy in the form of water compressed between layers of shale and enables renewable energy projects to store excess energy, to be released when the grid needs power.
Quidnet is developing energy storage projects in Texas, Ohio, and New York. It claimed per-kilowatt installed costs at less than 50% of batteries and traditional pumped storage, and said its systems can be configured for applications with 10 hours or more of storage duration.
Quidnet is working with the Energy Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) through its Duration Addition to electricitY Storage (DAYS) program to develop the company’s technology in power markets across the U.S. by planning and executing exploratory wells to characterize, evaluate, and validate this geologic resource. In April, the company said it had completed project development of the exploration well sites and achieved resource performance targets during exploration well hydraulic testing.
Siemens Energy said it will provide two SGT6-5000F turbines to power Omaha Public Power District’s (OPPD) new Turtle Creek Station Peaking Plant in Nebraska.

The simple cycle turbine will be used to modernize backup generation in the public utility’s fleet. The turbines offer the ability to run on up to 30% hydrogen and biodiesel in support of future technology advancements.
Siemens Energy aims to have all its new gas turbines capable of burning 100% hydrogen by the end of 2030.
The Turtle Creek Station is part of an OPPD project to develop up to 600 MW of solar generation and up to 600 MW of modernized replacement and backup natural gas generation resources.
