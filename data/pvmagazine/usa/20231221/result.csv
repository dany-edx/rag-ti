Joined by Astronergy, Canadian Solar, Risen Energy, TCL Zhonghuan and Tongwei, the group of six solar manufacturers intends to standardize the design of solar modules of 700 W or greater.
The  alliance calls for module manufacturers adhere to existing agreed industry dimensions of 2384 mm by 1303 mm; module long-side vertical hole distance: 400 mm/1400 mm). A hole distance of 790 mm has been added to the standard. This adheres to and builds on the T/CPIA 0003-2022 Technical Specification issued by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association.
In recent years, the power output of solar modules has jumped from 500 W to 700 W, and the size of modules have increased along with the wattage. In 2021, for example, Risen Energy released the 132-cell NewT@N panel based on 210 mm n-type monocrystalline multi busbars cells with a half-cut design. The high-wattage module size conforms to the recommended standard of 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm.
Having large modules presents some challenges in terms of weight on a roof, ease of mounting on trackers or racking, and more. But lack of standardization presents several challenges, not only in production but in fitting to infrastructure.
The 700W+ alliance sees standardization as a way of reducing balance of system costs as well as cutting the levelized cost of electricity. Ultimately, standardization will enhance supply chain efficiencies, boost production, and lower costs, the Alliance contends, accelerating the industrialization of high-powered modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/21/trends-in-the-hydrogen-sector-in-2023/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"DECEMBER 21, 2023",Trends in the hydrogen sector in 2023 ,"The green hydrogen industry in the U.S. saw some strong policy support and a flurry of project announcements this year, as policy-makers and the energy industry eye the resource’s potential to provide long-duration energy storage to the power grid, as well as help decarbonize industries that would otherwise be hard to tackle.
A June report from the Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress, which looked at the potential of green hydrogen to meet the demands of heavy industry, identified global market milestones of $642 billion by 2030, $980 billion by 2040, and $1.4 trillion by 2050.
Policy support for clean hydrogen 
2023 saw a lot of federal policy support for clean hydrogen technologies. In June, the Biden-Harris Administration put out a national clean hydrogen strategy and roadmap, outlining opportunities for the U.S. to domestically produce 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) of clean hydrogen annually by the end of the decade, 20 MMT annually by 2040, and 50 MMT annually by 2050.
The administration also created an inter-agency hydrogen task force – co-chaired by Mary Frances Repko, White House deputy national climate advisor, and David Turk, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) – to deploy a more holistic, “whole of government approach” to clean hydrogen across the administration. 
And in October, the DOE announced funding of $7 billion to launch seven regional clean hydrogen hubs around the country, each aimed at more broadly supporting the commercial-scale deployment of the resource. The funding for the hubs comes from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. All seven hubs are estimated to produce a joint three million metric tons of hydrogen each year, and slash 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.
Plans for hydrogen projects
This year also saw some interesting hydrogen project announcements. In October, for instance, Duke Energy announced plans to break ground on the first U.S. demonstration project with an end-to-end green hydrogen production, storage and combustion system, located at its 74.5 MW DeBary solar plant in Florida. The facility – expected to be operational in 2024 – will pull energy from the solar plant and run it through two 1 MW electrolyzer systems to produce hydrogen, which will then be stored until needed. At that time, the hydrogen will be passed through a combustion turbine to create electricity. 
Hydrogen company H2B2 Electrolysis Technologies, meanwhile, is working on its Fresno, California-based SoHyCal project. The project is currently in its first phase, producing up to a ton of hydrogen every day using biogas. In its second phase – expected to begin in the second quarter of 2024 – it will begin using solar energy from a nearby photovoltaic plant, as well as biogas, and ramp up production to up to three tons of hydrogen per day. 
Ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity 
Another focus for the industry this year has been ramping up the manufacturing capacity of electrolyzers, an essential component to producing hydrogen from renewable energy. Experts say most electrolyzer production is currently outsourced to overseas manufacturers, and one of the chief challenges to ramping up domestic manufacturing capacity is accessing capital to build the necessary infrastructure. 
However, some companies are looking to change this dynamic. Verdagy, for instance, announced in September that it is opening a new facility to manufacture advanced water electrolyzers in large volumes in Newark, California. The new plant is slated to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024. 
And Electric Hydrogen – which manufactures 100 MW electrolyzer systems that can each produce nearly 50 tons of green hydrogen daily – completed an oversubscribed $380 million Series C financing this year, bringing the total funding it has raised since its launch three years ago to $600 million.
Cost and scaling obstacles 
But the hydrogen industry still has a way to go. Some analysts, for instance, have raised concerns that the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious clean hydrogen goals will require addressing some cost and scaling obstacles. 
Hydrogen produced from fossil fuels currently costs around half of what clean hydrogen does – between $1/kg and $2/kg, compared to $3/kg to $6/kg – and the industry is likely to need continued financing, including through subsidies, to scale up significantly, some say.
Some environmental stakeholders, meanwhile, continue to raise concerns about hydrogen’s role in the clean energy transition. This summer, for instance, a coalition of more than 180 organizations – including conservation, social justice and Indigenous groups – penned a letter to the Biden administration urging it to reject the applications for regional clean hydrogen hubs. 
The groups noted that some 95% of hydrogen produced currently is derived from fossil fuels, and contended that hydrogen infrastructure build-out could lead to additional greenhouse gas emissions, as well as pollution.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/21/sunpower-breaches-credit-agreement-warns-business-may-go-under/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 21, 2023","SunPower breaches credit agreement, warns business may go under","Residential solar company SunPower suffered a drop of over 40% in share price this week as it filed a quarterly earnings report that flagged a “going concern.”
The concern was sparked by a technical default on debts owed by the company. In October, SunPower announced it would re-state third quarter financial results due to an inventory reporting error with one of its subsidiaries. Being late with financial reporting placed SunPower in breach of key terms in several credit agreements, leaving the company exposed to lenders’ requests for immediate repayment.
In all, SunPower stated that this breach could lead to lenders demanding immediate payment of over $65 million in debt, causing the company to express doubts about its ability to keep its operations running.
The company said it is currently trying to secure a waiver with the lenders, and without one, it may lack funds to support day-to-day operations.
On Dec. 8, 2023, the company received a similar waiver that saved it from technical default and provided it access to $75 million in funding. SunPower has until January 19 to shore up finances or receive another waiver for the some $65 million in debt it is obligated to repay.
Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told Reuters that the company stands a good chance to secure a waiver, as it essentially resulted from a technical issue.
Roth Capital Partners said in an industry note that if SunPower fails to secure the waiver, it could lead to a “cascade” of cash flow challenges, leading to cash flow constraints for SunPower dealers.
The company has posted over $110 million in operational losses through three quarters this year. Residential solar has struggled industrywide in the U.S. in 2023 due to the macroeconomic environment and critical policy changes.
High interest rates in particular have been a detriment to companies like SunPower, who rely on lending to offer their customers attractive long-term solar energy contracts.
Looking ahead
While hard times have hit U.S. residential solar, Enphase co-founder Raghu Belur told pv magazine USA he believes 2024 will be “a year of recovery” for the industry. 
Belur pointed to the financial fundamentals of rooftop solar, storage and EV charging. Interest rates are eventually going to come down, and meanwhile, utility rates are rising far faster than inflation. This is particularly true in California, where the Public Utilities Commission approved a 13% bump to electric utility rates in 2024. Couple these changing forces with diving solar module prices, and suddenly the payback period looks strong, and demand recovers.
While solar and storage shoppers typically use a rule of thumb of about 3% to 4% annual rate increases from the utility company to estimate long-term savings, Belur said this assumption no longer applies. “Double-digit rate hikes are common now,” he said.
Belur recognized that it has been a difficult year for rooftop solar, but said he remains confident that financial fundamentals will win back customer demand. Under California’s NEM 3.0 policy, what used to be a four-to-five-year payback period, or return on investment, for rooftop solar, is now about seven to nine years.
“But you’re buying a 25-year asset, so you’re still coming out way ahead,” he said.

Waaree Energies, India’s largest PV module manufacturer, said this week that it will set up its first U.S. manufacturing facility close to Houston, Texas. The solar module factory, to be built in the town of Brookshire, will have an initial annual production capacity of 3 GW by the end of 2024.
Waaree said it plans to invest up to $1 billion over the next four years to scale the U.S. facility’s capacity up to 5 GW by 2027 – potentially making it one of the largest solar module factories in the United States.
The company said it will also add an integrated solar cell facility at the site. It plans to make it operational by 2025.
In total, Waaree’s new production plan is expected to create more than 1,500 total jobs, once it is at full capacity.
Waaree already has a major presence in the U.S. solar market. It said it has supplied more than 4 GW of modules from its current Indian facility to U.S. customers to date.
Waaree’s ambitious U.S. expansion plan has the support of a long-term supply agreement with SB Energy, which has more than 2 GW of solar in operation, 1 GW under construction, and another 15 GW of solar and storage in development across the United States.
Waaree aims to supply multiple gigawatts of solar modules to SB Energy over the next five years, following the commissioning of the Brookshire facility, which is expected to be operational in 2024.
Most of the major components used for the production of the solar modules will be sourced domestically, said Waaree.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/21/whos-on-top-of-the-residential-solar-plus-storage-market/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 21, 2023",Who’s on top of the residential solar-plus-storage market?,"Homeowners are pairing battery backup with solar for many reasons including ensured resilience and as a response to increasing cuts to net metering programs. Wood Mackenzie recently launched its US Distributed Solar-plus-storage Leaderboard to track this market, and found that in Q3 2023, 11% of residential solar and 5% of non-residential solar installations are paired with storage.
While there have been many new entrants to this market in the past year, the Wood Mac report found that just three vendors have held an average of 80% of the market from 2018 through Q3 2023: Tesla, LG and Enphase. But the tide is turning as others move into top spots, and new entrants with well-known names offer complete solutions.
“These companies continue to dominate the market; however, they have recently come under pressure from new entrants,” said Max Issokson, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie and author of the new report. “Whereas Tesla and LG products were installed on 96% of residential solar-plus-storage projects in 2018, they made up 65% of installations in 2023 through Q3.”
Tesla claims the top spot in Wood Mackenzie’s residential solar-plus-storage rankings with a market share of 30.2% in 2023 through Q3, followed by Sunrun at 20.5% and SunPower at 4.6%.
The market has opened up to many new entrants in part due to the increase in residential solar installations spurred by passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which boosted the Investment Tax Credit to 30% through 2032. Well-known energy equipment companies including SunPower, Generac and SolarEdge are relatively new entrants who quickly moved into top spots on the Leaderboard.
SunPower made a few good moves that propelled it toward the top of the chart for residential storage. For example, the company signed a collaboration agreement with General Motors to deploy home energy storage systems for residential electric vehicle charging and was named GM’s preferred EV charger installer and solar provider. The company also signed an agreement with a large home builder, Dream Finders Homes, to deploy its solar-plus-storage system on its new homes.
Generac, a leader in traditional generators, entered the solar, EV charger and residential solar-plus-storage markets in recent years. Its PWRcell is the residential storage product, and coupled with the Concerto platform that is part of Generac Grid Services, it provides a distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) that can detect spikes in demand, which signal the batteries to automatically dispatch clean energy based on real-time grid conditions. Generac signed on with Southern California Edison (SCE) as a virtual power plant participant, using this solution to scale the utility’s Power Flex program. 
Enphase Energy, long known for its microinverters, is also in the residential storage business. The company is eyeing the California residential solar market for its new Enphase Energy System with the IQ Battery 5P. The California NEM 3.0 went into effect in April is slashing payments by 75% for excess solar production sent to the grid. Enphase reports that its system is optimized to support the new NEM 3.0 rules by enabling self-consumption and exporting energy at the appropriate times to create maximum value.
“California continues to be one of our top markets and the new IQ Battery 5P will enable our customers to maximize the value of their home solar systems with the new net metering rules,” said Bryson Solomon, chief executive officer of Infinity Energy, a Rocklin, Calif.-based installer of residential and commercial solar and storage.
According to the Wood Mac report, the solar-plus-storage market is much more consolidated than the residential installation market. The top five players in the residential solar-plus-storage market hold 59% of the market, whereas the top five in residential solar hold just 24%, noted Issokson.
Even with the top five players holding more than half the market, other companies have entered the market with residential offerings. A few of these include FranklinWH, SMA and Schneider Electric.
The integrated battery and control system in the Franklin Whole Home (WH) system, which debuted in 2022, has a built-in adaptive learning algorithms is inverter-agnostic, comes EV charger ready, and is designed to turn a home into a micro-grid when the grid is down, the company reports. According to the Wood Mac report, FranklinWH, less than two years after launching its first storage project, ranks eighth among manufacturers nationally.
Inverter specialist SMA recently announced a new residential energy storage solution that includes the Sunny Boy Smart Energy hybrid inverter. The company reports that the energy storage solution can be equipped with SMA’s Backup Secure to control the home’s energy, sending it to chosen appliances when needed.
Schneider Home platform is an energy management system (EMS) that integrates energy endpoints and household appliances in one interface, and it can be monitored with a single smartphone application. Released a year ago at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the company says that Schneider’s residential system allows users to not only monitor the energy consumption of household appliances, but it allows users to prioritize power during outages.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/21/thin-film-solar-is-the-future-of-agrivoltaics/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 21, 2023",Thin-film solar is the future of agrivoltaics,"As solar power has been developed and popularized across the globe over the last several decades, the industry has given way to more recent innovation that allows for higher efficiency in irregular places: thin-film solar cells. These lightweight, flexible cells are capable of attachment to surfaces of nearly any shape or design, thanks to their flexibility, while requiring minimal structural supports, due to their light weight. With this technology, solar power is able to be harnessed in a variety of applications and places where previously thought impossible, due to the rigid structure and heavy nature of traditional solar panels.
And now, thin-film solar modules are ready to take on their next challenge: agrivoltaics.
As the impacts of climate change worsen each year, domestic farmers have begun to struggle to keep their crops healthy, as the sun beats down on them with punishingly-high temperatures. Thankfully, a new use of solar technology, known as agrivoltaics (APV), have come to help.
Farmers need elevated coverage to provide partial shade for their struggling crops and solar modules need ample space to soak in the sunlight to generate power. APV combines these two needs, by placing arrays of solar modules above areas of crop growth, to provide partial shade, which reduces sunburn on the land, reduces water evaporation, and insulates the crops from extreme cold and extreme heat, all while giving farmers the primary benefit of solar power utilization: a second revenue stream through power generation.
And now, thin-film solar PV is ready to supercharge this powerful relationship.
Current challenges facing agrivoltaics 
If you were to set up your agrivoltaic system with traditional, rigid solar panels, it’s possible you will run into some logistical issues. Traditional panels are quite heavy, requiring substantial support structures, and are so large that they provide more shade than necessary for most crops, and can stifle their health and growth. The goal of a balanced APV system is to provide just the right amount of shade that keeps the land from dehydration while also allowing the proper amount of sunlight to shine through and help the crops grow. Unfortunately, the rigid nature of traditional solar panels limits the ability to strike this delicate balance.
Most current APV installations that utilize rigid panels will typically consist of a row of solar panels next to a row of crops, taking about half of the land out of production, and make crop care and harvesting quite difficult. Heavy machinery employed in standard maintenance and harvesting processes often must be replaced by expensive manual labor to avoid damage to the solar system.
Lastly, the electrical conduit for traditional solar modules is installed underground; this disables flood irrigation and therefore can limit the variety of crops that are able to be grown in symbiosis with a traditional solar array. If only certain crops can work within the module, then it may end up not being a good fit for an otherwise interested farmer.
Key benefits of thin-film for agrivoltaics
In contrast with traditional panels, thin-film solar cells are much more adaptable to these agricultural situations, thanks to their flexible, lightweight design. Thin-film agrivoltaics overcome the challenges of their rigid, heavy counterparts by consisting of a series of solar crossbars covered in solar that are elevated high above the protected crops, which allows for:
Agrivoltaics, using thin-film solar technology, allow for the proper distribution of shade and sunlight onto the ground beneath it.
The use of thin-film solar cells also allows for greater energy savings, a healthier crop yield, and increased water savings.
Perhaps best of all, is the ability for thin-film modules to continue functioning after being struck, impaled or damaged. Climate change continues to bring about dangerous, unpredictable weather phenomena, where high winds carrying various items and debris is common. When a traditional solar cell suffers an impact, its glass coating is often shattered, creating a costly mess, the need for swift, expensive repair, and the total lack of energy production until it is properly fixed. But thin-film solar cells don’t have these same drawbacks; if a cell is punctured or damaged by outside forces, the rest of the cell will continue to function just fine, leaving only the small, damaged area in need of repair, rather than taking the whole array out of commission.
The future of thin-film for agrivoltaics
As more and more domestic farmers turn to agrivoltaics as a viable solution to increase revenues per acre, reduce on site energy costs and to bolster crop yields, we will start to see a greater embrace of thin-film solar to get the job done.
While there are plenty of applications and situations where large, traditional, rectangular solar panels are the optimal choice for solar power generation, agrivoltaics is an area that requires the flexible nature of thin-film solar technology to deftly handle the delicate relationship between crops and their need for shade and sunlight. Soon, farmers across the nation will begin to see not only the lucrative energy-saving benefits of thin-film agrivoltaics, but also the crop health benefits of it as well.
