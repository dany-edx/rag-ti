Last year, we had strong reader interest in residential solar asset longevity, changes to net metering policy, market signals, and domestic manufacturing. 
Below are the top ten most read articles of 2023. We look forward to continuing to be the leading source of solar industry news and analysis in 2024. Thank you for reading! 
1. How long do residential solar panels last? 
Read here: September 8, 2023 
Residential solar panels are often sold with long-term loans or leases, with homeowners entering contracts of 20 years or more. But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they? 
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system used, among others. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements. 
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20-30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision. 
2. California proposes “blatant seizure of property” in solar ruling 
Read here: October 24, 2023 
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is soon to vote on a proposed decision that is expected to be harmful to the value of rooftop solar for renters in multifamily housing, farms, and schools. 
The decision would disallow residents of multi-meter properties to consume their own rooftop solar production, even if they own the solar array. The policy forces customers to first sell their solar production to the utility, and then buy it back at higher rates. 
“The CPUC is proposing a blatant seizure of property,” said the Solar Rights Alliance. 
3. California rooftop solar installations drop 80% following NEM 3.0 
Read here: December 1, 2023 
California, once a leader in residential solar, is feeling the effects from unpopular policy changes like the introduction of Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 and more recent market rate cuts for rooftop solar generation by renters, schools, and farms.
The two policy changes cut compensation rates for exporting local, clean solar generation to the grid by about 75%. Utility interconnection request data shows that solar sales have fallen between 66% and 83% year-over-year following NEM 3.0. 
What’s more, there have been massive layoffs industry wide. CALSSA said over 17,000 solar jobs have been lost in 2023, representing 22% of all solar jobs in the industry.
4. Indiana killed net metering, solar down 67%, utility now seeking 23% rate increase
Read here: November 21, 2023
The demise of rooftop solar in Indiana coincides with significant increases in electricity prices over the last two decades. This development was brought to light in recent filings that show the Indiana-Michigan Power Company (I&M) is seeking a 23% hike in electricity rates. The Citizens Action Coalition Indiana (CAC Indiana) indicates that distributed solar collapsed after the state eliminated net metering in favor of “excess distributed generation” (EDG) tariff on July 1, 2022, the day that Indiana rooftop solar died.
As this has occurred, electricity utilities are now seeking to massively increase the cost of electricity.
5. California is curtailing more solar power than ever before
Read here: October 31, 2023
Curtailment of renewable energy, particularly solar generation, is steadily on the rise in California, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
In 2022, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.
As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs either when there is congestion, when power lines don’t have enough capacity to deliver the power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.
6. California’s electricity duck curve is deepening
Read here: July 5, 2023
The phenomenon of the “duck curve” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation (mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand (late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.
The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “duck curve” is deepening.
7. How long do residential solar batteries last?
Read here: September 15, 2023
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Warranty periods can offer a look in installer and manufacturer expectations of the life of a battery. Common warranty periods are typically around 10 years. The warranty for the Enphase IQ Battery, for instance, ends at 10 years or 7,300 cycles, whatever occurs first.
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between 5-15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20-30 year life of a solar system.
8. Virginia governor kills Ford-CATL battery plant, calling it a “front for the Chinese Communist Party” 
Read here: January 19, 2023
Near the end of 2022, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin told the Virginia Economic Development Partnership group to remove the state from the running to host a $3.5 billion battery factory that Ford Motor was considering in partnership with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world’s largest lithium-ion battery manufacturer.
During the speech, he called on Virginia’s General Assembly to send him a bill that would “prohibit dangerous foreign entities tied to the Chinese Communist Party from purchasing Virginia’s farmland.” In the Washington Post, Youngkin’s chief legal counsel Richard Cullen was quoted saying, “They (CATL) were looking for land and incentives to build something and I think that was the nucleus of the evolving concern about farmland.”

10. Mysterious, higher energy yields in vertical PV systems 
Read here: November 15, 2023
A group of researchers at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has conducted a series of tests and simulations to understand why vertical PV systems tend to provide unexpected yield gains compared to horizontal arrays and have found that vertical installations have much lower operating temperatures.

The company has rebranded its O&M operations as Cleanleaf, and is now based in Texas.
Cleanleaf will focus on providing operations and maintenance (O&M) services to utility and commercial solar battery energy storage (BESS) projects throughout the nation.
The former Borrego personnel has remained in place, with Mikael Backman, previously president of the Borrego O&M division, now assuming the role of CEO of Cleanleaf Energy.
“Today’s announcement will allow the O&M business to focus solely on monitoring, operating and upgrading PV and BESS assets across the country to maximize the utilization of renewable resources that have been installed in this energy transition,” said Backman.
Borrego, which was formed in 2002, began offering O&M services ten years ago and grew to provide services for commercial and industrial as well as utility-scale solar. Last year Borrego was named in the top five C&I providers in the Wood Mackenzie Global O&M Report.
“Today’s announcement marks an important milestone in Borrego’s ten-year history of providing third-party O&M services,” said Andrew Hall, Borrego’s CEO. “I’m excited to see Mikael and his team of experienced technicians and managers use the scale and sophistication they developed at Borrego to deliver ever-improving customer service and outcomes to PV and BESS system owners under the Cleanleaf banner.
Cleanleaf Energy is manages and operates the more than 1.9 GW across 1,000 solar and energy storage projects, including utility-scale plants, previously all under the Borrego name.
According to Backman, what sets Cleanleaf Energy apart is its data-driven operational platform, along with “our ability and desire to embrace technological innovations”.
Cleanleaf also has a Special Projects group, which focuses on detailed investigation, pre-construction hand-offs, efficient troubleshooting, repair and system upgrades for solar sites.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/03/make-pv-modules-as-cheap-as-possible-but-not-cheaper/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 3, 2024","Make PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper","From pv magazine Global
The dream of solar cell and PV module manufacturing outside of Asia has become increasingly distant. A combination of falling PV module prices and China’s PV module manufacturers allegedly sitting on up to two months’ worth of stock is adding to the maelstrom. Plans for GW-scale PV cell and module production facilities in the US and Europe have been delayed or outright scrapped, and to make it worse, Western markets are accumulating inventories stocked with products purchased for double the current end-of-the-year market prices.
This solar storm is wreaking havoc on the industry, leading to cracked glass in modules and an even more fractured supply chain. In times like these, it could be best to reflect on words uttered by Albert Einstein, who once reportedly said, “Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler”. His argument, that an idea should be made as coherent as possible without being stripped of its meaning, could be applied to solar PV in this current market. Make PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper. Because with anything in life, there is a final price.
How did PV modules become so cheap?
Solar has become the most affordable and fastest-growing energy generation technology. It has surpassed all other renewable and conventional electricity generation technologies year-on-year since 2015. Part of its popularity is rooted in price, with each company being extremely price competitive due to a range of market factors and product improvements. This includes lower kerf losses, better cell packing in modules, less silver, thinner glass, thinner frames, larger modules, cheaper electricity and most importantly, companies flooding the market with products. Consumers buying cheaper decentralized solar rooftop PV systems or utility-scale installation technologies have reaped the rewards. But as time wears on, particularly for large-scale operators, fissures have emerged.
The price of cheap PV modules
Over the span of a decade, PV modules have almost doubled in size with thinner frames, thinner glass and shorter mounting rails. Half-cut cell modules now normally have three holes in the rear glass allowing them to bear a significant weight of the PV load. The shift occurred in 2017 when 2-millimeter-thick hardened (not fully-tempered) glass became cheaper than the PV module gold standard of 3.2-millimeter fully-tempered glass. Around the same time, utility-scale PV power plants began to use mainly bifacial, double-glass.
Nearly all large-scale PV plants today use bifacial, double-glass modules with 2-millimeter-thick glass at the front and rear. But utility-scale solar power plants installed in recent years, which rely on 2-millimeter double-glass PV modules, are reporting up to 10% breakage rates.
The cracks observed are causing warranty claims and contractual disputes costing money, time and integrity. This means that cheap PV is not only leading to worse outcomes for the energy consumer but is also fracturing the industry, impacting PV module and PV tracker suppliers, engineering, product and construction companies, and PV plant owners. This is the case for making PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/03/another-domino-falls-in-rooftop-solar-net-metering/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,IDAHO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 3, 2024",Another domino falls in rooftop solar net metering,"Slipping the resolution through in the final days of the year, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (PUC) passed a resolution to cut net energy metering for rooftop solar. The new rulemaking decision also approved electric rate increases that are expected to disproportionately impact low-income customers.
Net energy metering (NEM) involves the electric utility providing credit to rooftop solar customers for delivering electricity to the grid. It is an essential factor in the return on investment for rooftop solar and helps encourage local sharing of clean energy.
Utility Idaho Power will no longer be required to pay retail rates for net-metered electricity, instead shifting to a net billing format. The Sierra Club estimates that the new average annual net billing rate will be under $0.06 per kWh.
Over the past decade-plus, the United States has launched its residential solar industry, bringing predictable and often low-cost, local, and clean energy to homeowner’s rooftops. Rooftop solar is a source of financial stability for customers, and for its tens of thousands of employees, it has created decent paying jobs.
Idaho now follows California in slashing NEM. The move caused California, which was once among the most robust rooftop solar industries in the world, to suffer an 80% drop in installations in the immediate aftermath of the cuts. A major insurer of California rooftop solar businesses told pv magazine USA that 75% of California rooftop solar companies are now at high risk for bankruptcy, and as many as 17,000 jobs have already been lost. California’s struggles serve as a warning to the rest of the nation, but Idaho has not heeded that warning.
“The commissioners are saying the voices and expertise of thousands of Idahoans and small businesses are not as important as the voice of the state’s largest monopoly utility,” said Alex McKinley, Owner of Empowered Solar.
During recent Idaho PUC public hearings, not one public testimony came in favor of the resolution. Despite this unified opposition from the public, the utilities commission ruled in favor of Idaho Power’s plan.
Idaho Power justified the unpopular decision based on an internally produced report called “Value of Distributed Resources Study.” Sierra Club and other environmental groups hired an independent analyst, who concluded that the Idaho Power report severely undervalued rooftop solar’s contribution to the grid. The report was based on selective, internal utility data, said the analyst.
“The proposal willfully misleads the public on the value of rooftop solar to Idaho Power, ignores the huge environmental advantages of distributed clean energy and is likely to kill Idaho’s solar industry and the good paying jobs it brings to our state,” said Mike Engle, chair at Portneuf Resource Council.
From a business perspective, the motivation for utilities to suppress the value of customer-owned rooftop solar is clear. Idaho Power would much prefer to sell as much electricity as it can to customers in its territory, rather than sustain a market that enables homeowners to achieve a degree of energy independence and pricing clarity for the long run.
To add insult to injury, the PUC also approved a rate increase for all Idaho Power customers, assessing a monthly fixed fee called a “service charge.” Customers will be charged $10 per month in 2024, and $15 per month in 2025, regardless of power usage. The move is expected to be particularly damaging to low-income customers who monitor their energy use to avoid high bills.
“Fixed rates are regressive. They disproportionately raise rates on your poorest customers while barely increasing rates for the wealthiest,” said Lisa Young, director, Idaho Sierra Club.
Who’s next?
More utility attempts to quash rooftop solar are inevitable as other states see the “success” of California utilities in crushing the industry. The results may illuminate which utility commissions across the nation are truly operating in the interest of the public they serve.
In Oregon, Idaho Power is attempting to pass the same solar rate changes it implemented for its Idaho customer base. Oregon rejected the plan, though Idaho Power is expected to continue pushing the change.
In West Virginia, utilities Mon Power and Potomac Edison are attempting to cut rooftop solar export rates by more than half. The state’s public utility commission suggested a less severe cut, but installers in the state are warning that popular low-income solar programs will not be able to operate under the proposed rate structure.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/03/rfi-alert-solar-and-storage-opportunities-in-new-york/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 3, 2024",RFI alert: Solar and storage opportunities in New York,"The New York Power Authority (NYPA) issued a Request for Information (RFI) to assess potential interest and opportunities for collaboration with renewable developers, contractors and companies on projects including solar energy, wind and battery energy storage.
The RFI seeks information related to joint development opportunities in support of New York State’s aggressive energy goals, and it seeks to advance takeaways identified in the Power Authority’s recently published Conferral Report.
New York State’s nation-leading energy goals has set it on a path to achieving a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70% renewable energy generation by 2030, and economywide carbon neutrality by mid-century. In 2019, New York enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act), which established objectives and requirements aimed at addressing climate change and guiding the State toward a clean energy-based economy.
With solar as a strong part of the clean energy mix, the State created a framework to achieve at least 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030, enough to annually power nearly 700,000 average-sized homes. That framework provides a strategy to expand the state’s already successful NY-Sun initiative into one of the largest and most inclusive solar programs of its kind in the nation.
“The results of this RFI will inform the Power Authority’s next steps, advancing a cohesive and efficient transition to a clean energy economy for New York State that will benefit all New Yorkers,” said NYPA President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll.
NYPA is looking for feedback and is particularly interested in responses from private sector renewable developers, contractors, and companies. Responses should be sent to NYPARenewables@nypa.gov by February 7.
The Power Authority, which is the largest state public power organization in the nation, constructed the state’s largest hydroelectric power plants in Niagara and Massena in the 1950s and 60s, setting it on a path toward clean energy. The 2023-24 Enacted State Budget gave NYPA more authority to develop, own and operate renewable energy generating projects. NYPA currently operates 16 generating facilities and more than 1,400 circuit-miles of transmission lines, more than 80% of the electricity it produces coming from hydropower.
To support the transition to clean energy, New York has invested more than $50 billion in 66 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce building emissions, $3.3 billion to scale up solar, more than $1 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $2 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. These and other investments are supporting more than 170,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2022 and over 3,000% growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011.
