https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/04/california-utilities-commission-sued-for-gouging-rooftop-solar-payments/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 4, 2023",California utilities commission sued for gouging rooftop solar payments,"A coalition of three environmental groups have filed a lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for instituting a rulemaking decision that rapidly and sharply slashes payments to rooftop solar owners for exporting clean energy to the grid. 
The Environmental Working Group, the Protect our Communities Coalition and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal to review the state’s new Net Energy Metering 3.0 policy. 
In December 2022, CPUC decided to pass NEM 3.0, reducing payments for exported solar energy by up to 80%. 
The petition said the rulemaking violates the state’s climate laws and improperly evaluates the many benefits of small-scale, distributed solar on rooftops, while ignoring the billions of dollars utilities spend on transmission infrastructure that drives increased rates. Benefits of rooftop solar include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, resilience to extreme weather and power outages, and avoided land use impacts by decreasing the need for utility transmission infrastructure which also keeps electricity bills down.
The lawsuit directly names the three large investor-owned utility companies, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric Company, as the real parties in interest.
The decision adopted an investor-owned utility-developed avoided cost calculator to set rates. NEM 3.0 was implemented on April 15, and has worsened the return on investment for rooftop solar, particularly when not paired with energy storage. 
The state was the tip of the spear for the rooftop solar industry across the United States, representing about 50% of the market, and now that spear is blunted. Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) project that new residential solar installations in California are expected to decrease by nearly 40% through 2024, after doubling in 2020 to 2022.
“The commission’s misguided new policy violates California’s climate laws and will stifle rooftop solar growth, especially for working-class families,” said Roger Lin, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s outrageous that the commission is slow-walking our renewable energy transition when we need to be racing toward it.”
The petitioners said NEM 3.0 contained numerous legal errors and false assumptions, and that the Court must reverse the decision, grant review, and remand the issue with instructions to comply with the legislatures requirements to fully and properly evaluate NEM’s costs and benefits.
Why cut solar? 
The petition highlights methods utilities are using across the country to block rooftop solar as distributed energy resources threaten the utility profiteering. A report from the Center for Biological Diversity evaluates rooftop solar and net-metering benefits and why corporate utility companies are trying to kill these programs.
The rulemaking decision was justified based on an analysis that suggested non-rooftop solar customers were subsidizing their neighbors that decided to invest in the clean energy transition.
However, this utility-forwarded cost shift argument has been debunked. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory found that 47 states have a negligible solar power cost shift. Most states have solar penetration levels far below 10%. Until you hit that level of penetration there’s no cost shift altogether, yet states across the country are following California’s footsteps in slashing net metering.
Even at penetration levels of 10% or higher, the national laboratory found that the “shift” is only 5/1,000 of a cent per kilowatt-hour. Sixteen state-level analyses have come to the same conclusion that the cost shift is negligible.
“If the goal is to keep prices low, there are other pieces of the puzzle that affect rates far more than net metering,” Galen L. Barbose, a research scientist at LBNL, echoing a study by LBNL which put this in context. “Carbon pricing, operating outdated plants—those are the issues utilities and regulators should be focused on.”
More trouble ahead
What’s more, the state’s Public Advisor’s Office (PAO), following state procedures that require it to equitably balance the resource cost demands of the major investor-owned utilities, has recommended a fixed utility bill fee for all Californians based on income.
PAO’s recommendation assigns customers with fixed monthly fees between $22 per month and $42 per month, while some utility proposals under review would assess fees as high as $128 per month for California residents. This proposal would even apply to rooftop solar customers who consume zero electricity from the grid.
“In just about every case, if you are a low electricity user today, with a relatively low bill, you are going to see a higher bill once this plan is in place,” said Ahmad Faruqui, economist-at-large, grid controls expert, and California resident. 
“Customers will be very irritated,” said Faruqui. “They will be paying more for electricity not because their behavior changed but because California is changing the rules.”

TSAF, a tribal-led sustainability program that includes 65 tribes and over 120 tribal individuals, will award grants of up to $200,000 per tribe for solar projects situated on tribal authority land, and $50,000 grants per year for tribal energy plan proposals.
Types of renewable energy that can be submitted for consideration in the RFP include solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, ground-source heat pumps, biofuel, RNG, nuclear, tidal energy and nuclear, according to the TSAF’s RFP. Projects can include rooftop, carport or ground-mount solar installations that meet the energy needs of the tribal community.
To apply for the tribal energy RFP or to lean more, click here.
TSAF grant timeline and reporting:
Upon receipt of TSAF application, grantee applicants must meet the following funding criteria:
The accelerator fund defines tribal authorities as federal tribal governments in the lower 48 states and Alaska, as well as tribal-led non-profit organizations with direct ties to the tribal community. TSAF is committed to serving and supporting American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities by investing in solar energy development and sustainability programs.
As a tribal partner, TSAF will provide grantees with press release and news coverage support, host public events for project developments, create project video, list and write up the project in funder stakeholder reports and philanthropic press releases.
TSAF’s 2022 Impact Report highlights the nonprofit platform has in five years deployed 751 kW of solar systems at 87 solar installations via 27 grantees from 12 U.S. states, representing $3.2 million in grant awards to date.  The nonprofit has provided workforce development training to over 120 tribal members in solar installation roles.
The government nonprofit has provided an additional $160,000 to support tribal education programs such as scholarships and $100,000 in fellowship funding to tribal members. In 2022, endowments to TSAF have come from Sempra Energy, General Motors, Wells Fargo, the Bezos Earth Fund, Intuit Foundation, Illumina and Grove Foundation.
Sempra Foundation, founded by Sempra, an investor-owned utility company, has donated more than $350,000 to TSAF to develop, finance and implement solar projects for tribal communities in California.
About 200 kW of solar capacity will be installed at single-family residences and apartment buildings at four reservations in San Diego County and Bishop, California, supporting more than 200 tribal members.
There is currently a disproportionate number of Native American households living in energy poverty, with 14.2% having no access to reliable energy, which is more than 10 times the national average.
The Inflation Reduction Act increased the total loan authority for tribal energy systems from $2 billion to $20 billion. Affairs, $150 million: This program will provide financial and technical assistance to Tribes to increase the number of Tribal homes with zero-emission electricity. On top of the 30% standalone storage ITC, the IRA offers tax credit “adders” for projects in low-to-moderate income communities, including on tribal land, for projects featuring American components and labor, and for batteries installed into repurposed fossil fuel power plants.
If a Tribal authority deploys an American-assembled storage project in a microgrid, the total cost savings can reach 60% to 70%. That incentive is shared by developer, off-take counter party, investors, and battery and parts distributors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/04/florida-resort-owner-deploys-1-51-mw-of-solar-arrays/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,FLORIDA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 4, 2023",Florida resort owner deploys 1.51 MW of solar arrays,"Legacy Vacation Resorts, an Orlando, Florida-based resort property owner, will take advantage of its home state’s namesake of abundant sun after activating four rooftop and ground-mounted solar systems in central Florida. The arrays are expected to produce over 2 million kWh per year.
Optimus Energy Solutions, a Mount Dora, Florida-based solar, storage and EV charging installer, deployed the four solar arrays located in Kissimmee (760 kW), Lake Buena Vista (147 kW), Clearwater (205 kW) and Palm Coast (402 kW).
Ben Pauluhn, president of Optimus Energy, told pv magazine USA that the majority of modules were installed on vacation property rooftops, while about 35 kW of the portfolio was installed on the ground adjacent to the buildings.
The Florida resort installations utilized 3,700 domestically-assembled JinkoSolar 410 W modules, single- and three-phased SolarEdge inverters, and Ironridge racking hardware, Pauluhn said. Greentech Renewables provided distribution solutions for the projects’ assembly, he added.
Each solar installation is located on a separate utility grid territory in Florida, while each installation qualifies for full net metering under current Florida law, Pauluhn said.
Climate First Bank, a St. Petersburg, Florida-based community lender, has committed project financing to the resort property solar portfolio. Formed in 2020, the bank has funded solar photovoltaic, energy retrofits and energy transition infrastructure, according to its website.
“As a certified B Corp, Legacy Vacation Resorts strives to not only operate a profitable business, but to use our power to create positive social and environmental change in the world,” said Alex Smith, chief operating officer, Legacy Vacation. “Investing in solar energy in partnership with Optimus Energy Solutions provides an extremely effective way to positively impact our environment and generate a financial return for the company.”
Legacy Vacation operates eight properties in Florida, Nevada, Colorado and New Jersey. The company said in its 2022 annual report to stakeholders that since 2018, its operations have achieved an 8% reduction of its carbon footprint, conducted a sustainability audit and planned on-site solar projects.
With the 1.51 MW of on-site solar projects, Legacy Vacation will generate 40% of its electricity from renewable energy. The company has a goal of becoming net zero with all of its properties using renewable energy by 2030. According to its 2022 report, the company anticipates generating the remainder of its clean energy from utility-purchased energy, offsite projects and community solar projects.
Legacy Vacation has EV charging stations at each of its property locations and is evaluating on-site energy storage as well, Pauluhn said.
The resort owner’s Brigantine, N.J. facility purchases annual renewable energy certificates (REC) to offset its carbon footprint, said the annual benefits report. Besides onsite solar and RECs, Legacy Vacation is partnered with nonprofit We Are Neutral to fund energy efficiency upgrades in low-income Florida communities, plant native trees, practice urban agriculture and capture landfill methane gas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/04/senate-votes-to-resume-solar-tariffs-threatening-clean-energy-supply/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CAMBODIA,CHINA,MALAYSIA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 4, 2023","Senate votes to resume solar tariffs, threatening clean energy supply","Moved forward by a 56-41 vote, the U.S. Senate resolved to repeal the two-year pause on tariffs for solar goods from four Southeast Asian countries responsible for about 80% of the U.S. solar panel supply chain. Nine Democrats joined the largely Republican voting group in passing the resolution.
Passed in June 2022 by President Joe Biden, the moratorium halted tariffs on goods shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia. Solar suppliers in these nations are under investigation for harboring tariff-dodging components manufactured in China.
The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024, or modules installed on project sites before December 2024.
The Department of Commerce made a preliminary ruling in December that some suppliers from the four countries are guilty of violating anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws. The investigation is expected to conclude with Commerce’s ruling, scheduled for May 2, 2023.
Goods found in violation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws would be retroactively assessed with tariffs ranging between 50% to 250% of their shipped value.
Prior to Biden’s 2022 moratorium, the threat of tariffs created supply issues and high levels of risk that led to cancelled and delayed projects. About 20% of utility-scale solar capacity was delayed or cancelled in the first half of 2022 due to supply problems and uncertainty.
Biden’s two-year moratorium is meant to act as a supply bridge while U.S. domestic solar manufacturing ramps up. 
The solar industry has warned that lifting the pause on tariffs now would greatly challenge the nation’s transition to clean energy, as the U.S. currently sources roughly 80% of its solar components from the four Southeast Asian nations.
“The legislation will impose $1 billion in retroactive tariffs and cause 30,000 Americans to lose their jobs this year,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
“The United States relies on foreign nations, like China, for far too many of our energy needs, and failing to enforce our existing trade laws undermines the goals of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act to onshore our energy supply chains, including solar,” Senator Joe Manchin said in a statement. “I cannot fathom why the Administration and Congress would consider extending that reliance any longer and am proud to join this Congressional Review Act (CRA) to rescind the rule.”
Ross Hopper said the U.S. does not have enough solar manufacturing capacity to meet demand, and the remaining 14 months of the moratorium are needed to “close the gap.” 
The legislation to repeal the moratorium was moved forward via the CRA and spearheaded by House Representative Dan Kildee (D-MI). Kildee argues that the resolution will help American workers and “hold those who violate U.S. trade laws accountable.”
However, President Biden’s administration said it will veto the resolution, retaining the moratorium. “The Administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 39,” the White House said in a press release.
“The Senate’s action needlessly undercuts the critical clean energy growth that has been made since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. I am grateful for President Biden’s steadfast support of solar energy and applaud his intention to veto this harmful resolution,” said George Hershman, chief executive officer, SOLV Energy, a leading utility-scale solar developer. 
Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), said the resolution would “bring a halt to the booming solar growth in the U.S.”
“To prevent the loss of tens of thousands of solar jobs, reduce electricity costs, and avoid an increase in harmful greenhouse gas emissions, we urge President Biden to veto this destructive legislation,” he said.
The American Clean Power Association (ACP) called the prospect of retroactive tariffs “punitive,” arguing that it would harm U.S. workers.
“In recent months, the American solar industry has announced billions of dollars in investments in domestic solar manufacturing and energy production facilities. Continued success requires collaboration between American government, business, and labor to overcome real competitive barriers and reclaim America’s solar technology dominance,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer, ACP.

Demand for silver from the PV industry increased by 28% from 110.0 million ounces (Moz) in 2021 to 140.3 Moz last year, according to the “World Silver Survey 2023,” which was recently published by the Silver Institute.
The report also reveals that silver demand in the solar industry may reach 161.1 Moz this year, which would represent a 15% growth compared to 2022.
“The increase in PV cell production was much faster than silver thrifting, and this in turn helped drive the 6% rise for global electronics and electrical demand,” the institute experts said, referring to last year’s performance. “In 2023, we expect industrial fabrication will reach another all-time high, boosted by continued gains in photovoltaic applications as well as healthy offtake from other industrial segments.”
Global silver demand reached 1,055.6 Moz and 1,242.4 Moz in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and is expected to drop 6% this year to 1,167.0 Moz.
The average silver price for 2023 is expected to reach $21.30 per ounce, which would be around 2% lower than a year earlier. The Silver Institute said that it expects the price will trade in the low $18 per ounce in the fourth quarter.
“Along with record silver demand and lower mine production, the silver market achieved its second consecutive annual structural deficit, at a significant 237.7 Moz last year,” the authors of the report stated, noting that the combined shortfalls of the previous two years “comfortably” offset the cumulative surpluses of the last 11 years.
“This year is expected to be another of solid silver demand,” they added. “Industrial fabrication should reach an all-time high, boosted by continued gains in the PV market and healthy offtake from other industrial segments.”

This report tracks quarterly and annual volumes of orders, wafer material shipments and customer allocations.
In Q1 2023, U.S. solar companies increasingly incorporated energy storage into their product solutions as well as virtual power plant networked offerings, in response to policy events such as California’s Net Energy Metering 3.0 framework taking effect in April of 2023, and grid resiliency efforts tied to climate change.
SunPower
SunPower, a residential solar and energy services provider, recorded a net loss in Q1 2023 of $51 million, compared to a net loss of $2 million in the same quarter a year ago.  The company’s lower 14.5% gross margin showed a higher cost profile that outweighed a higher revenue production quarter of $441 million, a 26% increase year-over-year.  The company said it was affected by adverse weather conditions in California, which “increased costs and delayed certain installations.”
In Q1 2023, the residential solar company had increased cost of sales of $376.8 million, representing a 36% year-over-year increase from $277.9 of costs in the prior year’s quarter.
SunPower recorded gross margin erosion despite adding a higher customer account in the quarter of 21k customers, representing annual growth of 27% compared to 16.5k customers added a year ago.
“We exited Q1 with high customer growth, significant new financing commitments, and unprecedented retrofit backlog driven by our efforts securing customers under NEM 2.0,” said Peter Faricy, chief executive officer, SunPower. “This progress, despite challenging weather in California, validates the strength of the residential solar market and SunPower’s ability to capture growing demand.”
SunPower reported a $116.5 million cash balance at quarter end, down from $142.3 million a year ago.
Quarterly highlights:
SunPower’s stock traded down 6% today, to $11.80 per share from $12.54 before it reporting earnings, based on the earnings miss.
Sunrun
Sunrun, a San Francisco-based residential solar company, posted $589.8 million in Q1 2023 revenue, up 19% from $495.8 million a year ago. The company posted 14% higher sales than market consensus estimates as the company installed 240 MW of systems in Q1 2023, up 13% from 213 MW installed a year ago.
As of March 31, 2023, Sunrun had 829k customers, including 692k subscribers, representing 20% year-over-year growth.
Management said it expects the company’s installed growth to be 10% to 15% in 2023. In the near-term the company expects solar installed capacity growth of 270 MW to 290 MW in Q2 2023.
As of March 31, Sunrun had a cash balance of $843.2 million as well as $522 million available borrowings of a $1.8 billion non-recourse revolving warehouse credit facility to fund over 175 MW of solar subscription installations.

Completed by Castillo Engineering and RPG Energy Group, the solar farm will power Stanley Black & Decker’s 280,000 square-foot onsite production facility, and is expected to deliver 5,500 metrics tons of C02 reductions and an annual energy savings of $400,000.
The ground-mount solar installation is made up of 10, 415 First Solar Series 6 thin film modules, mounted on Solar Flexrack S-Series single-axis trackers with self-powered tracker controls. The facility has a total of 28 Sungrow 125W string inverters. The distributor for the modules, inverters and AC gear was Greentech Renewables, formerly CED Greentech.
According to Stanley Black & Decker, this solar installation will produce enough energy to offset 100% of the annual energy needs from the plant. Rather than building the solar system off site and claiming the carbon credits, Stanley Black & Decker has committed to building this solar array on its property, connecting behind the meter to achieve the company’s net-zero energy goal at this facility.
Stanley Black & Decker’s environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) strategy includes 2030 commitments aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. “As part of Stanley Black & Decker’s global environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, this project represents an impactful milestone as the organization progresses toward its mission of carbon neutrality by 2030,” said Rob Kirts, director of global energy and utilities at Stanley Black & Decker.
While the tool manufacturer has powered some of its other facilities in the U.S. with on-site and off-site renewable energy, this project represents the company’s first on-site, wholly owned, 100% offset solar project. Stanley has many solar and energy saving projects planned for the future, some of which are currently underway. These projects range from on-site solar to energy efficiency upgrades that reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions to support the company’s ESG goals.
RPG Energy Group, headquartered in Indianapolis, is a renewable energy company that offers schematic design and engineering through final construction and system monitoring within the renewable energy markets.
Based in Maitland, Florida, Castillo Engineering is a design and engineering firm that delivers expertise in solar and energy storage design, engineering and consulting services to developers, EPC contractors and utility companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/04/new-hampshire-utility-offers-dynamic-rates-for-distributed-storage-exports/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW HAMPSHIRE",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 4, 2023",New Hampshire utility offers dynamic rates for distributed storage exports,"The New Hampshire Electric Cooperative (NHEC) has launched a Transactive Energy Rate Pilot Program for its customers who own eligible battery storage systems, which may be paired with solar, or eligible electric vehicles (EVs) or EV chargers. Participating customers will pay for electricity used by eligible devices at 24 hourly rates set one day ahead, and may export electricity from those devices later, when hourly rates are higher.
Currently eligible devices, the utility said, are:
The utility added that the FLO Home X5 unidirectional EV charger is expected to be eligible soon.
Nissan previously said that use of the Fermata Energy FE-15 bi-directional charger will not impact the Nissan LEAF’s battery warranty. NHEC projected that New Hampshire’s Plymouth State University, which leased two new Nissan LEAFs and connected them to two Fermata Energy chargers, will earn $4000 per year in credits for each vehicle.
GM expects to launch an enrollment process for owners of Chevrolet EVs later this month, while NHEC said it expects that GM’s Chevy Silverado and other GM models will become eligible during the pilot program.
The pilot program is limited to 50 of the utility’s 85,000 customers, and will run for six months “so we can fine tune the member experience before increasing participation,” said David Erickson, NHEC’s director of access and distributed resources.
The cooperative utility expects that participating members will typically work with a third-party aggregator to manage their device. The utility says that aggregators that have “successfully integrated devices” with the Transactive Energy Rate system to date are Generac, Fermata Energy and General Motors. The utility said it is “actively seeking” additional aggregators to help its members participate in the pilot program.

Transactive energy rates are set one day ahead, as shown in the above image from a utility slide deck. Each day the utility sends the next day’s 24 hourly price signals to registered devices, to “inform, not control,” it said.
The hourly price signals, or rates, are the same as NHEC’s full “avoided cost” rate, said Erickson. “This allows NHEC to charge our members (or credit those that provide energy services) at the same rates that we would be purchasing from our suppliers.” He added that costs related to the NHEC distribution system are not reflected in the rates.
The OpenADR Alliance said that NHEC chose OpenADR as a communication protocol between the eligible devices and its billing system. The utility selected Bellawatt to develop the software for the project.
The utility provided the following example of how a customer with 27 kWh of battery storage might earn $28.37 of credit in one day by purchasing electricity at low prices in the middle of the night, and selling electricity at high prices in the late afternoon.

The utility estimated that an 8.6 kW PV system with eligible battery system enrolled in the transactive energy rates program could earn a customer $1700 per year in credits if the renewable energy certificates were sold to the utility. An eligible 5 kW home battery system could earn a customer $1200 per year in credits, the utility said.
In California, demand flexibility enabled by dynamic rates is seen as a way to integrate more renewable generation into the grid, and achieve lower rates for customers. Flexible supply from batteries at times of peak demand can also contribute to a reduced need for peak capacity and lower rates.
Proposed legislation in California would require new EVs sold in the state after 2026 to have not only vehicle to grid but “vehicle to everything” capabilities.
New Hampshire Electric Cooperative serves 85,000 homes and businesses in 118 communities. It is the state’s largest cooperative utility and its second-largest utility.
