As the industry matures, risk assessments support the build out of bankable projects that perform at a high level.
This is the motivation behind the annual kWh Analytics Solar Risk Assessment report, now in its fifth year. In the 2023 report, the firm highlights key risks in extreme weather, finance, and asset operations.  
(Read part one: Extreme weather and part two: Financial modeling)
“Mitigation of these risks will be critical to our industry’s shared goal: investment of capital into solar to attain sustainable growth,” said Jason Kaminsky, chief executive officer, kWh Analytics. “Doing so will require industry leaders to continue working together as new environmental, technological, legislative, and economic challenges arise.”
1) Industry losing $2.5 billion annually on equipment underperformance
Raptor Maps analyzed 24.5 GW of operational solar assets, finding $82 million in total losses from equipment issues. Extrapolated to the whole of U.S. solar assets, this equates to a staggering $2.5 billion loss.
The issue of equipment anomalies was found to occur across projects regardless of size. Raptor Maps said equipment operation anomalies increased 94% since 2019. These events can include extreme weather or equipment malfunctions.
“With solar assets consistently underperforming and competition driving down PPA rates, this growth in power loss could have severe ramifications for the bankability of future projects,” said Raptor Maps.
Large sites have suffered the highest percentage increases affecting power production, with power loss increasing by 336% for 50 MW to 100 MW sites, 243% for 200 MW or more sites, and 168% for 100 MW to 200 MW sites.
“Thus, a standardized and centralized system that collates all relevant data in a digital twin – including inspections, power production, irradiance, and equipment maintenance history – is critical for the solar industry’s reliable growth,” said the company.
2) Hourly data leads to clipping loss errors
Hourly resolution in solar production modeling is still industry standard, but Akanksha Bhat, product manager, Clean Power Research suggests this can be improved. High-resolution, granular solar irradiance resource data reduces clipping loss errors by more than 90% versus hourly data for high DC:AC scenarios.
“Recent research shows that hourly data can overpredict AC energy by 1.5% – 4% annually, depending on the system design and location,” said Bhat. “High DC:AC ratios, a recent trend for new installations, often lead to errors at the high end of this range.”
Higher-resolution products like SolarAnywhere leverage GOES satellite data that offers 5-minute, 500 meter resolutions. Combined with True Dynamics data to capture large, intra-hourly ramp rates and clear-sky exceedance events, Clean Power Research internal testing demonstrated a 90% improvement in clipping loss errors as compared to hourly data.
“Solar developers should consider using site-specific, sub-hourly solar data to get more realistic and data driven P50/P90 energy estimates,” said Bhat. “As the solar market matures, solar developers increasingly need to design systems that cost effectively deliver firm power regardless of the weather.”
3) 44% of companies noted lack of trained labor as growth bottleneck 
In a survey of over 500 solar companies, informational site EnergySage found that 44% of installers reported finding qualified trained labor professionals as a growth bottleneck. Only half as many installers (21%) pointed to the availability of equipment as a barrier to growth.
Solving the labor shortage challenge is not expected to be an easy task, but EnergySage said the Inflation Reduction Act provides a potential roadmap.
“The IRA establishes a precedent that solar companies must play an active role in the training of the next generation of solar installers,” said Spencer Fields, director of insights, EnergySage. “By extending the [Investment Tax Credit] at 30% for another decade (at a minimum), the IRA provides certainty.”
For a third year in a row, installers listed industry experience as their main differentiator from their competitors.
“Those same installers started somewhere: as apprentices or transitioning to solar from adjacent industries. Training – especially certifications and on-the-job training – was paramount to their success in the industry and will be just as important to the success of the next generation of solar contractors as well,” said EnergySage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/23/michigan-bill-proposes-residential-solar-plus-storage-credits/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MICHIGAN",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 23, 2023",Michigan bill proposes residential solar-plus-storage credits,"Two Michigan representatives have introduced bills that would significantly slash the cost of residential solar and energy storage systems for low- and moderate-income (LMI) ratepayers. The bills would encourage widespread adoption of these technologies as a means of bolstering resiliency, reducing pollution and lowering energy costs.
State representatives Jenn Hill (D-Marquette) and Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) introduced HB 4840, which would require utilities to offer rebates to customers to  offset the costs of solar and storage systems by thousands of dollars.
A companion bill, HB 4839, would require the Michigan Public Service Commission to create a virtual power plant (VPP) system which would aggregate solar plus battery systems into the grid when needed.
McKinney’s bill, HB 4840, would establish a rebate to customers of $500 per kW for a new solar system and $300 per kWh for a new battery storage system, which would be doubled for LMI customers.
The companion bill introduced by Hill would support a VPP framework, including load reduction, demand response and voltage support.
“An in-home battery paired with solar can keep vital medical equipment or refrigerators full of food running for days, protecting households during outages cause by extreme weather,” Hill said. “As an additional benefit, behind-the-meter storage systems can provide excess power back to the grid during periods of peak energy demand.”
“These bills will help build a more equitable and just Michigan while also making our state greener,” McKinney said. “In recent years, my district has been heavily impacted by power outages due to wind, ice and other causes, which have hindered many residents’ access to power. This legislation mitigates against those negative consequences. It also ensures that low-income areas receive opportunities to access alternative energy.”
The new legislation would boost Michigan’s residential solar market. Net metering ended in the state in 2018, replaced by the “Distributed Generation Program.” This program is similar to net metering because solar users get credit for all the excess energy they send to the grid—but only during the day. The credits vary by utility and are used to offset the power supply portion of their electric bills.
Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer in the Spring of 2022 announced the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which proposes that the state gets to 60% renewable energy resources and build infrastructure to accommodate millions of electric vehicles by 2030. The state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) states that 15% of the state’s energy consumption must be from renewable sources.
Through Q1 2023, Michigan ranked 25th in the U.S. for solar development, with 1.04 GW of total installations and a 2.61 GW pipeline of projects to be deployed over the next five years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/23/vikram-solar-announces-1-5-billion-vertically-integrated-manufacturing-operation/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,COLORADO,INDIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 23, 2023",Vikram Solar announces $1.5 billion vertically integrated manufacturing operation,"Vikram Solar, an India-based solar module producer, has partnered with investors Phalanx Impact Partners and Das & Co. to create a U.S. joint venture, VSK Energy LLC. The new company plans to invest up to $1.5 billion to develop a vertically integrated solar manufacturing operation.
The first phase of the investment consists of a $250 million investment to establish the Colorado module manufacturing facility in a recently completed building owned by Mortenson Properties and Hyde Development.
The new factory is expected to create over 900 direct jobs with an average salary of more than $70,000 and 200 construction phase jobs. VSK Energy expects the facility to commence operations in 2024 with an initial capacity of 2 GW of solar PV modules and planned expansion of up to 4 GW in the coming years.
With two planned projects, VSK extends Vikram Solar’s 17 years of solar manufacturing experience to the U.S. with financial support from sustainability-focused private equity firm Phalanx Impact Partners and Das & Co., a multi-tiered asset manager.
“Colorado is one of the top states in the country for solar production so this expansion in Brighton will help build upon our plans to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040, create more than 900 new good-paying jobs for Coloradans and contribute to our state’s thriving economy,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis.
“Cleantech in Colorado contributes $4.6 billion per year to the state’s economy and employs over 62,000 Colorado workers. By establishing a new solar manufacturing facility in Brighton, VSK will grow this important employment sector and help further Colorado’s commitment to grow clean energy technologies,” said Eve Lieberman, Executive Director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.
The second phase of investment would complete VSK’s vertical integration of the solar manufacturing process with the development of a second U.S. factory in a Southern state to produce solar ingots, cells and wafers with a planned annual capacity of 4 GW and $1.25 billion capital commitment.
VSK Energy is expected to commence operations in 2025 following the evaluation and finalization of available federal, state, regional, and local incentives for the project. The new factory is expected to create over 1,500 direct jobs and 1,000 construction jobs.
Mortenson, a leading solar engineering, procurement, construction, and commercial contracting firm, will oversee the engineering and construction of both phases of VSK Energy’s planned investment.
To construct both phases of VSK Energy’s planned module and ingot facilities, Mortenson intends to hire hundreds of team members from the local communities involved in the project, including pipefitters, electricians, sheet metal workers, plumbers, operators, carpenters, laborers and safety professionals.
“With our 17 years of experience in solar manufacturing, combined with the VSK team’s commitment to a clean energy future, we look forward to driving the solar industry forward and setting a new benchmark for innovation and efficiency in solar manufacturing in the United States.”
“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act was a landmark moment for the clean energy future of the United States,” said Sriram Das, Co-Chairman of VSK Energy and Managing Director of Das & Co. “The Biden Administration and Congress have called for immediate action and through our partnership in VSK, we are taking a decisive step towards achieving solar technology self-sufficiency, fortifying America’s energy security, and propelling large-scale solar deployment.”
Dentons LLP represented Vikram Solar for the creation of the VSK Energy JV, while McDermott Will & Emery represented Phalanx Impact Partners and Reed Smith represented Das & Co.
Based in Kolkata, India, Vikran Solar has a presence in 32 countries, operates a portfolio of 1.42 GW of PV projects and employs close to 2,000 employees. The company’s cumulative production capacity of solar modules is 3.5 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/23/thin-film-solar-development-receives-2-million-in-funding/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 23, 2023",Thin-film solar development receives $2 million in funding,"The Cadmium Telluride Accelerator Consortium (CATC), announced last August, is a three-year program intended to accelerate the development of cadmium telluride (CdTe) technologies. The goal of the initiative is to make thin-film solar cells (made with CdTe) less expensive, more efficient and to develop new markets for thin-film products.
CdTe solar cells were first developed in the United States and make up about 20% of U.S. the market for solar modules. The Consortium intends to spur technological advancements in CdTe manufacturing that will help increase America’s competitiveness, bolster domestic innovation, and support clean electricity deployment supporting President Biden’s goal of achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.
NREL released the request for proposal notice for small projects in September 2022, and the following six projects were selected:
University of Utah
University of Utah researchers will develop bilayer stacks for back contacts to state-of-the-art CdSeTe/CdTe absorbers. The researchers will focus on p-type materials that have energy level alignment predicting hole selectivity, are amenable to passivation and have a wide gap to provide transparency for enhanced bifaciality or back mirror cell optics.
The team plans to obtain state-of-the-art absorber stacks from CTAC partners and fabricate sputtered back contacts, and will continue to develop our surface photovoltage and SPV spectroscopy techniques to characterize back contact band structure, traps, and recombination activity.
University of Delaware
Researchers at the University of Delaware intend to develop new approaches for processing Cd1-xZnxTe solar cells that overcome previously reported difficulties, such as ineffective chloride activation and passivation, which prevented the realization of high performance with increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) relative to CdTe.
The approach will be based on two hypotheses: Modification of film growth, including in situ antimony incorporation, can form more equilibrated films with reduced defects and enhanced grain sizes, reducing the need for high-temperature activation; and alternative halide activation chemistries during post-deposition treatments can minimize the deleterious effects of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) activation. A final goal of the project is to confirm the viability of Cd1-xZnxTe by demonstration of a thin-film solar cell with VOC ≥ 1.0 V.
University of South Florida
University of South Florida researchers will develop alternative device architectures based on n-type CdTe/CdSeXTe1-X(CST) thin-film absorbers to create opportunities to overcome the efficiency limitations associated with the current state-of-the-art p-type CdTe/CST solar cells.
The project aims to build upon advances in n-CdTe/CST films that demonstrated group III and VII n-type doping for CdTe films. The team will focus on the development of p-type heterojunction partners for n-CdTe/CST absorbers.
Missouri University of Science and Technology
Missouri University of Science and Technology researchers plan to  enhance telerium (Te) recovery from copper processing (CP) by optimizing the current operations to capture the Te, gold (Au), and silver (Ag) that are presently lost to tails.
The scope of work involves: advanced mineralogical analysis of different processing streams of the flotation circuit of CP ores to identify Te carriers and modes of occurrence (i.e., Te in the crystal lattice vs. Te-rich inclusions in larger minerals); evaluation of different approaches and flow sheet options for enhanced separation of Te, Ag, and Au minerals from processing streams of CP ores; and techno-economic assessment to estimate the capital and operating costs of the developed flow sheets for successful implementation, which could increase the domestic production of Te from CP ores by at least 50%.
Arizona State University
Arizona State University researchers will combine the power of hard X-ray microscopy (XRM) and soft X-ray and electron spectroscopies to probe arsenic (As)-doped CdSeTe absorbers and devices. XRM will probe the chemical distribution, atomic environment, and current collection at the nanoscale for the As and selenium (Se) absorption edges. Electron and soft X-ray spectroscopies will enable an area-integrating determination of the electronic structure at surfaces (band edges, surface bandgap) and interfaces (band alignment), in addition to the chemical bonding environment of the sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), and oxygen (O) in the device.
The team is tackling two main questions: How do the chemical states of As (and neighboring atoms) evolve between initial deposition and post-activation? What stressors and processes enhance or prevent activation of As dopants?
University of Utah
University of Utah researchers will assess the role of microstructures in advanced CdTe devices. The goal is to improve the limiting open-circuit voltage while retaining the maximum values of short-circuit current and fill factor of CdTe solar cells by developing a novel architecture built on a comprehensive understanding of local carrier dynamics. The team plans to investigate the interfacial and microstructural characteristics of advanced CdTe (CdSe(1-x)Tex) Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact (PERC) solar cells.
A microcontact array platform with tunable pattern geometry will enable measurements of global (patterned CdTe PERC) and local carrier transport, delineating the contribution of grain bulk and grain boundaries to overall photovoltaic performance. Using complementary electron/optical microscopy, we will correlate the transport characteristics to the microstructural properties of each sample set (e.g., GrV-doped vs. copper (Cu)-doped CdTe PERCs).
NREL will serve as a resource, support, and technical analysis center as the consortium develops a technology roadmap, conducts research to meet targets set within the roadmap, and regularly assesses the domestic CdTe supply chain for challenges and opportunities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/23/puget-sound-energy-to-reach-63-clean-energy-by-2025/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WASHINGTON",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 23, 2023",Puget Sound Energy to reach 63% clean energy by 2025,"Seattle-area utility Puget Sound Energy (PSE) will add 300 MW of utility-scale solar, 500 MW of wind, and 50 MW of battery capacity by 2025 to reach 63% clean generation.
PSE relies heavily on hydroelectric generation and now has 770 MW of wind capacity. Washington State has 600 MW of solar capacity, providing less than 1% of generation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) determined that the 63% renewables target, set by the utility in late 2021, appears “reasonable in light of forecasted costs.”
The UTC also said that PSE’s plans to add 80 MW of distributed solar and 25 MW of distributed battery storage by 2025 were reasonable. Regulators directed PSE to increase the amount of community solar in its plan, however, from 25 MW to 50 MW, saying that community solar “provides greater benefits to customers” than customer leasing of solar or battery resources.
PSE is Washington State’s largest utility, with 1.1 million electric customers.
Transparency
As a condition of approving the utility’s plan, state regulators required PSE to increase the transparency of its resource planning going forward. The UTC said that within 60 days PSE must provide a narrative describing the methodology used to develop its renewable energy targets, and how those targets will contribute to meeting the 63% clean energy target by 2025.
The UTC also required PSE to obtain a license for UTC staff to use the Aurora and PLEXOS models, which the utility uses in its planning. At least one other state, Arizona, requires transparent modeling for utility resource plans, allowing state regulators to reproduce a utility’s modeling, or modify it using different assumptions.
Regulators also required PSE to rerun its resource planning models with an updated methodology for incorporating the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions and updated capacity values for energy storage, saying that PSE had undervalued storage.
Based on those new model runs, regulators ordered PSE to recalculate its interim clean energy targets and its energy storage target, and to incorporate any changes in its 2023 resource plan.
Equity
Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA) requires the state’s utilities to transition to 80% clean electricity by 2030 and 100% clean electricity by 2045, and sets equity goals as well. The state’s three investor-owned electric utilities must file periodic plans to show how they will achieve those targets.
The UTC set numerous conditions for PSE to improve the equity aspects of its plan. For example, PSE was ordered to develop a rent-to-own option or other options in place of leasing rooftop solar and residential batteries to customers.
“Prioritizing the most impacted communities in an equitable distribution of benefits and reduction of burdens will make CETA implementation truly transformative,” said Mariel Thuraisingham, clean energy policy lead for the community coalition Front and Centered. “The UTC’s order is a major step to keep utilities on track and hold them accountable for a just transition to a clean energy future.”
Earthjustice, the environmental law nonprofit, represented Front and Centered and the nonprofit NW Energy Coalition in the UTC’s regulatory proceeding that reviewed PSE’s plan, with support from the consultancy GridLab.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/23/agrivoltaics-seeking-mainstream-recognition-in-farm-bill/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 23, 2023",Agrivoltaics seeking mainstream recognition in Farm Bill,"Senators Merkley of Utah and Booker of New Jersey have introduced the Pollinator Power Act of 2023 to the U.S. Senate for consideration.
The legislation aims to make pollinator-friendly habitat development at solar power facilities eligible for loans and grants under the Farm Bill. The bill specifies that agricultural producers, rural small businesses and farmer owned cooperatives that build solar power facilities and receive federal funding may include pollinator habitat construction costs in their funding calculations.
The bill restricts the coverage of pollinator habitat construction costs to no more than 55% of the total cost. It further stipulates that at least 35% of the ‘new soil area’ developed under the project must be allocated to pollinators. Moreover, a minimum of 50% of pollinators must be planted and maintained as a native cover, exclusively comprising native plant species.
The legislation also indicates that solar projects that incorporate pollinator-friendly habitats will be given greater grant consideration over projects without such habitats.
Concurrently with the submission of this bill, Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Mike Braun (R-IN) broke the partisan mold by introducing the $75 million Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Act of 2023. If enacted, the law would allocate funding at a rate of $15 million per year from 2024 through 2028. The act stipulates that the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) must collaborate with the Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE) and other pertinent specialists to conduct extensive research and demonstrations of agrivoltaic systems.
According to Cathy Day from the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, these “marker bills” indicate the senators’ desire for these provisions to be incorporated into the upcoming Farm Bill – the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 – which is renewed every five years.
The Pollinator Power Act aligns with recent research indicating that retrofitting 217 existing utility-scale solar facilities with pollinator-friendly habitats could yield up to $264 million annually for the U.S. farming industry. Such habitats, when combined with sheep grazing, can sequester up to 80% more carbon. While classifying pollinator-friendly habitats as agriculture might be a stretch, there’s no doubt, as evidenced by the 217 solar facilities, that they significantly support agriculture. Furthermore, polls suggest that  a solar facility incorporating food production would garner more favorable views from 81% of respondents.
