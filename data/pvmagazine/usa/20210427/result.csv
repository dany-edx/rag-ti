The department said that without added transmission, the grid “cannot reliably and consistently deliver renewably sourced power” from often-remote points of generation to high demand areas.
DOE said it has two separate financing streams available to help with transmission projects:
In addition, the Department of Transportation said it will work to make use of public highways and other transportation rights-of-way to speed transmission line siting and permitting. To do so, DOT issued guidance to help state transportation departments host transmission lines, build renewable energy projects, deploy broadband, and support electric vehicle charging along highway rights-of-way.

The project is being developed to support the city of Knoxville, Tennessee’s goals of having 20% its electricity demand met by renewables and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, compared with 2005 levels. The Knoxville Utility Board will buy the energy generated through a long term power purchase agreement, enabled by TVA’s Green Invest program.
Origis will develop, build, own, and operate the plant, which is set to employ three to five full-time operations and maintenance staff. Origis expects to complete the facility in late 2023, pending environmental reviews.
Because the project is so early in development, Origis has not yet released equipment supplier details.
TVA said that the PPA makes Knoxville the top city in the Southeast and one of the top cities in the nation for solar power investment.
The project represents a new level of solar development in Mississippi. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Mississippi has installed just under 320 MW of solar to date. The project will be one of the largest installed to date, surpassing Recurrent Energy’s upcoming 100 MW Sunflower project.
These aren’t the only large projects coming to the state, however. Last summer, regulators approved the Moonshot Solar project and the Cane Creek Solar project, each clocking in at 78.5 MW. All totaled, the four projects will account for a more than 100% increase in installed solar capacity, representing a cumulative 457 MW.
This article was updated on April 28 to correct a misspelling of the developer, Origis’s name.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/27/tesla-touts-the-market-strength-of-its-powerwall-energy-storage-product/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 27, 2021",Tesla touts the market strength of its Powerwall energy storage product,"Tesla reported that its energy storage deployments grew 71% year over year in the first quarter of 2021, driven largely by what it said was the popularity of its Powerwall product.
The company said that rooftop solar deployments reached 92 MW in the first quarter, its strongest quarter in 2.5 years. Solar roof deployments grew 9x compared to the same period last year. The growth curve slowed, however, from the fourth quarter of 2020 when the company installed 86 MW.
CEO Elon Musk told an earnings call that the company had made some “significant mistakes” with its solar roof project. Recent price volatility reflects a realization that the complexity of roofs varies dramatically, he said. The company’s recent shift to sell rooftop solar and energy storage as a package is intended to streamline installation by ensuring that power goes to the battery system before reaching the electric circuit breaker.
Musk said that a software update for the Powerwall could enable as much as a 50% power increase over the 5 kW of real power currently specified. The company said that demand for Powerwall “continues to far exceed” its production rate. As a result, the company said it shifted Powerwall deliveries to solar customers only. As production rates increase, Tesla said it may make the energy storage system again available as a stand-alone product.
(Read “Making the numbers work for a residential energy storage system.”)
The company said that the February snowstorm in Texas and other blackout events continue to drive customers toward home energy storage. Even so, it said that energy storage deployments can “vary meaningfully quarter to quarter” depending on the timing of specific project milestones, which is the driver behind the company’s reported sequential decline in megawatt-hours.
The company deployed 260 MWh of storage in the first quarter of 2020 and 1,584 MWh in the fourth quarter. The pace sagged to 445 MWh in the first quarter of 2021.
Musk said that Powerwalls could be used to stabilize the grid and operate as a virtual power plant. He said the concept is likely to gain traction as electric vehicle adoption increases.

Rapidly falling costs of renewables and energy storage make it possible to achieve the required “massive expansion” of clean power systems at low cost, the reports said. However, wind and solar must grow from today’s 10% of total electricity generation to about 40% by 2030, and more than 75% by 2050.
As a result, annual wind and solar installations must grow by 5-7 times by 2030, and more than 10 times by 2050. They also must be joined by parallel deployment of other zero-carbon generation technologies (like hydro and nuclear), flexibility solutions, storage, and power networks to deliver zero-carbon power systems at scale.
In total, electricity could represent up to 70% of final energy demand by 2050, versus 20% today, with total electricity use expected to grow as much as 5 times in the coming decades, the reports said.
Electricity could represent up to 70% of final energy demand by 2050 versus 20% today.

The reports examine the feasibility of achieving a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy by 2050 and the actions required in the next decade to put this target within reach.
The reports said that clean hydrogen will play a complementary role to decarbonize sectors where direct electrification is likely to be technologically challenging or prohibitively expensive, such as in steel production and long-distance shipping.
A net-zero GHG emissions economy by mid-century will likely need to use “about 500 to 800 million tons of clean hydrogen” per year, a 5-7-fold increase compared to hydrogen use today. Green hydrogen, produced via the electrolysis of water, is likely to be the most cost-competitive and the major production route in the long-term, due to falling renewable electricity and electrolyzer equipment costs. The reports said it also could account for roughly 85% of total production by 2050.
Public policy is “essential” to drive clean hydrogen adoption.

The reports said that public policy is “essential” to drive clean hydrogen adoption. Policymakers will also need to anticipate growing hydrogen transport and storage needs. In total, 85% of investments required to ramp-up hydrogen production is for renewable electricity provision. Additionally, on the order of $2.4 trillion ($80 billion per year) will be required between now and 2050 for hydrogen production facilities and transportation and storage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/27/cs-energy-and-goldman-sachs-bring-more-than-200-mw-of-solar-to-new-york/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 27, 2021",CS Energy and Goldman Sachs bring more than 200 MW of solar to New York,"CS Energy said it has developed and begun work on a 216 MW, eight-project solar portfolio in upstate New York, in partnership with the Goldman Sachs Renewable Power Group (GSRP) and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).
The company began construction of Darby Solar, a 27 MW project; Branscomb Solar, a 27 MW project; Stillwater Solar, a 27 MW project; Grissom Solar, a 27 MW project; Regan Solar, a 27 MW project; Pattersonville Solar, a 27 MW project; Janis Solar, a 27 MW project; and Puckett Solar, a 27 MW project.
Stillwater Solar was originally developed by East Light Partners, acquired by GSRP, and is being constructed by CS Energy. All of the projects are expected to reach commercial operation by the end of 2021. The eight will become some of the first operational utility-scale solar projects in upstate New York, according to CS Energy.
The projects will also bring New York on the cusp of having 3 GW of installed solar capacity, enabling the state to join California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Massachusetts in hosting that much capacity.
Construction is expected to generate 500 jobs, and the $160 million in project investment is expected to generate more than $80 million in benefits for local communities.
As with all other large-scale solar development in the state, the eight projects were initially procured and developed through the state’s Clean Energy Standard, which has evolved into a commitment to ensure that 70% of the electricity consumed in the state by 2030 is generated by renewable energy.
Contracts for the projects were awarded by NYSERDA as part of its Renewable Energy Standard Request for Proposals in 2017 and 2018.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/27/sunrise-brief-hyzon-and-raven-partner-to-deploy-hydrogen-for-commercial-vehicles/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 27, 2021",Sunrise brief: Hyzon and Raven partner to deploy hydrogen for commercial vehicles,"Hyzon Motors, a New York State-based supplier of hydrogen fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles, signed a memorandum of understanding for a joint venture with renewable fuels company Raven SR. The two plan to build up to 100 hydrogen production hubs across the United States and globally. As part of the deal, Hyzon will acquire a minority interest in Wyoming-based Raven.
Each hub is expected to convert organic waste into hydrogen for Hyzon’s commercial vehicles. Raven owns a portfolio of patents for a conversion process that involves no combustion, which the company said avoids creating pollutants and particulates while producing more hydrogen per ton of waste than competing processes.
The hubs are planned to be built at landfills and are expected to power garbage trucks and other classes of heavy-duty trucks. The first hub is planned to be built in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is expected to be commissioned in 2022.
Conversion costs are expected to be similar to hydrogen produced using hydrocarbons, so-called “gray” hydrogen. The initial hubs are expected to process 50 tons of solid waste daily, per hub, and are expected to yield up to 4.5 tons of renewable green hydrogen each, enough to power 100 commercial vehicles. Future hubs may scale to five times larger to handle sites with higher hydrogen requirements.
Last October, Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures, the venture capital arm of Total SE, and other specialist hydrogen investors made an investment in Hyzon. The company operates out of the former General Motors fuel cell facility in Honeoye Falls, New York, near Rochester. The company has European operations in the Dutch city of Groningen with JV partner Holthausen Clean Technology.
Hyzon expects to deliver around 5,000 fuel cell trucks and buses over the next three years. By 2025, Hyzon’s capacity is expected to be more than 40,000 fuel cell vehicles annually.
Over 400 municipalities, counties, and regional organizations have now achieved designation under SolSmart, a federally funded program that helps local governments make it faster, easier, and more affordable to go solar.
SolSmart communities are in 41 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. SolSmart is led by The Solar Foundation and the International City/County Management Association, and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office. Launched in 2016, SolSmart is a national designation program designed to recognize communities that have taken steps to address local barriers to solar energy and foster the growth of mature local solar markets. The program offers technical assistance at no cost.
A new study from Missouri University of Science & Technology, Florida State University, University of Miami, and University of Texas at Austin found that SolSmart designees added between 300-450 MW of solar capacity and 12,800-19,200 new installations nationwide. That translates the $10 million in taxpayer funds for SolSmart into $1-2 billion in additional solar investment. The study also found that SolSmart speeds up the permit process for solar installations by 7.5 days on average.
Tri Global Energy said it will sell the 400 MW Honey Creek Solar project and the 180 MW Hoosier Line Wind project to Leeward Renewable Energy, which owns and operates a portfolio of around 2,000 MW of generating capacity. Financial terms were not disclosed.
The projects are located in White County in northwestern Indiana and are targeted to be operational as early as 2023. They represent the first deal between the two Dallas-based companies and the first renewable project sales for Tri Global Energy in Indiana.
Since the origination of these projects in 2019, Tri Global Energy has been the project developer. The company will continue as a co-development partner under the sale arrangement.
Battery tech company Gridtential Energy announced $12 million in financing led by 1955 Capital with participation from Silicon Valley Bank, August Capital cofounder David Marquardt, ReneSola CEO Yumin Liu, and existing investors East Penn Manufacturing, Crown Battery, and the Roda Group.
The funding will support a new production line of lead reference batteries, including a factory-ready single-block 24V deep-cycle lead battery. Gridtential has raised $28 million to date.
The company is targeting its battery for personal mobility vehicles such as golf carts, scooters, e-bikes, and e-tuk-tuks, as well as RVs and telecom backup or renewable energy storage systems in homes and offices.
Gridtential created its Silicon Joule battery as an alternative to lithium-ion and based it on readily available lead-battery technology and solar materials. Silicon Joule replaces the metal grids in conventional lead batteries with silicon wafers and a stacked-cell architecture. The goal is to reduce weight, increase power performance, and extend cycle life.
The company said that its Silicon Joule batteries charge up to two times faster, last more than four times longer, and weigh up to 30% less than conventional lead batteries. The batteries also maintain the thermal stability and 99% recyclability of the conventional technology.
Manufacturers East Penn, Crown, and Leoch are licensed to mass-produce the batteries. Nine more partners — mostly international — are piloting the technology, the company said.
