The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that as much as $3 billion to $5 billion in lost revenues each year can be attributed to PV soiling.
However, measuring soiling losses accurately has been a difficult task for the solar industry worldwide. As site conditions continually change due to localized weather and a changing climate, understanding the evolution of soiling losses can help asset operators better predict soiling impacts.
Fracsun, which keeps a soiling loss database spanning 22 countries, announced it has formed a partnership with App Orchid, an artificial intelligence platform provider, to offer a soiling loss database and simulation tool.
The Fracsun database is now collecting data on 7 GW of solar assets across various environments. The company said its tool will enable more accurate production modeling and operations and maintenance budget planning.
With a simple query to the database, users can predict soiling losses with assistance from App Orchid’s AI platform. The simulation tool makes use of historical weather patterns, particulate matter, and other relevant data, and integrates it with a probabilistic modeling and decision engine. The application is available for any location in the U.S.
“Our collaboration with Fracsun proves how the predictive analytics and decision-making AI built on App Orchid’s platform can enable the solar industry to be more sustainable while improving profitability,” said Vaibhav Nadgauda, chief executive officer, App Orchid.
The tool will arm project developers with more accurate modeling data, operation and maintenance teams with a clearer picture of operational costs and maintenance schedules, and origination teams with an understanding of which regions are best suited for development.
“Developers and operational professionals alike are often asking for better insight into future costs and production impacts due to soiling for their assets,” said Catlin Matthies, chief executive officer of Fracsun. “This unforeseen impact to project performance has been a source of pain for years and only looks to be getting worse looking to the future.”
IEA estimates that in 2018, soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV. And this is expected to increase to around 4% to 5% this year, thanks to an increase in PV installations in regions highly prone to soiling, economic pressures, and the fact that more efficient PV modules will suffer larger losses to their output due to soiling.

The trackers will serve LRE solar projects under development and construction through 2027.
The agreement demonstrates the shared commitment by both companies to use domestically sourced materials as well as to create jobs in the renewable energy industry. Nextracker reports that much of the steel and electronics used in the supply of its systems are manufactured in factories the company commissioned over the past two years. For example, the company recently commissioned a manufacturing facility in Memphis, Tennessee where MSS Steel Tubes USA will manufacture low-carbon steel components for Nextracker. The tracker provider also manufactures domestic steel in Pennsylvania and Texas, all of which will be help support the fulfilment of LRE’s 3 GW order.
LRE owns and operates a portfolio of 25 wind, solar and energy storage facilities across the United States, totaling approximately 2.7 GW of generating capacity. The company reports that it has another 1.9 GW contracted and 20 GW under development and construction across 100 projects.
“We are pleased to expand our long-standing partnership with Nextracker, whose technology will enhance energy production at our facilities,” said Jason Allen, chief executive officer at LRE. “Nextracker is a domestic supplier with a strong track record of delivering systems on time, and our agreement allows LRE to significantly de-risk our supply chain and uphold our commitment to providing our customers with reliable energy to meet their needs and sustainability goals.”
Nextracker has delivered more than 75 GW of its NX Horizon smart solar tracking system. By adding the TrueCapture smart control systems Nextracker reports that energy production has been found to increase up to 6%. Further advantages include the ability to handle varied site terrain and changing weather conditions, which Nextracker reports is the result of its independent-row architecture and optimization in response to data collected from thousands of sensors across its built-in wireless network.
This is the second VCA agreement between LRE and Nextracker, further extending their strategic partnership.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/01/certainteed-offers-25-year-warranty-for-solar-panels-with-integrated-warranty-coverage-for-roof-and-solar/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 1, 2023",CertainTeed offers 25-year warranty for solar panels with integrated warranty coverage for roof and solar,"According to Providence Research, the global rooftop solar PV market size is expected to hit around USD 398.3 billion by 2030. Interest in solar power systems in the US, for residential as well as commercial and industrial applications, has experienced significant recent growth thanks to tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In an industry where product reliability is of utmost importance, CertainTeed is differentiating itself from other panel manufacturers by offering customers a comprehensive 25-year “Wrap Warranty” on its recently-launched Solstice solar panels.
The state-of-the-art technology behind CertainTeed solar panels enables them to perform exceptionally well in various environmental conditions, making them suitable for installations across the diverse landscapes of the United States – from a scorching desert to a chilly mountain region. The Solstice panels can also be installed with either a new or existing asphalt shingle roof. When the panels are installed in tandem with a new CertainTeed roof, the entire system is protected under one company. The comprehensive warranty, which covers both parts and labor for all major system components, is the strongest in the solar industry.
The 400 W Solstice half-cell mono-crystalline panel has a 20.5% efficiency and features a black grid backsheet, a 0.35% temperature coefficient, and a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V. The frame is made of black anodized aluminum.
With a combination of product and performance guarantees, CertainTeed aims to assure its customers that the Solstice panels will continue to function optimally for decades. Instead of separate warranties per component, the Wrap Warranty covers all major system components and their installation ─ including industry leading coverage for essential elements such as inverters, racking systems, and other critical components that are integral to the overall functionality of the solar energy system.
With CertainTeed’s solar panels, customers benefit from not only the warranty on the solar system but also the company’s roof warranty that covers the roofing materials and workmanship, ensuring that the roof’s integrity is maintained throughout the solar panel installation process. CertainTeed also offers commercial customers the option of restoring their aging roof with CertainTeed’s SMARTCOAT liquid-applied roof restoration systems, enabling them to align 25-year warranties for a low-slope roof as well as the rooftop solar system, giving customers peace of mind and confidence in their investment.
End-to-end coverage is guaranteed for the workmanship by credentialed installers, even if the contractor who provided the service is no longer in business. Through the warranty, a customer can have their system tested to determine the cause of a performance problem, have any defective components repaired or replaced, and have any faulty installation workmanship corrected, giving customers peace of mind and confidence in their investment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/01/solar-decommissioning-plans-for-36-u-s-states/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 1, 2023",Solar decommissioning plans for 36 U.S. states,"Law Firm Lewis Roca has released what it believes is the first legal analysis to compile and assess renewable energy decommissioning requirements on a national level. The document, titled State Requirements For Decommissioning End-Stage Renewable Energy Projects, found that 33 states have fully established rules and regulations for decommissioning, with three more in development.
The report also includes an index that references the laws in each state, making it easy for developers to quickly find the correct language.
The co-authors of the report, Tom Dougherty and Dietrich Hoefner said, 
Some states focus exclusively on financial assurance requirements to ensure that end-of-life obligations are funded, while others also mandate specific regulatory standards for decommissioning efforts. Some states require the submission of detailed decommissioning plans, some provide for government monitoring and approval of decommissioning efforts, and some focus heavily on land reclamation.
The most popular decommissioning requirements include the development and continued updating of decommissioning plans, land restoration requirements, and bonding requirements to ensure that end-of-life work is paid for.
Of the 36 states analyzed in the report, 33 have developed and deployed programs for wind or solar – with 29 mentioning solar. Interestingly, two states with a heavy wind presence – Iowa and Kansas – have no decommissioning regulations at all.

Each state profiled in the report receives a single page, featuring a description and references to the decommissioning requirements. Both state and local-level decommissioning rules are referenced.
An example of financial insurance requirements is provided by North Dakota. The state mandates that decommissioning start within 12 months of abandonment or at the end of a facility’s useful life, and it must be completed within 24 months. An environmental effect report must be part of the decommissioning process. North Dakota also requires financial assurance equivalent to 5% of the estimated decommissioning cost. This assurance can take various forms, including a performance bond, cash escrow held by a financial institution, a surety bond or a guarantee.
New York state offers a more detailed set of requirements.
According to New York state’s decommissioning guideline handbook, a 2 MWdc solar facility might cost $98,900 to dismantle. Facilities on third-party-owned land must include a guarantee or security agreement.

As part of the permitting process, the solar facility must include a statement that outlines the decommissioning plan, the handling of any hazardous materials, environmental impacts, aesthetics, salvage and recycling plans, potential future uses for the site, and the expected end of the facility’s useful life. The statement must also be updated every five years.
The state is also considering a new law stating that if a solar facility is built on prime soils or farmland, the soils must be capable of agricultural production once all equipment is removed from the site.
Other organizations have previously analyzed nationwide restrictions on siting solar power across the United States.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/01/fercs-proposed-rule-would-harm-consumers-and-the-energy-transition/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 1, 2023",FERC’s proposed rule would harm consumers and the energy transition,"In his 2022 State of the Union Address, President Biden accurately highlighted the significance of competition in capitalism, stating that “capitalism without competition is exploitation.” The American economic model thrives on competition, which drives innovation and holds monopolies in check keeping prices low for consumers. However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is currently considering a proposed rule on electricity transmission that not only fails to support competition expansion but retreats from existing regulations intended to introduce a new era of transmission competition. Instead of pursuing policies that lower electricity costs for consumers, FERC’s proposed rule would condemn ratepayers to decades of accelerating price hikes.
The need for new transmission is at the heart of the Biden administration’s energy strategy and vital for the United States’ efforts to reach net zero by 2050. According to the Net-Zero study by Princeton University, the U.S. will have to spend approximately $2.1 trillion on transmission in the next three decades. The cost of new transmission is significant, and the price of new transmission infrastructure will be borne by consumers. It is imperative that we find ways to lower the cost of expanding the grid. Electricity transmission competition is the answer.
Where electricity transmission competition has been allowed, it has been shown to lower transmission costs by up to 40% across a range of new transmission projects. It has played critical roles in bringing innovation to the transmission system and connecting needed renewable energy sources to the electricity grid. If new transmission projects were competitively bid, ratepayers could save over $800 billion.
Both the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are strong advocates of competition and have expressed their support for electricity transmission competition in a joint comment submitted to FERC. Elizabeth Wilkins, FTC Director of Policy Planning, put it best “Competition is still the best way to ensure that our electric grid is built out in a way that lowers rates, increases innovation, and improves sustainability and resiliency.”
Incumbent monopoly utilities oppose competition for the simplest reason of all: profits. Utilities profit by applying a 10 to 12 percent rate of return on every dollar spent, with returns on their transmission investments lasting for up to 40 years. Naturally, these monopolies fear competition and have filed numerous comments to FERC to prevent its implementation. This anti-consumer business model was the driving force behind the Obama administration’s FERC Order 1000, which was designed to usher in a new era of competition by eliminating the utility’s right of first refusal (ROFR). Because FERC has failed to enforce Order 1000, only 3% of all transmission projects have been competitively bid.
Incumbent utilities have spent the decade since that order lobbying for state-level ROFRs and petitioning for waivers. The result is that despite flat electricity demand and supply, prices have increased consistently, and last year electricity prices recorded their highest annual increase since 1984. Between 2014 and 2021, the transmission portion of consumer electric bills skyrocketed by a staggering 79%, while energy and distribution cost components remained relatively low. The reason is evident: incumbent utilities have been able to steadily raise consumer prices without fear of losing business because of the absence of competition.
The recent declines in the rate of inflation in the Consumer Price Index have not been reflected in the electricity markets. The July 2023 data showed that electricity price inflation was 80% higher than the economy-wide CPI index. The rising price of electricity is affecting households, with a Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey revealing that 33% of the 44 million renter households across the country fell behind on their utility bills in the last year.
Transmission competition is the key to upgrading our electricity grid in a cost-effective manner. FERC must embrace competition and deliver on its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates for consumers. The rest of the Biden administration and consumers from across the country support competition – FERC must do the same.

Paul Cicio is chairman, Electricity Transmission Competition Coalition and president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America. He is a associate member of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission’s Energy and Environment Advisory Committee; a board member of the Center for Environmentally Responsible Materials Recycling and has served on other advisory roles for the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of the Interior.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/01/doe-announces-over-450-million-for-solar-plus-storage-in-puerto-rico/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUERTO RICO",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 1, 2023",DOE announces over $450 million for solar-plus-storage in Puerto Rico,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced up to $453.5 million from the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF) aimed at increasing residential rooftop solar and battery storage installations across the region, with a focus on reaching and supporting Puerto Rico’s most vulnerable residents.
The $1 billion PR-ERF fund was established after recent hurricanes devastated the already inconsistent electric grid on the island of Puerto Rico. President Biden toured the island in October 2022 after Hurricane Fiona, and after seeing the destruction, committed to leveraging the technical support of federal agencies to support improvements to Puerto Rico’s electric grid. Then in December, the President signed the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act into law, which includes $1 billion for the PR-ERF funding to drive key investments in renewable and resilient energy infrastructure in Puerto Rico.
The PR-ERF calls for at least two rounds of funding. The goal in the first round is to rapidly deploy residential rooftop solar and energy storage for vulnerable households and households that include individuals with disabilities. The second and possibly subsequent rounds may include energy resilience solutions like community solar, microgrids, and other grid modernization solutions as well as potential partnerships with local groups and workforce training.
The development of the PR-ERF has relied heavily on local collaboration and feedback, including a formal Request for Information (RFI) released in February 2023, as well as Secretary Granholm consistent engagement with residents and stakeholders in the region consisting of strategic meetings, townhalls, and community listening sessions.
In addition to deployment, the first round of funding of $435.5 million will provide consumer protection and education initiatives to support residents’ long-term use of solar systems. It also includes a Solar Ambassador Prize for community groups to identify and connect with eligible households.
“A future powered by renewables will offer the residents of Puerto Rico more energy security and more reliability—all while leaving households with cheaper bills to pay,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “DOE is using every tool at our disposal to expand access to clean energy, especially for the communities most at risk, giving families the peace of mind knowing that their communities are resilient in the face of the climate crisis.
The goal of this funding allocation is to incentivize the installation of from 30,000 to 40,000 solar and battery storage systems for very low-income single-family households that are either in a community that experiences frequent power outages or has family members with an energy-dependent disability. Funding will also provide residents receiving solar and battery storage installations with ongoing system education, training and consumer protection support.
Potential applicants include private industry, non-profit organizations, energy cooperatives, educational institutions, and state and local governmental entities.
The second round of funding for the PR-ERF will be announced at a later date.
PR-ERF FOA applications are due on September 18, 2023, at 5:00 p.m. AT/ET. Visit the Grid Deployment Office website for more information on the contents of this funding opportunity announcement and how to apply.
The Solar Ambassador Prize has a separate application process and deadline of September 25, 2023 by 5 p.m. AT/ET. This competitive funding opportunity will award $15,000 in seed funding for local organizations in Puerto Rico to identify qualifying households and help them enroll in DOE’s residential solar PV and battery storage installation program by spring 2024. The plan is to award a total of $3.5 million to up to 20 community organizations in the region. The winning ambassadors may receive additional compensation based on the number of beneficiaries enrolled in the program and verified by DOE.
DOE and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will host a public bilingual informational webinar about the Solar Ambassador Prize on August 17, 2023, at 11:00 am AT/ET. Registration is required.
