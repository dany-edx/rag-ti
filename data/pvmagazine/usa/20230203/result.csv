Vote Solar’s Jenna Warmuth, regional director for the Midwest told pv magazine that she is very confident that Governor Walz will sign the bill, as it was a part of his campaign platform.
This is a crucial milestone on the road to equitable, economy-wide decarbonization, according to a statement reeased by Vote Solar in support of the legislation.
The bill includes gulidance to the Public Utilities Commission to support jobs, prevailing wage provisions, affordable energy, and more. Once signed into law, Vote Solar said the impacts to Minnesota’s public health, clean energy workforce, and bill affordability will be tangible and widely felt.
The state’s major utilities, Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power, had already “pledged” to be carbon free by 2050. Speeding up that plan by a decade would seem to pose a challenge, however, Warmuth said that the utilities have been very supportive. She said that while the utilities have been working toward being 100% clean energy, the achievement ultimately requires a bit of faith that conditions to support scaling up equitable clean energy will continue to improve. She added that by the time we get to 2040, existing technologies will be more readily available and accessible for all, noting that the passage of this legislation brings the state closer to that goal.
Per the bill, by 2030, Minnesota utilities would need to generate 80% of their electricity with carbon free sources. By 2035, 90% of their electricity would have to be carbon free, and 55% would need to come from renewables such as wind and solar. By 2040, the law would require 100% carbon-free electricity for the state. The bill defines wind and solar power under 100 MW, and defines hydroelectric, hydrogen, and biomass as carbon free. Nuclear power is referenced in the bill, too, and can be considered carbon-free energy, but only after various groups have voted on a resource plan to insure that is in the best interests of the general public.
Warmuth noted that getting to 100% will “take a mix of everything”. Looking at the role of solar in the mix, Minnesota currently ranks 16th in the nation for installed solar capacity, rising rapidly from 29th place in 2021. A study by Vibrant Clean Energy modeled rooftop and smaller-scale distributed energy found that the lowest-cost way for the U.S. to dramatically reduce emissions by 2050 is for about a fifth of our power to be provided by rooftop and local solar power. Today, rooftop and community solar in Minnesota provide about 3.6% of the state’s power overall, according to SEIA. Warmuth noted that “we have a long way to grow in both DG and utility-scale solar,” but that the newly passed clean energy standard creates conditions for that growth to happen.
With the governor’s signature, Minnesota will join 22 states and Washington DC that have already pledged 100% clean electricity, energy, or net zero by various time frames from 2035 through 2050.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/03/utility-scale-updates-on-texas-36-gw-five-year-solar-path/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023",Utility-scale updates on Texas 36 GW five-year solar path,"Texas is living up to its proverbial “bigness” as it is set to take over as the largest solar market in the United States. A triumphant 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the 16 GW that is active to date.
Much of this investment in solar, which nears $20 billion, is going towards big solar farms, often exceeding 100 MW in capacity.  Over 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and those jobs numbers will sharply rise as more utility-scale projects are built. Today, nearly 5% of Texas electricity is generated by solar.
The solar buildout is promising for Texas, though it does come with some mounting challenges in transmission costs and congestion, climate resilience, and price stabilization.
Relatively low land costs and high solar irradiance in West Texas makes it one of the premier hotbeds of solar development. This development is pushed along by high demand from East Texas, which houses five of the top 15 largest cities in the U.S. Below are some recent utility-scale solar developments across the Lonestar State:
Orsted 471 MW
Ørsted, a utility-scale renewable energy developer with a large footprint in Texas, announced it will break ground this month on the 471 MW Mockingbird solar center. The project is the development company’s largest solar facility to date.
The facility is expected to produce the equivalent of 80,000 Texas homes’ electricity demand, interconnecting with Texas utility Oncor Electric. The project will create at least 200 jobs during construction and will require long-term staffing for operations and maintenance. The project is expected to be completed in 2024.
Mockingbird will inject an estimated $215 million of new revenue into the state’s tax base, promoting local economic development in Lamar County, and providing long-term financial support for North Lamar and Chisum Independent School Districts.
As part of the project, Ørsted announced it is collaborating with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to protect nearly 1,000 acres of native tallgrass prairies in Texas.
Plenitude 263 MW
Plenitude, a solar development company operated by Eni SpA, the Italian energy firm, activated the 263 MW project in Brazoria County, Texas for retailer Target this week. The Golden Buckle Solar Project is located on 1,483 acres about 50 miles south of Houston. The Italian developer installed the project in just over one year. Golden Buckle will produce 400 to 500 GWh per year of solar energy, enough clean energy to support 45,000 households annually.
“We have inaugurated the largest photovoltaic plant ever built by Plenitude in our short but successful history of renewable energy development,” said Stefano Goberti, chief executive officer of Plenitude. “It is a further step towards our renewable energy capacity, which exceeded 2 GW at end of 2022, in line with our goal to achieve over 6 GW globally by 2025.” 
Golden Buckle was developed with the support of Novis Renewables, LLC, a partnership between Eni New Energy US, Inc. and Renantis North America.
EDF 256 MW
EDF Renewables North America announced the execution of a 20-year virtual power purchase agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific. The contract covers the full output of the 256 MW Millers Branch solar project, slated for commercial operation in 2025.
The power purchase agreement, added to its other renewable assets, is expected to match 100% of Fisher Scientific’s annual electricity consumption in the U.S. by 2026.
Once complete, the project is expected to generate 545 GWh of renewable energy annually, enough to meet the consumption of nearly 51,000 average homes. This is equivalent to avoiding over 386,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually, representing the greenhouse gas emissions from over 83,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year.
“The purchase of low carbon electricity from Millers Branch Solar supports Thermo Fisher’s progress toward its net-zero commitment. The project will also contribute to the local economy – the construction phase will provide job creation, local spending with vendors, and an expanded tax base,” said Valerie Barros, senior director of origination and power marketing at EDF Renewables.
Pristine Sun 5 GW portfolio
Pristine Sun announced a $250 million capital commitment from private equity and family office investors to develop, finance, and build up to 5 GW of solar projects. The commitment will support proposed and active projects in Texas, California, and Louisiana.
Since 1995, the company has been developing solar and wind farms in rural and suburban areas in 22 states and several countries around the world. Pristine Sun is 100% owned by the Helming family office and has built more than 350 solar facilities.
WEC Energy 250 MW
Wisconsin electric utility WEC Energy Group announced a $250 million investment in a portion of the five-part Samson solar portfolio, which combined will contribute 1.3 GW of solar capacity to the grid. The utility will purchase 80% of a 250 MW project segment.
The project was developed by Invenergy and has been in operation since May 2022. It currently has an active power purchase agreement with AT&T. Together with its wind power contracts, WEC Energy Group has committed to over 2 GW of renewable energy.

From the suit, brought by the SunSpec Alliance, nine of the patents were seemingly ruled in Tigo’s favor, while two of them were apparently ruled in SunSpec’s favor. SunSpec did note that they would potentially appeal the ruling, and needed to have conversations with its members on what to do next.
Reading the headlines from the competing press departments only – one is led to believe this was a ‘win win’ type of decision. Tigo noted that they secured an ‘overwhelming’ 80% victory rate.
The headline read: Tigo Energy Secures Overwhelming Legal Victory Protecting U.S. Innovation in Solar Industry: U.S. patent office rejects more than 80% of SunSpec Alliance patent challenges, helping Tigo protect solar industry R&D investments
Tigo expressed excitement at their portfolio of patents being mostly defended. They hardly mentioned the two patents that were ruled against, except to say, “ruling on the two other claims has no effect on the applicability of the 18 remaining claims in the ’770 patent to the SunSpec Rapid Shutdown Specification.”
The headline read: Patent Office Invalidates Tigo Energy Inc.’s Patent Claims in Response to SunSpec Alliance IPR Challenge
SunSpec appeared happy to take down two specific patents, out of eleven overall. SunSpec noted in their press release that “Petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that claims 12 and 13 of U.S. Patent No. 10,256,770 are unpatentable.” SunSpec stated in their release that U.S. Pat. No. 8,531,055 anticipated the claims by Tigo.
In its press release, SunSpec noted that Tigo had filed suit against SunSpec members using their ownership of patent 10,256,770. SunSpec included links to prior art.
However, at the end of SunSpec’s press release, they do express disappointment over losing the argument on the other nine patents. SunSpec is considering its next steps, which may include filing an appeal.
pv magazine USA reached out to both companies to gain insight into why the two groups might both be feeling positive about the outcome, but as of the time of this publication has not received a response.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/03/window-mini-split-air-conditioner-company-secures-series-a-funding/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023",Window mini-split air conditioner company secures Series A funding,"Faced with the age-old quandary of how to cool residential buildings during the summer without central air HVAC systems, compressors that drain the grid and cause system outages, or toxic refrigerants harmful to the environment, a San Francisco start-up has devised a window-mounted mini-split air conditioner (AC).
According to the International Energy Agency, the number of AC units in buildings across the world is projected to hit 5.6 billion by 2050. Current HVAC systems—built by industry incumbents whose product design hasn’t changed in decades —are damaging the environment.
Gradient, a technology company that has designed the first consumer HVAC device using a heat pump technology, has closed a Series A funding round of $18 million from Sustainable Future Ventures and Ajax Strategies.
“We are reimagining the HVAC industry by building products that keep homes comfortable and healthy for the people who inhabit them, without compromising the environment,” said Vince Romanin, co-founder and chief executive officer of Gradient. “Support from Sustainable Future Ventures will enable us to expand our operations, build new products, and achieve a 95% carbon reduction when our products are used to both heat and cool.”
“The global market for HVAC is $100 billion per year and growing rapidly,” said Matt Chagan, partner at Sustainable Future Ventures. “We are thrilled to support Gradient’s mission and be part of their mission-driven journey.”
Gradient’s first product, the Gradient, is a replacement for the traditional window AC, designed to give consumers the aesthetic of not blocking the window like traditional ACs do. Gradient uses heat pump technology and a climate-friendly refrigerant to create a product that the company says is quiet, effective, and energy efficient.
Gradient’s window unit requires an opening of at least 15 inches height, a window width of no less than 24 inches, and clearance of at least 24 inches below the window sill. An additional 6 to 16 inches of depth clearance into the single or double-hung window opening is also required.  The unit weighs 50 pounds and produces 48 to 58 decibels of noise between low and high setting. On cooling setting, the unit produces 8,600 BTU per hour, while the heating function produces 8,000 BTU per hour and operated at a standard 120V power setting.
The first Gradient units will be shipped over the Summer of 2023 and are available for preorder on the company’s website for $1,999 MSRP, including a $99 deposit. The consumer heat pump unit includes a one-year parts and labor warranty, and can be controlled via smartphone app, which provides daily heating and cooling scheduling functionality.
The company’s Series A funding is devoted to design and development of its second product, a window heat pump unit that decarbonizes heating in cold climate environments.
Meanwhile the company is planning a marketing strategy that will focus on multi-family homes, while it adds services like hardware monitoring, maintenance, leasing, and demand response services including integration with virtual power plants.  Additional funds from the round will be devoted for hiring new personnel.
Other investors in the company’s Series A round include Safar Partners, Climate Tech Circle, Shared Future Fund, At One and Impact Science. Matt Chagan, a partner at Sustainable Future Ventures, has joined the company’s board.
In August 2022, Gradient was awarded a seven-year contract by the New York City Housing Authority, New York Power Authority and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to deliver thousands of cold climate packaged window heat pump units in the New York area.
Formed in 2015 as Treau, Inc., the company does business as Gradient. The company has about 60 employees and has raised about $30 million to date from debt and equity investors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/03/duke-rooftop-solar-program-sunsets-corporate-solar-rises/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023","Duke rooftop solar program sunsets, corporate solar rises","Duke Energy, a large utility that serves 1.6 million customers in a territory around the Carolinas, is adjusting its renewable energy buildout strategy. As one program beneficial to homeowner utility bill savings phases out, another program serving large corporate customers is expanded. 
In North Carolina, Duke has awarded the final rebates in a five-year $62 million rooftop solar program. Required by state law, the program awarded rebates that totaled up to $4,000 per homeowner and up to $30,000 for a small business. 
This year, 356 customers statewide, most of them residential accounts, received rebates. Another 2,900 customers are on a waiting list, though most of them are not expected to receive payment. Duke Energy said it does not have a plan in place to support more rooftop solar programs.
Net metering is another rooftop solar-supportive program that is coming under threat. It was established in North Carolina in 2017 and requires, among other things, that each investor-owned  utility must file revised net metering rates with the North Carolina Utilities commission. The rates must be “nondiscriminatory and established only after an investigation of the costs and benefits of customer-sited generators.”
Duke has been criticized for releasing a carbon plan that is not aggressive enough, and the utility supports alterations to net energy metering that installers say may cut the value of rooftop solar by 25% to 30%.
Last year, North Carolina courts made a decision that bars homeowner’s associations (HOA) from banning rooftop solar installations. The state also reached a compromise on net metering structuring, though proceedings are still underway to iron out the future of net metering in the state.
Adding 4 GW 
Meanwhile, corporations and other large organizations have interested in solar procurement have something to celebrate, as Duke announced it will offer 100% renewable energy power purchase contracts via its Green Source Advantage (GSA) program. This marks a big step up from the 30% renewables contracts the utility used to offer. 
The GSA will now expand more than ten times over – reaching 4 GW of capacity. Past program participants have included the City of Charlotte, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Duke University. 
Customers can work directly with Duke Energy or independent developers for their long-term purchase of renewable energy. Participants may also combine energy storage with their project – allowing them to align the production of renewable energy with their energy load. Duke Energy is also proposing a new 10-year avoided cost bill credit option in addition to the existing hourly, 2-year and 5-year options. 
“We’re continuing to fine-tune our renewable energy options for all customers and are looking at programs such as community solar in the future. That will allow customers to directly subscribe to the output of a solar facility,” said Lon Huber, senior vice president, Duke Energy.
North Carolina currently has nearly 8 GW of solar installed or enough to power nearly one million homes. The state is currently getting more than 8% of its electricity needs from the sun.
One reason that North Carolina has leapfrogged other states is due to its Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (REPS), established by Senate Bill 3 in August 2007, which required all investor-owned utilities in the state to supply 12.5% of 2020 retail electricity rates from eligible energy sources by 2021. Municipal utilities and electric cooperatives must meet a target of 10% renewables by 2018.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/03/annual-investment-in-low-carbon-energy-transition-exceeds-1-trillion/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BRIAN SAVAGE,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023",Annual investment in low-carbon energy transition exceeds $1 trillion,"While the past year has been defined by supply chain disruptions, and fears of macroeconomic uncertainty and growing geopolitical struggles, investments toward net zero goals remain strong. 
Researchers at BloombergNEF (BNEF) found that annual global investment in energy transition technologies now exceeds $1.1  trillion, matching fossil fuels for the first time.  BNEF’s Energy Transition Investment Trends report offers a detailed accounting of how much funding is being committed to the low-carbon energy transition.
As seen above, this global investment of over $1.1 trillion represents a record 31% gain from 2021.  Renewable energy comprises the largest segment at $495 billion in new project investments. This includes wind, solar, biofuels, biomass and waste, marine, geothermal, and small hydro.
Electrified transport, which includes both vehicles and charging infrastructure, followed this at $466 billion, a 54% yearly growth.  Besides nuclear power, all other sectors saw record levels of new investment in 2022.  Surprisingly, hydrogen tripled its year-on-year investment to $1.1 billion thanks to investments in electrolyzer production capacity and rising interest in green hydrogen.
When it comes to corporate finance, climate-tech companies raised $119 billion in equity financing from public markets and private investors in 2022.  This represents a 29% decline as public markets struggled.  The biggest decline was funding raised through reverse mergers with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) which fell 75%. Venture capital and private equity (VC/PE) investment saw a small increase of 3% and was the only source of funding that did not decline. Companies in China continued to attract the most corporate funding of any market, but the U.S. ranked first in VC/PE funding.
Clean energy factory investments grew to $78.7 billion in 2022, up by almost 50% from 2021.  As seen above, new facilities for batteries and their related components have rapidly accelerated with investment now at $45.4 billion in 2022.  Factories for lithium-ion battery components accounted for about 58% of new facilities in 2022.  Solar continued to grow, rising to $23.9 billion in 2022.  As well, wind grew by about 33% from 2021.
China retained dominance with 91% of investments, which is up from 79% over 2018 to 2021.  While there have been rising efforts for supply chain diversification, and competition, BNEF’s figures only account for successfully commissioned factory projects.  U.S. manufacturing growth triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act is not yet fully reflected in the data.  Despite this, spending in North America still grew by 40%.
BNEF concluded that energy transition and grid investments must triple to $4.55 trillion on average for the rest of the decade to get on track for net zero. This may seem daunting, but investments in manufacturing capacity are already exceeding expectations. BNEF estimated that even under more ambitious net zero scenarios, annual manufacturing investment needs would only rival last years towards the latter half of this decade.  Existing solar manufacturing capacity is already sufficient to meet the bulk of demand, and the world’s battery cell factory pipeline exceeds projected demand.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/03/solar-development-partnership-supports-tribal-communities-and-corporate-esg-goals/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023",Solar development partnership supports Tribal communities and corporate ESG goals,"Seneca Solar, the energy solutions division of Seneca Holdings, LLC, is expanding its strategic partnership with Alternative Energy Development Group (AEDG), a developer of commercial and industrial clean energy projects.
Seneca Solar is a Tribal-owned business whose profits go directly toward supporting the on-territory needs of the members of the Seneca Nation, whose territory is in western New York. The company was established to deliver projects at scale for customers wanting their climate dollars to support historically underserved communities. Seneca Solar reports that it is building a Tribal workforce and Indigenous enterprise capacity to benefit current and future generations.
Seneca Solar’s role in the partnership with AEDG is to provide project management expertise, leveraging the capabilities of the $300 million business of Seneca Holdings. 
“Our collaboration with Seneca Solar enables us to support customers in the achievement of their ESG goals while also helping underserved communities around the world gain economic self-determination,” said Chris Fraga, founder and chief executive officer of Alternative Energy Development Group.
Former Tesla project manager Kevin Ademu-John will join Seneca Solar to integrate the company’s program management expertise with AEDG’s growing portfolio. At Tesla, he managed large portfolios of residential solar projects as well as Powerwall storage projects.
“I look forward to leveraging the experience I gained at Tesla to help AEDG and Seneca Solar expand their offerings,” said Ademu-John. “The partnership is combining the strong capabilities of both companies with a focus on energy equity to serve communities who have been left out of the clean-energy transition for too long.”
Seneca Solar and AEDG have collaborated since early 2022. Previous projects include conducting an extensive feasibility assessment for a Fortune 100 global company on a 10 MW solar project in Papua New Guinea, which would be built, owned, and operated by local Indigenous communities. 

“AEDG has been an ideal partner for Seneca Solar as we work to support Native and other underserved communities with Earth-healing solutions,” said Jeffrey Ellis, chief executive officer of Seneca Holdings. “Together, we are showing the mutual benefit of a more traditional company collaborating with a Tribally owned company.”
Working closely with AEDG, Ademu-John will help manage five portfolios of distributed generation projects across multiple U.S. states. With total capital expenditures of $135 million, more than 55 MW of projects are projected to offset 21,610 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The largest of the portfolios comprises 32 MW across five Northeast solar projects. These include municipal, low-to-moderate-income (LMI), and commercial-designated solar projects. In California, two solar projects totaling 4.9 MW under development will serve industrial customers.
In the Mid-Atlantic region, two Senaca Solar projects totaling 1 MW will serve retail customers. An additional three projects with 14 MW of power capacity will serve a major U.S. retail customer’s corporate headquarters and distribution facilities in the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest region.
In New England, Seneca will deploy an energy efficiency project for an agricultural customer providing energy and thermal heat. The 4 MW project is projected to reduce the customer’s electricity costs by 20% while increasing their energy efficiency.
In addition to helping Native communities develop and benefit from renewable energy projects, Seneca Solar and AEDG are helping companies of all sizes amplify the impacts of their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) programs. 
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator will seed state and local clean energy financing institutions and support deployment of clean energy technologies. Half of those investments are prioritized for disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, programs specific to tribal communities offer rebates on the purchase of efficient electric appliances, to bring clean power to homes that have lacked electricity.
LMI communities, tribal authorities and other disadvantaged groups may be eligible for a 10% ITC adder in addition to the 30% solar investment tax credit (ITC) and 30% standalone storage ITC. Some $7 billion worth of grants can be awarded from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund of the IRA for facilities such as solar-plus-storage projects of 5 MW or less on recognized tribal land.  In various instances a tribal authority can recover more than 50% to 70% of costs, if conditions such as the domestic battery content and labor, and the environmental justice, are met.

The global renewables power developer posted a strong $4.71 billion of 2022 revenue, a 15% increase over 2021.
In 2022, Brookfield Renewable increased the scale of renewable development activities, nearly doubling its renewables pipeline from 62 GW in 2021 to almost 110 GW today. In 2022 alone, the company commissioned approximately 3.5 GW of capacity, including completing the massive 850 MW Shepherds Flat wind repowering project.
The company’s wind and solar segments generated a combined $579 million of FFO.  The company continues to benefit from the contributions from recent acquisitions, Scout Clean Energy, Standard Solar and Urban Grid, and diversification of its generation fleet, underpinned by long duration power purchase agreements.
“2022 was another successful year, continuing our track record of double-digit average annual FFO growth for more than a decade and executing on our growth initiatives, increasing our renewable power presence in all our core markets and expanding into transition investments”, said Connor Teskey, chief executive officer of Brookfield Renewable.
In renewable development, Brookfield Renewable invested $6.4 billion (approximately $1.4 billion net to Brookfield Renewable) of capital through both organic initiatives as well as acquiring new project development platforms. The developer continues to expand its U.S. market presence, with 74 GW of assets in operations and development.
On the back of the Inflation Reduction Act and strong corporate demand, the company is moving development projects forward in the U.S., which increases the growth prospects of its renewable development businesses.
