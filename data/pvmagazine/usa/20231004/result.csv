The company has over 20 years of experience in the renewables space, and now has rebranded a division dedicated to renewable energy project needs. 
The company’s product set includes container integration, prefabricated skid mounted solutions, charging platforms for electric vehicles, solar ballasts for landfill applications, and substation equipment foundations within the utility and commercial and industrial (C & I) markets. 
In over 60 years in business, Lindsay Precast has deployed over 15 GW of skid-mounted solutions and hundreds of megawatts of solar ballasts. The company said the new Renewables division will operate as a full-service integrator, offering design and prefabrication support through a project’s entire lifecycle. 
The company was acquired in 2021 by MiddleGround Capital, a private equity firm in making investments in North American middle market business to business industrial and specialty distribution companies.
“As the U.S. moves toward clean energy targets while simultaneously managing aging legacy infrastructure, Lindsay Precast offers highly engineered product solutions that support renewable energy transitions and bolster national infrastructure systems,” says Lauren Mulholland, MiddleGround founding partner.
Lindsay Precast is headquartered in Canal Fulton, Ohio and has over 350 employees across 9 facilities located in Ohio, Colo., Fla, N.C., and S.C.

The Solar Farm was developed by PureSky Energy and Eden Renewables, and is designed to capture solar energy efficiently, reduce carbon pollution, provide a dependable source of low-cost, renewable energy to the community, as well as to provide habitat for pollinators. A ribbon-cutting ceremony will take place on October 11.
The 5 MWac solar power plant features 19,712 Vikram modules on Schletter single-axis trackers. The 9 MWh battery energy storage system from Powin is housed in a conditioned enclosure with built-in safety features. The plant is expected to reduce carbon emissions by over 17 million pounds per year and provide enough electricity to power an estimated 1,566 homes.
The project is paired with the proprietary digital energy platform Amp X, an AI-powered transactive-ready virtual power plant (VPP). It enables real-time autonomous management and optimized dispatch of the battery energy storage system, based on forecast demand, generation and market pricing variables.
“We extend our gratitude to the Schodack Town Board for their invaluable support in the development of this pollinator-friendly community solar farm which will create lasting benefits for the community and make an important contribution to local clean energy generation,” said Giovanni Maruca, chief operating officer of Eden Renewables.
PureSky Energy (formerly Amp Energy) is a provider sustainable energy solutions, backed by Palisade Infrastructure Group and Fiera Infrastructure. The company has a total of 200 MW installed across 39 projects.
Eden Renewables is a Troy, New York-based solar and energy storage developer with projects in the U.S., UK, and sub-Saharan Africa. Eden currently has developed 20 pollinator-friendly community solar projects in the Capital Region of New York.
The ribbon cutting ceremony will take place on Wednesday October 11 at 10 a.m. RSVP here.

Researchers from space technology company Maxar Technologies have created a new dataset for residential PV system detection by using high-resolution satellite imagery.
“This dataset may be used independently or in conjunction with larger, non-satellite imagery datasets to produce robust detection models capable of generalizing across image types,” the scientists explained. “It may better support the use of satellite imagery in rapidly detecting and monitoring residential-scale solar panel installations, allowing researchers and policy-makers to address the needs of various applications.”
The dataset contains 2,542 solar systems located in southern Germany. The researchers explained that they chose this region due to the high concentration of both residential and commercial solar systems. After acquiring imagery of the area, they randomly chose three areas within the selected region and used software to identify the solar arrays.
They annotated individual solar panel objects manually and, in order to verify their identification, they compared the findings to images from Google Earth, which offers higher resolution images. Objects with potentially only one or two solar modules, either adjoined or separated, were considered as non-panel objects such as skylights, ventilation caps, and chimneys.
“In total, 2,487 solar panel objects, or 97.8%, were identified with high confidence,” the academics stated. “Less than 3.0% of the solar panel objects were identified with moderate or low confidence.”
The scientists said the novel dataset can be either used to develop detection models uniquely applicable to satellite imagery or in conjunction with existing solar panel aerial imagery datasets to support generalized detection models.
The dataset was introduced in the study “A solar panel dataset of very high-resolution satellite imagery to support the Sustainable Development Goals,” published in scientific data.
Maxar Technologies made both the image chips and the object labels available online.

The global PV O&M market grew substantially in 2022, with the top 15 suppliers overseeing 115 GW of PV capacity, up 13% from the previous year, according to Wood Mackenzie.
In their 2023 report on global PV O&M service provider dynamics, Wood Mackenzie said that the leading 15 companies in the sector collectively added 13 GW to their global portfolios in 2022. However, the market experienced a slight contraction of 2.8%, resulting in a 56% market share for these suppliers by the end of 2022, down from 58% in 2021, indicating fragmentation within the solar O&M industry.
The top three suppliers remained unchanged from the previous year, with NovaSource leading, followed by SOLV Energy, and Spain’s Solarig in third place. Across the portfolios analyzed by Wood Mackenzie, O&M suppliers expanded their capacity under contract by 18% in 2022, reaching a total of 207 GW.
Regarding O&M contract prices for large-scale projects in the United States, they decreased in 2022, averaging $7.9 (€7.4)/kW/year, representing a 22% decline. While specific details were not provided, the report indicated that Europe, the Middle East and Africa had the highest cost per megawatt for large-scale projects, followed by North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In terms of volume growth, North America led the way, adding 13 GW in 2022 for a total of 86 GW. EMEA expanded by 23% to reach 59 GW, APAC grew its portfolio by 2.6 GW, reaching 40 GW, and Latin America added 4.7 GW, reaching 20 GW.
The dynamic landscape of the O&M market is exemplified by recent developments such as RES Group’s acquisition of Ingeteam, which is set to become a significant multi-technology O&M provider. This move could potentially propel RES Group to the fourth position in the global solar O&M ranking once the deal is finalized, according to Leila Garcia da Fonseca, research director for renewables in the Americas at Wood Mackenzie.
While further market consolidation is anticipated to lead to increased price competition, long-term projections suggest rising costs. Factors contributing to this include increasing labor costs, general inflation, and the adoption of digital solutions, which have contributed to the recent decline in prices, as explained by Garcia da Fonseca.
