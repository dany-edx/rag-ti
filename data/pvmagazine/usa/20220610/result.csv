https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/10/edf-renewables-signs-1-gw-of-nyserda-solar-and-storage-contracts/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK,NORTH AMERICA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 10, 2022",EDF Renewables signs 1 GW of NYSERDA solar and storage contracts,"EDF Renewable North America announced three solar projects with co-located energy storage have been awarded contracts by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).
The projects represent nearly 40% of the 2.4 GW awarded as part of NYSERDA’s 2020 Renewable Energy Standard Solicitation, and 170 MW of the capacity was awarded as part of the 2018 solicitation.
All three projects are expected to reach commercial operations by the end of 2025. The awarded projects are as follows:
The electricity generated at full capacity is expected to meet the equivalent of 243,000 average New York homes. They are estimated to abate 880,000 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually, the equivalent of 190,000 passenger vehicles’ annual emissions.
EDF Renewables is among the largest developers of renewable energy in North America, with 24 GW of solar, storage, and wind projects across the continent. About 70% of the company’s project pipeline is solar. To date, it has installed 187 MW of solar and 80 MW of wind in New York state.
NYSERDA’s 2020 clean energy solicitation program includes 22 new large-scale renewable energy generation sites, over 3,000 jobs created, and nearly $3 billion in direct investment. In total, the reduced carbon emissions is expected to be equivalent to taking 440,000 cars off the road annually.
Under the program, NYSERDA supports new project development, and the program creates an obligation for retail electricity suppliers, such as energy service companies, to purchase increasing amounts of renewable energy to supply their customers. The NYSERDA program is in pursuit of a 2030 target of 70% of the State’s electricity to come from renewable energy sources, and 100% zero-emissions electricity by 2040.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/10/duke-energy-florida-completes-its-first-solar-project-in-750-mw-plan/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,FLORIDA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 10, 2022",Duke Energy Florida completes its first solar project in 750 MW plan,"Duke Energy Florida announced it completed construction of the Fort Green Renewable Energy Center, a 74.9 MW facility that will serve the utility’s Clean Energy Connection plan, which allows Duke customers to opt-in to sourcing a designated amount of capacity from the project on their monthly bill.
The facility was built on about 500 acres of land, consisting of 265,000 panels mounted on a fixed-tilt racking system. It is expected to produce enough power for roughly 23,000 homes at peak energy production.
Residents and small/medium businesses may join its new Clean Energy Connection “community” solar program. Applicants will be randomly selected to become subscribers to solar energy produced by the utility’s PV.
Under the program, customers can subscribe to kilowatt blocks of power, which are charged at $8.35/kW. The utility said a customer with an average usage of 1,000kWh a month could subscribe to about 5kW to cover their energy needs.
The bill credit rate tied to the solar production of a customer’s kW “block” will be $0.04/kWh for the first 36 months of the program, and then starting with the 37th month of continuous enrollment, the bill credit rate increases by 1.5% each year. This bill credit amount varies each month with the actual solar energy produced, meaning customer savings is tied to the successful production of the utility-owned solar facility.
Community solar offers an option to be connected with a carbon-free energy source for those who do not have a suitable roof space for PV. Generally, community solar projects are smaller than utility-scale plants, and are attached at the local distribution level, rather than to large-scale high voltage transmission infrastructure. This program, the Clean Energy Connection, supports the development and construction of Duke Energy Florida-owned solar, said the utility.
“Community solar” appears to be broadly defined in this instance, where the utility company remains sole owner-operator of the assets.  Rocky Mountain Institute offers a framework for the next generation of community solar projects that would be designed to support resilience and cost savings for community stakeholders.
The program sets aside 26 MW for income-qualified customers who participate in government subsidy programs or Duke Energy’s low-income energy efficiency program, Neighborhood Energy Saver. For these customers, the fixed monthly $9.03 credit per kW subscribed will always be higher than the fixed monthly $8.35 subscription fee per kW subscribed. The average subscription amount for income-qualified customers (5 kW) results in approximately $42/year in bill savings, said Duke.
Duke said it anticipates the Clean Energy Connection program to be allocated as follows: 486.85 MW to large commercial and industrial customers, 74.9 MW to local government customers, 161.25 MW to residential and small business customers and 26 MW to low-income customers. Each MW represents electrical power equal to 1 million watts, referring to the output capacity of the solar facility.
Duke Energy Florida has invested more than $2 billion in solar and expects to have 1.5GW of emission-free generation and 5 million PV modules installed by 2024. Currently, the company has over 400MW of solar assets in operation.
“Bringing cleaner resources onto the grid is important to our customers and our company,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida president. “By subscribing to the Clean Energy Connection program and supporting solar sites like this one, our customers are joining a community that is helping drive Florida to a cleaner energy future.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/10/renewable-energy-bill-threatens-to-stall-solar-in-hawaii/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,HAWAII",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 10, 2022",Renewable energy bill threatens to stall solar in Hawaii,"At a rally earlier this week at Hawaii’s state capitol building, solar advocates including the Hawaii Sierra Club, the Hawaii Solar Energy Association (HSEA) and numerous local solar companies, along with concerned citizens, urged Governor Ige to veto SB 2510. The portion of the bill that is raising ire among opponents is a policy that requires at least 33.33% of renewable energy on each island to be generated by “firm” renewable energy as opposed to intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Some of the island, such as Kauai, are already over the threshold, and would have to halt new construction, cutting jobs and limiting the advancement of solar in the state. Approximately 3,000 people are currently employed in the solar industry in Hawaii.
The bill is also opposed by Tesla, the Hawai‘i Youth Climate Coalition, Environmental Caucus of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, Our Revolution Hawaii, 350Hawaii, Beyond Kona, and dozens of other groups.
The primary sponsor of the bill is Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz (D)  who said that “Over-relying on an intermittent source of energy will make it difficult for a utility to provide stated services for its customers… It’s scary to think that we’re going to rely on mostly intermittent. We can do hydro, pumped storage, hydrogen…”
A petition drafted by Jeff Kaemmerlen, CEO of the solar firm Sunspear, says the bill would “tip the scales in favor of expensive and high-emission biomass or biofuel projects and penalize proven solar and storage technologies. This bill picks winners and puts constraints on industry innovation and customer choice.” The petition has gathered nearly 300 signatures to date, with a goal of 500 before sending it to the Governor.
“The Governor’s veto of SB 2510 is essential to prevent a 180-degree turn in the wrong direction for Hawaii energy policy,” said Rocky Mould, executive director of HSEA. “There is no reason to limit solar, especially when solar and battery installations lower consumer energy costs and improve grid reliability.”
Hawaii’s renewable portfolio standard calls for 100% renewables by 2045, an effort to reduce reliance on expensive, imported fossil fuels. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association the state ranked 16th for installed solar in 2021, with nearly 18% of its electricity needs coming from solar. Hawaii currently has the highest electricity rates in the country, currently at 32.76 cents kWh, a jump of 7.6% in the past year. The bill, if passed, would limit the number of residents who could install solar to control their electricity costs.
According to Wayne Tanaka, Director of the Hawai’i Sierra Club, “SB 2510 is a threat to Hawaii’s clean energy future and will slow down our transition away from fossil fuels at the very time that we need to accelerate renewable energy adoption.  Allowing SB 2510 to become law would be a terrible mistake.”
Many of those opposed to the bill say that a biomass producer is behind it. “To say we cannot go with cheap alternatives but have to go with more expensive alternatives because someone is being greased, makes no sense,” said Henry Curtis, executive director and vice president for consumer issues of Life of the Land, a non-profit environment group based in Honolulu.
Governor Ige has until June 27 to say whether he is going to veto the bill.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/10/clean-hydrogen-and-energy-storage-project-in-utah-receives-504-million-loan-guarantee-from-doe/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,UTAH",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 10, 2022",Clean hydrogen and energy storage project in Utah receives $504 million loan guarantee from DOE,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) closed on a $504.4 million loan guarantee to Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development for the Advanced Clean Energy Storage I project, the world’s largest industrial green hydrogen facility. The project, which is located in Millard County, Utah, was announced in 2019 and is currently in its final stages of debt and equity closing.
The loan guarantee is the first for a new clean energy technology project from DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) since 2014, and it will help finance construction of the facility. The project is expected to create up to 425 jobs and will advance President Biden’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050 through clean energy deployment, as well as replacing a retiring coal-fired power plant.
“The Advanced Clean Energy Storage team, with its world-class industry partners, is excited to secure this loan by DOE to develop the first phase of the world’s largest renewable hydrogen energy hub,” said Michael Ducker, senior vice president of Hydrogen Infrastructure for Mitsubishi Power Americas and President of Advanced Clean Energy Storage I. “This step creates a path to accelerate the long-term hydrogen market and clean energy landscape to expand decarbonization across the United States.”
The facility will combine 220 MW of alkaline electrolysis with salt cavern storage for grid scale energy conversion and storage using hydrogen as the energy carrier. The clean hydrogen will be stored in two massive 4.5-million-barrel salt caverns. Advanced Clean Energy Storage will capture excess renewable energy when it is most abundant, store it as hydrogen, then deploy it as fuel for the Intermountain Power Agency’s (IPA) IPP Renewed Project, a hydrogen-capable gas turbine combined cycle power plant that is planned to be incrementally fueled by 100% clean hydrogen by 2045.
The plan is to use the stored hydrogen as fuel for a hybrid 840 MW combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant that will replace the retiring 1,800 MW coal-fired power plant. The project is estimated to help prevent 126,517 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually based on the difference in the emission profiles of the IPP turbines between 100% natural gas fuel to a 70% natural gas and 30% hydrogen fuel blend.
“Since President Biden’s first day in office, DOE has made it a priority to leverage the potential of the Loan Programs Office to fund emerging technologies that will deploy clean and reliable energy to Americans,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Accelerating the commercial deployment of clean hydrogen as a zero-emission, long-term energy storage solution is the first step in harnessing its potential to decarbonize our economy, create good paying clean energy jobs and enable more renewables to be added to the grid.”
As of the end of May, the Loan Programs Office has attracted more than 70 active applications for projects in 24 states totaling nearly $79 billion in requested loans and loan guarantees.  With the closing of this loan guarantee, LPO now has $2.5 billion in remaining loan guarantee authority for Innovative Clean Energy projects. Since early 2021, LPO has made substantial changes to improve its Innovative Clean Energy Loan Guarantee Program and its Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/10/new-york-distributed-storage-owners-could-soon-earn-money-in-wholesale-markets/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 10, 2022",New York distributed storage owners could soon earn money in wholesale markets,"New York grid operator NYISO plans to enable aggregations of distributed storage systems to earn compensation for participation in wholesale capacity markets, by the end of this year.
New England grid operator ISO-NE already allows for such compensation. SunPower has aggregated 11 MW of New England rooftop solar plus storage systems into a virtual power plant, and each system will earn $190 per year by selling the capacity into the New England market and occasionally injecting energy to help meet peak load. System owners will in turn be compensated by SunPower.
Yet two other federally regulated grid operators, PJM and MISO, have proposed to delay offering compensation for wholesale capacity market participation until 2025 and 2030, respectively. The two grid operators together serve one-third of the US population. The remaining two federally regulated grid operators, CAISO and SPP, do not operate wholesale capacity markets.

In Texas, where the grid operator ERCOT is not federally regulated and there is no capacity market, Tesla has called for enabling distributed storage to participate in the wholesale energy market.
A “half-time report” from the Center for Renewables Integration reported the timelines for the federally regulated grid operators. The consultancy reviewed the plans filed by the six grid operators to comply with a federal order requiring grid operators to open their wholesale markets to participation by aggregations of distributed resources, known as Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 2222.
Beyond reporting the wide spread in timelines proposed by the six regional grid operators for meeting FERC Order 2222, the Center’s co-founder Kerinia Cusick evaluated the quality of the compliance plans, as shown in a filing by Voltus, a company that helps firms maximize the value of their distributed energy resources. The evaluation, shown below, appears to show that California’s grid operator CAISO, along with NYISO, have submitted plans most favorable to distributed resources.

FERC is now reviewing the grid operators’ proposals for complying with Order 2222. The commission has the option to either approve a plan, or send it back to the grid operator for further work.
Energy and ancillary services markets
FERC Order 2222 requires federally regulated grid operators to open their energy and ancillary services markets, as well as their capacity markets, to participation by aggregations of distributed energy resources.
The order will enable stand-alone distributed energy storage to inject energy to the grid more easily, said Cusick of the Center for Renewables Integration. Participation by resources such as fleets of electric vehicles “will hopefully be enabled,” if grid operators “get the rules right,” she said.
Ancillary services markets, along with capacity markets, “are much more financially attractive” than the energy market, with the exception of ERCOT, Cusick said. Existing markets for ancillary services include frequency regulation, spinning reserves, and non-spinning reserves, she said, adding “I anticipate that aggregations of distributed resources will want to participate in these markets.”
As a specific example of a grid operator’s ancillary services market in which distributed storage could participate, GridLab Executive Director Ric O’Connell mentioned PJM’s “Reg D” product, a fast frequency response product. “That product was mostly saturated with utility scale batteries, but it could have been a good option for distributed batteries,” he said.
