When combined with projects under development, the milestone represents 95% of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s goal to install 6 GW of solar by 2025, as mandated in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
While projects in development can never be counted on with certainty to achieve commercial operation, the previous figure only includes the 2.7 GW of solar projects that had been awarded NY-Sun incentives and are now under development across the state. These projects are expected to come online in the next two years, with that pipeline made up of more than 90% community solar, or more than 800 projects.
Last year was a transformative year for New York’s solar market, as the state installed 549 MW of community solar capacity, the most in the nation.  That announcement was made at a recent ribbon cutting for a 6.1 MW community solar array located in the town of Bethel in upstate New York.
Outside of distributed and community solar projects, NYSERDA’s large-scale renewables program has active contracts with more than 75 utility-scale solar projects either in development or active construction, totaling nearly 5 GW more of capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/13/energy-storage-aggregation-unlocks-benefits-for-homeowners-grid-operators-and-installers/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW ZEALAND,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 13, 2021","Energy storage aggregation unlocks benefits for homeowners, grid operators, and installers","Rooftop solar energy is instrumental in the grid’s evolution towards a decarbonized, reliable structure that is beneficial to all.
The time mismatch between peak solar production and residential peak energy demand has driven a need for distributed energy storage units to smooth the peak and more efficiently respond to demand.
Residential solar companies like Sunrun and now researchers in New Zealand are learning that the benefit of storage can be improved when storage units are used collectively, meaning batteries store and discharge power from the grid based on times of peak production or peak demand. And the gain in value is shared between solar companies, homeowners, and grid operators alike.
In a recent report published by the University of Otago in New Zealand, researchers took a demand-driven approach, analyzing a per-minute resolution time series of individual household demand over several neighborhoods that contained these distributed assets. A trial led by Aurora Energy and SolarZero in southern New Zealand provided data on the efficacy of this collective battery use method.
The results found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90%  or peak shaving.
The researchers said the results make a case for coordinated battery deployment at the street or building level for multiple economic benefits. These benefits include the potential reduction in energy storage cost for homeowners (who could buy a smaller unit), benefits to the grid in easing demand and load related strains, and benefits to solar developers who can add another value chain to their operations by facilitating these grid services.
As an example, if peak shaving occurred for demand above 3 kW per house, deploying batteries individually for 20 houses would require 120 kWh of storage.  By contrast, deploying batteries collectively would only require 7 kWh, the researchers said. Sharing batteries or having one battery per 20 houses would be a less expensive approach to providing these services, they said.
In the U.S., Sunrun has been a pioneer in aggregating batteries. In 2019, the residential installer secured a 20 MW bid to participate in New England’s ISO 2022-2023 forward capacity market, one of the first contracts of this type in the United States.
As part of the bid, Sunrun said it would deploy distributed solar and battery storage to about 5,000 customers in Massachusetts. It will be required to offer the grid 20 MW of power, 24 hours a day for the one-year period. In return, Sunrun will be paid $3.80/kW/month, representing a $912,000 total contract value. Homeowners who signed up for the program agree to allow their battery to be discharged overnight. In exchange, they receive an upfront cash incentive as either a payment or a reduction in the upfront cost of their system.
Sunrun has another project with a different strategy, where it is partnering with East Bay Community Energy (EBCE) near Oakland, California, to offer battery storage to low-income multifamily customers. The San Francisco-based installer will deploy solar-plus-storage on more than 500 low-income housing units by 2022. The energy storage units will deliver 500 kW of grid reliability capacity to EBCE, and homeowners will receive financial incentives for their participation in the program.
Homeowners needs, grid requirements, and policy environments vary widely across the country. Sunrun also has launched bring-your-own-device programs, virtual power plants, and non-wires alternatives, finding success in creating value propositions that share benefits among the homeowner, grid operator, and the solar installer.

By now, you’re probably wondering how to take care of your new 25-year investment!
In many ways, a solar power project is like a really nice Lego set. There are a few components that are unique (inverters and disconnects for instance), but it’s mostly a bunch of repeating pieces assembled according to an engineer’s instructions.
But don’t allow the simplicity to catch you off guard: Your solar power project will need some TLC.
Due to the strategic emergency benefits that solar power provides, the Federal Emergency Management Agency produced a document on the topic – Rooftop Solar Panel Attachment: Design, Installation, and Maintenance. The guide’s primary focus is on the proper installation and upkeep of nuts and bolts, in order to defend against wind events.
When Tesla had its own rooftop fire issues with Walmart, it was likely a result of faulty connections between solar panels. Per the lawsuit, incompatible electrical connectors may have loosened over time, leading to arc faults.
In prior contributions to pv magazine USA, former Navy nuclear engineer Lawrence Shaw recommended thermal scans of solar panels and routine checkups of their connections.
Another consideration: when a solar system goes down, it’s usually due to a faulty inverter. An analysis by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters.
Solar O&M comes down to mechanical rooftop connections, electrical solar panel connections, panel and connection temperatures, and inverters. So, how do we keep up with everything?
The first line of defense is a solar workmanship warranty. In many states, contractor law mandates that consumers get a one-year workmanship warranty on a solar installation. If any of the issues already mentioned come up, your contractor will visit the site and fix them.

DIY’er… If you’re handy, the most affordable option is monitoring and making repairs yourself. Naturally, this presents challenges. You will need to safely climb on your roof, understand electricity, and use hand tools properly. You’ll also need to learn how to diagnose solar inverter issues. If there are true hardware or connectivity issues, you will need to reach out to your solar contractor or an electrician to do the final repairs. Always remember that solar repair work involves multiple hazards, including the risk of falls and electric shock or electrocution that can result in serious injuries and even death.
Electrician services a la carte… If you trust your contractor’s work and have a good relationship with them or a local electrician, you can pay on an as-needed basis as issues arise. You should invite an experienced tech to do a site visit at least once a year for spot checking and bolt tightening.
This sort of a la carte structure puts an important piece of work in your lap: observing your system’s ongoing electrical generation. As the homeowner, you will need to make sure you check on your solar power project’s phone app, web interface, or the wall units to verify your system’s electricity generation numbers. You’ll also want to look into the performance of individual solar panels. If you forget to do this and fuses pop or the inverter shuts down, you can easily lose weeks of electricity generation.

If you liked your contractor and they did a good job during that first year, then the standard one-year workmanship warranty can be extended almost indefinitely, for a price. A service agreement by the original contractor or by a third-party electrician also can be purchased to accompany that warranty.

The service agreement should include regular observation of your solar power system via its remote access tools.  It should also include annual onsite visits to perform spot checks, retighten bolts, and test connectors. In dusty environments, your panels may also need a regularly scheduled cleaning.
If the extended workmanship agreement doesn’t jive with you and your original contractor, don’t sweat it. Plenty of electricians are willing to take over a one-year workmanship warranty and offer a full service package (after an inspection).
The guaranteed production and O&M package…If you own your own system and don’t want to worry about anything —  including your project’s return on investment — there is one higher level of service agreement that can be purchased.  Omnidium offers a full warranty on your solar system, including all hardware and services needed, plus a guarantee that your system will generate 95% of the approved contractor’s estimates. And if your system doesn’t meet those projected numbers, the company will pay you the difference.
These services require a one-time startup fee and an annual payment.  Your local electrician may still be the one doing the work on your project, but you’ll always have someone watching your system; someone who is legally bound to ensure it generates a certain amount of electricity.
The truth is, most solar power systems are fairly stoic and work for many years without drama or grievance. Choosing a good contractor from the get-go, and giving her or him the chance to build a solid, well thought-out system, will likely be your number one long-term safety factor.

The New York Power Authority, along with the Electric Power Research Institute, General Electric, and hydrogen supplier Airgas, will test the concept at the Brentwood Power Station on Long Island. The test will start with a blend of about 5% green hydrogen and increase to around 30%. Hydrogen in amounts greater than 30% would likely require equipment retrofits at the plant.
The project team will evaluate different concentrations of hydrogen blended with natural gas at regular intervals. They also will assess the blend’s effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and its overall system and environmental impacts, including nitrogen oxide emissions. The project will begin in fall 2021 and is expected to last six to eight weeks. The plant consists of a GE LM-6000 combustion turbine and was commissioned in 2001.
NYPA will lead the project with help from EPRI, GE, Sargent & Lundy, Airgas, and Fresh Meadow Power. EPRI will assist with the project design and technical evaluation. As the gas turbine original equipment manufacturer, GE will supply a hydrogen/natural gas blending system and support the project’s planning and execution. Sargent & Lundy, acting as the engineer of record for the project, will provide overall engineering and safety reviews. Airgas will supply renewable hydrogen, and Fresh Meadow Power will provide piping system design, material procurement, and installation services.
Southern California Edison launched its $436 million Charge Ready program, which is intended to add around 38,000 new electric car chargers throughout the utility’s service area over the next five years.
As part of the program, SCE will install and maintain the supporting EV charging infrastructure while site hosts, who are non-residential SCE customers, will own, operate, and maintain the charging stations.
The Charge Ready program set a target to locate half of the chargers in state-designated disadvantaged communities, or economically-impacted communities that suffer most from the negative effects of air pollution.
SCE launched a program last year for larger trucks, buses, and off-road industrial equipment called Charge Ready Transport, which aims to add charging to support at least 8,490 medium- and heavy-duty EVs over a five-year period. The $356 million program was modeled after an earlier Charge Ready pilot program
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Senate Bill 52 into law on July 12. The bill allows county commissioners to reject particular details of solar and wind projects, ban the projects entirely, or carve out portions of the county where those facilities may not be built.
The law takes effect in 90 days and requires project developers to notify county commissioners and trustees at least 90 days before filing with the state’s Power Siting Board. The bill also adds a commissioner and trustee to the siting board while it reviews the local project.
The bill had support from two northern Ohio counties where a wind development was the subject of local opposition. The APEX Clean Energy project ultimately was rejected by the siting board.
Cummins Inc. said it began testing a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine. The proof-of-concept test may potentially expand the technology options available and aligns with what Cummins said are its existing capabilities in hydrogen fuel cell, battery electric, and renewable natural gas powertrains.
Following proof-of-concept testing, the company plans to evaluate the engine in a variety of on- and off-highway applications.
The hydrogen engines can use green hydrogen fuel, produced by Cummins-manufactured electrolyzers, emitting near-zero CO2 emissions through the tailpipe and near-zero levels of NOx.
The engine maker said the high energy density of hydrogen enables on-board gas storage without compromising either vehicle payload or operating range. It said its joint venture partnership with hydrogen storage company NPROXX adds the ability to integrate the fuel cell or hydrogen engine with the high-pressure gas cylinder tanks and supply lines on the vehicle.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/13/by-addressing-heat-this-serial-inventor-just-may-change-the-entire-solar-value-chain/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,O&M,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 13, 2021","By addressing heat, this serial inventor just may change the entire solar value chain","It happens every day: A bird flies over your rooftop solar panel array and deposits an unwelcome offering on a cell. The bird dropping is an annoyance that needs to be cleaned off. But it also can result in a hot spot on the affected cell, impacting the entire panel’s output and potentially affecting its long-term performance.
The phenomenon is known as reverse bias and the hot spot that is its hallmark is something of an Achilles Heel for the solar industry. That’s because a single cell weakened by a bird dropping or a leaf shadow can be overpowered by stronger cells that surround it. Those neighboring cells send a reverse flow through the weaker cell causing it to experience temperatures that can exceed 400F and operate at voltages in excess of 20 times those of forward voltages.
All of that leads to cell stress, premature aging, and the increased likelihood of a module’s total failure.
A serial inventor, Kent Kernahan, first began to tackle the problem more than a decade ago. His solution was to design a control technology that detects reverse bias and redirects current away from the affected cell and through the rest of the otherwise healthy solar panel. He went on to create a company, IdealPV, to develop the technology.
And here’s where things get even more interesting: he also established a business model that could help disadvantaged communities all across the U.S. by making the technology available to non-profit entities set up under Section 501(c)3 of the U.S. tax code. The first such non-profit to start manufacturing IdealPV solar cells is getting underway now in California. More on that in a bit.
At its core, the control technology that Kernahan developed watches for a signal that the weakened cell sends out as it begins to overheat. The control system uses that signal to throttle back the affected cell, redirect current across the panel, and ease the onset of a reverse bias event.
“The breakthrough allows us to anticipate reverse bias” and act to alleviate the emerging hot spot, Kernahan told pv magazine in a recent interview.
IdealPV’s solar panel technology is based on what Kernahan refers to as the Law of Forward Only Zero Hot Spot (FOZHS). Derived from the First Law of Thermodynamics and the Law of the Photoelectric effect, FOZHS lays out that the conductance of a solar cell falls as its voltage becomes more negative. The company’s solar panels make practical use of this insight to keep the conductance of each solar cell high and prevent any of them from being subjected to the reverse (negative) voltage that drives extreme heat into the cell.
In and of itself, that’s a useful advancement in cell design. But Kernahan sees broader implications for his innovation across the cell manufacturing value chain. Because most modules are designed to manage wide variations in temperatures across very small intervals, everything from glass to adhesion and backsheeting is designed to handle temperature extremes.
By addressing reverse bias and the resulting heat, Kernahan and IdealPV moved to unwind and rethink the entire module manufacturing process. For example, without the need of bypass diodes and buss bars, it becomes practical to put more, shorter cells in series. This reduces internal cell and panel currents and increases internal panel voltage. In turn, this allows for cells with corner chips, local AR defects, and cracks to be used. Such cells typically are a fraction the cost of cells without defects.
The ability to remove heat-related design parameters “dumbs down the manufacturing requirements,” Kerhahan said, making for a “very forgiving manufacturing process.”
And that opens the door for what Kernahan and others hope will be a nationwide network of nonprofit solar module manufacturing facilities. By making use of provisions within the U.S. tax code, a group known as Community Home Energy Retrofit Project (CHERP) is working with individual and corporate investors whose focus is not on shareholder returns and maximizing profits, but on an underlying social mission to work in disadvantaged communities and expand solar’s adoption among low- and moderate-income people.
The first factory dedicated to IdealPV solar cell production opened in Claremont, California, earlier this year. Made possible in part by $2.1 million from the California state budget, the factory is waiting on certifications for its solar panel from the National Testing Laboratories. Once those certifications are in hand, CHERP will start to hire with a goal of producing its first modules later this year.
The factory will create around 200 jobs, with entry-level warehouse and installation workers paid between $16 and $20 per hour. Each panel produces around 330KWh a year through its expected 25-year production life. Each will cost about $160 to build  and take around 45 minutes to assemble. The plant will be able to produce up to 105,000 panels a year or enough for about 6,000 typical Southern California households. The switch to solar is projected to save those residents a combined $6.5 million in energy costs yearly.
Once the first facility is up and running, the plan is to replicate the template nationwide and help other community-based non-profit group create manufacturing jobs and deploy solar. Talks are under way with a substance abuse recovery facility in West Virginia, a green sustainability initiative in Michigan, and a gang rehabilitation and re-entry program in Los Angeles.
The initial goal of taking the heat out of solar panels could lead to the emergence of a non-profit-based solar manufacturing sector, Kernahan said. “We want to bring back middle-class employment and manufacturing.”
