Filed in the Wisconsin Circuit Court on Feb. 25, the lawsuit argued that the state’s Public Service Commission (PSC) should stick to “regulating monopoly utility companies” and not overstep its power by “illegally” interfering with private choices of families and businesses.
MREA’s litigation challenged PSC guidance documents that the group alleged discourage third-party financing for on-site solar. The group said such financing, which includes long-term leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs), helps make solar more attractive for customers who cannot afford to buy solar installations outright.
…many solar companies deem it risky that regulators will interfere with their business and block the sale of a project’s power to a customer.

Because of the uncertainty, the lawsuit added, many solar companies deem it risky that regulators will interfere with their business and block the sale of a project’s power to a customer.
MREA’s lawsuit also challenged guidance related to demand response incentives. The lawsuit is available here.
A PSC spokesperson told pv magazine USA that, although the commission is aware of the lawsuit, it does not comment on pending litigation.
In its lawsuit, MREA said that it hopes to build at least three 20 kW solar projects at Milwaukee-area public schools under a pilot program funded by the Couillard Solar Foundation. MREA would handle upfront costs and installation, and sell the energy under PPAs to host customers.
MREA said it hasn’t advanced the pilot program because the PSC’s documents assert that third-party financing constitutes prohibited public utility service.
MREA said that the State of Wisconsin has used third-party financing itself to obtain solar energy using contracts between the Department of Administration and outside financing entities. The contracts enable the state government to benefit from federal tax credits passed through the third party that the state could not otherwise receive.
Third-party financing has been an ongoing issue in the state. MREA Executive Director Nick Hylla claimed Wisconsin utilities are using the “faulty” PSC guidance to limit energy options for ratepayers.
According to a local news report, We Energies previously denied a developer’s plans to install rooftop solar and connect it to the grid. A utility spokesperson reportedly said, “If anyone sells electricity to our customers, they should be viewed as a public utility and should be registered as such.”
David Bender, the Earthjustice attorney representing MREA, argued that the regulatory commission’s role is to protect customers from monopoly power, “not to protect utilities when their customers want cleaner and more cost-effective options.”
According to MREA, solar customers across most of the country are able to use third-party financing.
“We’re not asking for favorable treatment,” said Hylla. “We’re asking for fair treatment.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/01/report-assesses-the-status-of-rps-goals-and-prices/,"MARKETS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 1, 2021",Report assesses the status of RPS goals and prices,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has released its annual status report on U.S. renewable portfolio standards (RPS). The report describes recent legislative changes, key policy design features, compliance with interim targets, past and projected impacts on renewables development, and compliance costs.
Key trends include:
Evolution of state RPS programs: States continue to refine and revise their RPS policies. Among other changes since the start of 2019, eight states enacted higher RPS targets or created new clean-energy/zero-carbon targets (Arizona, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Virginia, and Washington), in most cases setting targets equal to at least 50% of retail sales.
Historical impacts on renewables development: Roughly half of all growth in U.S. renewable electricity generation and capacity since 2000 is associated with state RPS requirements. That percentage has declined in recent years, representing 23% of all U.S. renewable energy capacity additions in 2019. However, within particular regions—the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic—RPS policies remain a dominant driver.
Future RPS demand and incremental needs: RPS demand growth through 2030 will require roughly 90 GW of new renewable energy capacity. Growth also will require total U.S. non-hydro renewable energy generation to reach 17% of electricity sales (compared to 12% in 2019). Relative to projections from the Energy Information Administration, this amounts to roughly one-third of projected renewable energy growth over the next decade.
RPS target achievement to-date: States have generally met their interim RPS targets in recent years, with exceptions generally reflecting unique, state-specific issues.
Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) pricing trends: Prices for New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Class I RECs rose over 2019, reaching $40/MWh and remaining at roughly that level over 2020. Farther south, PJM Tier I REC prices rose over the course of 2020, reaching $10/MWh by year-end. Prices for solar RECs remained relatively stable over 2020, and continue to exhibit wide variation across states, with the highest prices ($200-450/MWh) in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia.
RPS compliance costs: RPS compliance costs in 2019 averaged roughly 2.6% of retail electricity bills in RPS states, compared to 2.3% in 2018. Costs in most states ranged from 0.5% to 4.5% of retail electricity bills.

The group challenging Duke is represented by the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida. They argue that because the solar projects are being funded by customers’ bills, an opt-in requirement as well as not expanding project benefits to all customers is discriminatory.
The Public Service Commission voted 4-1 to approve the CEC program on January 5. The program was supported by Duke, Vote Solar, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and Walmart Inc.
Under the program, Duke Energy Florida will build 10 74.9 MW solar plants, with two coming online in January 2022, four in January 2023, and four in January 2024. The costs of each plant would range from $102 million to $113 million. Customer subscriptions to the energy generated would be available in 1 kW blocks.
The program set a monthly fee for each block at $8.35, and the bill credit that customers receive  will be 4 cents-per-kWh for the first 36 months, escalating by 1.5% annually after that. Duke said it expects that by the program’s fifth year the annual bill credit will exceed the subscription fee. By year seven, customer credits are expected to exceed the charges paid to-date for the program.
Duke designed the plan so that 65% of the program is allocated to commercial and industrial customers, 25% is allocated to residential and small businesses, and 10% for local governments.
The group that brought the lawsuit alleges that these allotments are unfair, arguing that they disproportionately benefit Walmart, a signatory to the program, and other large customers that would help pay upfront costs and then receive future credits. The consumer group argues that customers that can afford to help with upfront costs will have the most opportunity to subscribe. Meanwhile, residential customers will feel a larger financial burden and have more limited subscription opportunities.

Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc. filed for reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.
The company is a 3,994 MW generation and transmission cooperative whose members’ service territory span 68 counties and 1.5 million customers from the Texas Panhandle to Houston. Dating from 1941, Brazos Electric was the first cooperative formed in Texas to generate and supply electric power. It supplies wholesale power for its 16 member-owner distribution cooperatives and one municipal system.
(Read “An energy strategy worthy of Texas.”)
In a statement, Brazos said ERCOT sent it “excessively high invoices” with payment required “within days.” The company said that it “cannot and will not foist this catastrophic financial event” on its members and consumers.
In late February, ERCOT said that $2.1 billion in bills had gone unpaid after the storm, which hit Feb. 14 and lasted for days. More power providers likely will reject bills in the coming days, ERCOT executives were quoted as saying.
In a related action, Fitch Ratings in late February placed all retail and wholesale electric utilities operating within ERCOT on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The action followed what Fitch said was the “potentially severe, but uncertain” financial impact of the winter storm.
Fitch said that real-time energy prices during the storm hit ERCOT’s market price cap of $9,000/MWh, and spot gas at the benchmark Houston Ship Channel pricing point averaged more than $200/million British thermal units (MMBtu). Prices earlier this year were $20/MWh and $3/MMBtu, respectively.
Siemens Energy said it will conduct a design study on ways to integrate a hydrogen energy storage system into an 840 MW combined cycle power plant run by Intermountain Power Agency in Utah. The hydrogen storage project won a $200,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.
The study will look at the efficiency and reliability of a CO2-free power supply sourced from large-scale hydrogen production and storage. It also will consider aspects of integrating the system into an existing power plant and power grid, such as impacts on subsystems, sizing, and costs.
The study will focus on Siemens Energy’s Silyzer technology, which uses electrolysis to make hydrogen. Scope of the work includes hydrogen compression, storage, and plant controls.
The power plant itself plans to move from coal to natural gas, with the goal of burning 30% hydrogen fuel at start-up in 2025 and 100% hydrogen by 2045 using technology from Mitsubishi Power. The power plant provides electricity to customers in Utah and southern California.
Hyzon Motors, a supplier of hydrogen fuel cell-powered heavy vehicles, said it plans to build a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) plant near Chicago.
The MEA accounts for about 70% of the cost of a fuel cell stack. MEAs are produced at commercial scale in Canada, Europe, Japan, Korea, and China. Hyzon said that smaller-scale MEA production in the U.S. has so far been both a supply and a cost “bottleneck” for fuel cell vehicle production.
At full capacity, the Hyzon plant is expected to produce enough MEAs to supply up to 12,000 hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks each year. The facility is expected to start producing in the fourth quarter.
