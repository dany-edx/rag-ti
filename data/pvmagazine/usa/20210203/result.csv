Similar fees have been tried in other jurisdictions where they have been met with disdain from renewable energy advocates, who describe such fees as discriminatory.
In documents first brought public by the Energy and Policy Institute, TVA officials outlined that the new rate could “lessen the potential decrease in TVA load that may occur through the adoption of behind-the-meter generation.”
Relatively little distributed solar capacity exists across TVA’s system, and instituting fees that target only distributed solar customers seems like an effort to keep it that way.
A representative of Southwest Tennessee Electric Membership Cooperative (STEMC), a local power company fed by TVA, put it more bluntly, saying about the fee: “We need to capture this early before we end up with too many solar systems already installed on our system.”
The Energy and Policy Institute reported that STEMC has proposed a $25 monthly fee. The power company said the fee represens an attempt to recover the system costs. The company claimed that all of its customers will eventually go solar and only use STEMC for supplemental and backup power.
STEMC isn’t the only TVA-fed power company that has already expressed interest in instituting a distributed generation fee. West Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. has not formally filed for the fee, but suggested that,“If a residential customer desires to [install solar] then the rate they pay should be a more cost based rate and not a socialized rate.”
TVA has estimated that as many as two dozen local power companies would adopt a distributed solar bill in the “near term.”
For current or potential solar customers of a TVA-supplied local power company, charges could be nullified by courts or state regulators before they’re even instituted.
In 2018, the New Mexico regulators struck down Rate 59, a “standby fee” that charged solar customers of Southwestern Public Service $28 a month, after the company requested a 14% hike on the charge. Prior to removing the charge, distributed solar development in Southwestern Public Service’s area had slowed almost to a halt, according to those who argued against it.
Also in 2018, Indiana regulators reached an agreement with Indianapolis Power & Light on the company’s proposed general rate increase petition that dropped the company’s attempted fixed charge increase on residential customers, from $17 per month to $27. Although that proposed charge wasn’t as directly discriminatory towards solar customers, low residential fixed charges are an important factor in keeping residential solar economically viable, as they cannot be reduced via net metering.
In 2020, the Kansas Supreme Court blocked a fixed fee for self-generating customers that had been proposed by Westar Energy and Kansas Gas and Electric, approved by state regulators, and affirmed by a lower court. The case cited a 1980 Kansas law which stated that customers using renewable energy may not be subjected to “higher rates or charges” or “any other prejudice or disadvantage.” The court also called the attempt to differentiate self-generating customers from others “simply price discrimination,” and ruled the rate design “unlawful.”
Currently, Sierra Club and Vote Solar are involved in a lawsuit with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin over regulators’ approval of a rate settlement agreement between utility Madison Gas and Electric and intervenors, claiming that the utility’s monthly fixed charge imposes unnecessary costs on low-income customers and discourages investments in energy efficiency and rooftop solar.
The lawsuit alleges that the charge violates Wisconsin’s landmark Energy Priorities Law, which requires maximizing energy conservation, efficiency, and solar generation.
Update 2/5/21: This article has been corrected to reflect that Sierra Club and Vote Solar are involved in a lawsuit with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, not Madison Gas and Electric, and that Madison Gas and Electric’s fixed charge has not been instituted recently.

It is one of the first projects of its size to be built after the 2019 Community Solar Gardens Modernization Act allowed for larger gardens and ended geographic restrictions for participation. The project serves subscribers from 13 Colorado counties and 40 cities.
Subscribers will receive credits on their utility bills for energy generated by the garden, which was built by E Light Electric, a local Colorado contractor. SunShare will own and manage the facility.
Denver-based SunShare said it has developed more than 110 MW of community solar gardens and is one of the largest residential community solar subscribers in the U.S., having enrolled more than 13,000 customers in both Colorado and Minnesota.
The company said another 7 MW of capacity is projected to come online by mid-year, with construction on additional projects beginning later in 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/03/solar-developer-to-pay-1-14-million-settlement-over-environmental-damage/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",Solar developer to pay $1.14 million settlement over environmental damage,"A Pennsylvania-based solar developer agreed to pay approximately $1.14 million to settle allegations that its violations of federal stormwater requirements damaged protected wetland resources in the town of Williamsburg, Mass., and polluted the West Branch Mill River, according to Massachusetts Attorney General (AG) Maura Healey.
The consent decree, filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and pending court approval, settles an April 2020 lawsuit filed by the AG’s office alleging that Dynamic Energy Solutions LLC disregarded pollution control requirements for construction sites when it constructed an 18.5-acre solar array on a steep hillside above the West Branch Mill River.
In an announcement, Healey said, “Developers must abide by our important state and federal laws designed to protect precious natural resources.”
Under terms of the consent decree, Dynamic must comply with state and federal laws to protect water quality and natural resources at the solar array, restore impacted resources at an estimated cost of $530,000, and place a parcel of 24 acres near the West Branch Mill River into conservation at an estimated cost of $210,000.
The company must also pay $215,000 to fund the acquisition of land by a trust to benefit water quality in the Mill River, pay a penalty of $100,000 to the state’s general fund, and pay $80,000 to the AG’s office for costs, including attorney fees.
According to a local report, a Dynamic Energy representative said the developer is happy to resolve the matter. Dynamic’s general counsel wrote, “We look forward to completing restoration work at the site, and to placing land into conservation to help protect Massachusetts’ natural resources.”
In its complaint, the AG’s office alleged that Dynamic caused sediment-laden stormwater to flow off the array site, eroding a hillside, scouring out stream beds, and filling in nearby wetlands with sediment.
The AG’s office alleged that Dynamic’s failure to comply with construction stormwater pollution control requirements altered around 97,000 square feet of protected wetlands and more than 41,000 feet of riverfront area and covered the bottom of the West Branch Mill River with the equivalent of more than an acre of sediment.
Dynamic also allegedly failed to comply with an enforcement order issued by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) requiring site stabilization, stormwater controls, and restoration of damaged resources. MassDEP’s western regional office investigated the case and referred it to the AG’s office for further enforcement.
Michael Gorski, director of MassDEP’s western regional office in Springfield, called the environmental impacts “egregious” and “entirely avoidable.”
“Solar energy is an important part of the state’s long-term energy strategy,” said Gorski. “However, projects must be sited, designed, and constructed in a thoughtful manner.”

That’s according to projections in the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2021, released February 3.
EIA projects that electricity demand will largely return to 2019 levels by 2025. Renewable electric generating technologies are projected to account for almost 60% of capacity additions over the next 30 years. EIA projects that renewables’ share of the electricity generation mix will more than double by 2050. The natural gas share will remain relatively flat at 36%, and the coal and nuclear shares will both fall by about half.
EIA projects that total U.S. energy consumption, which includes transportation, will return to 2019 levels by 2029. It said that projection is “highly dependent” on the pace of U.S. economic recovery. In a case that models low economic growth, energy consumption does not return to 2019 levels until 2050. EIA also projects that U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions will fall through 2035 and then increase.
TVA has approved a new rate structure which allows the 153 local power companies that buy power from the federal agency to charge new fees to solar customers, according to the Energy and Policy Institute. The group said that TVA authorized local power companies to charge fees to existing customers with solar, effectively penalizing them for investments, unless prohibited by an existing contract.
At least two local power companies, Southwest Tennessee Electric Membership Cooperative and West Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative Corp. have considered charging distributed energy customers the new fees. The Southwest Tennessee power company was considering charging distributed energy customers $25 per month, the Institute said.
The Institute reported that in documents submitted to the board of directors, TVA said that behind-the-meter generation was small in comparison to the utility’s system, but that the new rate could “lessen the potential decrease in TVA load that may occur through the adoption of behind the meter generation.”
Similar fees have been struck down by courts and regulators, the policy institute said. Kansas’ Evergy targeted solar customers in 2018 with a demand charge, which was later struck down by the Kansas Supreme Court. The Michigan Public Service Commission rejected DTE Energy’s proposed charge in 2018. And a Wisconsin judge overturned Wisconsin regulatory approval of a 2014 charge sought by We Energies.
Southwest Power Pool (SPP) launched its Western Energy Imbalance Services (WEIS) market. The real-time balancing market is expected to lower wholesale electricity costs, increase price transparency, and ease congestion on the transmission system for market participants.

Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Deseret Power Electric Cooperative, the Municipal Energy Agency of Nebraska, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the Western Area Power Administration, and the Wyoming Municipal Power Agency all announced in 2019 their intent to join the WEIS.
WAPA Administrator and CEO Mark A. Gabriel said that advances in generation, energy demand, and transmission are “fundamentally changing and complicating” day-to-day grid operations “beyond what the current system” was designed to handle. “We have said for years that markets are coming to the West.”
As the WEIS market’s administrator, SPP will support the reliability of the region’s transmission system and meet demand with the most cost-effective generation available, reducing wholesale electricity costs for participants. The WEIS will provide price transparency of wholesale energy, allow parties to trade bilaterally, and hedge against costly transmission congestion.
SPP currently holds the record for the highest one-hour and point-in-time wind penetration recorded by the Energy Information Administration. It set a SPP wind peak record of 19,848 MW on Jan. 14 and was the first U.S. regional transmission organization to see wind as its main fuel source in 2020.
Overall home charging satisfaction is highest among EV owners who install a Level 2 permanently mounted charging station, with a score of 749 (on a 1,000-point scale), according to the inaugural J.D. Power U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Home Charging Study.
The study measured EV owners’ satisfaction within three charging segments: Level 1 portable; Level 2 portable; and Level 2 permanently mounted charging stations. Satisfaction was measured across eight factors: fairness of retail price; cord length; size of charger; ease of winding/storing cable; cost of charging; charging speed; ease of use; and reliability.
Satisfaction was reported highest among owners who use a permanent Level 2 charger (749) than among owners who use a portable Level 2 charger (741). Satisfaction was  lower among owners who use a much slower Level 1 charger, just 574.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/03/sunpower-launches-new-home-solar-and-storage-monitoring-app/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 3, 2021",SunPower launches home solar and storage monitoring app,"SunPower has launched its new mySunPower app, a way for homeowners to review and manage their energy generation, consumption, and battery storage settings from their mobile devices.
The app will be available for download for SunPower Equinox customers starting Feb. 16th on the Apple App Store and Google Play store. It also will be available to all of SunPower’s 285,000 monitoring customers sometime in the second quarter.
The app allows customers to track how much solar their system is generating on an hourly, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, or by time parameters that the customer can set themselves. The app also allows customers to track how much grid-supplied energy they are consuming and the current state of their battery’s charge.
Along with checking their battery’s charge, customers can also operate their battery in one of three modes–Reserve, Cost Savings, Self Supply. The setting depends on if they’re prioritizing saving energy in the event of an outage, minimizing their bill by charging their battery and selling excess generation at the most opportune times, or maximizing the amount of renewable energy that their home uses.
The app builds on what Vice President of Software Product & Engineering at SunPower, Jacob Wachman, calls a digital experience from the ground up.
What Wachman is referring to is the different software tools that SunPower provides to make the entire solar system purchase and installation process a digital possibility. This begins with the company’s Instant Design tool, which allows potential customers to digitally build a system to fit their needs. Customers can then buy the system and monitor installation through the mySunPower portal. The new app, the last step of the fully digital process, is intended to flow seamlessly with the other two services, fully acclimating the customer to the platform.
The user interface is something that the company prioritized throughout the app’s development, aiming to bring a new, accessible experience to customers who may not be technically experienced with their home’s energy needs.
“We wanted to make it as easy to use as possible,” said Wachman.
He also said that the development team looked outside of the solar industry to develop the user interface. For example, developers took inspiration from nontraditional non-energy sources, such as the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
The app also allows customers to get a sense of the environmental attributes that their system is achieving. It does this by taking the amount of emissions prevented by the system, the equivalent of trees planted those emission reductions equate to, and their emission reductions in terms of equivalent miles driven or gallons of gas used.
Plans call for the app to include a warning system to alert homeowners of impending blackouts, whether a planned outage like Pacific Gas & Electric’s weather-related rolling blackouts in California, or a natural disaster. That enhancement is set to release later in the year.
That means the release coming later this month is not the app’s final form.  Wachman said that it was designed to easily integrate new features as they are developed.
