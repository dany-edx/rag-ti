When energy bills can take up to 20% of the monthly income for a family at or below 80% of their area’s median income threshold, any reduction at all can make major improvements to that family’s quality of life. The way electricity bills are currently structured, however, has a significant impact on equitable energy access and distribution, and can restrict the impact of these resources.
A common practice instituted by utilities to make back some of the cost incurred by net metering programs, fixed fees can have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, adding an immovable amount to their sometimes oppressive monthly bill.
In addition, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) said that low-income households and households of color are far more likely to report losing home heating service, according to recent federal data.
In Berkley Lab’s most recent report, Advancing Equity in Utility Regulation, the authors argue that utilities, regulators, and stakeholders need to prioritize energy equity in the deployment of clean energy technologies and resources. Within the context of the report, energy equity refers to the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of energy production and consumption.
The report outlines systemic changes needed to advance equity in electric utility regulation by providing perspectives from four organizations – Portland General Electric, a utility company; the National Consumer Law Center, a consumer advocacy organization; and the Partnership for Southern Equity and the Center for Biological Diversity, social justice and environmental organizations.
In the first part of the report, the Partnership for Southern Equity’s Chandra Farley examines and explains why energy equity is a crucial goal of utility regulation. She examines real-life scenarios of current inequities through a regional lens and provides practical steps toward energy justice.
Farley argues that regulators should extend public engagement in utility regulatory decision making to include environmental justice organizations and provide the capacity for their effective participation through intervenor funding.
She also advocates for the formation and mobilization of coalitions of “uncommon allies,” namely clean energy, civil rights, and equity and environmental justice groups, to inform and educate “first-person advocates” on energy issues and utility decision-making. In this sense, an educated community helps to fight inequities, as communities who aren’t aware of the severity of the energy issues they face are less likely to take action to improve their position.
This idea ties into Farley’s call for prioritize knowledge- and capacity-building on energy equity issues, both for people who may bear the brunt of inequitable outcomes and in statehouses and utility commissions. While communities benefit through being educated on the issues that affect them, it is not solely their responsibility to fight for equity.
Farley’s other recommendations include:
In the next section of the report, John Howat and Jenifer Bosco, both of the National Consumer Law Center, use data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration to develop a series of graphs that illustrate historical inequities in the allocation of energy system costs and benefits based on household income, race, and ethnicity. Like Farley, the two continue to make the case for additional consumer protections, which include programs that extend access to energy efficiency, solar, and electrification for disadvantaged households; and improved public participation in regulatory decisions for electric utilities.
In their essay, Howat and Bosco approach tackling the protection of vulnerable populations and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on one front, by recommending that utilities guide their investments and services toward solutions that achieve both equity and clean energy imperatives for electricity systems of the future.
The two also lay out a number of ways to reverse the historically regressive model by which electricity costs and benefits are distributed, which include: addressing the proportion of income required to maintain basic electric service; advancing access to on-site energy generation, storage, and energy efficiency technologies—and the bill savings and resilience benefits they can provide; and offering uninterrupted and affordable access to a basic level of electricity service.
Other recommendations in this chapter include:
Portland General Electric’s Nidhi Thakar and Jake Wise open by describing “the need to address historic and systemic barriers that have prevented and continue to prevent the progress and participation of historically underrepresented groups, in support of fostering equitable outcomes for all.”
Taking the utility perspective, the two outline how Portland General Electric is working to address three core energy justice principles: procedural justice, distributive justice, and restorative justice, all within the backdrop of regulatory relationships and service to utility customers and communities.
Their arguments are provide in the context of state legislation, responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires, a new multi-year planning process for utility investments in distribution infrastructure, a community-based smart grid test bed, engagement with community-based organizations and Tribes, and workforce initiatives.
Frequently, discussion regarding energy equity and the adoption of DERs is framed as an “us-vs-them” argument of the customer and advocates fighting against an unmoving, monolithic utility. While utilities across the nation have operated as such, this picture does not define each, and the progress that Portland General Electric has made can be used as a larger model for what is possible.
Other recommendations in this chapter include:
Center for Biological Diversity’s Jean Su concludes the report by laying out the injustices of the current energy system disproportionately experienced by communities of color and low-wealth communities due to fossil fuel pollution and health impacts. These disproportionate hardships include energy burden, energy insecurity, and energy poverty; climate disasters; and ecocide.
Rather than just laying out the host of issues and calling for blanket change, Su then moves to outline legal and regulatory pathways toward addressing chronic energy injustices.
One idea she targets is expand the definition of “public interest” to encompass climate, environmental, and energy justice goals. This would come into play when regulators consider certificates of public convenience and necessity for new energy infrastructure, but could also be used to protect utility customers from undue financial risk, including financial losses from stranded carbon-emitting assets, climate change-induced damages to generating facilities and delivery systems, reputational damage that may drive loss of investors, and access to insurance.

Granholm. “From reducing solar permitting delays and other soft costs to expanding solar benefits to renters and other non-traditional solar users, we’re providing more localities with the tools to succeed in delivering cheaper, cleaner power while generating good-paying local jobs.”
Since the guidebook was originally published in 2009, solar power costs have decreased 80% and federal incentives have spurred dramatic increases in solar deployment. However, soft costs like unnecessary paperwork, red tape, and other burdensome requirements increase costs and discourage solar companies from moving to an area. By streamlining these requirements and taking other steps to encourage solar development, DOE is supporting communities to become “open for solar business.”
DOE’s solar guidebook encourages local governments to adopt SolarAPP+ (Solar Automated Permit Process), a tool that helps to speed approval for residential solar permits. DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory released results from its SolarAPP+ tool pilot in five communities in California and Arizona. The results show that SolarAPP+ reduced the average permit review time to less than one day, enabled projects to be installed and inspected 12 days faster, and saved the pilot communities over 2,000 hours of staff time.
The guidebook also describes the SolSmart 60 campaign, which aims to get 60 new communities designated as SolSmart Gold, Silver, or Bronze for making it faster, easier, and more affordable to go solar. So far, 21 local communities have earned distinction for their solar deployment practices since September 2021. The program offers free technical assistance to help any municipality, county, or regional organization remove obstacles to going solar and reduce the soft costs that can hold back growth. SolSmart’s team of national experts in solar energy and local government have helped these jurisdictions implement best practices and take decisive action to encourage the expansion of solar energy.

Local governments can also receive free technical assistance to develop community solar programs through the National Community Solar Partnership, which is a coalition of community solar stakeholders working to expand access to community solar, particularly to those with low-to-moderate incomes, renters, and other community members for whom traditional rooftop solar is unavailable.
The guidebook also answers common questions, just a few of which include:

Each battery energy storage system offers two-hour durations.
The sites were constructed, commissioned, and put into operation in just five months, amid a volatile supply chain and logistics market, said the company. As unseasonably rainy weather this summer and maritime port congestion posed to threaten the project timeline, Burns & McDonnell’s team worked weekends and communicated with suppliers to deliver on-time.
“Having an integrated EPC team allowed for a smooth transition between each phase of the project,” says Josh Tucker, project manager at Burns & McDonnell. “It also allowed us to pivot and work with our construction team to modify schedule, re-sequence tasks and properly hand over the system between construction and commissioning to see that the project was brought online and generating revenue by the promised completion date.”

The stand-alone storage systems are designed to support the ERCOT grid as it undergoes fluctuations in supply and demand. The construction firm worked closely with battery provider LG Energy to coordinate design and equipment delivery.
Emerson’s Oviation automation technology was integrated for asset monitoring and control. The open-source platform increases battery operations visibility and simplifies system management, said Burns & McDonnell.
The EPC team at Burns & McDonnell collaborated with Sustainable Environmental Renewable (SER) Capital Partners, transitioning the operations phase and training SER during startup and commissioning activities. “Having a battery provider with a deep understanding of their technology working together with an integrated EPC contractor who understands the system integration requirements was vital to this project being delivered on time,” said Sara Graziano, committee chair at SER.
Burns & McDonnell, founded in 1898, is 100% employee-owned by over 7,600 engineers, construction professionals, architects, planners, technologists, scientists, and more.

Click here to register and view the recorded webinar session. 
PV Infolink’s analysis shows that polysilicon ex-VAT (pre-tax) prices should improve from the current levels of $26-$30/kg to as low as $19/kg by the end of the year. Prices have recently ticked back up to about $30/kg, largely due to decreased polysilicon inventories driven by seasonality ahead of Chinese New Year and a rebound in utilization levels from the end of 2021, said Dora Zhao. 
Inventory levels are expected to build across the value chain, said the report. Currently, value chain inventory levels are well below healthy levels, sitting at about a month to a six weeks across all segments, said PV InfoLink. Polysilicon inventory is about two weeks, and wafers hold a less than one week inventory. The report projects an increase in production to 318 GW of polysilicon and 322 GW of wafers globally in 2022. It said that an inventory build of about 30 GW above forecast production for modules may result in pricing support for polysilicon and wafers through 2022. 
Capacity expansions are on the way across the value chain, drive by “just-in-case” inventory considerations due to ongoing Covid logistics. Lin and Zhao noted many new entrants are expected to continue through 2023, including Shangji Automation, Gaojing Solar, Shuangliang Group, and Fuxing New Energy (n-type wafers.) 
Lowered polysilicon pricing will send a ripple effect through the supply chain, and PV InfoLink projected module prices will drop from $0.27/W in Q1 to $.24/W by Q4. 
N-type modules are expected to increase to about 7-8% market share this year, while PERC modules will likely retain their dominance with about 90% market share. Corrine Lin said there has been a rise in companies taking interest in TOPCon expansion over heterojunction. She commented that perovskite technology likely needs five or more years to take a meaningful share of the market.

Under the joint venture, Lafayette Square and Invenergy will provide capital, technical assistance, and executive leadership to build and operate Reactivate, which will finance, acquire, develop, and operate solar energy projects primarily serving low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities and areas disproportionately affected by the clean energy transition.
According to Reactivate, the company isn’t limited to just developing community solar projects, and will also explore opportunities in small-scale utility solar projects, energy storage, building electrification, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Beyond project financing and development the company attests that it is focused on creating development, construction, and operations jobs while focusing worker training efforts on traditionally underrepresented segments of the workforce and those transitioning to the renewable energy industry.
“By bringing together capital, technology, experienced solar operators and targeted employee training programs, we believe we can create a more inclusive and localized renewable energy production model benefitting historically marginalized communities,” said Founder & CEO of Lafayette Square, Damien Dwin.
By 2030, Reactivate seeks to develop 3 GW of renewable energy capacity, save $50 million in energy costs for LMI households, sign 100 contracts with minority or women-owned contractors, and facilitate workforce training for 2,500 underserved workers.
While electrical bill savings may seem like a benefit or added perk of supporting renewable energy to some, the bill savings can be absolutely critical to the finances of LMI families and individuals. Research done by Energy Outreach Colorado found that one-in-four households in the state struggle with a high energy burden, which leads to such households spending a disproportionate amount of their income on energy bills, when compared to higher-income households, with the average burden being three times worse. Households that meet or are below the 80% area median income threshold can see energy bills take up to 20% of their monthly income.
By bringing bill savings via community solar, Reactivate said it hopes to do away with one of the most consistent financial burdens these families and individuals have to face.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/19/why-build-back-betters-solar-policies-are-so-important/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 19, 2022",Why Build Back Better’s solar policies are so important,"The US solar industry plays a critical element in the movement to clean energy, as it would lessen our dependence on fossil fuels and allow many Americans to enjoy the myriad financial, environmental, and practical benefits of going solar.
The current energy landscape is already primed to move toward solar for three primary reasons:
First, the price of solar energy continues to plummet due to improved technology and reduced hardware and storage costs. Since 2010, solar costs have fallen 70%. Today, solar is the “cheapest source of electricity” in history,” according to the International Energy Agency.
Second, Americans are increasingly looking to phase out carbon-heavy appliances and electrify everything from their cars to their home heating systems. As a truly renewable form of energy, solar power will play a critical role in affordably and reliably electrifying American homes and businesses, while also lowering greenhouse gas emissions. 
Lastly, record levels of extreme weather have created frequent power outages, dramatically increasing the need for improved disaster resiliency. You don’t have to look far to find examples: In February 2021, millions of people across Texas lost power after a record-breaking frost enveloped the state. Just a few months later, temperatures in Seattle were so high that concrete buckled and bridges had to be sprayed with water to keep from expanding, adding to the negative impact felt by the heat-induced rolling blackouts across the area.
These extreme weather conditions are only going to become more frequent, as are the ensuing devastating power outages. In light of these events, homeowners increasingly opted for the energy independence offered by solar panels. SolarReviews has seen significant spikes in solar interest in regions immediately following an extreme weather event.
But we need to make solar energy more prevalent, and the Build Back Better plan can help us do exactly that. As it is currently proposed, the package will increase the federal investment tax credit (ITC) from 26% to 30% and extend it for at least 10 years.
Earlier this year, SolarReviews surveyed US homeowners and found that the federal tax credit was the single most important financial incentive to install solar. That same survey found that it can take homeowners up to four years to research, shop for, and install solar panels. A 10-year runway for the tax credit would be critical in giving consumers peace of mind.
This change will significantly impact Americans who historically have been unable to afford the upfront cost of solar, despite needing relief the most from high energy bills. Residential solar installations would qualify homeowners to claim the full amount of the tax credit in the year after installation. This means more Americans in low- and middle-income brackets can install solar and lower their energy costs. The bill includes a 10% tax credit proposed for families living in low-income communities and additional 10% tax credit that can be realized by homeowners if a certain percentage of the solar parts are manufactured within the US.
The Biden administration said the bill will cut the cost of installing solar on a residential rooftop by 30%  and reduce the payback period by five years. These are significant benefits for average Americans who want to lower their energy costs, improve their home’s resiliency, and help curb carbon emissions.
However, I believe this package will be far more beneficial than what the administration forecasts. SolarReviews forecasts this legislation will increase the rate of residential solar installations from a rate of around 750,000 homes in 2021, to more than 1.5 million homes per year by 2024. We expect this package will lead to the creation or continuance of more than 1 million solar jobs that would not exist without this legislation, in almost every town and city in America.
These are meaningful jobs. Solar is an inherently local business. The economically smart thing about supporting the residential rooftop solar industry is that the jobs it creates are spread out over the entire country, not just concentrated around one or two locations. A worker in New York can’t install solar panels on a home in California.
Until now, the US has not had a long-term strategy for solar energy. This is very, very smart legislation on several levels. Forget whether it is progressive, liberal, or conservative, it is just smart economics. The Build Back Better plan will enable more Americans and businesses to be involved in this promising industry that will save American’s money— and help our environment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/19/solving-ev-supply-chain-issues-requires-scaling-the-battery-supply-chain/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 19, 2022",Solving EV supply chain issues requires scaling the battery supply chain,"Before COVID, global sales of new passenger cars were about 80 million units annually, growing slowly. During 2020, sales of internal combustion engine cars (ICEs) plunged, and sales of electrical vehicles (EVs) took off around the world. Today, EV sales are expected to grow exponentially for the rest of the decade, reaching 30 million and 60 million by 2040. This growth will generate more than 7 trillion dollars of EV sales before 2030, the fastest and largest shift in any global market in the last 100 years.
As desire for electric vehicles to deliver faster charging speeds, longer range and be more affordable increases, automakers are looking to find new and innovative solutions to satisfy this demand. However, creating a new market of vehicles — 100% of EV fleets for many automakers — is uncharted territory and to do so in a cost-effective manner takes time, scale, and new manufacturing systems.
The expected growth in EV sales during this decade will be dependent on an increase in the production of higher performance and lower cost EV batteries. Batteries are expensive, complex, and require specialized materials and chemicals. The EV supply chain requires huge increases in raw materials production and processing to feed into the huge increase in EV battery factories required to meet EV market demand.
The dynamics of EV cell production
EV cells are produced in large factories named “Giga-factories” because their production capacity is measured in GWh, where the letter “G” stands for billions of Wh of energy storage. In 2020, the global Gigafactory capacity was about 700 GWh and it is now expected to reach close to 5000 GWh by 2030.
When charging an EV, the electrons are stored almost exclusively in the graphite in the anode electrodes of the EV cells, where each electron is paired with a lithium ion until released during driving. Thus, EV-grade graphite annual production will need to increase from about 500,000 tons (500M Kg) to more than 3,500,000 tons (3.5 trillion Kg) by 2030. Today, a single 20 GWh factory requires a daily amount of graphite equal in weight to a Boeing 767.
The impact on the supply chain
Because batteries are heavy, they must be produced close to the EV factories and the sourcing and processing of specialized materials should ideally be on the same continent, from multiple suppliers carefully selected to avoid unnecessary costs and strategic shortages.
If this was not challenging enough for EV makers, they must also innovate at a rapid pace to incorporate new materials and new manufacturing processes so that EV batteries can provide longer range, charge faster, and cost less. A failure to do so will cost billions in lost revenue and market share will shift to competitors able to innovate faster, more safely and with greater economies of scale.
This represents the most daunting supply chain challenge ever faced by the incumbents in a large global industry: they must re-invent their own competencies and integrate new technologies from new suppliers to succeed.
The risks and the complexity of this challenge arise from the “perfect EV storm” — a trifecta of requirements that are difficult to address on their own, and exponentially so when combined.
Looking ahead
The strategic question is how to reduce technical and financial risks while competing with other competitors in a race for market share in the global marketplace of hundreds of millions of EVs, worth trillions of USD in revenues.
The answer lies in a reevaluation of the supply chain in the following ways:
In order to be compatible with multiple material suppliers — we must think of a new process that replaces inefficient steps in the process by deploying salable technology that increases performance and decreases costs of the materials and cells used in EVs. Given that the end to the supply chain challenges we’ve been experiencing seem nowhere in sight, a positive future for EV battery manufacturing will be contingent on finding solutions that work within existing realities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/19/best-fire-safety-practices-for-rooftop-pv-system-installations/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 19, 2022",Best fire safety practices for rooftop PV system installations,"Researchers from the Universiti Putra Malaysia have defined a series of fire safety practices that solar installers should follow in the deployment of residential rooftop PV systems.
“Improper installation practices have been identified as a common factor contributing to PV fire hazards,” the research’s corresponding author, Mohd Zahirasri Mohd Tohir, told pv magazine. “This human error may be due to an unintentional action or indeed a deliberate violation of procedure. The first, mainly due to inexperienced installers or simply slippery actions by experienced workers. While the latter, due to time pressure and their ignorance of the consequences of fire safety. Regardless of the reason, both can be attributed to a lack of fire safety knowledge.”
According to Tohir, the annual fire incident frequency for PV installations is 0.029 fires per MW. “While the figure does not seem alarming, however, with the surge in global demand of PV systems as a green technology, if the issue is neglected and not curbed, the failure rate is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” he said. “That is why our work is seen as important in developing safe practices and knowledge sharing on fire safety management during PV system installation as a lack of understanding of the associated PV fire risks can lead to severe long-term consequences.”
The academics systematically reviewed the fire safety practices described in 40 PV installation guidelines that are publicly accessible. These include publications from PV manufacturers together and installation guidelines, as well as best practices handbooks. “It is worth mentioning that more than half of the selected installation guidelines reviewed are from the national agencies, regulatory bodies, and national associations and mostly are from the United States,” said the research team.
The proposed fire safety practices were categorised into 10 groups considering different factors: general practices to ensure the PV system is designed by qualified contractors only; site survey including size, shade management, accessway, tilt, orientation and location; roof structure and material; marking systems for all PV equipment including PV input and output, conduit, cabling, inverter, enclosures, combiner, box, and isolator switches; roof waterproofing and flashing; electrical cabling and grounding system; array mounting, ventilation and PV panels; combiner box and connectors; DC/AC inverter; and DC isolator and other protection devices.
“Prior to PV system installation, it is important to conduct a site evaluation to avoid the shading effect and determine the best orientation for maximum PV system output,” the scientists said. “Besides, good ventilation and airflow around the PV modules may prevent the phenomenon of a hot spot.” According to them, many fire accidents originated from DC isolators due to the water penetration into the enclosure caused by ignorant practices during installation. “However, the number of publications highlighting the installation of DC isolators, such as the dos and don’ts, is relatively small,” they also highlighted.
The best practices were presented in the paper Development of fire safety best practices for rooftops grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems installation using systematic review methodology, published in Sustainable Cities and Society.

Meter collars essentially simplify residential solar grid connection, enabling utilities and homeowners to expand access to distributed energy resources (DER). The way a meter collar works is, for electric utilities, they enable load unmasking, detailed remote monitoring, and more. For solar installers, they reduce costs, minimize logistics, and improve safety. For homeowners, meter collars reduce the cost of getting solar, EV charging, and energy storage on the home.
The hardware cost, estimated to be around $400, can save between $400 to $2,000 on a residential solar power project. A ConEdison pilot of 300 units found that the savings were between $400 and $1,500 per installation.
The overarching goal of the hardware is to save a service panel upgrade, which would otherwise increase the price of a solar power installation by greater than $1,000. However, the meter collar product also saves on wiring, and fusing, when connecting directly to the meter and skipping the electric panel.

In a small Maryland pilot, nine installations were estimated to have saved over $5,000. The project managers noted that while none of these projects actually needed service panel upgrades, both time and wiring costs were reduced by the simplification of connections. Project savings estimates were between 2 and 3%.
Contractors on this pilot suggested that ConnectDER shorten their unit, and provide a model that was greater than 200 amp, as many of their high end target customers had larger electric switchgear ratings.
After filing for a patent in 2015, ConnectDER was awarded United States patent number 10,830,802 on November 10, 2020.
The company sees a clear opportunity in mitigating electric panel upgrades. A report putting the price of a panel upgrade at $2,000 each, says there could be as much as $100 billion in potential upgrade costs as the United States seeks to electrify residential housing stock – 48 million panels in total.
