To boot, according to utility Green Mountain Power (GMP), the public-private project is part of the company’s program to feed extra power to the grid and help lower costs for all Vermonters.
Lawmakers and state officials joined leaders from GMP and local suppliers to make the announcement January 5 during a virtual news conference. In a video comment, Gov. Phil Scott said, “I know many think clean energy must be more expensive, but the work done today shows not only can we reduce carbon emissions, but if we are strategic, we can also save money in the process.”
The Samsung Mega E2 batteries were installed in the statehouse’s basement where a failing fossil-fueled generator from the 1960s once was. The 250 kWh energy storage system came online in the fall and now backs up more critical systems for the historic building, including the elevator. Northern Reliability procured and built the system, Dynapower supplied the inverter, and Virtual Peaker provided cloud-based software used to connect the battery system to the GMP grid for energy sharing.
As GMP explained, the batteries are part of the utility’s Bring Your Own Device for Business program, which provides financial incentives to businesses that install batteries and share some of that stored power with GMP’s grid system during energy peaks, when power is costliest and dirtiest. GMP expects the statehouse project to save Vermont taxpayers $44,000 and GMP customers an additional $18,000 over 10 years. The batteries also are projected to reduce carbon emissions by 6,388 pounds per year, the equivalent of not using 326 gallons of gasoline.
State Curator David Schultz noted that the energy profile of the statehouse has been in a constant state of evolution.
“The building itself dates to the mid-19th century, when its chandeliers were illuminated with coal-fired gas,” Shultz said. “Electricity was finally installed in 1898, and now, over 120 years later, there is an unprecedented reliance on power and technology to do the people’s business.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/06/clearway-flips-the-switch-on-192-mw-solar-project-in-california/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 6, 2021",Clearway flips the switch on 192 MW solar project in California,"San Francisco-based Clearway Energy Group has completed the 192 MW Rosamond Central solar project. Located in Kern County, California, the project has power purchase agreements with regional community choice aggregators East Bay Community Energy (EBCE) and Clean Power Alliance, as well as the City of Palo Alto Utilities.
Construction on the project kicked off in February and was led by McCarthy Building Cos. According to Clearway, the project will provide several permanent operations and maintenance roles. The Rosamond Central solar site also represents a $5 million investment in Kern County through tax revenue and is expected to generate enough clean energy to power more than 71,000 homes each year, the company added.
In December, Clearway announced a joint equity transaction for a 1.6 GW solar and wind energy portfolio that includes Rosamond Central. Valerie Wooley, the company’s vice president of origination, applauded project partners for their dedication to completing the solar farm “in a year with countless headwinds.”
“This project has given us the opportunity to create much-needed jobs and allowed us to meet California’s ambitious renewable energy goals ahead of schedule,” said Natasha Keefer, Clean Power Alliance’s director of power planning and procurement.
EBCE CEO Nick Chaset said, “This marks the first new utility-scale solar project built to serve EBCE customers with clean, affordable, renewable energy.”
“The City of Palo Alto Utilities has been delivering 100% carbon-neutral electricity to our customers since 2013,” said Dean Batchelor, utilities director. “With the addition of 26 MW generated by the Rosamond project to our energy portfolio, solar energy will now supply almost half of Palo Alto’s total electric needs each year.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/06/urban-land-and-aerosols-could-accelerate-hail-storm-formation/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,MISSOURI,TEXAS",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 6, 2021",Urban land and aerosols could accelerate hail storm formation,"Urban landscapes and man-made aerosols have the potential to accelerate the formation of hail storms, make their gusts harder and direct these storms towards cities, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
The team, led by atmospheric scientist Jiwen Fan, created two storm models, one near Houston, Texas, and another in Kansas City, Missouri.
The team simulated multiple versions of the two storms, with and without cities and aerosols present, to isolate the effects of these two distinct factors. The factors were always tested in tandem, as models of cities and aerosols independent of one another already exist.
(Watch our webinar video, “Can your solar project weather a hailstorm?“)
Researchers found that urban land and aerosols worked together to amplify the frequency of large hail by roughly 20% in Kansas City. The Houston storm was “gentler” by comparison, but still resulted in amplified, longer-lasting rainfall that developed sooner than expected. The Houston storm was not modeled as a hailstorm, but as a sea breeze-induced thunderstorm.
The study followed earlier research that concluded that cities are warmer than surrounding areas because buildings absorb and retain the sun’s heat differently than trees and agricultural land, and also block wind flow.
The Kansas city model is one that could prove particularly troubling for the solar industry, one that is already combating the destructive nature of hail.
In the PNNL model, heat from the city was carried downwind, where it met the storm just after its formation at the northern urban-rural boundary. When warmer, drier air met with cooler, moister rural air, it intensified convergence. This  eventually led to a more violent storm that moved toward urban land. When the aerosols were modeled alongside the urban landscape, the two combined to amplify hail, synergistically producing a more hazardous hailstorm.
Hail has been a concern for rural, utility-scale, solar installations, especially after the 2019 hailstorm in Pecos County, Texas, which damaged more than 400,000 panels at the 178 MW Midway Solar Project.
The Pecos storm was one of a handful of extreme weather events in the past two years which have hardened the market for property and casualty insurance for solar projects. Premiums have risen by as much as 400% over that time.
The researchers’ finding that urban landscapes and aerosols are capable of pushing more violent storms towards cities could create additional uncertainty when it comes to insuring urban distributed solar projects.
While the financial risk on a distributed solar project is less than that of a utility-scale installation, insuring it against hail could still prove difficult if urban hailstorms become more common and violent: one project could be subjected to multiple extreme storms over its lifespan.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/06/could-agrivoltaics-feed-our-demand-for-clean-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,OREGON",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 6, 2021",Could agrivoltaics feed our demand for clean energy?,"Using land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture could provide 20% of total electricity generation in the United States, according to a new paper by Oregon State University researchers.
Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaic systems could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
Agrivoltaics provide a “rare chance for true synergy: more food, more energy, lower water demand, lower carbon emissions, and more prosperous rural communities,” said Chad Higgins, an associate professor in Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences and the senior author of the paper published in the journal Sustainability.
The paper finds that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland.
The cost of the agrivoltaic arrays would be $1.12 trillion over a 35-year project life. The researchers said they believe that the private sector would invest most of the construction costs, with the federal government contributing rebates and other incentives.
Using money generated from the PV arrays, it would take about 17 years to pay back the $1.12 trillion, the researchers estimate. After the projected 35-year project lifespan, the arrays would produce $35.7 billion in annual revenue.
The Oregon State research is not the first in the field. Research led by the University of Arizona’s Greg Barron-Gafford, and published in Nature Sustainability in September 2019, found that shading crops with PV panels can provide multiple benefits, including greater food production, reduced plant drought stress, and a drop in solar panel heat stress.
The Arizona team’s results were based on a dryland farming system and suggested that an agrivoltaic system may be a resilient energy and food system. The researchers warned, however, of “probable barriers to wider adoption,” including challenges associated with mechanized farming and harvesting, along with the additional costs of elevating PV arrays to allow for food production.
SolarPower Europe launched in early 2020 a new working group devoted to agrivoltaics. The aim of the group is to boost the deployment of agrivoltaics across Europe by shaping the EU’s agricultural and energy policy agendas.
And in October, German solar developer Next2Sun flipped the switch on an agrivoltaic project in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg. The 4.1 MW solar project spans around 14 hectares. It was built with roughly 11,000 n-type PERT bifacial solar modules, each with 380 W of power, provided by Chinese manufacturer Jolywood. They were vertically installed on 5,800 racks.
Back in Oregon, Higgins said he plans to install a fully functional solar farm designed to prioritize agricultural activities on five acres of Oregon State’s North Willamette Research and Extension Station near Portland. Ground is expected to be broken in May, with production expected to start in 2022.
Higgins said that the wide-scale installation of agrivoltaic systems opens the door for other technologies. For example, surplus energy generated by the solar arrays could be used to power electric tractors or to generate fertilizer on a farm. And, low-cost sensors could be installed on the solar panel platforms to support artificial intelligence-based decisions to improve agricultural productivity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/06/florida-regulators-approve-duke-plan-to-add-750-mw-of-solar/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 6, 2021",Florida regulators approve Duke plan to add 750 MW of solar,"Florida utility regulators have approved Duke Energy’s plan to build nearly 750 MW of new utility-scale solar across the state.
The projects are each set to be 74.9 MW in capacity and are scheduled to have staggered completions over the four-year development outline: two would come online in January 2022, four in January 2023 and four in January 2024.
The plants are being constructed at exactly 74.9 MW due to Florida’s Power Plant Siting Act, which requires that any generation facilities above that capacity be subjected to additional siting supervision, which can add time to an already long development process.
Cost became a point of contention during the regulatory review process, with Commissioner Julie Brown calling into question the $102 million to $113 million price tag of each project, roughly $1,360-1,508 a kW. Brown questioned the cost efficiency of the projects, comparing them to the 20-project proposal from Florida Power & Light (FPL) that was approved last March. Those came with a combined price tag of $1.8 billion, not too far off from the Duke projects’ combined price of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.
Alongside the project portfolio, regulators also approved Duke’s proposed “Clean Energy Connection Program.” The program will allow residential and small business customers to pay a voluntary monthly fee of $8.35 per kilowatt block to help finance the new projects. Participating customers also will receive a credit for their participation. For the first 36 months, the bill credit rate will be 4.037 cents per kWh, then increase by 1.5% every year.
This latest round of large-scale project announcements adds a substantial capacity load to the wave of utility-scale solar development under way in Florida.
The development rush is being led by Duke and FPL, with the two utilities combining to bring more than 2.2 GW of large-scale solar to the state in the next four years.  FPL’s roughly 1.5 GW of capacity is slated to come online this year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/06/south-carolina-regulators-tell-dominion-to-rethink-its-coal-fleet/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SOUTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 6, 2021",South Carolina regulators tell Dominion to rethink its coal fleet,"Dominion Energy must conduct a comprehensive coal fleet retirement analysis and assess replacing its South Carolina plants, according to an order from the state’s Public Service Commission.
Commissioners will open a docket ordering Dominion to “evaluate the reliability risks and environmental costs of continued operation of the coal plants.” The order also directs the utility to consider options–informed by resource bids–to replace coal technology with state-of- the art clean energy as part of its 2022 energy plan update.
The order requires the retirement analysis to be completed before Dominion can make any decisions about spending customers’ money to retrofit the Williams and Wateree coal plants. Both plants need to be retrofitted to meet federal rules meant to protect waterways from mercury, arsenic and other pollutants.
The order was met with praise from both renewable energy proponents and environmental conservationists alike. Will Harlan, senior representative for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign in South Carolina, said, “We’re confident a thorough analysis of Dominion’s coal fleet will show that phasing out these dirty, polluting plants and replacing them with clean, affordable energy is the best path forward.”
The new order comes less than a month after the Commission unanimously rejected Dominion’s proposed integrated resource plan (IRP).
The rejected IRP, according to the Commission, failed to include a demand side management resource option or power purchasing options. The IRP also did not model any renewable energy additions prior to 2026, nor any coal retirements prior to 2028.
The IRP also proposed raising solar customers’ basic service charge to $19.50 a month, adding a “solar subscription fee” of $5.40/kW a month and slashing the solar export credit that customers can receive.
The fees were described by Kate Lee Mixson, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, as an attempt to “keep customers tethered to Dominion’s rising rates.”
The proposed fees also drew the attention of South Carolina Governor, Henry McMaster, who urged the utility to reconsider, especially “in the midst of a pandemic.”
Many have pointed to the rate hike as an attempt by Dominion to claw back some funds after the utility’s purchase of South Carolina Energy & Gas, as that utility faced a large debt after its involvement in a scrapped nuclear power plant construction project.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/06/current-ghg-levels-may-keep-the-planet-locked-on-2c-warming-study-says/,"SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 6, 2021","Current GHG levels may keep the planet locked on 2C warming, study says","The planet is committed to global warming in excess of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) just from greenhouse gases that have already been added to the atmosphere. That is the conclusion of new research by scientists from Nanjing University, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Texas A&M University, which appears in Nature Climate Change.
The team used observations and climate model simulations to re-evaluate how much warming is “in the pipeline” from past emissions. Their estimate is higher than previous estimates because it accounts for changes in the geographic pattern of surface warming.
“Typically, committed warming is estimated assuming that changes in the future will pretty much follow changes in the past,” said LLNL atmospheric scientist Mark Zelinka, a co-author of the paper. “But we now know that this is a bad assumption.”
While most of the planet’s surface has warmed, several important regions, like the Southern Ocean, have not. The lack of surface warming favors the buildup of low-level clouds over these regions, which reflect sunlight back to space and cool the planet. Eventually, these regions will warm up. When they do, the low clouds will decrease, which will allow more sunlight to be absorbed by Earth and give the world additional warming.
“The important thing to realize is that this has not yet happened — it is not in the historical record,” said lead author Chen Zhou, a researcher at Nanjing University. After accounting for this effect, the estimated future warming based on the historical record would be much higher than previous estimates, he said.
The team found that future warming with radiative forcing fixed at present-day levels (equivalent to freezing the atmospheric composition as it is today) has a most likely value of +2.3 degrees C (4.1 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels. This exceeds the limits set in the Paris Agreement, in which the world’s countries agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) above pre-industrial temperatures, while pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).
“The bad news is that our results suggest that we have most likely already emitted enough carbon dioxide to exceed 2°C,” said Andrew Dessler, Texas A&M researcher and co-author of the study.
But he said that once net emissions get to near zero, the rate of continued, committed warming will be very slow, potentially good news. “If we can get net emissions to near zero soon, it may take centuries to exceed 2 degrees C.”
