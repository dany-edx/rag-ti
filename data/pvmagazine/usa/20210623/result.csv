https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/23/conedison-is-developing-a-battery-storage-and-ev-charging-facility/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,NEW YORK",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 23, 2021",ConEdison is developing a battery storage and EV charging facility,"New York City utility ConEdison has partnered with Centrica Business Solutions to turn an empty Brooklyn parking lot into a new type of hybrid facility, combining battery storage and electric vehicle charging.  
The 5 MW/ 15MWh battery system holds enough power for about 5,000 apartments for four hours of peak summer usage. The facility will also house 18 direct-current fast chargers and will be among the largest charging facilities in the city. This project is the only of its kind through ConEdison’s rate case plans through 2022. 
The batteries and chargers will be grid-connected, and Centrica will sell services from the storage into wholesale markets as part of a virtual power plant. The batteries will be charged from ConEdison’s grid during overnight hours when demand is low and power is cheaper. ConEdison will lease the land to Centrica in this arrangement. 
The direct-current fast chargers can provide up to 350 kW and are capable of fully charging a vehicle in less than an hour.  
ConEdison said that it bases its decision-making and planning process on projections for climate change, according to its recently released 2020 sustainability strategy report. It outlined a vision that includes tripling energy efficiency by 2030, achieving 100% clean energy by 2040, and “all-in” support for electric vehicles. 
ConEdison has planned more than $310 million in investment by 2025 to incentivize the connection of thousands of new EV charging stations. The utility said it will enable deployment of more than 21,000 level 2 plugs and 525 DC fast chargers. The grid operator is also collaborating with the NYC Department of Transportation to install another 120 curbside level 2 chargers in a pilot program. 
With a portfolio of more than 2.8 GW of solar and wind projects in 20 states, and with another 400 MW under construction, ConEdison’s report said it invested more than $600 million in large-scale renewables in 2020. Its renewables portfolio is comprised of 85% solar and 15% wind.

Central Electric Power Cooperative, Santee Cooper’s largest customer, finalized contracts with the same developers for the remaining share of about 308 MW.
The 425 MW will be coming to South Carolina across five projects and represents an addition of roughly 40% of the state’s current installed solar capacity. Nashville-based Silicon Ranch will build, own, and operate two projects near Charleston in Georgetown County totaling 200 MW. The projects are named Lambert I and Lambert II and are expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Birdseye Renewable Energy, a developer based in Charlotte, North Carolina and subsidiary of Dominion Energy, is developing a 75 MW solar farm in Aiken County, named Chester White. Chester White is expected to be operational in the west-central part of the state in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Ecoplexus, a developer with offices in Durham, North Carolina, will build a 75 MW solar project in Williamsburg County, northeast of Charleston. That project will be named Hemingway and is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2023.
The final project, a 75-MW solar farm near Summerville, in Dorchester County, will be developed by Johnson Development Associates, based in Spartanburg. The project, the only one of the group yet to be named, is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Although Santee Cooper and Central have contracted separately for their share of each project, Santee Cooper will manage the projects as part of its combined power system. As the aggregator for the state’s individual electric cooperatives, Central represents about 72.5% of the system load.
This group of solar projects represents the first of three phases Santee Cooper is undertaking to ensure a greener mix in its generation portfolio. The two remaining phases, approximately 500 MW each, are scheduled for later in the 2020s and early 2030s.
The additions should also help Santee Cooper to improve its position as a solar player in the Southeast U.S. The newest edition of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy’s Solar In the Southeast report has Santee Cooper near the bottom of all the region’s major utilities in terms of installed watts of solar capacity per electricity customer. The report’s four-year outlook predicted some improvement for the utility, boosting its watts-per-customer ratio from 83 in 2020 to an anticipated 644 in 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/23/virtual-power-plant-project-gets-underway-in-maryland-demonstration/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,MARYLAND",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 23, 2021",Virtual power plant project gets underway in Maryland demonstration,"Sunverge said that it and Maryland-based Delmarva Power kicked off the 0.55 MW / 2.2 MWh capacity Elk Neck Battery Storage Pilot Program.
The utility selected Sunverge for the project in a competitive bid process in 2020. The project received regulatory approvals from the Maryland Public Service Commission last year, but not before parties questioned the project’s cost effectiveness.
Sunverge will now begin acquiring customers to take part in the program, which is expected to be fully operational by the first quarter of 2022.
The project is expected to help demonstrate the value of multi-service virtual power plants and aggregated residential battery systems, both to benefit consumers and the grid. As designed, the project will provide backup power to residents of Elk Neck, Maryland, on Chesapeake Bay. It also will provide multiple grid services to increase overall grid reliability, system integration of distributed energy resources, and participate in the PJM wholesale electricity market for ancillary services.
The project is part of an Energy Storage Pilot Program that state regulators launched in 2019. In early 2020, Baltimore Gas and Electric, Potomac Electric Power Company, and Delmarva Power & Light (all operating units of Exelon Corp.), and Potomac Edison filed pilot program applications.
The commission in early November approved six projects proposed by the Exelon companies, including the Elk Neck project, the only virtual power plant to be proposed.
As described in regulatory documents, Sunverge would buy behind-the-meter energy storage systems to be installed in 110 homes in Elk Neck. Those systems would be networked together to allow them to operate as a virtual power plant. Participating homeowners would take over equipment ownership after a 10-year contract period.
Delmarva forecast that the project would have a $3.5 million cost in present value over 10 years, and would provide benefits of $1.2 million in present value over a 15-year term. The commission said that equated to a benefit-to-cost ratio of around 0.3, not including the value of unquantified benefits.
Public Service Commission staff said that the Elk Neck project had the worst cost-benefit return of all of the proposed projects that the regulatory body considered. Staff said the project should only be approved “in the interest of studying” the virtual power plant model.
The staff also recommended that the commission approve the Elk Neck project only if Delmarva secured an agreement with grid operator PJM to allow the project to participate in PJM markets. Staff said it was concerned that around half of the benefits projected for the Elk Neck project would come from PJM revenues, even though PJM at the time did not generally allow virtual power plants to bid into its markets.
In announcing that the project was getting underway, Sunverge said that Elk Neck would be allowed to provide ancillary services in the PJM market.

In a recent letter to the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), 25 state legislators voiced support for an interconnection cost allocation approach that would help ensure solar initiatives currently in Eversource and National Grid  studies can move forward in a fair, timely, and financially viable fashion.
Typically, interconnection in the state has occurred in a rolling single-basis fashion. With the advent of the Massachusetts SMART incentive program, an influx of new solar projects entered the interconnection queue. This led Eversource and National Grid to implement group studies to approve interconnection.
Currently, about 679 MW of solar are under review in the group studies, which began last October.
Some projects submitted interconnection applications as long as three years ago and may have to wait an additional five years for upgrades to be completed, according to the letter.

The letter pushes for an interim interconnection solution for solar projects currently in development so they will receive an interconnection cost estimates in the next 1-3 years before system plans are approved.
In an interview with pv magazine USA, Jessica Robertson, Borrego Solar’s director of policy and business development, said “If we don’t have a new way of structuring cost allocation, the costs for all these projects will be prohibitive, and they will be cancelled.”
She warned that multiple solar projects would end up going back to the starting line without a process to share costs.
The letter to the DPU estimated a potential loss of 6,800 jobs, and $300 million in lost municipal revenue due to interconnection costs and delays. It said that a a number of stalled projects are sited on farms that depend on solar lease revenue to exist.
The legislators said that a longer-term solution must be developed to enable the state to pursue its clean energy goals. Their letter advocated for advanced technologies and study methodologies to find less infrastructure-intensive solutions. They expressed concern that the Commonwealth will not be able to bear the costs of interconnecting if renewable energy project are routinely required to pursue upgrades of the current magnitude.
“It is sort of like in real estate development,” Robertson said. “You can have the building owner pay for the repaving of the sidewalk in front of their building, but you can’t have them build the entire interstate. There’s a shared benefit in the use of that interstate, and a shared cost.” 
Borrego Director of Interconnection Policy Kathryn Cox-Arslan said one area for improvement is the concept of “free-ridership.” Projects that can afford the cost of interconnection upgrades are able to move forward, while other projects follow and take advantage of the enabled capacity.
“Projects should be paying their fair share for system access, but there should also be an acknowledgement that those upgrades don’t benefit just one facility, but support multiple facilities,” said Cox-Arslan.
Leaders from National Grid, NECEC, CCSA, SEBANE, SEIA, MassSolar, Zero Point Development, Borrego Solar, Nexamp, Bluewave Solar, Ameresco, SunRaise Investments, and Sol Systems all signed an additional letter calling for action.
The group studies are slated to be completed between August and October, and the legislators urged state regulators to move forward with an interim solution by then.

2020 proved to be the final year of regional solar leadership for North Carolina, as already in 2021, Florida has surpassed the state in terms of total installed capacity and South Carolina has eclipsed it on a solar watts per customer ratio. Florida nearly overtook North Carolina in 2020, finishing the year with 3,909 installed MW, compared to North Carolina’s 3,955 MW. In the coming years, Georgia is expected to surpass North Carolina on both of these metrics with SACE placing the timeline for that passage at four years.
When it comes to utility solar watts per customers, Duke Energy Progress (DEP) reclaims the top spot for North Carolina, offering roughly 1,950 watts per customer. In this metric, DEP is followed by Dominion Energy South Carolina (1,336 watts/customer), Tampa Electric (769 watts/customer), Georgia Power (669 watts/customer), and Duke Energy Carolinas (591 watts/customer).
Tampa Electric increased its solar watts per customer ratio by two-thirds in 2020.
The impressive new addition to this top-five is Tampa Electric, which increased its watts per customer ratio by two-thirds in 2020.
The report also includes an outlook of utilities that SACE expects to make major solar progress over the next four years, with these utilities being dubbed Sunrisers. The Knoxville Utilities Board, after an explosive 2020 that saw the addition of 502 MW in solar commitments, is expected to reach a 2024 benchmark of 2,552 watts/customer. Other Sunrisers were Mississippi Power for adding two 78.5 MW systems to its portfolio and Tampa Electric for a continued commitment to solar.
Of course, no state can achieve such heights in commitment to solar without strong policy supporting the resource. SACE states in the report that it supports the call for a federal Clean Electricity Standard (100% by 2035), adding that North Carolina’s state-level renewable portfolio standard, enacted in 2007, deserves credit for catalyzing the state’s historic solar momentum. A federal mandate could be effective towards giving solar a foothold in states/utility service areas where it has not yet been successful.
The report also calls attention to contractual relationships across state lines, saying that these types of supply deals may warrant additional scrutiny to ensure proper accounting and transparency. It highlights the fact that more than half of the solar being constructed to supply the Knoxville Utilities Board in Tennessee is being constructed in Mississippi.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/23/solar-technology-was-developed-in-america-now-its-energy-for-america-lets-make-it-here/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 23, 2021","Solar technology was developed in America, now it’s energy for America. Let’s make it here","The U.S. solar industry is a success story by almost every metric. From record installations on a quarter-over-quarter basis, to employment numbers that now top a quarter-million Americans.
Numbers like these have continued despite the headwinds of the pandemic, trade challenges and shifting political winds.
However, the industry is now facing supply chain constraints.
All those who examined these constraints for their companies in recent months have come to the same startling conclusion: No matter where panels are assembled, key components used to make solar modules are sourced from China. Now that upstream components face cost increases and sourcing interruptions, the industry finds itself with nowhere else to turn.
Between 2010 and 2020, U.S.-produced solar panels dropped in market share from 6% globally to 1%. More jobs have been lost in the U.S. solar manufacturing sector than currently exist, despite recent investments that now have U.S. solar manufacturing at approximately 5 GW of capacity with several more gigawatts of capacity planned.
To date, the United States government’s response to help protect U.S. manufacturing has been tariffs, which are generally unpopular with the U.S. solar industry. That’s because inexpensive imports have fueled explosive growth in U.S. jobs in the “downstream” part of the solar industry, such as installing panels on American rooftops and connecting solar power to our grid.
The inconvenient reality is that those downstream jobs are all dependent on a foreign supply chain. Now we know they are at risk.
Many developers have projects in a development queue that use an aggressive, downward price curve on components. However, with global supply chain issues impacting everything from the glass to polysilicon, the costs of solar panels are actually increasing.
The Biden administration has signaled its support for solar energy’s continued growth with ambitious deployment goals.
However, opponents of this plan are now alleging that U.S. government support uses U.S. taxpayer money to fund companies that have repeatedly violated trade agreements. And the U.S. government is considering imposing further trade actions tied to allegations of forced labor in the upstream solar supply-chain.
With the winds of Washington still blowing toward hawkish trade policies, U.S. solar policy will likely include continuation of import tariffs or other trade actions.
This raises an important question: Do new import tariffs make sense as a mainstay of pro-solar policies for America?
The Section 201 “safeguard” tariffs have not accomplished investment in the domestic production of ingots, wafers, and cells.

That has left the domestic supply chain at the mercy of imported goods. Over the last few years, China has cornered the global market of ingots and wafers with a market share of 95% and 99%, respectively.
In short, even with increased domestic production of solar modules, every U.S. solar job is still subjected to the risks of a non-U.S. based supply-chain.
Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) introduced the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act on June 21. This bill proposes a long-term manufacturing tax credit based on the content that comes from a U.S.-anchored supply chain. Each step of the supply chain is incentivized, from polysilicon to ingot, wafer, cells, and finished panels. The tax credit places market and technology risk on the private sector, and it provides price buoyancy for what is produced. That way, domestic manufacturers can invest and compete on a global level.
More importantly, a manufacturing tax credit doesn’t create further market barriers for the importation of products needed to hit America’s ambitious solar deployment goals. It incentivizes scale, innovation and consumption of a domestic supply chain.
Rebuilding our domestic solar supply chain won’t happen overnight, and we need long-term solutions. The Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act is an excellent start.
