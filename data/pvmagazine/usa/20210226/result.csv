Totaling 2.8 MW, the projects are expected to result in $6.1 million of energy savings over 25 years for low-income households and nonprofits serving low-income communities.
Commerce Director Lisa Brow said low-income households pay a disproportionately higher portion of their income for energy and are often in locations more likely to be impacted by harmful emissions and climate change.
“These projects will lower the energy burden of low-income communities while increasing renewable energy generation on the electric grid, both important steps toward achieving energy equity across Washington state,” said Brow.
In January, the commerce department and other state regulators adopted new rules to help implement Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act, which was passed in 2019 and sets the state on a path to carbon-neutral electricity by 2030 and 100% clean electricity by 2045.
The nine projects selected in the recent award include:
Coastal Community Action Program (CCAP): $243,000 to build a 121 kW installation at a community center. CCAP will use savings from the project to offset energy costs and provide more services to qualified low-income households across two counties.
HopeSource: $170,130 to install a 101 kW solar array on an affordable housing complex in Ellensburg. The production benefits will go directly to residents and also will offset the energy costs of a related community center.
Lummi Nation: $593,898 to install two solar PV systems on the Lummi Nation Administration Building and HeadStart Building, with a total capacity of 384 kW. Energy savings will lower the energy burden of the Lhaq’temish Foundation, which serves school, nonprofit, and tribal programs.
Olympia Community Solar: $341,732 to install a 126 kW solar system at an affordable housing complex in Olympia. Generation from the solar project will offset residents’ electric bills.
Opportunity Council: $179,324 to install a 100+ kW solar PV system to serve a food bank and help cut its annual energy costs; savings will be redirected to buy food and supplies for the community.
Orcas Power & Light Cooperative (OPALCO): $1 million to build a 1.2 MW community solar array on San Juan Island. OPALCO will use benefits from the array to offset energy costs for low-income service providers, and to increase credits provided to offset low- and moderate-income households’ energy bills.
Puget Sound Energy (PSE): $207,932 to install a 243 kW community solar project on the Olympia Center in downtown Olympia. PSE will direct project benefits to low-income households and affordable housing providers across the city, and to the Olympia Center’s nonprofit tenant.
Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD): $861,814 to install a community solar project in south Everett. The PUD will donate related generation credits to an energy bill assistance program for county residents.
Yakima Valley Partners Habitat for Humanity: $112,600 to install a 119 kW solar project on the nonprofit organization’s storefront in downtown Yakima. Energy savings over the life of the project will support construction of new homes.
The Low-Income Solar Deployment Program is part of Washington’s Clean Energy Fund. Since it was established in 2013, the fund has invested more than $131 million in projects and clean energy job creation.

The financing will be used to add 50 projects to New Columbia’s existing portfolio of 150 projects, and enable the hiring of up to 20 people this year. New Columbia said that the financing will keep it on track to achieve its vision of deploying $120 million into the local solar market across 2020 and 2021.
New Columbia develops rooftop, carport, and ground-mounted solar energy projects. The company closed its first tax equity deal with Franklin Park Infrastructure in May 2020. That $40 million investment allowed the company to develop 30 MW of capacity and hire 10 people.
Washington, D.C., is home to one of the most aggressive renewable mandates in the country – 100% renewable by 2032 – but has limited space where projects can be developed. New Columbia Project Finance Manager, Shane Lebow, said that Franklin Park “understands the box which we operate and develop in,” and that each customer has different needs for their systems.
New Columbia adds solar to multifamily buildings, schools, and industrial facilities, according to CEO Mike Healy. Most of its projects are less than 100 kW in size.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/26/watch-ikea-completes-1-35-mw-solar-carport-with-seven-more-underway/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARYLAND",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021","Watch: IKEA completes 1.35 MW solar carport, with seven more underway","In partnership with New York-based Distributed Solar Development­­ (DSD), home furnishings retailer IKEA said it completed a 1.35 MW solar carport at its Baltimore location and plans to build seven more projects at other U.S. stores.
The solar carports will help IKEA move toward its goal of being powered by 100% renewable energy while also increasing energy efficiency by 2025.
DSD designed and built the Baltimore carport. Initial results indicate the location has seen an 84% decrease in its purchased energy requirement between September and December 2020, equating to a 57% cost savings for the store.
The Baltimore project is the first of eight projects totaling 7 MW that DSD will develop for IKEA stores in Maryland and California. The other arrays are on track to be done this year. In January, DSD closed on a $300 million debt facility financed by Credit Suisse and hinted it will have more deals to announce in the near future.
All totaled, the solar carports are expected to generate roughly 10.7 GWh a year. Five of the projects include energy storage systems with a collective capacity of about 5 MWh.
In the U.S., the company currently owns 104 wind turbines, two geothermal properties, 240,784 solar panels, and 143 electric vehicle charging stations across 51 properties.
In 2020, Ingka Group, a partner in the IKEA franchise system, committed more than $700 million into companies, solutions, and its own operations to move to a net-zero carbon economy. As part of that effort, Ingka Group invested in two solar parks totaling 403 MW of capacity in Utah and Texas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/26/a-big-win-for-solar-kansas-regulators-reject-utilitys-proposed-fees/,"POLICY,KANSAS",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",A ‘big win’ for solar: Kansas regulators reject utility’s proposed fees,"The Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) unanimously rejected Evergy’s proposed rate changes for residential solar customers. The ruling denied the utility’s plan to impose a charge on customer-owned solar. It also turned down the utility’s proposed alternative plan to impose a minimum bill for all customers.
The Climate + Energy Project, the Sierra Club, and Vote Solar opposed both proposals and applauded the regulators’ decision. Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, called it a “big win” for solar and all Evergy ratepayers.
The 36-page decision ordered Evergy to put its residential distributed generation (DG) customers back on a two-part standard residential rate design, eliminating a demand charge.
Regulators originally approved a three-part rate design for residential DG customers in September 2018 as part of a Westar (now Evergy) rate case. The Sierra Club and Vote Solar, both parties to the docket, filed an appeal. In April 2020, the Kansas Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the commission, calling the three-part design “price discriminatory” and sending the matter back to the KCC for more work.
In its Feb. 25 order, the commission turned down two alternate proposals from Evergy to recoup DG customer costs that the company claimed are not captured in the standard residential rate. The first proposal called for a grid access fee of $3.00/kW of installed DG capacity. The alternative called for a $35 minimum monthly bill for all residential customers.
The KCC decision means that rates for standard residential and DG residential customers will be identical, at least until Evergy’s next scheduled rate case in 2023.
Clean energy advocacy groups argued that minimum bills disproportionately harm low-wealth and fixed-income families, as well as discourage energy conservation and efficiency investment by reducing customers’ ability to control their electric bill.
Claudine Custodio, regulatory manager at Vote Solar, said that local clean energy saves money for all grid customers by generating energy where it is used, reducing the grid’s operating costs. She said the ruling allows Kansans to keep benefiting from solar investments that they or their neighbors make and prevents a “harmful, discriminatory fee.”
Despite the unanimous decision, some KCC members said they believe solar customers are being subsidized and said they liked the possibility of additional fees.
“The solutions purported by the company, we believe were flawed,” Commissioner Susan Duffy told the Topeka-Capital Journal. She said that rather than having “kicked the can down the road with this order,” regulators instead had given stakeholders “an opportunity … to work together and explore the best solution not only for rooftop solar issues, but other issues as well.”
And Commission Chair Andrew French told the newspaper that the issue continued to need to be addressed. He said he was “convinced” that there is “some amount of subsidy that flows to [solar] customers associated with their use of the grid.”
In a concurring opinion, Commissioner Dwight Keen indicated he was open to requiring electric utilities that want to enact rates that impact DG residential customers differently than non-DG customers to identify the services that DG customers will receive, and also show how those services are different from, or in addition to, what are provided to non-DG residential customers.
The KCC encouraged Evergy to explore rate designs that address the DG subsidization issue. It also encouraged all stakeholders to explore legislative changes to update Kansas’ net metering laws and other statutes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/26/sunrise-brief-first-solar-signs-2-4-gw-deal-reports-results-from-a-challenging-2020/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021","Sunrise brief: First Solar signs 2.4 GW deal, reports results from a “challenging” 2020","First Solar reported net sales of $2.7 billion for 2020, a drop from the nearly $3.1 billion it reported a year earlier.
Operating expenses for the year improved from almost $711 million in 2019 to $363 million in 2020.  The 2019 expenses were skewed by a charge related to settling shareholder litigation over alleged stock price manipulation.
Full-year net income was just under $400 million, or $3.73 a share. That compared to a loss of almost $115 million, or $1.09 a share, in 2019.
Net fourth quarter sales were $0.6 billion. That was down $0.3 billion from the prior quarter. The company said the decline stemmed from higher international project sales in the third quarter, which were partially offset by increased module sales in the fourth quarter. The company said its fourth quarter net income per share was $1.08.
Analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of $1.24 a share on revenue of $715 million.
Mark Widmar, CEO, said that the company faced challenges during 2020, including “continued intense competition” across the crystalline PV supply chain as well as “unforeseen challenges related to the pandemic.”
Orders for 2021 got a boost with word that First Solar will supply up to 2.4 GW of its Series 6 photovoltaic solar modules to Intersect Power. The deal, announced Feb. 26, is one of the largest orders for the modules to date.
Modules will be deployed to seven projects, with deliveries scheduled for 2022 and 2023. The deal with Intersect Power includes options to add almost 400 MW more capacity, subject to the projects’ final designs. Intersect Power placed a 1.7 GW order for Series 6 modules in 2019.
First Solar said it is forecasting net sales for 2021 of between $2.85 billion to $3.0 billion. That includes $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion of module segment sales. Operating income is forecasted to be in the range of $545 million to $640 million. The company also said it expects net income per share to range from $4.05 to $4.75.
First Solar has suggested that it is evaluating further U.S. manufacturing expansion, “contingent on the right policy environment.”
Plug Power said it will build a $290 million hydrogen production facility and electric substation in the New York Science, Technology and Advanced Manufacturing Park (STAMP) in western New York State. The project includes a 450 MW electrical substation that will service the entire STAMP site. The hydrogen production plant is intended to produce 45 metric tons of green liquid hydrogen daily for markets in the Northeast. The plant will use 120 MW of Plug Power’s PEM electrolyzers to make the hydrogen using hydropower. The New York plant joins an existing Tennessee plant in a network that aims to supply 500 tons per day of green hydrogen by 2025.
Assets related to energy infrastructure tend to be far-flung; solar PV assets in particular may sprawl over hundreds or thousands of acres, much of it in rural and isolated regions.
With that in mind, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory is developing small-scale local climate-change models. California utility Pacific Gas & Electric will use them as part of its planning to avoid wildfire disasters.
Data includes factors that impact fire risk such as high wind speeds, low humidity, and soil moisture.

The Argonne-developed model projects future climate in a 12-km grid across the entire U.S.
Data includes factors that impact fire risk such as high wind speeds, low humidity, and soil moisture. The California utility will combine those data with existing science on how climate change will affect heat and precipitation.
The growth of solar energy capacity across California puts the often-sprawling arrays at increased wildfire risk, according to Andrew Sundling of PVEL. He spoke on insurance risk at a recent online event hosted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The range of damage to solar PV panels can sometimes be obvious, such as scorched backsheets, warped tracker torque tubes, embrittled metal structures, and melted or cracked inverter enclosures, junction boxes, and connector cables.
Less obvious damage may occur from fast-moving brush fires that result in thermal stress. In that case, cell-level cracks, microcracks, scratches, and heat spots may not be visible, but can still trim energy yield and cause safety issues over time.
