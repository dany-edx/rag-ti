A report from Interact Analysis showed that cumulatively, the United States is expected to reach 49.5 GW of installed and operational energy storage capacity. Over 10 GW is expected to be added to the cumulative total in 2023 alone. 
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found the average duration of these deployments to be about three hours. The average duration has increased over the years, as seen below. 
Some batteries are used similarly to natural gas peaker plants, offering shorter durations to match times of peak electricity demand. Other batteries are designed as long-duration energy storage, storing eight hours or more of dispatchable energy to provide baseload grid support. About 90% of energy storage capacity is at the grid scale. 
An additional 31.4 GW of energy storage projects are in construction or planning phases, said the report. Interact Analysis said that about 24.7 GW of the 31.4 GW is represented by electrochemical batteries, commonly lithium based.
Texas leads the way for energy storage project capacity. About 51% of the nation’s planned, under construction, or installed and operational energy storage is installed in the state. For electrochemical storage, California and Texas have 16.3 GW and 16.4 GW installed respectively.  
New York is another notable center for energy storage development, setting a target for 6 GW of storage by 2030. Energy storage has also grown rapidly in Arizona in recent years as the state aims to reach 15% renewable energy by 2025. It represents about 5% of the nation’s planned, under construction, or operational energy storage.
Tim Montague of the Clean Power Consulting Group said that energy storage is about 10 years behind solar PV on the cost-adoption curve. Creative solutions to lower costs will be needed to meet the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory projection of a need for 60 TWh of energy storage by 2050, a nearly 100x increase from today.
“Several challenges must be addressed to fully realize this potential, including permitting and interconnection issues, workforce shortages and upgrading grid infrastructure,” said Montague.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/22/xcel-energy-approved-for-expansion-for-710-mw-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MINNESOTA",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",Xcel Energy approved for expansion for 710 MW solar project,"Xcel Energy has acquired approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to expand its Sherco Solar project. The Commission unanimously approved the expansion of the project, adding 250 MW to a 460 MW project that began construction in April.
The project’s total capital investment now amounts to $1 billion following the $406 million expansion. It is expected to generate $350 million in local economic benefits through payments to landowners and local tax.
The 710 MW project, once completed as scheduled for late 2025, would become one of the largest solar projects in the United States. The project is expected to generate enough electricity to power over 150,000 Minnesota homes per year.
The large utility-scale solar project is sited on a former coal plant that is planned to be retired by the end of 2023. Xcel has stated plans to shut down all its coal generators by 2030.
“Sherco Solar will provide the lowest-cost solar on our Upper Midwest system, and these projects demonstrate our focus on clean energy without compromising affordability,” said Chris Clark, an executive for Xcel Energy.
By locating the project on a retired coal plant, Xcel will make use of land already developed for electricity generation, rather than disturbing existing habitats or farmland. The site also benefits from existing transmission infrastructure that used to support the coal plant.
Furthermore, Xcel has committed to retaining jobs as it phases its coal plants into solar facilities. The company said it has transitioned its other coal jobs to solar jobs without layoffs, has stated plans to do the same for employees the Sherco site. The Sherco project will also add 400 union construction jobs.
“We thank the Commission, Minnesota Department of Commerce and labor partners for their support of our solar portfolio,” said Clark.
Minnesota has a long history of being a solar-friendly state. Governor Walz signed into law a new climate bill that aims for 100% clean energy by 2040. The state enacted its first net metering law in 1983. In 2013 it became the first state to establish a community solar law. In 2007 it set its renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Walz’s new climate bill encourages utilities to take energy justice into account in their ratemaking process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/22/accelerating-heat-pump-adoption-in-canada/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",Accelerating heat pump adoption in Canada,"Heat pumps are a way to heat and cool homes with electricity, and offer near zero emissions when powered by solar or other clean sources of energy, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA further contends that they result in lower emissions even where electricity is generated by an emissions-intensive source. They can replace oil or gas furnaces, or in very cold climates, households may choose to retain their legacy heating system—just in case. However, recent advances in heat pump technology had made them much more efficient in cold climates, with the leading manufacturers announcing models designed for cold climates that do not need a backup heat source.
Canada, which has extremes of both cold and hot temperatures, has a goal of cutting emissions by at least 40% to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and it passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which calls for a net-zero target by 2050.
A recent report by the Canadian Climate Institute, Heat pumps pay off, states that Canadians are not embracing heat pumps in a way that is consistent with moving toward emissions targets. The report contends that Canadian households need more clarity on costs as well as government policy in order to speed adoption.
Researchers at the Canadian Climate Institute assessed lifetime costs of different heating and cooling combinations in different ages and types of housing across five Canadian cities to determine how heat pumps compare to the common combination of gas heating and air conditioning. They concluded that a heat pump is the lowest-cost option for most households over the lifetime of the system; however, barriers such as high upfront costs, lack of consumer confidence, the complexity of government rebate and loan programs, and the fact that residents usually have to own their own homes in order to benefit from some of the programs, thus eliminating renters, low-income households and others.
Five findings from the report:
Standard heat pumps, as opposed to cold climate heat pumps, were found to be the lowest-cost option for single, detached homes, regardless of the age of the home. For example, the report states that “whether a single-detached house in Montreal was built in 1940 or 2023, heat pumps with electric backup are consistently lower-cost than gas-fired heating with air conditioning”.
Cold climate heat pumps with backup, however, are a costlier option than standard heat pumps. But the report contends that as technologies improve, their upfront costs will fall to be more in line with standard systems.
Barriers to adoption
The report concludes that barriers to adoption include economic, behavioral, and struc­tural barriers. For example, upfront costs can be high, but many people are also reluctant to invest in a new technology. The report authors are optimistic that these barriers will resolve as the heat pump market matures; however, they indicate that the time is now to embrace clean technology. Rather than “locking in another generation of fossil fuel heating equipment,” the authors state that the next few years are a “window of opportunity” to upgrade homes and decarbonize the building stock.
Navigating complex policies
The many programs in place to help Canadian residents decarbonize their households are too complex and “create a substantial administrative burden for households,” the report states. For example to apply for Greener Homes grant and loan programs, home energy audits are required, and households must pay for them without knowing whether they’ll qualify for a grant or loan. The result is that application rates are lagging by one-third of those needed to meet program targets. The report makes several recommendations for enhancing policies, including the suggestion that the government maintain the schedule of planned carbon price increases. It also recommends that it’s important to maintain the existing financial support even as heat pump adoption accelerates—at least in the near term—conceding they may be able to sunset some programming as the market matures and costs fall. A final recommendation is to maintain support for lower-income households.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/22/nextracker-opens-steel-manufacturing-facility-in-las-vegas/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TRACKERS,NEVADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",Nextracker opens steel manufacturing facility in Las Vegas,"During the busy week of RE+ 2023, Nextracker hosted industry leaders at an opening ceremony at a steel plant in Las Vegas.
The steel manufacturing facility will be owned and operated by Unimacts, a specialist in industrial manufacturing and supply chain solutions, and all steel components will be produced exclusively for Nextracker.
The idea for the facility came to Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker, after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. He contacted Matt Arnold, CEO of Unimacts, urging Unimacts to provide a steel tube manufacturing facility for Nextracker in the western U.S., reported Eckhart Gouras, publisher and managing director of pv magazine group, who attended the ceremony. Shugar’s goal was to have the Unimacts’ facility in place by January 1st, 2023. At the time of that phone call, Unimacts had no production sites in the U.S., but a steel manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. The solution was to take that facility and put it in Las Vegas to ensure that Nextracker was locking in the support that the IRA provides to domestic clean energy manufacturing.
This is Nextracker’s sixth manufacturing facility in the U.S. since 2022 and the 15th facility the company opened or expanded with key suppliers in the U.S. in that time. The tracker specialist has located plants near its target markets with the goal of reducing time and cost for its customers The Unimacts plant will produce steel components for Nextracker’s in ground-mount solar power generation plants primarily for projects in Nevada and southwestern states. Another plant opened last year in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, and it serves the rapidly growing solar markets in Pennsylvania, Indiana, New York, and Ohio.
“Unimacts is excited that our partnership with Nextracker will create new jobs and increase the amount of solar we can produce here in the US,” said Arnold. “With the Nextracker dedicated line, we will be supporting gigawatts of utility-scale projects annually, powering homes and businesses across the Southwest and even as far east as Indiana and Kentucky.”
The Las Vegas facility features expanded production capacity generating what Nextracker estimates to be more than 100 new jobs currently, and over 200 expected by 2024. The plant includes Unimacts manufacturing machinery and equipment relocated from Mexico as well as new equipment.
“By partnering with Unimacts on this new production line, we’re bringing back American manufacturing jobs and building out America’s energy infrastructure to enhance energy security and de-risk the supply chain,” said Shugar. “This plant will support our customers with quick shipping and American-made products.”
Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act just over one year ago, solar developers are focusing on U.S. made content for solar power plants. In order for developers to obtain the domestic content bonus credit all steel and iron used in projects must be completely manufactured in the U.S., with the exception of certain metallurgical processes related to steel additives. This primarily applies to construction materials used for racking, trackers and foundation components anchoring solar panels.
“Nextracker and Unimact’s new facility is a shining example of how smart policy can uplift communities with jobs and local investment,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “The United States is in the midst of a clean energy manufacturing renaissance, and investments like this are helping drive us toward an abundant, reliable, American-made clean energy future.”
At the opening event, Shugar called on the audience to spread the word that the U.S. solar industry is not only delivering lower cost energy, but also creating clean jobs and “advancing energy independence, all while we’re facilitating clean water and clean air.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/22/verdagy-plans-first-u-s-facility-to-manufacture-large-volume-of-advanced-water-electrolyzers/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",Verdagy plans first U.S. facility to manufacture large volume of advanced water electrolyzers,"Water electrolysis technology company Verdagy is planning to open a new facility in Newark, California, which will be the first in the U.S. to manufacture advanced water electrolyzers in large volumes.
The facility will have more than 100,000 square feet of advanced manufacturing space, and the company plans to double its employees by next summer to manage the expansion and operation of the new plant. The facility is expected to come into operation in the first quarter of 2024. 
Verdagy caters to customers in heavy industries, like chemicals, ammonia and fertilizer, and steel; sectors that green hydrogen can play a key role in decarbonizing. The company says it is focusing on advanced manufacturing, cost reductions and product innovation that puts it on the pathway to the U.S. Department of Energy’s goal of hitting $2/kg levelized cost of hydrogen by 2026.
The U.S. needs to accelerate domestic production of electrolyzers as most of the production is outsourced from overseas manufacturers, Verdagy CEO Marty Neese told pv magazine USA. 
“If we enable domestic manufacturing of electrolyzers, it will also accelerate innovation that will have cascading effects on the overall cost and production capacity, enabling domestic manufacturing to become global leaders in the hydrogen industry,” Neese added. 
The new Silicon Valley manufacturing facility will accelerate the production and cost reduction of its 20 MW electrolyzer module, which is the basic building block for delivering larger, gigawatt-scale plants, according to Neese. 
Verdagy’s plans to expand its manufacturing capacity in California is set against the broader backdrop of the state’s hydrogen ambitions. California is focused on building an entire renewable hydrogen ecosystem to achieve its climate goasl, and that includes manufacturing electrolyzers, Dee Dee Myers, senior advisor to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and director of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, said.
“Verdagy’s decision to expand their footprint here reflects California’s unique strength in creating new markets, enabling the creation of clean energy jobs while solving our most existential challenges with the technology of the future,” Myers said. 
One of the key challenges to ramping up domestic electrolyzer manufacturing capacity is access to capital to build out the needed infrastructure, Neese said. Policy-makers are already looking at ways to address these challenges. The DOE, as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is encouraging companies like Verdagy to expand the U.S. supply chain for green hydrogen electrolyzer manufacturing, Neese added. 
In August, Governor Newsom instructed his Office of Business and Economic Development to develop a hydrogen market development strategy for California, which is expected to mirror the state’s zero-emission vehicle market development strategy. Clean hydrogen is likely to be a key component of achieving California’s climate goals, and the state is competing to be a federally-funded hydrogen hub under an $8 billion program that stems from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The new strategy will focus on using hydrogen to deploy clean energy and decarbonize the transportation and industrial sectors, and will be developed with input from agencies like the California Air Resources Board, the California Energy Commission, and the California Public Utilities Commission.

Briggs & Stratton Energy Solutions, a US-based provider of battery systems and standby generators, has unveiled a new lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery package comprising a battery, a 6 kW inverter and a control system.
“These packages offer a simplified, state-of-the-art technology solution that is versatile enough to serve a variety of energy applications across homes and businesses — from grid-tied solar systems to off-grid energy systems to backup power for outage management,” said Tom Rugg, SVP and president of Briggs & Stratton Energy Solutions.
All packages utilize the company’s SimpliPHI and AmpliPHI battery technologies, which the manufacturer said can easily be scaled to increase capacity to 299 kWh per system.
The company offers the SimpliPHI ESS Package with a 4.9 kWh battery, its SimpliPHI 6 kW inverter and its EnergyTrak control system. This package can rely on up to four batteries to reach a capacity of up to 19.92 kWh and reportedly offers up to 32 hours of backup.
“The SimpliPHI ESS Package is suitable for indoor or outdoor installation and has an IP65 rating for operating in all weather conditions. To provide more storage capacity and backup power for larger power needs, multiple batteries can be run in parallel,” the manufacturer stated.
The AmpliPHI ESS Package is based on a 3.8 kWh battery, the SimpliPHI 6 kW inverter and the EnergyTrak control system. It can also utilize up to four batteries and reach a capacity of up to 15.48 kWh. It purportedly ensures up to 25 hours of backup power.
“The package can be scaled with the addition of AmpliPHI batteries to meet larger power needs,” Briggs & Stratton said.
Both products come with a 15-year warranty. The battery technology is said to have a lifecycle of more than 10,000 cycles and a depth of discharge (DoD) of 80%.
The company also said the new products are engineered and assembled in the USA.
