(Read our coverage of the hearing.)
Energy and battery storage are set to be the lynchpin of a transition to a carbon-free economy and greater adoption of renewable energy. Even so, most experts say that the U.S. is significantly behind much of the world in usage and manufacturing. This reality will need to be quickly addressed by the Biden Administration. pv magazine spoke with Kurt “Chip” Breitenkamp, vice president of Business Development at NanoGraf, who offered insight into how the administration might tackle the battery and storage challenge.

Already, the Biden Administration has created significant battery and EV demand through the “Made in America” executive order signed in late January. The order directs the federal government to replace its entire existing vehicle fleet with EVs.
“If we believe that electrification is going to be the future of the new green economy, we can’t be reliant on other countries,” said Breitenkamp. “I think we learned that lesson from fossil fuels over the last 50 years.”
Breitenkamp said that the demand created by the federal government will create upstream demand for batteries and the materials used to construct them. That, in turn, will create a much more dynamic American battery market. From there, the hope is that corporations and other entities will recognize the capacity of battery manufacturing and look to invest still further in the technologies.
The biggest challenge to achieving this reality is the middle part of the “smiling curve:” manufacturing and production capacity. While a major focus of research and development is on battery technologies and massive potential demand exists for these technologies, domestic manufacturing capacity is virtually nonexistent.
“There isn’t a single U.S. company that can make a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery right now,” said Breitenkamp.
Making those batteries requires the supplies to go with them, and that means developing an American battery production supply chain.
One of the biggest issues involves cobalt, which primarily is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has a  dubious supply chain. But, Breitenkamp asserts that this may not be the most difficult obstacle to hurdle.

Instead, he said that battery manufacturers are increasingly moving their chemistries away from cobalt. If the United States were able to set up an effective market for battery and electronic recycling, that would greatly reduce the country’s reliance on new, mined cobalt. To date, battery recycling has been underdeveloped, but the potential for greater expansion exists, according to Breitenkamp.
He cited the opinion of JB Straubel, co-founder and former CTO of Tesla and now CEO of Redwood materials, who said that thousands of tons of cobalt exist already in the U.S. in the form of unused electronics.
“The reality is that China has shipped us enough cobalt in the form of finished products, that, if we recycle that, we might have enough cobalt without having to worry about that being part of the U.S. supply chain,” Breitenkamp said.
As for nickel, graphite, and lithium, the United States may have to turn to Canada and countries in South America, where the resources are plentiful. For example, considerable nickel and graphite resources exists in Canada, which is especially important given that China historically has dominated graphite production. As for lithium, the resource is plentiful in South America, especially in Chile.
Breitenkamp raised the idea of a trade treaty, similar to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, that the United States could pursue with Canada and South American lithium-producing countries to create a resilient and equitable supply chain.
As important as the raw materials are to create a battery,  job creation is at the forefront of Biden’s energy policy.
In her hearing, Gov. Granholm shared the goal of creating 10 million jobs focused on transforming energy systems. A major challenge will be retraining former fossil fuel workers in the new energy economy.  Any transition cannot be equitable if these workers are left behind, the administration has argued.
“We have technologies that are ready now, we have jobs that are ready now,” said Breitenkamp. He said a key challenge is creating enough demand to further develop clean energy solutions like batteries and energy storage. “If it were easy, we would have already figured it out.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/01/california-regulators-modify-grid-map-requirements-to-ease-solar-integration/,"MARKETS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 1, 2021",California regulators modify grid map requirements to ease solar integration,"The California Public Utilities Commission ordered several key improvements to the Integration Capacity Analysis, a grid transparency tool.
The motion requesting the changes that the CPUC responded to was filed last October by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, the California Solar & Storage Association, and California Energy Storage Alliance. Regulators issued their decision at the end of the January.
Integration Capacity Analysis (ICA), called hosting capacity analysis in other states, is a process of modeling conditions on the distribution grid that impact where additional distributed energy resources can be added without the need for costly upgrades and/or lengthy interconnection studies.
The maps  can be critical tools for enabling more efficient and cost effective deployment of clean energy and energy storage.
The ruling establishes new requirements to improve the accuracy and usefulness of ICA maps. These include requiring investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to:
The CPUC’s action will make ICA more useful in showing the capacity of the grid to host new load, IREC said. Due to problems in initial ICA maps released by California’s IOUs, they previously were not useful for this purpose. In particular, IREC said the maps showed the distribution grid to be “significantly more constrained” in its ability to host new load than it actually is.
As part of the order, IOUs must make a filing describing the methodology, inputs, and assumptions of the load ICA; these will then be refined through workshops and public comment.
Another element of the decision related to data redaction. The CPUC had previously established redaction rules to protect customer information; however, earlier ICAs redacted more information than was necessary to protect customers’ privacy.
In particular, IREC said that San Diego Gas & Electric omitted the locations of substations. As a result, large portions of its map appeared blank because SDG&E redacted more than is allowed under the CPUC’s rules. The CPUC order confirmed that SDG&E redacted too much information and required IOUs to publish the location of transmission lines.
Finally, the CPUC ordered a number of other changes designed to make ICA results more useful. The order requires a process of continuing improvements, and establishes requirements for data validation.
Improvements include requiring better search and query functionality, publishing downloadable map files, updating user guides when map functionality changes, and displaying other useful information in the ICA maps.
The CPUC also required IOUs to file better data validation plans, and to hire an independent technical expert to review ICA data validation plans, identify best practices, and suggest improvements.

Shoals said its balance-of-systems (BOS) solutions are deployed on more than 20 GW of solar projects globally.
The Tennessee-based firm and its parent entity first intended to offer 50 million shares of Class A common stock priced between $19.00 and $21.00 per share. Shoals later upsized the IPO to 77 million shares at $25.00 each.
The stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “SHLS” on January 27. According to reports, shares climbed to above $30.00 and raised about $1.9 billion by the time the market closed.
“Shoals is excited to become a Nasdaq-listed company,” President and CEO Jason Whitaker told pv magazine USA. “This is a key milestone for our company as we execute on our mission to deliver innovative products that reduce the cost and improve the reliability and safety of renewable energy.”
Shoals announced completion of the upsized IPO on January 29, noting the company and its parent entity ultimately sold more than 88.5 million shares.
Shoals itself sold more than 11.5 million shares totaling almost $289 million. That included an additional 2.5 million shares following the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase more.
Meanwhile, a parent entity controlled by funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management LP sold 77 million shares, including an additional 9 million to underwriters. That totaled almost $1.93 billion.
All told, the IPO raised more than $2.21 billion for Shoals and the Oaktree-managed parent entity.
The company’s IPO is among the most successful in the solar industry, joining that of tracker builder Array Technologies last year.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan acted as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters for the Shoals offering. Guggenheim Securities and UBS Investment Bank acted as joint book-running managers. Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Credit Suisse are acting as book-runners. Cowen and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. are acting as co-managers.

The University of Arkansas Hope-Texarkana (UAHT) is installing a 1 MW solar project and building a training lab at its Hope campus.
In an announcement, UAHT said the solar array will occupy around seven acres and help the university save on electricity costs.
As part of the recently approved project, UAHT will also install a smaller hands-on solar learning lab under its new Certificate of Proficiency in Solar Energy Technology program.
Interim Chancellor Laura Clark said the lab and program will help fill a need for accredited technicians in Arkansas.
Beginning this fall semester, UAHT will use a curriculum from training group Solar Energy International and become an approved provider of North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) certification. Course work provides training to install, construct, maintain, and operate solar electric systems.
The AEP SWEPCO Foundation provided a $200,000 grant for the laboratory. In addition, project installer Entegrity Energy Partners has teamed up with First Solar and OMCO Solar to donate modules and racking equipment to help complete the lab.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/01/panasonic-says-it-will-exit-solar-manufacturing/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,JAPAN",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 1, 2021",Panasonic says it will exit solar manufacturing,"From pv magazine Global
Panasonic announced it will exit the solar manufacturing industry within 14 months.
The Japanese brand issued a press release outlining plans to shutter its Malaysian factory, liquidate its Panasonic Solar Energy Malaysia subsidiary, and lay off staff by March 2022.
The manufacture of solar wafers, cells and modules at the company’s domestic fab, in Shimane prefecture, will also cease by the end of the next fiscal year, although no members of the Japanese workforce will be made redundant. Panasonic confirmed the Shimane fab will continue to manufacture inverters, batteries “and other products.”
The company will continue to sell solar modules with its brand, with their manufacture sub-contracted out. The third-party-manufactured products will be sold in Japan after domestic production ceases, Panasonic stated, as is already the case for overseas markets.
The decision to exit solar manufacturing will also prompt photovoltaic R&D activity at the company’s Nishikinohama factory in Kaizuka City, Osaka, to be “downsized,” with “human resources … shifted to other growth areas,” the company added.
Malaysian staff will not be so fortunate, with Panasonic stating it will “support impacted employees with sincerity, providing measures including premium severance payment[s] and outplacement assistance.”
The move comes after Panasonic in August walked away from a projected partnership with Chinese heterojunction module maker GS-Solar which would have seen the Japanese company’s Malaysian operation transferred to the Chinese business and a photovoltaic R&D operation established by the two partners. Having announced the potential tie-up in May 2019, Panasonic abandoned the plan five months ago, stating GS-Solar had missed two deadlines to honor its commitments under the partnership, and reserving the right to take legal action against the Chinese company to recover consequent losses.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/01/sunrise-brief-net-zero-carbon-for-less-than-the-cost-of-a-cup-of-joe-heres-how/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 1, 2021",Sunrise brief: Net zero carbon for less than the cost of a cup of Joe? Here’s how,"Reaching zero net emissions of carbon dioxide from energy and industry by 2050 can be done by rebuilding U.S. energy infrastructure to run primarily on renewable energy, and at a net cost of about $1 per person per day. That’s according to research published by the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the University of San Francisco, and the consulting firm Evolved Energy Research.
The researchers say they modeled the entire U.S. energy and industrial system to produce a detailed, peer-reviewed study of how to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050.
In doing so, they developed multiple technology pathways that they say are feasible and that differ widely in terms of fossil fuel use, land use, consumer adoption, nuclear energy, and bio-based fuels use. By methodically increasing energy efficiency, switching to electric technologies, using solar and wind power, and deploying a “small amount of carbon capture technology,” the United States can reach zero emissions by the middle of the century.
The authors wrote in the scientific journal AGU Advances, and were supported in part by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, an initiative of the United Nations.
Decarbonizing the U.S. energy system “is fundamentally an infrastructure transformation,” said Berkeley Lab senior scientist Margaret Torn, one of the study’s lead authors. She said that means that by 2050 the U.S. needs to build many gigawatts of wind and solar power plants, new transmission lines, a fleet of electric cars and light trucks, millions of heat pumps to replace conventional furnaces and water heaters, and more energy-efficient buildings while continuing to research and innovate new technologies.
In this transition, very little infrastructure would need “early retirement,” or replacement before the end of its economic life. “No one is asking consumers to switch out their brand-new car for an electric vehicle,” Torn said. Instead, efficient, low-carbon technologies would be used when it comes time to replace the current equipment.
The pathways studied have net costs ranging from 0.2% to 1.2% of GDP. Higher costs result from tradeoffs, such as limiting the amount of land given to solar and wind farms. In the lowest-cost pathways, about 90% of electricity generation comes from wind and solar. One scenario showed that the U.S. could meet all its energy needs with 100% renewable energy (solar, wind, and bioenergy), but at a higher cost and greater land use.
In the least-cost scenario to achieve net-zero emissions of CO2 by 2050, wind, solar, and battery storage capacity would have to increase several-fold. Vehicles would need to be mostly electric, powered either by batteries or fuel cells. And residential space and water heaters also would need to be electrified, powered either by heat pumps or electric heaters.
The researchers said the cost of the transformation is lower than what similar studies showed just five years ago. The main reason, Torn said, is that the cost of wind and solar power and batteries for electric vehicles “have declined faster than expected.”
EDF Renewables North America said that its Desert Harvest 1 (114 MW) and Desert Harvest 2 (100 MW) solar projects have entered service in California.
Desert Harvest 1 provides electricity to MCE under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement, while Desert Harvest 2 supplies energy and renewable attributes to Southern California Public Power Authority under a 25-year Renewable Energy Credit + Index structure contract.
The Federal Bureau of Land Management designated the area where the projects are located as a Solar Energy Zone and Development Focus Area, land set aside for utility-scale renewable energy development. Both projects consist of horizontal single-axis tracking solar photovoltaic technology. Desert Harvest 2 includes a 35 MW, 4-hour energy storage system.
EDF Renewables’ Asset Optimization group will perform operations and maintenance services for the life of the project. The group will provide NERC compliance support, remote monitoring, and balance-of-plant management to maximize power production.
