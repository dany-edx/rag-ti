Driven by lowered costs, clean energy goals, and a gravitational shift in global capital toward renewables, solar and wind energy are expected to carry the torch left behind by coal, oil, and gas.
Technology adoption often follows a model called the S-curve, where exponential growth is experienced as a technology takes over as the highest-demand available option. This exponential growth ends when a preferable alternative technology is made available and the legacy technology plateaus in demand.
Bond said that this has already happened for fossil fuels in the electricity sector. In fact, his analysis shows that fossil fuels in the electricity sector reached peak demand and is now bouncing along a plateau before its inevitable decline in the back half of the decade.
According to RMI research, fossil fuel demand for electricity has peaked in 95 % of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and 31% of the non-OECD countries excluding China. China is on track to reach its 2030 solar and wind deployment targets by 2025, meaning the nation has also likely approached its peak in fossil fuel demand.
RMI said OECD demand for fossil fuels peaked in 2007, coal demand in 2013, industrial demand for fossil fuels as energy peaked in 2014, and internal combusion engine car demand in 2017. By 2019, 58% of the world experienced peak fossil fuel demand. In 2019, renewables met 85% of the growth in energy demand.
“Electricity is the largest demand sector for fossil fuels,” said Bond. “The peak here marks a key turning point in the energy transition and gives us hope that we can hit the goals of the Paris Agreement.”
The research is part of an ongoing series of reports tracking the energy transition called Peaking: The Series.
The report demonstrates how change increases over time, often leading to exponential growth. In 2011, the world struggled to sell 29 GW of expensive solar panels, in 2021 it deployed 182 GW, and by 2031 the industry is gearing up to sell 1,000 GW, said RMI.
“Putin’s War, the desire for domestic energy sources, and high fossil fuel prices only add to the pressure to change,” said Bond. “When we add up deployments in solar, wind, EVs, heat pumps, and hydrogen, we expect clean technology deployment over the course of this decade to replace four times as much fossil fuel demand as it did in the past decade.”
Bond said efficiency is another driver in the transition. Fossil fuels are relatively inefficient, requiring 10% of their energy to extract and process them, and up to two thirds of the available energy is lost in thermodynamic losses. Renewable technologies offer greater efficiencies. An electric vehicle uses about one quarter of the amount of energy as an internal combustion engine, solar is 2.5 times more efficient than coal, and a heat pump uses three times less energy than a gas generator.
“As these superior solutions enter the market in size, they will increase global efficiency gains by nearly 1 % a year and drive primary energy demand growth toward zero,” said Bond.

The exponential growth of renewable energy is currently underway. By 2024, renewable energy capacity is expected to be twice that of the total cumulative installed capacity in 2019.
Meanwhile, global analysts are joining RMI in the conclusion that fossil fuels have already passed their heyday. DNV of Norway was the first mainstream forecaster to make this conclusion, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) argued in its 2022 World Energy Outlook that the fossil fuel plateau has been reached.
“The stone age did not end for want of stones, nor the horse age for lack of horses,” said Bond. “The fossil fuel age of hunting for finite fossil stocks is giving way to the renewable age of farming infinite renewable flows. Superior renewable technology is winning the battle for the future of energy, and it is time to recognize this key turning point. Countries, companies, and investors that accept and embrace the energy transition will prosper, while those that deny and resist will struggle and eventually fall.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/16/freyr-battery-signs-10-gwh-plus-battery-agreement/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,GEORGIA,NORWAY",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 16, 2023",FREYR Battery signs 10 GWh plus battery agreement,"FREYR Battery signed an offtake agreement to supply Impact Clean Power Technology, a manufacturer of EV and stationary battery systems, with 10 to 14 GWh of batteries.
Under the terms of the five-year agreement, FREYR will supply batteries using the 24M Technologies SemiSolid lithium iron phosphate platform beginning in 2025. Batteries will be produced from FREYR’s Mo i Rana, Norway Gigafactory for use in Impact’s E-Mobility products for commercial vehicles, among other applications.
“Following today’s announcement, FREYR’s portfolio of offtake and long-term sales agreements now exceeds 130 GWh of production in both energy storage and E-Mobility markets through 2030, which demonstrates our growing commercial presence globally,” said Tom Einar Jensen, co-founder and chief executive officer of FREYR. “Commercial vehicles could generate more than 1 TWh of cumulative battery demand on a stand-alone basis by 2030 in Europe and the U.S. to comply with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.”
“We sought a sustainable LFP producer in Europe that could supply our facility in Warsaw, aiding us in meeting the growing demand for batteries in the E-Mobility space. In FREYR, we have a like-minded partner that is dedicated to the decarbonization of important sectors like commercial transportation,” said Bartek Kras, CEO at Impact.
The contract between FREYR and Impact covers the period until 2030, with potential for further extension. The framework agreement is non-binding and may reach a value of $1.8 billion based on BNEF’s recent 2025 lithium price estimates and other conditions.
Since going public in July 2021, FREYR selected Coweta County, Georgia as the location of its multi-phase Giga America battery manufacturing facility that will produce 34 GWh with a $1.7 billion initial capital investment. The Georgia facility will bring more than 720 jobs and invest more than $2.6 billion through 2029. Production at FREYR’s Giga America facility is set for soft rollout in 2025, with global production of over 34 GWh batteries scaling up to 100 GWh by 2028. The company is evaluating supply agreements for Giga America with U.S. independent power producers.
FREYR’s first gigafactory, called Giga Arctic in Norway, is currently under construction with planned nameplate capacity of 29 GWh.
The company holds a long-term development partnership with 24M Technologies for the SemiSolid battery chemistry that provides for a 130 GWh market opportunity to supply batteries to the energy storage market under a co-licensing arrangement.  On January 10, the Department of Energy awarded 24M Technologies a $3.2 million grant under the $42 million Electric Vehicles for American Low-Carbon Living (EVs4ALL) program.  The funding incentivizes 24M’s sodium metal battery for the EV market using the ultra-thick SemiSolid battery cathode which does not require cobalt or nickel.
Since going public in 2021 on the NYSE, FREYR’s common stock traded up to $10.72 per share today, from $8.80 at the time of its listing, while the company trades for a $1.5 billion market capitalization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/16/lg-energy-solution-and-hanwha-group-partner-on-battery-development/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 16, 2023",LG Energy Solution and Hanwha Group partner on battery development,"LG Energy Solution signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with three  Hanwha Group companies to collaborate on battery manufacturing equipment and battery technologies for energy storage systems (ESS) and for specialty use. The three companies are Hanwha Solutions, owner of Qcells, Hanwha Corporation/Momentum, and Hanwha Aerospace.
The new partners will invest in establishing energy storage systems (ESS) battery production lines in the United States, and the two will work on maximizing synergies and expanding the application of batteries to future mobility fields such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM).
The collaboration will enable Qcells to secure a stable battery supply for the U.S. power grid market and especially for ESS batteries. Last week the company announced that it will invest more than $2.5 billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States.
As the largest investment in the U.S. solar industry, the project will make Qcells the first company to establish a fully-integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the U.S. The company aims to not only be a leading company in solar manufacturing, but also in engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), and ESS business development by securing stable battery supply and competitive product procurement.
With the MoU, LGES positions itself firmly in the U.S. market by reinforcing its business portfolio in three sectors: advanced automotive batteries, mobility and IT batteries, and ESS batteries.
LGES advanced into the field of ESS System Integration by establishing a new corporation, LG Energy Solution Vertech. Inc., which offers customers a streamlined approach to energy storage system integration and a secure battery supply chain through LGES.
In the new collaboration, LGES will also work closely with Hanwha Corporation/Momentum, an automation engineering solutions company. The expectation is that the companies will cooperate on businesses related to battery manufacturing equipment.
In August of 2022, LGES and Honda announced plans to invest $4.4 billion and establish a new joint venture manufacturing plant in the U.S. that is expected to have an annual production capacity of approximately 40 GWh. The pouch-type batteries produced at the new plant will be supplied exclusively to Honda facilities in North America.
In July 2022, LGES and GM announced a joint venture after securing a loan from the U.S. Energy Department intends to loan Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution, $2.5 billion to help finance construction of new lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan also constructing joint venture plants in North America with GM (three Ultium Cells plants) and Stellantis, and also plans to further expand the production capacities of its own facilities in Michigan, Poland and South Korea.
LGES will also collaborate with Hanwha Aerospace in developing special-purpose batteries for its Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and more.

The Pālā‘au Solar and Kualapu‘u Solar projects will be the first on the Molokai island, a 260 square mile island east of the Hawaii island, to offer a community-based renewable energy or CBRE to help lower the electric bills of low-to-moderate income customers.
The distributed generation projects, once complete, can meet 20% of Molokai’s energy needs by providing clean power to 1,500 island households.
HECO, the largest investor-owned utility serving Hawaii’s electric market, in March 2022 sent out requests for proposals to developers, companies, organizations or groups to form a subscriber organization of shared solar projects for the utility’s low- to middle-income customers.
Once negotiations of the 20-year contracts for Pālā‘au Solar and Kualapu‘u are finalized, Hawaiian Electric and Ho‘āhu will submit the applications to the Public Utilities Commission for approval.
Pālā‘au Solar includes 2.2 MW of solar paired with 10.1 MWh of battery energy storage. The project will be sited on HECO property adjacent to the company’s Pālā‘au Baseyard.
Kualapu‘u Solar includes a 250 kW solar system paired with a 1 MWh battery located at the Kualapu‘u Park and Community Center. The project’s solar array will be mounted on carport structures over an existing parking lot.
Shake Energy Collaborative, a woman-owned public benefit corporation, and Mana Pacific, were selected as project developers for the two projects.
“When Act 100 was passed in 2015 the intent was to ensure that the benefits of renewable energy generation were made more accessible to a greater number of residents who would otherwise be unable to directly participate in renewable energy production,” said Senator Lynn DeCoite. “These projects are promising steps towards our renewable energy future on the friendly isle.”
For more information about the Molokai projects, visit Ho‘āhu Energy’s website.
Elsewhere in Hawaii, HECO in November 2022 selected seven distributed generation solar projects on the islands of Hawaii Island, Oahu and Maui that will offer clean energy procurement to LMI households.
Nexamp is developing the seven community solar-plus-storage projects on the Hawaii (12.8 MWdc / 41.1 MWh storage), Maui (11.2 MWdc / 35.5 MWh storage) and Oahu (7.8MWdc solar only) islands.  On Oahu, the developer is partnered with MeLink Solar.
According to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Hawaii’s Community Power, which grades states based on community solar, net metering terms, PACE financing, community choice aggregation and various statewide tariffs and utility protocols, the state of Hawaii has a Grade C community power rating.
Hawaii scores in the middle because the state has some policies that continue to support local authority over consumer energy choice, according to the ILSR.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Hawaii rocketed to 17th place in the U.S. solar development market in 2021 from 32nd coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.55 GW of current PV installations as of mid-2022.
