With over 1,350 exhibitors showcasing their products and 500 of those being first-time exhibitors, the floor at the Venetian Convention Center felt like a sports stadium. Despite the vastness, there were gems around every corner.
Bila Solar – soon to be from Indianapolis – introduced a flexible solar panel set to be produced by middle of next year. Weighing a mere 17 pounds, the representatives said this unit works very well in scenarios where weight is a significant factor, such as warehouses with limited load capacity or structures that shouldn’t be pierced. Its flexibility also enables it to adapt to curved structures.

These 520 watt modules boast an initial efficiency of 19.3%. Measuring 7’3” in height and just under 4’ in width, their lightweight nature allows a whopping 1,120 units to be packed into a 40’ shipping container.  That’s an impressive 583,440 watts in total. The panels are manufactured by an Australian company owned by a Chinese firm.
American Storage Energy Innovations (AESI) showcased a 7.2 MWh energy storage unit, a bit larger in size than a shipping container. Although it requires on-site assembly, its energy density is among the highest observed on the show floor, and seem to have the highest capacity of any single energy storage unit on the show floor.
James Mongeau highlighted a standout feature: the absence of wires between the individual prismatic cells. Instead, bars conduct the electricity. Furthermore, if a cell does need replacement, an entire row of parallel-connected cells is removed simultaneously. Thanks to the parallel connections, other interconnected cells remain unaffected.
Erthos caught a lot of attention with their solar module-cleaning robot.
The company, which mounts solar right on the ground, recommends one robot for every 2 MW of solar modules. The robots are self-powered, and charge during the day and clean up to 1 MW of modules overnight. An Erthos kit includes the robot, its charging station, perimeter concrete bricks, metal cables beneath the system, and custom-framed solar modules to facilitate cable connections.
Recently, Erthos announced a 180 MW project in Mississippi, implying the deployment of 90 of their robots. pv magazine USA suggested that the company share a video featuring all of these robots running at the same time, with lights on and at night, as they clean the modules. The company says it is currently working on 18 projects, two of which exceed 100 MW.
3Sun showcased the highest efficiency module that pv magazine USA encountered: a 25% commercial unit. However, these aren’t yet available for the general public. For now, 3Sun primarily supplies to its parent company, Enel, from its 200 MW manufacturing facility in Italy.

However, change is on the horizon. Next year, 3Sun’s Oklahoma-based manufacturing facility will begin operations, potentially producing up to 6 GW annually once later phases are fully built. An intriguing possibility mentioned was the production of a perovskite solar panel atop the company’s existing heterojunction panel as part of the second phase.
On a slightly different note, thanks to Lisa Ann Pinkerton of Technica Communications, several of us from the press had the opportunity to view the Sphere from a unique vantage point. While not a direct solar product, the Sphere’s LED illumination echoes the energy-saving advancements that have significantly cut electricity use both in the U.S. and globally. It’s a vivid reminder that the most cost-effective electricity is the kind we never use to begin with.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/19/california-legislature-passes-highway-side-solar-bill/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",California legislature passes highway-side solar bill,"The California Assembly unanimously approved SB 49, followed shortly by passing the Senate in a concurrence vote. Senator Josh Becker’s bill supports the buildout of solar, storage, and transmission projects alongside California highways.
If passed by Governor Newsom, the law would require that California agencies evaluate highway sides and right-of-way locations for clean energy projects. The state targets 90% clean electricity by 2035 and 100% by 2045.
The bill requires the state’s transportation department Caltrans to evaluate the issues and policies impeding the development of land within department-owned rights-of-way for renewable energy generation facilities, energy storage facilities, and electrical transmission and distribution facilities, as specified.
With solar jumping from 2,609 GWh to 48,950 GWh in the past decade, and coal nearly completely phased out, data from the California Energy Commission showed that the state is on the path to achieving its goal of being carbon neutral by 2045.
In just over 20 years, the Governor’s office projects a need for an additional 148 GW to meet California’s clean energy demand.
This represents a growth of 400% over the next two decades, a tall order, but one that is achievable for the frontrunner in clean energy technologies nationwide. Already, California surpassed targets of a 33% share for renewable energy, has reduced emissions below 1990 levels, and has sold over 1.5 million electric vehicles. As of 2021, 59% of the state’s electricity comes from zero-carbon sources.
Thoughtful planning of solar project siting can save useful land, protecting farmlands, habitats, and other land uses. A report from Environment America based on analysis from Georgia-based nonprofit The Ray shows that the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Diego in California have 4,800 acres of suitable solar project space alongside its highways and rights-of-way.
These spaces are advantageously located alongside infrastructure and are otherwise unused. The sites could host over 960 MW of solar capacity, generating 1,960 GWh per year. This is roughly equivalent to the electricity demand of 270,000 California homes.
“California can utilize the results of our solar analysis tool to prioritize the most promising spaces for solar panels in the state’s vast rights-of-way, and generate a wealth of clean electricity in the process,” said David Peters, western regional manager, The Ray.
California has more than 75,000 lane miles of state and federal highways, leaving the door open for clean energy development that is conscious of land use and strategically located near infrastructure.
“This new analysis makes a strong case for utilizing land along California’s highways to generate clean energy,” said state Sen. Josh Becker. “If just three counties have this much solar potential alongside their highways, imagine our entire state’s potential. Let’s make better use of the available roadside land at our disposal.”

The York County, South Carolina facility is a 785,000 square foot site that is expected to host over 850 jobs.
The annual production capacity will include 1 GW of cell production and 1.2 GW of additional module production capacity. Operations are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2024, adding critical cell production capacity, a current bottleneck in the U.S. solar supply chain.
The Coordinating Council for Economic Development approved job development credits related to the project and awarded a $2 million Set-Aside grant to York County to assist with the costs of building improvements.
“Silfab Solar selecting York County for a project that requires a highly skilled workforce shows that our workforce development investments are paying off in a big way. Our people are South Carolina’s greatest resource, and we are confident they will help Silfab Solar thrive in its latest venture,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster.
The company also recently signed a major supply agreement with Norwegian ingot and wafer producer NorSun. Silfab will purchase solar wafers for cell production from NorSun’s planned 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility in the U.S.
New modules
Silfab debuted several new module products at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas. The residential and commercial TOPCon modules will be available starting in Q1 2024.
TOPCon is another milestone in Silfab’s ongoing commitment to innovation and technological advancements to meet growing demand for high-quality, made-in-America PV solar,” said Paolo Maccario, Silfab President and CEO. “Silfab continues to make significant investments in people, facilities, processes, materials and technology that ensure the North American solar industry has an ethically sourced and reliable U.S. solar module partner.”

In opening remarks, Senator Jon Ossoff gave commendations to panel manufacturer Qcells for its “steadfast investment in and belief in Georgia,” the Senator’s home state and host to a new $2.5 billion vertical solar ingot-to-module factory. Ossoff noted it has been known for decades that “we’re destroying our only habitat” while allowing American manufacturing infrastructure to crumble. By contrast to this erosion of U.S. manufacturing, Ossoff argued, the IRA and other legislation has been transformative on a number fronts.
“We passed the most significant U.S. infrastructure plan since the Eisenhower administration… the most significant investment in combat and climate change in the history of humanity, right here in the United States.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, then stepped to the microphone, heralding the “new era of American energy. As a result of the IRA, she said the United States solar and solar industry will add $565 billion to our economy over the next decade while creating another half a million jobs along the way.
Ross Hopper had four key points, with action items.
Ross Hopper concluded with:
 Welcome to the new era of affordable, abundant and homegrown energies. Now let’s get to work.
Coming to America
With nearly 70 companies already expected to set up solar manufacturing in the U.S., several more announced during RE+ 2023 plans or enhancements to plans. The following offers a look at just a few of those announcements:
Trina Solar announced it is investing more than $200 million in property and equipment for a manufacturing facility in Wilmer, Texas. The facility will produce 5 GW of Vertex solar modules using 210 mm large size wafers, with production expected to begin in 2024. Trina reports that it will source polysilicon from the U.S. and Europe.
SEG Solar, maker of TOPCon solar modules, announced that it is setting up a module manufacturing facility in Houston with plans for production to begin in March 2024. Future plans include manufacturing both cell and ingots in the U.S.
Kinematics, a specialist in intelligent motion control systems used in solar trackers announced not only a new product–the Kinematics ONE—an all-in-one controller and actuator solution, but that it will be setting up manufacturing in the U.S.
LG Energy Solution announced that it will produce 16 GWh of batteries in a new manufacturing facility to be located in Queen Creek, Arizona, with production expected to start in 2026. Furthermore, the company stated that it has undertaken a major initiative to manufacture the entire battery supply chain in the U.S., making its products IRA-compliant. The company said it is also considering further expansion depending on demand and market conditions.
Heliene, a solar module maker from Canada, opened a 500 MW manufacturing facility in Mountain Iron, Minnesota in 2022. In August the company announced that Nexamp ordered 1.5 GW of modules from Heliene, and now the company is announcing the opening of an additional 500 MW plant at its existing facility in Minnesota. 
Distributed solar weathering storm, leaning on storage
Pairing a rooftop solar array with batteries is increasingly the strategy of successful businesses. This shift was evidenced by the multitude of new home batteries and hybrid inverters on display at RE+ this year. Battery sellers now lean on the ability of the device to enable “self-consumption,” ensuring the homeowner uses its solar production, rather than selling it to the utility company for pennies on the dollar.
In an EnergySage survey, nearly 40% of consumers reported self-supply as a reason for getting a storage quote, up from less than 20% in 2022. Backup power for outages and savings on utility rates were also listed as top reasons for including energy storage in a quote.
Batteries drive up the overall sticker price for a residential solar project, but installers remain optimistic that leveraging the additional benefits of energy storage will allow the bruised sector to keep growing. EnergySage said the average estimated payback period for residential solar is 8.3 years, averaging 10.4 kW. In other nations, rooftop solar markets have survived and even thrived with much longer estimated payback periods. As the U.S. moves along the technology adoption curve and more consumers are comfortable and interested in solar, installation growth is expected to persist.
“While the first half of 2023 was tumultuous at times for the solar and storage industries in the U.S., we remain optimistic: solar and storage have proven to be resilient in the past, surviving–and even excelling–irrespective of expiring tax credits and incentives, changing net metering policies, shifting tariffs, supply chain issues, and labor shortages,” said Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive officer and founder, EnergySage.
Residential solar had a record 1.8 GW of installations in Q2 2023 as Californians rushed to secure more lucrative export compensation rates under net energy metering (NEM) 2.0, which transitioned to NEM 3.0 in April. Wood Mackenzie said it expects the installation surge to continue through Q3, beginning to taper off in Q4.
Uncertainties abound
While the headline figures and the announcements make for encouraging reading, there are persistent uncertainties regarding the buildout of American clean technology manufacturing. 
Short-term market conditions are less-than-ideal for new market entrants and getting worse. PV cell and module oversupply is the prevailing dynamic and while price declines are somewhat slower in being passed onto the U.S. market, it is occurring. 
Investment bank Roth noted in one of its Solar Snapshot notes during RE+ that PV module pricing as low as $0.25/Wp was confirmed by one tier-1 US supplier. While this remains above both European and Chinese spot module pricing, it represents a sizable decline. 
Battery energy storage products are also getting cheaper. Roth confirmed pricing at-or-below $200/kWh, which is well down from $350/kWh seen “not long ago.”
There is also some skepticism regarding the IRA and whether it will be able to deliver the long-term support required to manufacturers – particularly given the global oversupply market dynamic. This presents a challenge to manufacturers as to how they can establish facilities that could potentially be competitive without subsidies. 
In terms of technology, remaining competitive requires adopting technology that is the cutting edge of both cost and performance. TOPCon appears to be the dominant technology, according to equipment supplier reports at RE+, although one prospective U.S. manufacturer is placing requests for mono PERC production lines. Perovskites remain only a distant priority on manufacturers roadmaps. 
Uncertainty was also commonplace among attendees at RE+ – particularly when it came to tradeshow floor logistics. Many reported experiencing difficulties in navigating the trade show floor, with the booth numbering system and signage anything but clear. 
This confusion was further hampered by a lack of on-site wifi on day one of the event. Rumors were that the main venue, the Venetian convention center, had demanded an eye-watering $50/user for the wifi to be switched on. The final price paid for the crucial navigational tool wasn’t disclosed, but thankfully there was wifi-for-all on the second and third day of the event.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/19/center-for-model-policy-development-brings-unity-to-clean-energy-transition/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",Center for Model Policy Development brings unity to clean energy transition,"With the undeniable momentum from last weeks’ RE+ 2023 trade show in Las Vegas, which boasted big names like Van Jones, Kal Penn, and Senator Jon Ossoff, a staggering 41,000 attendees, and a record number of exhibitors showcasing products, it would be understandable if you overlooked yet another pivotal moment signaling the continued maturation of the renewables industry.
On Tuesday of last week, the Solar and Storage Industries Institute (SI2), a non-profit research, policy analysis and education organization, launched the Center for Model Policy Development, a new effort to help harmonize state policymaking around barriers to clean energy deployment.
It’s important to remember that the growth and acceptance of renewable energy hasn’t been without its detractors. For years, fossil fuel and natural gas advocates have used a multi-pronged strategy to maintain their stranglehold on the energy market. They’ve lobbied to downplay the potential of renewables, funded campaigns that spread misinformation about their viability, and used their deep pockets to influence state policies that stymie the growth of clean energy. It’s an old playbook, familiar to any emerging industry facing resistance from entrenched interests. Now, however, the stakes are monumentally high. Our planet is at a tipping point, with extreme weather-induced disasters and avoidable grid shortfalls becoming an all-too-regular part of our news cycle. There’s an urgent need to transition to sustainable energy, and any delay not only jeopardizes our environment but also our collective future.
Given this backdrop, it’s all the more essential for the renewable energy sector to have a unified front, especially in policy matters. As the saying goes, “A house divided cannot stand,” and certainly not when faced with the vested interests of the fossil fuel lobby and the pressing timeline of the climate crisis.
In the 1930s, Justice Brandeis in a dissent opinion helped popularize the idea that states should be laboratories of democracy. In his view, states should try novel experiments in policy making. These attempts have little risk to the rest of the country if they don’t work.
While state innovation has been a hallmark of American federalism, ,50 states developing their own approaches to solving every problem related to the clean energy transition is impractical and time consuming. It would also be a big headache for solar and storage firms.
As a former colleague of mine liked to say about the climate crisis “time is our least renewable resource.” To add more clean energy to the grid, we don’t have the luxury of waiting three to five years to see what approaches are going to work. And 50 different approaches will slow down deployment.
In response, the Institute’s new Center will propose different policies relevant to state and local governments and provide bill templates for consideration by state leaders. They are intended to be a resource for state-based renewables organizations, advocates for decarbonization, officials in Governor’s offices, and state legislators and their staff.
To be clear, based on unique geographical, political, and infrastructural nuances, each state’s journey to clean energy will exhibit certain distinct features. However, the templates offered by the Center are intended to provide a foundation, a starting point – facilitating state leaders and advocates to jump-start pivotal discussions. These documents can help inform the best ways to responsibly recycle solar panels at the end of their useful lives or encourage faster ways for local government to permit rooftop solar projects.
For example, our first model policy is intended to clarify the role of local governments in large-scale solar permitting. To encourage uniformity of permitting within a state, and to prevent local governments from establishing hundreds of different sets of requirements that slow down clean energy deployment, this model policy establishes baseline standards and processes, such as uniform set back requirements.
This first model policy recognizes that local governments have discretion to adopt their own conditions provided that whatever they finalize cannot be more restrictive than the state policy. Therefore, this model policy — to be adopted by state legislatures — is intended to enumerate the responsibilities of local governments, recommend timeframes for executing permits, and provide direction on other solar permitting matters.
Over the coming years, we intend to tackle other key issues like what happens to panels at the end of their useful lives, what environmentally responsible project decommissioning looks like, and what’s next for net metering.
The Center for Model Policy is intended to be a hub for partnership and collaboration, so feedback and suggestions are critical to its success. Periodically, the Center will make adjustments to the model policy documents to reflect comments by stakeholders in the field. The Center’s next model policy, following extensive peer review, will be unveiled in the coming months.
As we move forward, it’s imperative to remember the weight of the climate crisis we’re facing, and the role that renewables play in our collective response. The overwhelming presence and initiatives highlighted at the RE+ 2023 trade show serve as reminders of the solar and storage sector’s advancements and potential. Now, more than ever, we need unity and clarity in our approach. Our progress today will determine the world we leave behind, and with collaborative efforts, timely action, and a shared vision, we’re poised to set the stage for a sustainable future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/19/what-causes-batteries-to-degrade/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",What causes batteries to degrade?,"From pv magazine global
Amid wide battery variety, each cell type and sub-species of device has unique vulnerability to degradation, influenced by usage and other factors. Some cells thrive at low temperature, others excel at high currents. Such specialization, however, often comes at a cost.
Battery aging is either related to time (in cases of calendar or “calendric” aging) or to usage, with charging and discharging representing “cyclic” aging.
Both forms of aging contribute to capacity and efficiency fade and increasing internal resistance as ions become trapped in unpleasant side-reactions for good. These reactions are driven by various “influencing factors.” Typically, ions react irreversibly with other materials in the cell, forming passive residue and preventing their use for energy transport.
Common influencing factors – whose impact varies by cell type – include the temperature of battery cells; device state-of-charge (SOC); and the current, or power, used during charging and discharging. Regarding state-of-charge – the amount of charge, or energy, in a battery – idle SOC matters when a battery is not in use and the SOC window (the range in which cycling occurs) is relevant when a device is cycling.
Mechanical stress, such as vibration and pressure, is another influencing factor in battery degradation but we’ll focus on the three factors above for now.
Temperature
Temperature plays a pivotal role in battery life. Most cell chemistries benefit from storage and idling at low temperatures, below 20 C (68 F), as that slows calendric aging by reducing the chance of side reactions. Idling at higher temperatures can greatly increase the degradation rate.

Conversely, most cell technology is very sensitive to low-temperature operation, causing a dilemma. With more than 30 C to 40 C (86 F to 104 F) being less than optimal, the sweet spot for battery cell operation is around 15 C to 25 C (59 F to 77 F), for most chemistries. Newer nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC)-based batteries are very sensitive to low temperature charging and dangerous defects can occur if charging at lower than 10 C. In the graph to the left, showing three high-quality NMC cells of the same type, the rate of degradation is slightly improved by reducing the operating temperature by 10 C (50 F), from 25 C (77 F) (the orange line) to 15 C (59 F) (violet line). Going 10 C lower (blue line), however, would crash the battery almost immediately.
Lithium plating
Lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries are generally safe but under certain conditions – in cold temperatures, under high current, or with an already well-filled host electrode – they can experience lithium plating. The example above showcases the impact of plating at low temperature. Plating is a form of residue that occurs when lithium ions form metal deposits inside battery cells. Over time, this process can accumulate and eventually lead to internal short circuits that might trigger a thermal runaway – a rapid and dangerous release of heat and gases.
It’s important to note the conditions which facilitate plating are only partially controllable by a battery management system (BMS). Operators must take responsibility for monitoring and maintaining their devices.
SOC
State of charge has a substantial impact on battery lifetime. Both idle SOC, during non-usage (which concerns calendric aging), and the SOC range or window during operation (cyclic aging) matter. The following example shows two identical NMC cells.
The graph below shows the degradation evolution of two almost identical use cases of a high-quality NMC cells.

Both use only around 50% of the battery, and the first use case (the blue line) does so in the upper half of the SOC, starting fully charged and falling to 50% before being fully charged again. The second use case (in orange) starts at 50% charged and ends virtually empty. As the graphs show, the impact on degradation is incredible: the orange battery will live two times to three times longer than the blue one, reducing total cost of ownership by more than half.
It should be stressed, however, this is an example of a particular cell type and other devices and cells may behave completely differently. As a rule of thumb, avoiding an SOC above 90% and below 10% generally extends battery life, but there are exceptions.
Battery stress levels
Assessing battery stress can be complex, even for experts, and can be affected by temperature changes, SOC ranges, and the profile of a device’s C-rate – its rate of discharge relative to maximum storage capacity. Such factors interact intricately with the susceptibility matrix of cell types. Stress level is a single number which gauges how stressful a battery usage profile is, compared to a reference case.
A stress level of 1.0 indicates usage is roughly as stressful as planned, 2.0 suggests a device will degrade about twice as fast as expected. Tools such as battery diagnostics automatically analyze stress levels, helping risk assessment and optimizing usage profiles.
BMS’
There’s an ongoing debate about whether BMS’ should control influencing factors to maintain battery health. BMS’ can prevent particularly damaging and dangerous usage but don’t typically provide recommendations for optimizing stress levels.
Future batteries
The global battery trend toward higher energy density for longer ranges often comes at the cost of reduced device lifetime. Battery lifetime and safety margins have, on average, retreated in recent years. That means extra care should be taken when operating the most expensive degrading component of the energy transition. The susceptibility of all li-ion cell types to influencing factors should make us aware of the untapped optimization potential in many battery usage scenarios.
Importance of monitoring
The complexity of stress factors and battery usage cases highlighted above ensures simply counting cycles or logging a device’s age will not give a clear picture of its degradation. It is clear that regularly checking battery capacity and state of health is essential and we can see that slight adjustments to usage profiles can significantly reduce battery stress and extend asset lifetime by 10% to 50% or more.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/19/lithium-ion-battery-fire-in-california-energy-storage-facility/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",Lithium-ion battery fire in California energy storage facility,"A fire erupted on Monday inside a solar battery storage container  at the Valley Center Energy Storage Facility in northern San Diego County, California.
The fire occurred when a battery storage unit caught fire, according to Terra-Gen, owner of the energy storage facility.
The Valley Center Energy Storage Facility is a stand-alone 139 MW energy storage project located on a 7-acre property within a commercial-industrial zone. Homes and businesses within a quarter mile of the site were evacuated and a shelter-in-place order was in effect for anyone a half mile from the site. Terra-Gen issued a statement saying that the facility’s design systems are keeping the incident contained.
The energy storage facility houses lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) in racks within enclosures. Electricity is stored and discharged from the batteries to the inverter transformer located next to them, which converts the energy from DC to AC. The energy is delivered to the SDG&E Valley Center substation located one-third of a mile away. Terra-Gen contracted with San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) to provide power under a 15-year Resource Adequacy (RA) contract for up to 14,000 homes for four hours on a single charge..
Lithium NMC batteries have been known to cause fires, explosions, arc flashes, electric shocks from the energy storage systems can expose workers and area residents to toxic chemicals. The McMicken fire is an often cited incident that occurred in  2019 in Arizona when an Arizona Public Service (APS) battery failure and corresponding explosion left eight firefighters and one police officer hospitalized. Insights from that fire are reflected in the 2023 National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 855 code revision. American Clean Power recently published a guide for first responders on lithium-ion battery energy storage system emergencies that takes the new code into account.
The Valley Center facility has been online since March 2022, and this is reportedly the second fire at the location. The first occurred in March of this year when a faulty sprinkler system caused the decommissioning of LG batteries.
The California Public Utilities Commission recently approved a plan to add more than 25.5 GW of renewables and 15 GW of storage by 2032, at a cost of $49 billion. The purpose of ramping up battery energy storage is to prevent power outages, help stabilize the grid, and help with peak power demand, all especially important in an area prone to high heat and wildfires. SDG&E is reportedly nearing approximately 300 MW of its own energy storage and Pacific Gas & Electric is also moving quickly to ramp up its battery resources.
According to Terra-Gen, the Valley Center project also provided economic benefits amounting to tens of millions of dollars in the form of direct and indirect jobs associated during construction and increased property taxes.
