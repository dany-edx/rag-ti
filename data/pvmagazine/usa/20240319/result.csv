Homeowners with SolarEdge projects installed before June 30, 2022, excluding Home Hub customers, are offered several upgrade options through the Re-Energize program. The company said installers can add devices on the DC-side of the inverter, allowing for component installations with minimized main panel upgrade requirements.
The program offers promotional pricing for the company’s Home Hub inverter, which comes with a 12-year warranty and a 5-year data cell card that extends the ability of the home energy management system to connect to smart devices and appliances. The 5-year data card enables customers to connect to the company’s solar monitoring platform via their cellular plan.
Participants in Re-Energize are able to add more solar panels to their system, for up to 200% oversizing, add home battery backup, and connect home energy devices like EV chargers, load controllers, and more.
The company said the promotional program allows installers to re-engage existing customers with an incentive to upgrade their system.
SolarEdge said installers interested in the program can get involved with a three-step process. First, installers order the Re-Energize Home Hub inverter from a distributor, then, the company performs an upgrade on a qualified SolarEdge inverter. A document outlining eligible inverters can be found here. Installers then ship the replaced inverter back to SolarEdge, becoming eligible for the promotional pricing. An equipment return document is available for installers here.
Residential solar equipment providers like SolarEdge and Enphase have had a difficult year, with their stock prices shedding over 50% of their value. High interest rates, lowered demand, and equipment oversupply in Europe have dragged down earnings in the industry. In January 2022, SolarEdge announced it would cut about 900 jobs, or about 16% of its total workforce. One of its major competitors in Enphase also laid off 10% of its workforce.
Time-to-failure
The upgrade program gives homeowners the opportunity to get new equipment for one of the most failure-prone elements of their residential solar system. Researchers from the Bern University of Applied Sciences conducted an online survey to investigate the “time to failure” (TTF) for residential inverters. They have found that 34.3% of the devices experienced their first failures after 15 years.
“I would say this failure rate is acceptable, even good,” researcher Christof Bucher told pv magazine. “One assumes the inverter must be replaced once in the lifetime of a PV system.”
The survey included inverters from Fronius, Huawei, Kostal, SMA, SolarEdge, and Sputnik.
The survey showed that more than 65% of the inverters did not present yield-relevant faults by their 15th year of operation. The scientists said the TTF mainly depends on the manufacturer and a device’s location, with outdoor installations having shorter TTF rates.

The Avocet Energy Storage Project is located in Carson, California. It is expected to be operational in Q2 2026. Once complete, the project is expected to support the equivalent power demand of about 45,000 homes for four hours daily.
The project will make use of Tesla Megapack grid-scale batteries. The batteries will store energy during non-peak electricity demand hours, discharging power when it is needed most during peak demand.
As the mismatch between hours of peak renewable energy generation and peak electricity demand increases, energy storage is being pursued by electricity providers to balance the grid. This mismatch, sometimes referred to as the “duck curve” has been deepening in California, leading regulators to call for more energy storage capacity.
“Energy storage systems such as our Avocet Energy Storage facility reduce air pollution and contribute to grid reliability,” said Tommy Greer, executive vice president and chief commercial officer, Arevon.
The Avocet project is estimated to create 75 construction union jobs and disburse more than $35 million in property tax payments over its lifespan.
SDCP is the second-largest CCA in California, serving nearly 1 million customers in the San Diego area. This is the second such energy storage agreement the CCA has entered with Arevon Energy, adding to the 150 MW / 600 MWh Vikings Energy Farm, which commenced construction earlier this month.
“San Diego Community Power’s mission is to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers, and Arevon shares this commitment,” said Karin Burns, chief executive officer of SDCP. “The Avocet project will be a critical component to ensure that, not only are we adding energy storage to shift renewable generation to demand hours, but we are creating quality construction jobs that support the energy transition in our communities.”

“We need to deploy around 1.1 TW of renewable energy capacity per year by 2030. Every technology that provides a reduction in CO2 emissions is good, but technology neutrality may not be the solution, as only renewables ensure the necessary speed and scale to achieve the proposed targets,” said IRENA President Francesco La Camera, in reference to the slow pace at which nuclear energy is currently driving the global energy transition.
According to the official documents, 123 national governments and supranational blocs, including the European Union, have signed up to triple the world’s installed renewable energy generation capacity to at least 11 TW by 2030. The signatories also vowed to double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements, from 2% to 4%, until the end of 2030.
La Camera noted the importance of creating a workforce for the energy transition. He also discussed the need to create incentives to foster the emergence of a green hydrogen market and to develop grid infrastructure and interconnection sea cables for global energy trade.
In the Tracking COP28 Outcomes report, IRENA said that annual investments in renewable power generation must surge from $570 billion in 2023 to $1,550 billion on average between 2024 and 2030. The report also said that the proposed COP28  target will not be reached without urgent policy intervention.
“G20 nations, for example, must grow their renewable capacity from under 3 TW in 2022 to 9.4 TW by 2030, accounting for over 80% of the global total,” said IRENA.
The organization also said that wider international cooperation, as well as the strategic use of public finances, will be key to achieving the COP28 goals.
“This requires structural reforms, including within multilateral finance mechanisms, to effectively support the energy transition in developing countries,” it stated.

Innovation at material, cell, and system level has been just as important in lithium ion’s leap forward as supply chain development. Stationary energy storage cell design is trending toward large-format prismatic cells thanks to lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry. Lower costs, a longer cycle life, and better safety have seen LFP batteries eat into nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) market share since 2020. The energy density and charge rate offered by NMC devices has instead seen them favored for mobility uses.
New materials
Both offer room for development. Reducing cobalt and raising nickel content in NMC batteries offers lower costs and better energy density. LFP energy density can be improved by replacing some iron cathode material with manganese – for an LMFP cathode. This emerging technology shows great promise, as it provides roughly 15% to 20% more energy density, or up to 230 Wh/kg, while maintaining the same level of cost and safety as LFP batteries. Financial services firm Ernst & Young calculates that the costs of LMFP batteries are about 21% higher than that of LFP devices on a dollars-per-kilogram basis. Considering their higher energy density, however, the cost per watt-hour is 5% lower, making them much more economical.
Although LMFP batteries offer higher voltage and energy density than LFP, there are trade-offs. “There are issues with lower power capability and lower cycle life which arise from the lower electrical conductivity of LMFP compared to LFP, which limits the power capability; and the dissolution of the manganese into the electrolyte over cycling, which limits cycle life,” said John-Joseph Marie, energy storage analyst at British research body The Faraday Institution. As a result, Marie doesn’t see LMFP replacing LFP for short-duration storage. “If the issue of cycle life could be solved, LMFP could be a cost-efficient technology for longer storage durations, e.g. four to eight hours,” he said.
Moves toward mass production of LMFP batteries are picking up pace, though – especially in China. CATL, Eve, BYD, and Gotion – as well as South Korea’s Samsung SDI and United States-based Mitra Chem – are now at various stages of commercialization and are producing this technology. In mid 2023, Gotion High-Tech set a precedent for developing NMC-free batteries with a range that reached 1,000 km with the launch of its L600 Astroinno battery cell and pack, featuring LMFP chemistry. The Chinese manufacturer said its new battery technology, which has undergone a research period of 10 years, is scheduled to begin mass production in 2024.
On the anode side, graphite remains the go-to material with efforts made to boost its lithium-holding capacity by adding a small amount of silicon. The addition of silicon is an attractive proposition, as it would allow for almost 10 times more capacity, due to its theoretical capacity of 3,600 milliampere-hours per gram (mAh/g), compared to graphite’s maximum of 372 mAh/g. In 2023, Tesla reportedly added up to 5% of silicon to its graphite anodes via intermetallic alloying. Startups are even more bullish on the technology, with a few of them proposing 100% silicon anodes.
The advantage on the cost side is also pronounced. “Silicon anodes, including silicon composite anodes and pure silicon anodes, are expected to be cheaper to produce on a dollar-per-kilowatt-hour basis than the incumbent graphite anode technology, thanks to their much higher capacity,” said Marie.
London-based consultants Rho Motion have modeled the cost pathway for lithium ion cells using various evolutions of silicon anode up to 2030. The results showed that the current anode active material accounts for around 7% to 9% of total cell costs in NMC811 (80% nickel, 10% manganese, and 10% cobalt) and LFP chemistries, a figure which is expected to reduce to around 2% by 2030 with the adoption of optimized microsilicon at scale.
Silicon anodes are set to increase their market share. Analyst BloombergNEF says anode technology could lean on silicon, lithium, and hard carbon to displace 46% of graphite demand in 2035, compared to scenarios in which the market doesn’t shift away from graphite. While the analysts expect hard carbon used in sodium ion batteries to already start entering the market in 2024, lithium metal anodes are projected to start playing a more prominent role only beyond 2030.
Bigger, better
As the search for new battery materials continues, so does innovation on the cell level. In battery energy storage system (BESS) applications, however, cost remains the key driver for adjustments at cell level. The obvious way of bringing down bill-of-materials (BOM) costs is by increasing the capacity and size of cells. Another benefit is that fewer cells means less work for the battery energy management system. Finally, the number of connection points and the complexity of mechanical trays are also reduced, making manufacturing processes easier.
Several manufacturers have already transferred from 280 ampere-hour (Ah) to 300 Ah-plus cells, with larger capacities in the pipeline. With the former seen as a standard in utility scale storage projects in 2023, the 300 Ah-plus cells stand ready to power commercial projects in 2024. Christoph Neef, senior scientist and project manager at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, observed that the trend toward high-capacity cells does not come from the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where only cells up to 200 Ah are usually deployed.
“The reason is simple: the system sizes are rather small compared to industrial BESS’, e.g. only 70 kWh,” said Neef. “Nevertheless, a system voltage of more than 300 V or, in future, 800 V should be achieved. This is simply not possible with a few high-capacity cells connected in series. The effects of the failure of a single cell would also be incalculably high.”
In other words, 300 Ah-plus cells are a clear indication battery cell manufacturers are increasingly developing products tailored to the BESS market and slowly moving away from the dominance of EV-customized cells.
Most cell manufacturers offer 300 Ah-plus cells with the same dimensions as 280 Ah devices, which makes the job easier for system integrators when designing their products. Large cells pose a greater challenge for safety management, however – particularly in terms of ensuring temperature uniformity within cells.
“The larger the individual cell, the greater the impact if a cell fails,” said Neef. “However, we do not assume that this has any effect on the fire risk.” Large-format cells, with more than 300 Ah with LFP chemistry, are likely to exhibit similar behavior in the event of a short-circuit as smaller units. The impact on the long-term reliability of the system could be higher, however. Precise cell monitoring and predictive maintenance are becoming increasingly important as a result.
“What is very interesting, however, is that the production quality of cell manufacturers is now so high that large-format cells are also worthwhile from the point of view of rejects,” added Neef. “The larger the cell capacity, the higher the risk of defects, e.g. in the electrode, and therefore the higher the risk of producing poor-quality cells. Only with very low defect rates is the production of these large cells worthwhile. [It is] a sign of the maturity of the industry.”
System evolution
Such bigger cells have led to bigger capacities at the container level. Average capacities have moved from more than 3 MWh to more than 5 MWh for the same 20-foot-equivalent units. Such higher energy-density BESS’ come with a host of advantages. For instance, they make it possible to install bigger capacities on a smaller footprint and thus save on land use – a particularly important consideration in regions facing space constraints.
“Less number of cells per watt-hour also reduces assembly and packaging and saves cost during production processes,” said Anqi Shi, senior analyst for batteries and energy storage at S&P Global. “However, challenges occur in system design and safety measures as heat dissipation and consistent temperature is harder to achieve.”
Another pronounced development at the system level is the move from air cooling to liquid cooling. In 2023, many system integrators released new BESS products with liquid cooling, describing it as an upgrade in terms of efficiency and the lifespan of grid scale products. Compared to the previously ubiquitous air cooling method, liquid cooling is better geared to deal with temperature-related challenges and is able to reduce land footprint, with some manufacturers reporting saving more than 20% of floor area.
That technology uptake has been particularly pronounced in China, where the lion’s share of large scale energy storage project tenders require liquid cooling technology. Shi said liquid cooling is especially suitable for high energy-density BESS’, or for projects where fast charging and discharging, and wide ambient temperature changes, are expected. “However, while liquid cooling offers better heat dissipation efficiency and temperature uniformity inside the BESS, the cost is higher than air cooling and there could be a risk of coolant leakage,” added Shi.
Finally, a potential new trend could be the emergence of alternating-current, “AC blocks” – containers with both battery and power conversion systems (PCS’) integrated inside. That type of product was pioneered by Tesla, in the company’s 2022 Megapack redesign. “AC blocks offer easier and quicker installation on site, less land occupation, and decentralized (pack-level or rack-level) control of BESS’,” said Shi. “They come at a cost premium, mostly due to using string PCS’, but the cost could be reduced by scaling up production.”
Currently, only Sungrow and Tesla have AC blocks that are larger than 3 MWh in a single container. Other relatively newer players, including Rimac Energy and JD Energy, have less-than-1 MWh AC block containers which might not have the same land-use advantage. It is not yet clear whether AC blocks can become a mainstream trend. After all, not all system integrators have in-house PCS capability. As Shi noted, however, AC blocks give developers increased choice and further squeeze established players in an already fiercely competitive market.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/19/whats-in-store-for-storage/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-03-19,What’s in store for storage?,"From pv magazine print edition 3/24
The world gained 110 GWh of energy storage in 2023, up 149% from 2022. The scaling of demand in China, the United States, and Europe accounted for more than 90% of the global market.
In China, several provinces are strengthening storage policies to stimulate growth in utility-based, front-of-the-meter (FTM) storage. In the world’s largest energy storage market, China, storage capacity reached 52 GWh in 2023, up 229% year over year.
The United States experienced a bumpier ride. A shortage of transformers disrupted the energy storage industrial chain, while project approval procedures remained complicated, resulting in severe project and grid-connection delays. Policy made an impact, with a US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit significantly increasing the economic efficiency of storage projects. The United States gained 25.8 GWh of storage in 2023, up 112% year on year.
Europe gained 21.8 GWh of storage in 2023, up 117%, driven by residential and FTM projects. Residential batteries are still consuming surplus inventory. In Italy, the extension to the end of March 2023 for the 110% tax-deduction “superbonus” for renovations, saw home storage installations peak in the first quarter before falling markedly. Italy installed 2.7 GWh of storage in 2023, up 35% year on year.
Germany added 4.6 GWh of storage in 2023, for an annual rise of 142%. Batteries peaked in June before falling every month thereafter due to a sluggish economy, falling electricity prices, and a related fall in the home storage business case.
Policy reforms regarding the European Union power market are expected to push other European Union member states to include energy storage as part of their energy planning, which will further drive demand.
Big shipments
Some 196.7 GWh of battery cells were shipped in 2023, up 61% year on year. Utility-scale and commercial and industrial shipments were 168.5 GWh, up 67%. Small-scale-related shipments transported 28.14 GWh, up 27.9%. The market fell short of expectations for the high-season fourth quarter, with shipments up only 1.3% from July 2023 to September 2023.
Of the battery manufacturers, CATL remained dominant, with more than 70 GWh of cells shipped. BYD and Eve Energy both topped 25 GWh and REPT and Hithium both shipped more than 15 GWh. Those big five players cornered 76.7% of the market in 2023, up from 68.7% in 2022, thanks to successful cost controls. The battery companies ranked sixth to tenth shipped less than 10 GWh each in 2023, ensuring the top 10 accounted for 92% of the market, up from 86.7% in 2022. South Korean manufacturers Samsung SDI and LG shipped a total of almost 14 GWh in 2023, down 7% year on year.
Breaking down total battery cell shipments, CATL, BYD, Eve Energy, Hithium, and REPT were the top five for utility scale energy storage shipments in 2023, with CATL topping 65 GWh of shipments and its biggest rival less than 22 GWh. With utility-scale storage cell costs falling below CNY 0.40 ($0.06)/Wh, manufacturers with better cost control and financing can still invest in cell technology R&D. Amid increasing competition, big cell makers are introducing large capacity cells utilizing stacking technology and moving toward systems integrated with direct-current side energy storage, in order to differentiate their products.
Severe competition
CATL, REPT, Eve Energy, BYD, and Great Power shipped the most small-scale storage cells in 2023 and cornered 85.1% of the market, up from 84.7% year on year. Competition was severe. CATL, including ATL joint venture Ampace, held more than 25% of the market. Their chief competitors had 12% to 17% each. The market grew only 27.7% between 2022 and 2023, thanks to small-scale storage inventory pile-up. That slowdown is expected to last until late March 2024 or early April 2024, based on current inventory depletion, with shipments to pick up from June 2024.
Chinese companies made up the world’s top five battery cell makers in 2023, with LG and Samsung emerging as the only non-Chinese operators in the top 10. Shipment numbers for 2023 underscored the confidence of big manufacturers in overseas expansion. Chinese cell makers plan to develop about 579 GWh of annual production capacity overseas, according to InfoLink’s global lithium ion battery supply chain database. That includes 353.4 GWh from production lines in Europe and 144 GWh in the United States, as well as electric vehicles. InfoLink expects more than 250 GWh of cell capacity overseas from Chinese companies by 2026. The resulting market share grab will help Chinese companies to circumvent domestic manufacturing policies, which could put rivals from South Korea and other nations under pressure.
Looking ahead, as inventory levels gradually decrease, prices across the industrial energy storage supply chain will stabilize. That development, coupled with supportive policies, means InfoLink expects the global energy storage market to sustain growth at a medium to high pace. The global expansion of energy storage installations is projected to grow at a rate of 50% to 165 GWh per year, while energy storage cell shipments will expand by 35% to 266 GWh.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/19/systemic-barriers-that-stand-in-the-way-of-clean-energy-investment/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW YORK",,2024-03-19,Systemic barriers that stand in the way of clean energy investment,"As a serial entrepreneur and advocate for environmental stewardship, I’ve navigated the complexities of various industries, but few have been as challenging – or as rewarding – as the journey to establish a solar farm on Long Island; New York.
The Middle Island Solar Farm (MISF) stands today as a beacon of innovation and sustainability. Since its full operation in 2018, MISF has been generating 19.6 MW of electricity, equivalent to powering approximately 4,000 homes annually on Long Island.

Moreover, its clean energy output translates to removing the emissions of 6,000-8,000 cars from our roadways, a significant stride towards environmental sustainability. Witnessing the realization of my vision to utilize private investment for public welfare brings me immense satisfaction. However, the road to its success was fraught with obstacles that threatened to derail the project at every turn.
One of the most pervasive challenges we encountered was the Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) mindset prevalent in many communities. Despite the undeniable benefits of solar energy – including reduced carbon emissions and energy independence – local opposition often arises, fueled by fear and misinformation. Overcoming this resistance requires patience, perseverance, and a commitment to community engagement.
In addition to public perception, outdated zoning laws and bureaucratic red tape presented significant hurdles to the development of MISF. The arbitrary classification of solar farms as electric generating plants, coupled with convoluted regulatory processes, created unnecessary delays and added complexity to the approval process. Reforming these outdated laws and streamlining regulatory procedures are essential steps towards facilitating the growth of the renewable energy sector.
Furthermore, the influence of vested interests cannot be ignored. Established industries, threatened by the rise of sustainable energy, have wielded considerable power and resources to maintain the status quo. Lobbying efforts aimed at undermining clean energy initiatives perpetuate dependence on fossil fuels, hindering progress towards a greener future.
Despite these challenges, the case for clean energy investment remains stronger than ever. The economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy are undeniable, with solar power emerging as a viable alternative to traditional energy sources. However, realizing this potential requires a concerted effort to dismantle systemic barriers and create a more conducive environment for investment.
Education and community engagement are crucial components of this effort. By dispelling myths and highlighting the tangible benefits of clean energy projects, we can garner public support and overcome opposition. Moreover, fostering partnerships between government agencies, businesses, and local communities can help streamline the approval process and expedite the development of renewable energy infrastructure.
Additionally, policymakers must prioritize sustainability and incentivize investment in clean energy initiatives. By implementing policies that promote renewable energy adoption and phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, we can level the playing field and create a more equitable energy landscape.
As we confront the urgent challenges of climate change and environmental degradation, the need for decisive action has never been greater. By breaking down barriers to clean energy investment, we can pave the way for a brighter, more sustainable future for generations to come. It’s time to harness the power of innovation and collective action to build a world powered by clean, renewable energy. The time for change is now.

Fluke said it offers efficient and reliable array testing that can result in maximizing return on investment (ROI).
The new curve tracer can cut testing time with its scan rates, according to Fluke, and it can also be used with today’s high-efficiency solar modules. Designed for ease of use, the tool offers intuitive operation and simple data analysis so it can be used for less experienced technicians, Fluke reports.

“Utilities are under increasing pressure to maximize up-time and production while ensuring the health and longevity of their solar installations,” said Jason Waxman, president of Fluke. “The PVA-1500 is a game-changer, delivering the speed, precision, and user-friendliness required for technicians to address these challenges head-on. It is the only I-V Curve Tester that can consistently and accurately measure I-V curves for 1500V high-efficiency solar panels without overheating.”
Fluke reports that it has undergone rigorous testing to ensure it meet the company’s high standards for reliability, durability and safety.
The PVA-1500 series addresses the time, accuracy, and usability challenges faced by technicians. It enables technicians to optimize PV array performance for maximum energy production, while minimizing downtime, Fluke reports. The tool is designed to maximize return on investment while ensuring the long-term reliability of the solar plant.
The PVA-1500 I-V curve tracers build upon Fluke’s September 2023 acquisition of Solmetric, including the company’s PV Analyzer. formerly Solmetric’s flagship product. The PV Analyzer has three primary components: the I-V unit, the SolSensor, and a user interface that operates on a tablet or laptop. The I-V unit and SolSensor function in tandem, assessing the I-V curve, irradiance, and temperature. With the new PVA-1500 I-V curve tracers in Fluke’s portfolio, the company now offers a comprehensive toolkit for solar professionals to service projects from distributed generation to the utility-scale.

This growth was built atop residential solar, which itself had more than doubled its deployed capacity. However, 2023 witnessed a slowdown in distributed generation’s growth, falling to 8% compared to 2022, with the fourth quarter experiencing a 7% contraction.
As the residential sector’s doldrums from the fourth quarter extend into 2024, the industry is left to ponder the extent of the potential contraction and whether commercial, industrial, and community solar segments will play a larger role in sustaining the market.

The Ohm Analytics’ Annual 2023 DG Solar and Storage Report revealed that in recent history, the residential sector has been the growth engine for the smaller (residential, commercial, industrial, and community solar) sectors. (These sectors differ from the ‘utility’ sector, which is larger than all distributed sectors combined and connects to the wholesale electricity market.) In Q4 2023, it was growth in smaller commercial and industrial sectors at 9%, and community solar at 3%, that softened the impact of residential falling by 12%.
Last year’s decline in residential solar was driven by rising interest rates, which forced slower moving finance companies out of business, and California’s decision to hit the brakes on net metering incentives. The switch to NEM 3 in California initially led to an increase in residential deployments as many rushed to submit applications before the April 14, 2023 deadline.
The fourth quarter slowdown was uneven across the nation, with states like Texas, Florida, and Arizona, which rely heavily on loans, being most affected. In contrast, northeastern states with higher costs continued to grow, with some partially developed states like New York and New Jersey growing by 20%, and early growth states like Pennsylvania seeing an 80% expansion.
Despite the challenges, with California’s NEM 3, a silver lining is emerging: the expansion of energy storage. Ohm noted that residential storage grew by 22% for all of 2023, with Q4 2023 seeing a strong 66% increase. This growth aligns with the fall in price of energy storage battery cells and the massive global expansion in 2023.
Roth MKM, informed by various industry inputs including Ohm Analytics consultations, anticipates more weakness in the residential solar sector in 2024. Initially, Roth predicted a 12% residential decline, but in January, they revised this to a potential 15% drop due to further declines in California (which were then ranging from 30% to possibly 50%). Now, without a turnaround by May or June, Roth believes the residential solar sector could fall by 20 to 30% from its 6.5 GW of deployed capacity in 2023.
