With the variability of intermittent cycles of electricity generation provided by these sources, energy storage is needed to ensure a stable, balanced supply. 
Demand response programs, distributed home batteries, vehicle-to-grid storage, community level batteries, and many other technologies will play a role in balancing the variable renewables-dominated grid. Along with these technologies is the rise in demand for long duration energy storage (LDES), which typically can store and dispatch electricity for six hours or more. 
A report from IDTechEx modeled growth with LDES, projecting that there may be a $223 billion global market by 2044. 
The report noted this market growth will happen at different rates regionally. For instance, if California reaches its clean energy targets for 2035, it will have a 280% increase in the capacity of renewable energy compared to a 2023 baseline. Other key countries and U.S. states expected to see rapid growth of VRE deployments include Germany, the UK, Italy, Australia, India, and Texas, said the report. 
“Increased VRE penetration will result in longer periods of time when energy is unavailable from these sources, and thus, LDES technologies will be required to dispatch energy over these longer timeframes,” said the report. 
IDTechEx said that once a country or state’s electricity from VRE sources reaches about 45% of the energy mix, the average duration of storage of six hours or more becomes the most cost-optimal option. The report said this 45% threshold will be met on average globally by the late 2030s, though the previously-mentioned hot markets are expected to reach the milestone sooner. 
Aside from pumped hydrogen, which is dependent on local running water sources, lithium-ion batteries dominate the global stationary energy storage market, said the report. However, IDTechEx notes that lithium-ion batteries are unlikely to have low enough capital costs for LDES applications. 
To achieve a lower cost-per-kilowatt-hour, IDTechEx recommends technologies that allow for energy and power decoupling. It said this role could be served by redox flow batteries (RFB). 
“To increase system capacity for RFBs, electrolyte volume and the size of electrolyte storage tanks can be increased, whereas changes to the cell-stack are only needed to increase power output,” said the report. 
IDTechEx said liquid-air energy storage (LAES) is another alternative that may come with cost advantages at scale. 
“For LAES, the size of liquid-air storage tanks can be increased, while turbomachinery only needs to be scaled with power output,” said the report. “This results in faster and non-linear decreases in CAPEX (on a $/kWh basis) for many of these LDES technologies as a function of duration of storage.”
Other technologies evaluated in the report include iron-air (Fe-air), rechargeable zinc batteries (Zn-air, Zn-ion, rechargeable Zn-MnO2, Zn-Br), high-temperature / molten-salt batteries, RFBs, (CAES), liquid-air energy storage (LAES), cryogenic / liquid-CO2 energy storage (LCES), alternative and underground pumped hydro storage (APHS), gravitational energy storage systems (GESS), thermal and electro-thermal energy storage (TES) and (ETES), and hydrogen.
The report’s author, Conrad Nichols, technology analyst, IDTechEx, will host a free webinar on Thursday, February 8 titled The Time for Long Duration Energy Storage is Coming. The registration link can be found here.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/05/increasing-alternative-energy-standards-would-bring-billions-in-investment-to-pennsylvania/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PENNSYLVANIA",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-05,Increasing alternative energy standards would bring billions in investment to Pennsylvania,"The governor of Pennsylvania has made a campaign pledge of 30% renewable energy by 2030. While 30% is not overly ambitious, three business groups crunched the numbers and found that, if enacted, more than $13.1 billion could be invested in Pennsylvania over the next seven years and 129,000 jobs could be created.
A coalition of approximately 100 clean energy groups urged Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro not to wait to expand the renewable energy requirements within the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS). The report by Advanced Energy United, MAREC Action, and American Clean Power Association, examined potential economic and jobs benefits of the proposed increase in renewables.
“Clean energy can be a massive money-maker and job-creator for Pennsylvania, but only if elected officials take action,” said Nick Bibby, Pennsylvania State lead for Advanced Energy United. “This report’s findings hammer home just how much Pennsylvania’s economy has to gain from clean energy—and what we’re missing out on as our policies lag further and further behind neighboring states.”
The AEPS was enacted into law in 2004 but its renewable energy requirements plateaued in 2021, after requiring that just 8% of the state’s electricity come from renewable energy sources that year. Nearby states have much more aggressive goals: New Jersey 50% by 2030, New York 70% by 2030, and Maryland 50% by 2030.
“Our new analysis shows that a modest increase of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard to 30% renewable energy by 2030 will return roughly $2 dollars in benefits to Pennsylvanians for every dollar invested,” said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action. “AEPS expansion will maximize deployment of new energy sources while maintaining a strong foundation of legacy energy industries—ensuring the Commonwealth can meet the challenge of rising electricity demand and that Pennsylvanians benefit from a balanced, resilient and clean energy mix for years to come.”
The report outlines economic as well as environmental benefits to the “30 by 30” plan, which includes jobs and investment into developing energy projects. According to the report authors, the modeling considers the level of expenditures related to each type of resource and the origin of the costs. For example, installation labor for a solar array is economically sourced in Pennsylvania while the panels themselves are sourced from outside of Pennsylvania and do not contribute to in-state benefits.
The report also finds an increase to the AEPS would reduce emissions, which it values at $6.5 billion, due to avoiding costs associated with the negative health and economic impact of toxic air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions.

Cost to ratepayers is estimated at “at most, $3.43 more per month for the average residential customer, compared to business as usual, with cost impact declining into the future”.
Even after accounting for this ratepayer increase, the report finds that the state would still realize net economic benefits of $8.3 billion from 2024 to 2035. When factoring in both economic and environmental benefits, the net total benefits are projected to be $11.2 billion.
Other benefits noted include insulating ratepayers from fossil fuel price spikes and a more predictable cost of electricity. Furthermore, the report authors urge the state to  take measures to protect low- and moderate-income households from ratepayer impacts,
“Pennsylvania’s long and storied leadership on energy development forms the bedrock for the region’s energy security, grid reliability, and economic resiliency. Governor Shapiro’s pledge to achieve 30% renewable energy sources by 2030 advances the Commonwealth’s historic energy leadership, making massive investments in the region’s future that will drive job creation, health benefits, and clean energy development for Pennsylvanians for decades to come,” said Moira Cyphers, director of eastern state affairs for American Clean Power. “Today’s report shows us that clean, affordable and reliable energy is the correct path for the future of the Keystone State.”

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/05/five-drivers-of-new-york-city-solar-energy-expansion/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-05,Five drivers of New York City solar energy expansion,"New York City faces unique challenges to meet its renewable energy goals, being a densely populated area with a robust built environment. Despite the challenges, the city is going all-in on solar with numerous supportive policies, changes in regulations, and programs to expand solar access. 
T.R. Ludwig, the chief executive officer of Brooklyn SolarWorks, an NYC-based installer, shared five ways that the city is driving growth in solar adoption.
1) City of Yes 
The City of Yes program is a broad change to New York City’s zoning regulations that seeks to modernize the city and make it more equitable and environmentally conscious. It has three major facets focused on housing opportunity, economic opportunity, and carbon neutrality.
The carbon neutrality section of the City of Yes program will remove existing zoning obstacles that severely limit how much space on a rooftop can be covered by solar panels, also known as setback requirements. It will also make it easier to install energy storage by loosening some of the strict zoning laws related to battery placement.
Among other changes, City of Yes is expected to open solar opportunities for more than 8,500 acres of parking lots across New York City. Ludwig said the changes present opportunities for rooftop solar development on more than 50,000 buildings and more than 1 million homes in NYC.
2) Property tax abatement
New York City has increased its property tax abatement from 20% to 30%. It covers 30% of solar panel installation costs by reducing property tax bills from the New York City Department of Finance incrementally for 4 consecutive years.
This is a tax abatement, which lowers the amount of property taxes owed by applying a credit.
3) Local Law 97
Local Law 97, taking effect this year, limits emissions for buildings greater than 25,000 square feet, requiring a reduction of emissions by 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Buildings not in compliance are required to pay penalties.
This law dovetails with NYC Local Laws 92 and 94, also known as the Green Roof Law, which requires that all new roof construction must include either a green roof, a solar array, or a combination of both.
4) Low income communities bonus credit
The Inflation Reduction Act provides at least 30% and up to 70% of a solar project’s installed system cost in the form of a tax credit. The Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit program allows for up to 1.8 GW of eligible solar or wind capacity to be allocated credits each year. Read more about the program here.
5) Job creation
Ludwig said economic opportunity in the form of job creation will expand dramatically.
“The rising demand is being felt by the city’s developers and installers with the city’s comptroller predicting the creation of 13,000 clean-energy jobs over the next 8 years,” said Ludwig.
T.R. Ludwig is the CEO and co-founder of both Brooklyn SolarWorks and Brooklyn Solar Canopy Co. and serves as treasurer for New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA).

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/05/irs-pre-registration-portal-open-for-ira-elective-pay-and-transferable-credits/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,2024-02-05,IRS pre-registration portal open for IRA elective pay and transferable credits,"On December 22, 2023, the IRS opened the pre-filing registration portal for credits to be claimed under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Registration through the portal is required to obtain a registration number to be included on the income tax return filings needed to claim the tax credits.
This registration impacts both tax exempt entities going the elective pay route to receive a direct cash payment from the IRS and those entities seeking to transfer credits to a third-party buyer in exchange for cash.
IRA background
The IRA has breathed new life into energy credits. Prior to the IRA, solar and other clean energy tax credits that had been in place for many years were starting down a path to sunset.
Two of the most significant new components embedded within the IRA legislation is the ability for non-profit entities to pursue elective pay credits, and for-profit entities to transfer tax credits earned in exchange for cash. However, like many of the other new aspects of the tax code promulgated through the IRA, it has come with new processes and requirements for those seeking to take advantage of these opportunities.
Prior experience suggests we should expect a bit of turbulence as the tools created by the IRS go live.
The registration process
The IRS released a 73-page registration guidebook outlining the details of the rules. Moving forward on energy projects requires the guidance to be broken down and a detailed review of the new guidebook will map the process for thousands of taxpayers over the next decade. All registrations will be processed through a newly created IRA pre-registration filing portal.
One taxpayer – one registration
Organizations and taxpayers are allowed only one pre-filing registration for the applicable tax period. As such, a taxpayer must apply for the registration numbers for every credit it intends to claim within one filling.
This pre-registration can be amended or updated, but only after the review of the initial submission has been reviewed by the IRS. Once a registration number has been assigned to a taxpayer, updates or amendments to that registration number must be made prior to it being used in a filing.
Pre-filing registration should occur after a project is “placed in service” and at the beginning of the tax period in which the tax credit is earned. In terms of a “deadline,” it is suggested that a pre-filing registration should be submitted at least 120 days prior to the due date for the tax return on which the credit will be reported, including any allowable extension periods.
The details
Taxpayers will need to fill out two sections to complete the pre-filing registration. The first section collects general information regarding the taxpayer. The second section, based on the inputs from the general section, will allow the taxpayer to input all relevant information for specific credits to be claimed.
The first section asks for basic information, such as: the tax period of the election; the filer’s EIN; any information about subsidiaries included in a consolidated group of corporations; the entities name as it will appear on the ultimate tax return; the entities (not project) address (this must be the address used on the last income tax return filed by the entity, if this isn’t a newly formed organization or first time filer);bank account information.
In a situation where there is a parent of a consolidated group of corporations as the registrant, the EIN and name must be that of the parent. Information regarding the subsidiaries can be captured during the subsequent credit-specific information input. The parent of a consolidated group of corporations will register on behalf of itself and will act as an “agent” for subsidiaries included in the group. When entering subsequent credit-specific information, the parent corporation will provide the subsidiary name and EIN for each facility or property being registered that is owned by the subsidiary.
I’m through the General Registration Section, now what?
This is where the fun really starts. The IRS portal offers two options at this juncture, manual entry or bulk upload. Think of this as the difference of entering a set of an individual set of data for a single project (on a project-by-project basis) versus uploading a spreadsheet file with all of this information for each project embedded into it.
Project information required for this section includes; choice of election (e.g., elective pay or transfer); if applicable, confirmation of the entity as a subsidiary in a consolidated group of corporations; the date construction began; the date the project was placed in service; the property location; details on any joint ownership in the project; and finally (and an interesting requirement) the sources of funds.
You aren’t done yet!
Aside from the information discussed in the “general” and “detailed” sections, each credit type will request supporting documentation. With the IRA, a number of new and enhanced credits are going to be registered, including: Section 30C (alternative fuel refueling property), Section 45 (production tax credit), 45Q (carbon oxide sequestration credit), Section 45U (nuclear power production), Section 45V (clean hydrogen), Section 45W (commercial clean vehicles), Section 45X (advanced manufacturing production), Section 48C (qualifying advanced energy projects), and the Section 48 energy investment tax credit we have all come to know and love.
The additional supporting documentation required to register includes:
A learning process
As more and more guidance comes out, the associated requirements that come along with the opportunity to harvest substantial tax credits will be a learning process.
While elective pay or transferable credit registration requirements don’t appear to be significant, they are another step that needs careful consideration. Complete registrations are more likely to be approved and not questioned for resubmittal.
Prior experience indicates that there may be delays in turnaround of registration requests regardless, those that don’t register with correct and complete information can only anticipate even longer delays prior to ultimately accessing the credits. And in this case, time is literally money.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/05/solar-recycling-headquarters-and-research-lab-opens-in-arizona/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ARIZONA,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-05,Solar recycling headquarters and research lab opens in Arizona,"Solarcycle, a solar recycling company, announced the opening of its new headquarters in Mesa, Arizona. In addition to office space and a recycling facility, the headquarters is also equipped with a research lab that will employ scientists and engineers to work on the advancing the material refinement process to reach zero-waste and obtain the most value out of decommissioned panels.
The Mesa facility will initially recycle 250,000 solar panels each year, and ramp to one million panels per year to keep pace with growing market demand in the solar industry for its recycling and circular supply chain services.
With the rapid growth in solar energy in the U.S., there is also growing concern about what will happen to solar panels at the end of their useful life. Without an increase in solar recycling, the U.S. will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). To put into context, the U.S. dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Solarcycle reports that its proprietary technology enables the extraction of 95% of the value from recycled panels, including silver, silicon, copper, aluminum and glass. The company sells these higher-purity materials back to the domestic supply chain.
The company says it will create more than 100 local jobs and is hiring for positions in production, engineering, operations, IT, finance, sales and marketing, and management.
Solarcycle, now in its second year of operation, was founded by industry experts from leading corporations and institutions including Solaria, Nextracker, Sierra Club, and the University of New South Wales. The company raised an initial $6.6M seed round in May 2022 from leading renewable energy and circular economy investors including SolarCity founders Peter and Lyndon Rive, former CEO/CTO of Sunpower Corporation Systems Tom Dinwoodie, Urban Innovation Fund and Closed Loop Partners.
Also in its inaugural year, the company opened a facility in Odessa, Texas. To fund that facility the company raised $30 million in Series A funding in 2023, bringing its total funding to $37 million. The infrastructure financing was led by Fifth Wall and HG Ventures. The round also included participation from special situations partner Alok Sindher, Prologis Ventures, as well as existing investors Urban Innovation Fund and Closed Loop Partners.
In April 2023 the U.S. Department of Energy awarded the company a $1.5 million research grant to study the process for recovering higher-quality metals and materials extracted from retired solar panels.  
The solar recycler has grown its infrastructure footprint nationally through high-volume contracts with industry leaders including AES, EDF Renewables North America, EDP Renewables North America, Greenbacker, Ørsted, Silicon Ranch, and Sunrun.
Solarcycle reports that it follows stringent set of systems developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and is actively certified under ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 to recycle and process materials and minerals from solar panels.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory projects that by 2040, recycled panels and materials could help meet 25% to 30% of U.S. domestic solar manufacturing needs.
Solarcycle plans to announce additional facilities across the United States in 2024, with the intention of having a recycling center within 500 miles of 80% of the installed solar in the U.S., Jesse Simons, co-founder and CCO told pv magazine USA. He said the company relies on its logistics professionals to optimize the number of panels on a truck to make the fewest number of trips to bring panels to its sites.
