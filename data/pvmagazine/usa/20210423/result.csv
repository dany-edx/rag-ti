The solicitation calls for approximately 4.5 million MWh of renewable electricity per year. Eligible projects include any project that can be certified as a Tier 1 renewable technology and that has commenced operation after Jan. 1, 2015, or that commences commercial operation by Nov. 30, 2023, with the option to extend to Nov. 30, 2026. NYSERDA expects to notify the awarded developers in late 2021.
Along with the solicitation came word that more than 20 large-scale renewable energy infrastructure projects will be under construction across the state this year, including the first utility-scale solar project in Upstate New York.
Located in Easton, just north of Albany, the 20 MW Branscomb Solar project, developed and constructed by CS Energy and owned by Goldman Sachs Renewable Power, will generate over $20 million in private investment and create nearly 100 jobs to support its construction and future operations and maintenance in the Capital Region.
Both announcements advance progress toward New York’s goal of having 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030, as outlined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. 
Across the previous four renewable energy solicitations, New York has contracted with more than 90 new large-scale renewable energy facilities, including solar farms, onshore wind farms, and hydroelectric facilities, some of which have been paired with energy storage. These installations have brought significant private investment, new jobs, and economic development to communities in more than 30 counties.
NYSERDA’s competitive program has leveraged the declining cost of renewable energy, with the latest round of awarded projects priced over 40& lower than those awarded just a year previously, maintaining the cost-effective ramp-up of renewable energy across the state.
New York’s pipeline of large-scale renewable energy projects, will add nearly 11 GW of clean power to the grid when completed. Supported by 250 miles of new major transmission upgrades, the pipeline of will enable the state to power over 50% of its electricity from renewable sources.

To stay up to date on what’s new, check out this latest clean energy product roundup:
Robotic cleaning company IMAGE Ecoppia said it completed installing robots at a solar site in California operated by the AES Corporation.
The site will use the Ecoppia T4 product, which is designed for single-axis trackers. The autonomous T4 robots operate nightly, cleaning large-scale solar arrays without the use of water, human operators, or electricity; the robots are solar powered. More information is here.
Fuel delivery company Booster said it expanded its service to include on-demand electric vehicle (EV) charging. The capability makes Booster one of the first companies to expand its platform to renewable energy. The company said it is building on its conventional energy capabilities to meet the increased demand for EVs, broadening its service to include the 500,000+ electric vehicles in California.

Booster’s mobile charging service will supplement the charging infrastructure at existing customer locations. The pilot service will be available to select customers in the San Francisco Bay Area starting this summer via the Booster app. More information is here.
SOL Components, a producer of designs for solar module mounting systems, announced the successful construction of its Ground Fixed Tilt mounting system in support of a 213 MW solar PV project in California.
SOL Components’ roll-formed steel components support more than 500,000 solar panels at the site, which is one of the largest ground-mounted fixed-tilt solar PV projects in the western U.S. SOL Components said it was selected because of its expertise with utility-scale solar projects, and the benefits and advantages of its end-to-end PV structural systems. SOL Components’ light gauge roll-formed steel piles and racking components reduce overall steel weight while providing optimum structural integrity, which reduced the developer’s racking costs. The site was developed on steep, undulating terrain necessitating a system with the flexibility to adapt to varying site constraints. More information is here.
SPOC Automation, which specializes in variable speed-drive automation and inverter technologies, launched SPOC Grid Inverter Technologies. The company said it already has deployed 70,000 inverters. The new company is expected to further allow enhanced performance and provide new energy alternative configuration choices, assist in reducing carbon emissions, and give the user control of their power systems in numerous applications. More information is here.
Tech company Palmetto said it has launched a new solar energy monitoring program called Palmetto Protect. The monitoring tool is available through the Palmetto App, accessible via Android and iOS, to all solar customers regardless of installer. The free monitoring plan provides information about energy production, consumption (for those customers who have a consumption meter), and savings over time, as well as on-demand system status functionality, allowing homeowners to view performance at a glance.

Three additional Palmetto Protect plans are each available for a fee. All offer professional monitoring and notification along with immediate resolution options. The Essentials Plan includes remote professional monitoring and a monthly operational report. Other plans are scheduled for launch at later dates. More information is here.

The four-year global competition invites innovators and teams to create and demonstrate solutions that can pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans.
To win the grand prize, teams must demonstrate a working solution at a scale of at least 1,000 tonnes removed per year; model their costs at a scale of 1 million tonnes per year; and show a pathway to achieving a scale of gigatonnes per year in the future. All demonstrations must be validated by a third party.

In the first of two competition phases, teams must demonstrate the key component of their carbon removal solutions at smaller scale, not the full operating solution. Fully operational solutions are required to win.
The organizers said that any carbon negative solution is eligible: nature-based, direct air capture, oceans, mineralization, or anything else that achieves net negative emissions, sequesters CO2 durably, and shows a sustainable path to ultimately achieving gigatonne scale.
Teams may enter the competition at any stage. After a year of competition the judges will review the progress of competitors and award up to 15 Milestone Prizes of $1 million each.
XPRIZE will also award up to $5M to student teams in the fall of 2021. These awards may fund participation in the competition itself or the development of supporting technologies.
In 2024, after developing their solutions, teams will apply to be considered as finalists. Winners will be selected in 2025, including $50 million paid to the single Grand Prize Winner, $30 million to be distributed among up to three runners-up.

The New York City-based institute is being formed in partnership with Siemens, Lutron Electronics, the Brooklyn Law School, building engineering consulting firm Thornton Tomasetti, and international architecture firms HKS, OBMI, and Perkins&Will. The institute will use digital technologies to drive decarbonization of urban environments at the systems level.
The announcement was made by RPI President Shirley Ann Jackson at President Biden’s Climate Leadership Summit. Dr. Jackson is a theoretical physicist and the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from MIT in any field. She has led RPI since 1999.
Plans call for EBESS to model integrated transportation, communications, and supply chain networks. It will link architectural design and engineering to create infrastructure that is both net-zero in energy use and climate resilient. It will also use new materials, renewable energy systems, and sentient building platforms to maximize human health and well-being.
The new institute will integrate research across centers and schools at RPI, including the Center for Architecture Science and Ecology (CASE) and the Lighting Enabled Systems & Applications (LESA) Center.

That’s what the Electric Power Research Institute said will be needed to meet the Biden administration’s Earth Day pledge to cut U.S. economy-wide carbon emissions to around 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.
EPRI said the goal amounts to a 2 gigaton (Gt) drop in annual, energy-related U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. That is triple the rate achieved from 2005 to 2020 when annual emissions fell by 1 Gt.
EPRI said that other sectors of the economy, notably transportation, buildings and industry, could largely reduce carbon emissions through electrification. That means the power sector will play a “crucial role in achieving the administration’s 2030 economy-wide goal,” EPRI said.
EPRI said that beyond 2030, low-carbon resources such as a hydrogen, advanced nuclear, and carbon capture and storage, will be “essential to driving additional carbon reduction.”
EPRI and Gas Technology Institute are leading a five-year Low-Carbon Resources Initiative. The two groups earlier outlined research, development, and demonstration activities to further economy-wide decarbonization.
JetBlue Technology Ventures, a venture capital arm of the airline, said it invested in Universal Hydrogen as part of its $20.5M Series A funding round. The financing will help Universal Hydrogen speed development of its hydrogen logistics network and regional aircraft conversion kits, and bolsters its commercial activities.
Universal Hydrogen is building a fuel distribution network that connects hydrogen production directly to the airplane using modular capsules that are transported using the existing freight network, avoiding the need for new pipelines, storage facilities, and fuel trucks. The company is also developing conversion kits to retrofit existing 40-60 passenger regional airplanes with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain.
JetBlue said that it achieved carbon neutrality for all of its domestic flying in 2020, a year of pandemic-induced demand collapse, primarily through carbon offsets.
Universal Hydrogen was founded last year. It said first commercial flights with its technology are planned no later than 2025, with operating costs expected to be equal to conventional hydrocarbon-burning airplanes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/23/solar-wins-big-as-wisconsin-regulators-approve-alliant-capacity-additions/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WISCONSIN",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 23, 2021",Solar wins big as Wisconsin regulators approve Alliant capacity additions,"Wisconsin regulators voted to allow Alliant Energy’s subsidiary, Wisconsin Power and Light, to buy or build, own, and operate six solar electric facilities with a combined capacity of 675 MW.
In its April 22 decision, regulators approved Alliant’s bid for:
The estimated total cost of the solar projects is $887 million. Regulators said that Alliant’s customers will see savings of around $127 million due to the retirement of higher cost coal-fired generation.
Prior to the decision, the regulatory body had approved 1,078 MW of utility-scale solar generation in Wisconsin.
Renew Wisconsin called the Earth Day decision “the most significant advance yet towards a zero-carbon future in Wisconsin.”
In late March, Alliant filed a separate application to acquire an additional six solar farms for about $515 million. As proposed to state regulators, the six newest projects would be developed in mostly rural parts of five counties. Once the projects are operational, Alliant said local communities would receive around $50 million in shared revenues for the next 30 years. Over the same period, local landowners would receive a combined $60 million in lease payments.
News reports said that about a dozen people opposed the acquisition proposal based on concerns about loss of farmland, environmental impacts, and potential loss of property values.
Alliant plans to retire its two remaining coal plants by 2025 as it seeks to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030. The company has said that replacing coal plants with up to 1,000 MW of solar capacity can avoid up to $6.5 billion in additional costs over the next 35 years.
