Property manager Granite Redevelopment Properties worked closely with Dallas’ own The Solar Company to develop the plan, which was acted upon due to the clear financial benefit of the project.
Chet Dyson, head of operations shared that the solar modules installed range from 400 W to 450 W and are a mix of about 2/3 Canadian Solar panels and 1/3 Znshine. The inverters used were Solis single-phase inverters, with multiple inverters around 10 kW in size stacked to meet the need of the distributed system.
“When we ran the numbers for overall project returns, we were sold and wanted to go all in. Not only is it a responsible decision from an environmental standpoint, it also makes tremendous financial sense and adds millions of dollars to the overall value of our portfolio,” said Tim Gillean, President at Granite Redevelopment Properties, LP.

The project is particularly beneficial to the “all bills paid” model that Class B and C multifamily housing units offer. The project cuts costs and provides price predictability for the landlord, while providing clean, local, and reliable power to the residents.
During the winter superstorm that knocked out much of the Texas grid last year, a key reason a huge spike in demand for power to heat homes that was generally unexpected by grid planners. Transmission bottlenecks and centralized power worsened the issue, which caused wholesale prices to skyrocket to the cap $9,000/MW and led to widespread outages. The problem was so bad it led to the Public Utilities Commission to lower the cap to $5,000/MW, after it was assessed the storm caused $130 billion in economic damages.
Many Texans found themselves facing electric bills in the thousands of dollars, often in low-income communities where residential energy providers are known to sell predatory packages that expose residents directly to wholesale prices.
A project like Granite Redevelopment’s 15 MW array can act as a shield to both problems. It provides local clean energy and takes stress off the grid, smoothing out the spikes of bottleneck-created price hikes. And a “all bills paid” model can allow the housing manager to offer a predictable cost of energy, rather than allowing its residents to be exposed to potential predatory energy supply companies.
The 15 MW portfolio is distributed throughout numerous units and will also comprise solar carports that cover 2,000 parking spaces, providing the dual benefit of cooling the vehicles below while producing clean energy. The 40,000-panel system is expected to be completed this July.
The Solar Company builds its solar carports in-house, from manufacture through install. “We found it was more cost-effective to build the carports ourselves, and it ensured they are made with superior craftsmanship,” said Travis Wildeman, CEO of The Solar Company in an interview with pv magazine.
Wildeman’s company works with apartment buildings, hotels, car dealerships, warehouses and other commercial buildings to install cost-effective, distributed solar.
“Granite is setting a trend for owners of Class B and C apartments – and potentially the entire multifamily industry. By removing one of the biggest expenses for many landlords with rooftop solar panels and solar carports, the math is hard to argue with,” said Wildeman.
Wildeman said he sees bright days ahead for the Texas solar industry. He comes from a background of over 20 years in commercial real estate underwriting and has noticed a trend among his connections from his past career. “People are excited to talk about solar here in Texas,” he said.

GSK Consumer Healthcare has a manufacturing facility in Oak Hill, nestled in the Catskills in Upstate New York. There the company produces some of GSK Consumer Healthcare’s oral health brands including Sensodyne, Pronamel, and Parodontax for the US and Canadian markets.
The solar installation comprises over 17,000 modules with an estimated electricity generation capacity of 6.9 MW DC. It is estimated that the plant will generate electricity equivalent to more than 70% of the Oak Hill site’s annual usage and reduce its carbon footprint by 60%
“The completion of this project marks a pivotal moment for us at GSK Consumer Healthcare, as a continued step in the right direction for enacting real change that reduces our environmental impact and helps us deliver on our larger sustainability initiatives,” said Mike Allen, Sustainability Lead Consumer Health Supply Chain, GSK Consumer Healthcare.
The Oak Hill site is the 12th solar investment project for GSK and its Consumer Healthcare business. Allen noted that the company plans to implement additional major solar and wind energy investments in the UK and US to set to set the company on track for 100% renewable electricity by 2025.
GSK Consumer Healthcare is the designated off-taker of the clean energy generated at the solar site, and is part of the company’s larger ongoing commitment to its sustainability goals of reducing its Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 100% by 2030.
“In order to form a more sustainable world, we need to work collaboratively with major corporations to implement energy-efficient solutions. I’m so thankful that we were able to work with an organization like GSK Consumer Healthcare, that has set forth aggressive goals for its future and truly understands the need to implement renewable technologies at a grand scale,” said Pete Christakis, Senior Vice President, Ameresco. 
Another project that Ameresco has under construction on the other side of the country is at the US Coast Guard Petaluma training center. A 5 MW solar, 11.6 MWh energy storage microgrid is part of its $43 million contract that includes energy efficiency and management systems, and planned improvements such as the deployment of new power distribution transformers, smart controls in 10 buildings across campus, LED lighting improvements, installation of new electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and HVAC upgrades. The US Coast Guard project is expected to be complete in the fall of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/26/gemini-solar-and-storage-project-closes-1-9-billion-in-financing/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEVADA",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 26, 2022",Gemini Solar and Storage project closes $1.9 billion in financing,"Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners and Primergy Solar said the two have closed on a deal of $1.9 billion in debt and tax equity financing for the Gemini Solar + Storage project: a 690 MW solar and 380 MW/1,416 MWh battery storage project set to located in Clark County, Nevada, and among the largest projects to ever receive approval in the US.
According to the two companies, the Gemini debt financing consists of $1.3 billion in credit facilities and $532 million in tax equity commitments, with the tax equity commitments provided by Truist Bank and Bank of America.
“The successful culmination of this financing is a testament to the discipline and dedication of our teams who are establishing leading best practices in sustainable renewable energy development and responsible procurement,” said Ty Daul, CEO of Primergy. “With the suppliers and contractors engaged and the financing secured, we are ready to begin construction on this unprecedented project.”
The close of the financing comes just over a month after the completion of Gemini’s major equipment procurement and contractor selection. Primergy selected Kiewit Power Constructors Co. as Gemini’s engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partner and IHI Terrasun Solutions as the integrator for the project’s 380MW/1,520MWh lithium-ion battery, also one of the largest known to pv magazine.
According to Primergy, the two companies were chosen due to their “decades of experience in construction and installation, product development, procurement and systems integration in the renewable energy and power sector.”
As for the solar hardware, the project will utilize over 1.8 million of Maxeon Solar Technologies’ high efficiency bifacial solar modules. Maxeon’s bifacial panels use shingled cell panel technology in bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large format 8-inch G12 wafers. The modules offer efficiency of over 21%, enhanced shade tolerance, and power ratings of up to 625W. These modules will be mounted on Array Technologies’ Array DuraTrack HZ v3 trackers, which are specifically designed to withstand harsh desert environments and high wind speeds with a patented wind-mitigation system.
Slated for completion in 2023, with operations beginning shortly thereafter, the Gemini project is expected to create approximately 1,000 local jobs, which will be sourced through union participation. The on-site construction workforce is expected to average 500 to 700 construction workers, with a peak of up to 900 workers, supporting up to an additional 1,100 jobs in the local community and injecting an estimated $712.5 million into the economy during construction, according to previous updates from Primergy and Quinbrook. Upon completion, Gemini will deliver renewable energy under a 25-year purchase agreement with NV Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/26/7-5-mw-solar-farm-planned-on-former-biomass-plant-site-in-northern-maine/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MAINE",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 26, 2022",7.5 MW solar farm planned on former biomass plant site in northern Maine,"Standard Solar and Acadia Energy announced plans to develop a 7.5 MW solar farm on the western side of the former ReEnergy biomass plant site in the town of Fort Fairfield, Maine.
The solar farm will lease land from Smith’s Farm, Inc and land previously used for a biomass power facility owned by New York-based ReEnergy Biomass Operations, which transferred the 32-acre site to the town in 2018 after concluding that the plant was no longer economically viable.
“The Fort Fairfield project will transform the least desirable area of the former industrial site into a clean energy producer that benefits the community while creating additional lots for the Town to lease or sell,” said Eric Partyka, director of business development for Standard Solar.
The fixed-tilt ground-mount system is projected to generate 9,112 MWh in its first year of operation, with about 10% of the power going to Smith’s Farm, and the benefitting other commercial and industrial organizations throughout Aroostook County.
“Former industrial sites are ideal for solar energy development,” said Glenn Walker of Acadia Energy. “Our partnership with Standard Solar on the Fort Fairfield project will provide a model that can be followed throughout Maine and around the U.S., showing how to successfully transition industrial sites with limited potential into a solar farm that will save money for local businesses and benefit the environment.”
Construction on the project is expected to begin in May, with completion targeted for the fourth quarter of this year.
Standard Solar currently owns and operates more than 250 MW of solar across the United States, of which 50 MW are in Maine. Recently Standard Solar acquired a 7 MW community solar project in Trenton, Maine, which is the state’s first large-scale community solar installation.
Acadia Energy, based in Rye, New Hampshire, is solar developer with a pipeline of over 300 MW of solar across the United States, and over 20 MW of solar under construction (or in various stages of development) in Maine.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/26/utility-scale-solar-inverters-need-improved-commissioning-and-upkeep/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 26, 2022",Utility scale solar inverters need improved commissioning and upkeep,"The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has released a report, Multiple Solar PV Disturbances in CAISO, which discusses why more than 100 utility scale solar plants and a significant amount of distributed solar shed gigawatts of capacity during grid fault events in the spring and summer of 2021. This document complements the Odessa Disturbance, with NERC building upon the recommended policy changes.
The cascading nature of these events — due to the failure of a single piece of hardware — is reminiscent of the Northeast Blackout of 2003.
The reports do, optimistically, point toward the solvable nature of many of these issues via additional commissioning requirements, and possibly via high-level data monitoring. Some of the issues include onsite operations and maintenance teams that were not able to access passwords to equipment onsite, and were unable to change inverter settings.

However, it is clear that there is an issue, since there have been four events within the CAISO region within about two months time. Between these events, a cumulative 3.1 GW of capacity was dropped.
The four events were touched off by a phase-to-phase fault on a 500 kV line, two fires and their smoke that set off nearby 500 kV lines, and a tripped transformer that connected a 500 kV and 500/230 kV set of lines.
The solar facilities reacted in a variety of ways, and analysis found many individual faults within the plants that led to the gigawatts of shed generation. Most of the capacity that was shed did immediately return to generation, however, several large blocks of generation took longer to get back online.
One of the broader issues stemmed from a lack of data collectors in specific places, which meant that NERC was unable to obtain explicit data showing why these sites stayed down longer than intended. NERC hypothesized that this was the result of inverter settings, though unfortunately, those settings are not available.

To head off the issue of not knowing for sure where the issues are, NERC ‘strongly recommends all newly connecting bulk power system (bps)-connected inverter-based resources to be equipped with at least the following’ pieces of data collecting gear:
Additionally, simply having better access to records and passwords of facilities was high on the list of needed improvements. The report notes that as plants have changed hands, the operations and maintenance teams haven’t always been given proper records of hardware installed or replacement records. This is in addition to simply not having passwords.
The password issue was made more challenging by multiple inverter manufacturers that have gone out of business, suggesting that the in-house password workarounds that might exist within the IT teams could be lost to the fog of corporate evolution.
Most of the additional recommendations unique to the CAISO report versus the initial Odessa report can be summarized as NERC pushing CAISO to implement standards they had previously recommended, and for better monitoring of sites.
If anything, the people working on reliability appear to be zeroing in on a specific set of challenges.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/26/california-solar-bill-would-extend-access-savings-to-renters-and-low-income-families/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 26, 2022","California solar bill would extend access, savings to renters and low-income families","California has been the clean energy frontrunner in the United States, and it has been particularly strong in deploying distributed, rooftop solar. Distributed generation, especially when paired with energy storage, has numerous advantages in cost savings, efficiency, a lessened carbon footprint, the preservation of land, and more when compared to centralized resources. The state represents about half of all residential rooftop arrays in the United States with over one million Californians having gone solar to date.
However, community solar programs in investor-owned utility territories, which serve over 75% of the state’s electricity, are conspicuously absent.
One issue that has been raised about residential solar in California is the fact that there is an unequal distribution to who is able to invest in and reap the benefits of solar PV. Across the United States, solar owners have an average income 58% higher than the median income in their county. Plus, there is the utility-backed argument of the “cost shift” in which solar customers are cross subsidized by non-solar customers for paying retail rates for net energy metering. While the cost shift is negligible in nascent solar markets, there is a nonzero effect on California’s energy prices.
With this access and benefits gap in mind, Assembly Bill (AB) 2316 has been proposed, with aims to deploy value-based and grid-responsive community solar projects. It is sponsored by the Coalition for Community Solar Access, and met with strong support from groups like SEIA, GRID Alternatives, Vote Solar, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and more.
The bill, entitled the Community Renewable Energy Program Act, would create a cost-effective community solar program that pools distributed energy resources and expands access to renters and low-income residents. It would also require the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to issue guidelines to ensure at least 51% of the capacity of each community renewable energy facility is subscribed by low-income customers or low-income service organizations.
Without the ability to purchase and install solar directly on a rented residence, community solar offers a pathway to the 45% of Californians who rent their homes, and the 70% of renters who are considered low-income. Other homes may lack the proper structure for solar PV, so community solar offers a pathway for these homeowners to be connected with local solar resources.
Community solar projects are often installed on landfills, former industrial sites, or small parcels of private land. Multiple customers can subscribe and receive credit on their utility bill for their share of the power that was produced.
While states like New York and Minnesota have booming community solar markets, Californians living in the territory of investor-owned utilities do not have access to such a program. AB 2316 aims to establish community solar programs in these investor-owned utility territories, which serve over 75% of the electricity usage in the state.
The bill would:
1) Establish a cost-effective community renewable energy program that supports grid resiliency in California
2) Expand access to distributed generation benefits to all customers, particularly low income
3) Provide an option for meeting the state’s building code mandates. AB 2316 would require the CPUC to establish the program by July 1, 2023, and ensure it results in viable community renewable facilities located on the distribution system of investor-owned utilities. The CPUC would establish a tariff that creates a bill credit rate based on the time-differentiated avoided-cost value of the community renewable energy facility.
Utility opposition
Notably, the major investor-owned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Edison all signed on in opposition to the bill. These utilities are the same organizations that pushed the Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 proposal, a rooftop solar “killer.” The major justification for the proposed NEM was that the current market unfairly benefits wealthy Californians and leaves poorer Californians behind.
Now, the altruistic sentiments of these major utilities seems to have shifted, as a bill aimed at mending the benefits gap they sought to close is being opposed by the very same investor-owned utilities.
In a note to the CPUC, the Coalition for Community solar access wrote, “Stymieing broader participation in California’s climate fight directly undermines the state’s ability to achieve its climate goals equitably. Without viable community renewable energy programs, builders have fewer options to meet California’s ambitious building code requirements that new construction be solar-powered.”

Firefighters were alerted to a fire at the facility last Monday. During a press conference on Thursday, a spokesperson for the Chandler Fire Department confirmed that there was a battery on fire in the building, but that sprinkler systems had been able to control it.
Three years ago Peoria, Arizona fire fighters learned the hazards of battery fires first-hand when a fire at a battery facility left four fire fighters injured. Because the SRP facility had been smoldering for days, the fire fighters used an abundance of caution before entering the building.
Keith Welch, Battalion Chief at Chandler Fire Department said, “We took a defensive strategy and for us that means we’re not going to open the door and go in without personnel to take a look because we know some of the potential hazards of the battery degradation and the off-gassing and the different hazards that can cause.”
Due to potentially hazardous gases leaking from the building, businesses in the area were asked to evacuate Thursday night, as the robot opened the doors and entered the facility, allowing the gases to dissipate. The next day the robots were sent back in to measure gases before firefighters could enter.
Salt River Project was announced in 2018 in conjunction with AES with the energy storage solution supplied by Fluence. The plan for the project was to provide power to SRP customers during high peak demand periods, and the project would also serve as an initiative to learn more about grid-scale battery storage. SRP customers have had no interruption in service as a result of the fire.
An AES spokesperson said it’s too early to speculate on the cause.

According to Yotta, the company will use the funding to accelerate the scaling of its panel-level solar-plus-storage system, develop new technology, and increase its headcount. Yotta’s unique energy storage solution includes a one-kilowatt-hour battery that mounts underneath a roof-mounted solar module. This panel-level solution fits under any industry standard solar module, according to the company. In addition to battery charging from the PV system, Yotta’s energy storage system provides time-of-use software control.
In addition to the funding, Yotta also announced that it was awarded $1.97 million by the Department of Defense’s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP)  for a new solar-plus-storage microgrid project at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to Yotta, the installation will feature hardware tweaks and innovations driven by customer feedback, but not much else is known about the project.
“Yotta Energy is a great candidate for this [ESTCP] program because of the distributed and flexible solution the technology provides for different use-cases on military installations,” said Timothy Tetreault, project manager at ESTCP. “We are excited to implement this technology at Nellis Air Force base as we strive to future proof our military with resilient and sustainable solutions.”
Yotta Energy’s lithium-iron-phosphate battery is a 1 kWh unit that accepts up to four solar panels. The company says the system can scale to 1 MWh of battery, meaning 1,000 units.
Each battery can be wired with up to four solar panels, although two panels are considered optimal. The 1.2 kW microinverter can handle up to four 440W+ solar panels, with one battery per panel. The unit has a 10-year warranty by default, and there is a 15-year extension available.
