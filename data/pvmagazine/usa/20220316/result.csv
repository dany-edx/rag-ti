https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/16/upgrading-transmission-lines-could-enable-27gw-more-renewable-power-per-year/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 16, 2022",Upgrading transmission lines could enable 27GW more renewable power per year,"Replacing 5,000 miles of transmission wires each year with “advanced conductors” would make room for 27GW more renewable generation per year, says a report from Grid Strategies, published by the renewables trade group ACORE.
That projection is based on the increased capacity of advanced conductors, which “can have a maximum current-carrying capacity of up to two times that of conventional conductors,” says a Department of Energy report describing five types of advanced overhead conductors.
The increased capacity is partly due to an increase in the amount of aluminum in the wire, with one type of advanced conductor having about 28% more aluminum in the same diameter of wire as conventional conductors, says ACORE’s report. Aluminum is used for transmission because it is a good conductor of electricity that is much lighter than copper.
Advanced conductors also have a high-strength core with low thermal expansion. So if a parallel line fails, says a Department of Energy post, a line using an advanced conductor “can handle the extra current flow. When operated at higher temperatures (representing higher current flow), a normal conductor would tend to thermally expand and sag beyond safe limits—potentially grounding out to adjacent lines or structures—causing catastrophic outage. The advanced conductor’s reduced coefficient of thermal expansion prevents thermally induced line sag and would prevent that type of occurrence.”
Advanced conductors cost more than conventional conductors. Still, at least “one major utility is in the process of making advanced conductors their default, because they realize the value proposition,” said Jay Caspary with Grid Strategies, a co-author of the ACORE report, in a webinar. The US needs to “take full advantage” of existing transmission structures and rights of way by upgrading conventional transmission lines to higher-capacity advanced conductors, he said.
Worldwide, one type of advanced conductor has been used in more than 750 projects, while another type has been used in more than 140 countries, said the DOE report.
The ACORE report derived the projection that advanced conductors could make room for 27 GW of renewables per year through a three-step calculation. Starting with one utility’s stated need to replace 30% of its transmission lines over the next ten years, due to their age, the 30% figure is extrapolated to the US grid, yielding an estimate that 200,000 miles of transmission lines nationwide will need to be replaced over the next ten years. Assuming that 25% will be replaced with advanced conductors yields 5,000 miles of replacements per year. Representing that amount as 100 50-mile replacements per year, each “capable of providing an additional 200MW of capacity,” yields 20GW of additional renewable capacity on an AC basis. That is converted to 27GW on a DC basis, “assuming a 40% overbuild of wind capacity and a 30% overbuild of solar capacity.”
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has launched a reform process to “build the transmission system of the future.” Advanced conductors are within the scope of this proceeding, said Barbara Tyran of ACORE, during the webinar.
The ACORE report made policy recommendations regarding advanced conductors for FERC, the Department of Energy, transmission planners and owners, and state regulators. Those recommendations address several barriers to adoption of advanced conductors, in terms of technical barriers, regulatory incentives and business practices.
Other types of advanced transmission technologies that can deliver more solar and wind to the grid include advanced power flow control, topology optimization and dynamic line ratings.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/16/solar-powered-data-server-network-developed-to-frame-the-internet-as-a-natural-resource/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 16, 2022",Solar-powered data server network developed to frame the internet as a natural resource,"While the internet can seem ethereal, with data being processed “on the cloud” the reality is it a materials and energy-intensive core infrastructure. It is estimated by the environmental organization Climate Care that servers are responsible for as much emissions as the global airline industry. This carbon intensity is only increasing with the advent of blockchain technology. One transaction of the cryptocurrency Ethereum is equivalent to the carbon impact of over 300,000 credit card transactions.
A group of researchers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering have built a new network of servers intended to re-frame our understanding of the cloud, tying the impact of datacenters back to planet Earth.
The project, called Solar Protocol, is a network of servers that are directly tied to solar and energy storage. When the sun shines its brightest in a given region, that region’s servers are activated. The structure bucks the prevailing model of shifting data processing to the fastest, lowest-cost available processing capacity, to one that pays heed to the energy being used to power it.
The concept found initial support by the Eyebeam Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future and the Code for Science & Society digital infrastructure incubators. It won the Mozilla Creative Media Award, which supports internet health through open-source computing, inclusion, online privacy, and decentralization.
The decentralization of databases supported by the Mozilla award echoes a similar re-framing of how energy may be distributed in the future. In his book Freeing Energy, venture capitalist Bill Nussey explains how there are billion-dollar opportunities for innovation in an energy profile dominated by distributed renewable energy and battery energy storage.
In the Solar Protocol network light is shed on how the sun shapes daily behavior, seasonal activities, and decision-making. The website uses the availability of the sun as the core logic that powers its activation schedule.
“Solar Protocol is a great opportunity for us as artists to foreground issues of climate change and how technology is driving it,” said Tega Brain, an NYU professor and project lead. “The project has catalyzed conversations about AI and automation, as in-network user traffic is decided by solar energy. We are using intelligence from natural and dynamic versus a data-driven machine learning model… Why not think of planetary limits as intelligence? After all, they will shape the future of life on Earth whether we like it or not.”
The team explained Solar Protocol is not an alternative to the internet or something that is planned to be scaled, but rather an “open standard” and a model that can be replicated.
“How data is collected, managed, and trains AI systems has an impact on billions of lives. But that impact is often invisible. Creative Media Awards like Solar Protocol make the invisible visible,” said Kofi Yeboah, awards program officer at Mozilla.

The Coalition opposed Maui Electric’s plans to locate a utility-scale solar power plant near a residential neighborhood and near the massive volcano, Haleakala.

The Coalition hired lawyers for a case that was heard before the Hawaii PUC, and when they lost that case, it was elevated to the state’s Supreme Court. The Supreme Court recently found that the Coalition did not show how the project would exacerbate water runoff or damage native plants and ultimately found that the PUC had properly evaluated allegations of harm and had  “lawfully approved” the utility’s agreement to purchase energy from the Paeahu solar plant.
The 1.5MW Paeahu Solar Project, owned by the Canadian firm Innergex, will consist of multiple zones of ground‐mounted solar PV arrays, a substation, and a 60MWh battery energy storage system. The project will be situated on approximately 200 acres of Ulupalakua Ranch land, in South Maui and is expected to power about 7,300 Maui households with clean, renewable energy.
Just three months ago, another Hawaiian solar project by Innergex was challenged by a community group, but that dispute ended in the group withdrawing its complaint after completion of mediator-led negotiation.
Hawaii has the highest electric prices in the country, and Hawaiian Electricity recently warned that prices may rise 10% in the coming months due to the Ukraine crisis and inflation. The state hopes to turn to renewable energy for relief, and while it is currently receiving just over 17% of its electricity from solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and it has set the ambitious goal of receiving 100% from renewables by 2045.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/16/making-sense-of-solar-supply-chain-issues/,"COST AND PRICES,COVID-19,GUEST POST,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 16, 2022",Making sense of solar supply chain issues,"As current supply chain issues continue to threaten the US photovoltaic solar industry, solar module suppliers, manufacturers, renewable energy developers and utilities alike face great uncertainty surrounding the immediate future of the solar module supply market. The bottom-line is that supply chain issues are increasing shipping and equipment costs for solar cells and panels, however, there are several independent factors that are working together to drive this surge in pricing and constrained market. These factors include the following:
This article takes a closer look at each of the factors listed above in an effort to explain the current landscape of the supply chain issues threatening the solar module supply market.
Antidumping and Countervailing Duties Anti-Circumvention Petition Filed by Auxin Solar
On February 8, 2022, California based Auxin Solar filed a petition with the Department of Commerce asking federal trade officials to investigate whether to impose tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells and modules that are assembled in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia using parts and components from China (the Petition). The Petition argues that Chinese manufacturers have shifted production of CSPV cells and modules to affiliated companies in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia in order to circumvent US anti-dumping (AD) laws and countervailing duties (CVD), which were implemented ten years ago after the US International Trade Commission found that dumped and subsidized imports of Chinese CSPV cells and modules caused material injury to the US CSPV industry. Further, the Petition argues that while the end of the production process has been shifted to Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia in order to serve the U.S. market, nearly all of the R&D, raw materials and capital investment is still coming from Chinese manufacturers.
The Petition is similar to the one rejected by the Department of Commerce just four short months ago, but with three notable differences:
Because the prior petitions rejection was based on the Petitioner not identifying themselves and the Department of Commerce’s resulting uncertainty of their standing to bring the petition, the first difference listed above may prove considerable this time around. In the event that the Department of Commerce does decide to investigate whether CSPV cells and modules should be subject to US anti-dumping laws and countervailing duties, the Department of Commerce will determine and asses whether:
Based on the current timeline, the Department of Commerce has until March 25, 2022 to accept Petition’s request and initiate an investigation or reject the Petition.  A decision could come sooner than that deadline, or the Department of Commerce could effectively extend that timeline by requesting more information from the Petitioner.  Once the Department of Commerce does come to a decision on whether to initiate an investigation, if it (a) rejects the Petition, thus not initiating an investigation, the case will end or (b) accepts the Petition, thus initiating an investigation, the timeline for clarity can be as long as one year with significant costs imposed during that year.  The timeline for such an investigation is 150 days from the Department of Commerce’s acceptance for a preliminary determination, and 300 days for a final determination.
If the result of the investigation is that the government finds that circumvention has occurred, it may impose duties (i.e., import taxes) on subject modules that could range from a few percentage points up to or exceeding 90%.  These duties can be applied to imports from the initiation of the case.  Further, while the investigation is pending (so as early as March 25, 2022), the US Government can impose a “cash deposit” requirement which would require an importer to post a cash deposit as security for the potential duties.  These cash deposits would impose a significant cost burden on the importation of subject modules.
The impact of the Auxin Solar Petition remains to be seen.  If the Department of Commerce initiates an investigation, it could take some time for closure on the matter (in the range of a year) and, during that time, significant cost could be imposed on subject modules (in the form of cash deposits).  More information should be known in the coming weeks.
Section 201 Tariffs
On February 4, 2022, the Biden administration extended Trump-era tariffs (known as Section 201 tariffs) on imported CSPV for an additional four years. In addition to extending the tariffs on monofacial solar cells and modules, the Biden administration also made several modifications to existing provisions including (i) increasing the capacity of monofacial solar cells that can initially be imported each year free of safeguard tariffs from 2.5 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts and (ii) excluding bifacial solar cells and modules from the tariff. Imports of CSPV cells that exceed the 5 gigawatt tariff-rate quota, and all imports of covered CSPV modules will be subject to the following tariffs:
While seeking to remedy injury to domestic manufacturing and create jobs in the US solar section, the Section 201 tariffs have solicited mixed reactions from solar industry stakeholders. Industry trade groups have argued that the extension of the tariffs threaten President Biden’s goal to decarbonize the US electricity sector by 2035 as solar companies have relied on cheap imports to compete with energy produced from fossil fuels. The Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents various companies throughout the solar value chain (including manufacturers, installers, and project developers), outwardly opposed the original tariff noting that “the US will continue to import 80% to 90% of our solar cells and modules at a higher cost due to the tariff, potentially putting solar out of reach for many homeowners, making some utility-scale projects uneconomical, and driving up prices for ratepayers”. Although the modifications made by the Biden administration have eased various aspects of the tariff, it continues as a contributing factor to the increasing shipping and equipment costs for solar cells and panels.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and Forced Labor WROs
On December 23, 2021, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) intending to reinforce the existing prohibitions against the importation of goods made with forced labor. UFLPA effectively creates a rebuttable presumption that all goods manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are the product of forced labor, and are therefore banned from importation into the United States. The rebuttable presumption will apply unless an importer is able to demonstrate that it:
UFLPA’s rebuttable presumption is set to take effect 180 days after its enactment, on June 21, 2022. During this time, the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force is soliciting comments and devising its strategy of implementation of the rules and regulations of UFLPA. Although there is a great deal of uncertainty that remains, the enforcement of the UFLPA could have a chilling effect on the solar module supply market in the near future, lasting through 2024, and potentially into 2025. The evidentiary requirements to overcome the rebuttable presumption detailed above will be significant and will most likely involve traceability across the entire supply chain. Manufacturers and related companies with supply chain exposure to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region should (i) prepare for an increasingly complex regulatory landscape in the near future, (ii) begin to carefully review the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force’s upcoming guidance on how to conduct due diligence on supply chain issues while assessing their supply chain risks, and (iii) consider engaging with the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force through the public comment period to inform the implementation of the UFLPA in a manner that is consistent with their practices.
General Global Supply Chain Issues (likely resulting from COVID-19)
Like numerous other supply chains, the solar module supply chain has felt significant pressure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the fallout from COVID-19 has resulted in (i) a shortage of the shipping containers that ship cargo, (ii) a spike in demand for steel (iii) too few ships and dock workers, (iv) a shortage of truck drivers, (v) an increase in gasoline prices, and (vi) an increase in key solar panel components such as polysilicon, all of which have caused an increase in shipping cost as well as significant shipping delays. Additionally, city-wide shutdowns in Asian export hubs have halted the manufacturing of various components and raw materials all together for months on end.
The Shanghai Freight Index, which tracks the cost of shipping a freight container from Shanghai to numerous ports around the world, has increased roughly six-fold from the pre-pandemic baseline. This has proven especially problematic for the US solar energy sector as most CSPV cells and modules are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia.
Summary: How have these factors affected the solar energy sector?
While any of the contributing factors detailed above would singularly threaten the solar module supply chain, each of these factors working together has caused a chilling effect in the US solar energy sector. Many solar developers have adopted the “wait and see” approach, postponing utility-scale solar projects planned for 2022. The level of uncertainty surrounding supply chain issues (specifically the Antidumping and Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD) Petition filed by Auxin Solar) has also caused developers to become increasingly cautious about holding risks associated with increasing costs. This has led to cost allocation and schedule provisions being heavily negotiated in recent utility scale contracts.
With several factors impacting the solar supply chain, it is not clear when there will be clarity in the market. In the near term, stakeholders should anticipate an uncertain and constrained market.  Also during this time, we should expect to see the allocation of cost, schedule and risk amongst stakeholders to be steadily and significantly evolving and changing.

The analysis finds that total system degradation is averaging 1.2% per year, greater than what is projected in many observed power purchase agreements.
However, the analysis finds two nuances in the data that paint a picture of stronger performance. First – newer (post 2014) and larger (greater than 25MWac) facilities are showing only 0.7% of system wide degradation. The second nuance in the data is that older facilities show a bump in generation in their later years. This suggests that repairs start in year seven, result in increased generation in year eight, and that performance improvements in subsequent years are sustained.

In fact, looking at year nine in the above chart – it appears that older facilities nearly reach their year one capacity factors. If this data pans out, it speaks volumes to repowering opportunities in the future.
These two data points suggest that newer and larger facilities are improving in both quality and operations/maintenance compared to their predecessors. It implies that older facilities are being upgraded or repaired by asset owners seeking to improve returns.
Often, solar assets in the US are resold to new owners after the fifth full year of operation due to the Investment Tax Credit structure. The bump in year eight and nine may be attributed to the asset transfer occurring in year six, as analysis and repairs occur in year seven, and results show up shortly thereafter.

In the analysis, Plant-level performance and degradation of 31 GWDC of utility-scale PV in the United States, the authors attempt to tease out recoverable versus non-recoverable degradation losses.
Recoverable losses are defined as correctable performance issues, like soiling or tracker malfunction, while unrecoverable losses are typically due to solar module delamination or solar cell hot spots. Naturally, these losses are larger than those of solar modules alone, as modern solar panels are typically warrantied at or below 0.5% of degradation per year.
The vertical line in the chart demonstrates how singular events – failures of fuses, trackers, breakers, and inverters – can briefly, but dramatically cut solar power facility outputs. The author notes that inverters or breakers may cut 100% of plant output, and that fuses can cut around half of a plant’s output. Individual tracker failures and curtailment may result in a 20-30% reduction to a plant’s output.
Of course, solar modules degrade slowly, and indefinitely, thus the wide and ever increasing dark blue bar. Interestingly, when the authors modeled losses based on solar module manufacturers, they found no statistically significant differences amongst the standard silicon module manufacturers. However, plants powered by thin film products – namely First Solar – showed 30% less annual degradation.
The report cited a selection of variables that show statistically significant differences in generation:

While the primary purpose of this analysis was to explore degradation rates, the data shows a few other interesting trends. First – the number of plants and total capacity deployed has increased significantly over time. In 2007, the first year of analysis, there were only 2 facilities totaling 22MW. In the peak year, 2016, the study shows 148 sites totaling nearly 10GW of capacity.
Also increasing – the DC (solar panels installed) to AC (inverters installed) ratio went from 1.18 modules watt per inverter rating, to a peak of 1.37:1 in 2018.

Stanford’s Solar Installations
The 67MW Stanford Solar Generating Station #1, located in Rosamond, CA, came online in 2016.
5MW was installed on rooftops on campus in 2017. And the Stanford Solar Generating Station #2, which came online this week, is an 88MW array constructed near Lemoore, CA, through a power purchase agreement with Goldman Sachs Renewable Power. There is also  a 200MWh Battery Energy Storage System co-located with this system.
Stanford embarked on this path in the 1980s, when the university implemented net metering on its facilities for the purpose of understanding how and where energy was being used, and in 2009 the university released its long-range Energy and Climate Action plan. That plan is now in its third edition and includes high-efficiency standards for new buildings, continued efficiency improvements for existing buildings, and the cutting-edge energy supply system known as the Stanford Energy System Innovations (SESI) project.
SESI moved the university from a 100% fossil-fuel-based combined heat and power plant to grid-sourced electricity and a more efficient electric heat recovery system. SESI uses the technology roadmap for building heating and cooling recommended by the International Energy Agency, which the United Nations Environment Programme also recently discussed in a comprehensive report for district-level implementation.
 
Stanford was recognized in 2021 as one of only eleven US universities to achieve the Platinum rating and is the top-ranked doctoral university in the Energy category in the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education’s (AASHE) 2021 Sustainable Campus Index. And Stanford has taken further steps as it transitions to clean energy. It was the first US college or university to issue bonds carrying dual climate and sustainability designations for financing campus construction and renovation projects in 2021 ($375 million). And the school has a goal of zero waste by 2030 (defined as 90% diversion of waste away from the landfill). The current diversion rate is approximately 67% of which waste is composted, re-used, or recycled. In addition, Stanford has implemented a water conservation plan that reduced total campus potable water use by 48% since the program began in 2001.
This article was amended on 3/18/2022 to reflect that Goldman Sachs Renewable Power is now the owner of the Stanford Solar Generating Station #2, having acquired it in 2020 from Recurrent Energy. Also to state that there is energy storage at the facility.

Fourth quarter revenues of $101.7 million represented a 92% increase over the previous year’s results. The company issued strong guidance for the year, estimating 62% revenue growth for 2022, which the company said would outpace the market.
Fourth quarter results came in above the high-end of FTC’s guidance range, and operational expenses met expectations, said president and CEO Sean Hunkler on the earnings call. The completed its initial public offering in 2021 and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as “FTCI”.
“With the recording of a reserve for a potential customer credit impacting revenue and margin by $3 million, Adjusted EBITDA was at the low end of our guidance range. Absent that charge, the sequential gross margin improvement would have been even greater and Adjusted EBITDA above the midpoint of the range,” said Hunkler.
In the fourth quarter, the company inked deals in new international countries, tripled its international pipeline, and launched higher margin products. It also reported increasing steel efficiency by 20%.
“FTC Solar offers a solution that is differentiated in the marketplace and is increasingly recognized by customers as a preferred choice. And we believe we’re on the cusp of profitability with significant growth and margin improvement ahead,” said Hunkler.
In the fourth quarter, GAAP gross loss was $8.6 million, or 8.4% of revenue compared to $8.0 million, or 15.2% of revenue in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross loss was $7.4 million, or 7.3% of revenue. GAAP operating expenses were $15.0 million. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and certain other expenses, operating expenses were $9.0 million, which compares to $6.2 million in the year-ago quarter. FTC attributed the increase to staffing growth expenses and other in-company costs.
The company said it has a contract and award pipeline of $606 million with expected delivery dates in 2022 and beyond.
Acquisition
FTC announced the acquisition of emergent competitor HX Tracker. The China-based supplier of 1P trackers was established in 2019. It said HX Tracker’s low-steel architecture is well suited for large-format modules.
The acquisition is expected to bring growth in China, the Middle East, and Africa said FTC Solar. The company was purchased for $4.3 million in cash and about 1.4 million shares. HX Tracker will also be eligible for an earn-out of approximately 1.6 million shares based on meeting certain performance metrics. Overall, FTC said it estimates the transaction can generate $4 million of EBITDA accretion in 2023, and $7 million in 2024.
