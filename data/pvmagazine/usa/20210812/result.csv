(EVE), a lithium battery development company, which will  become a strategic battery cell supplier for Powin’s Stack products.
According to Powin, the move was made in light of global supply chain challenges and will help ensure that restrictions do not adversely affect the company.
Under the agreement, EVE will supply the same standard form factor of cell that Powin has previously used. Powin said it has secured customer commitments to deliver nearly 500 MWh of Powin Stack products using EVE cells in 2021.
“Powin’s due diligence process reviewed EVE’s cell designs, supply chain, factory processes, R&D capability, financial strength and safety and quality controls and concluded that EVE should be considered in the same class as other Tier 1 cell vendors,” said Geoff Brown, CEO of Powin.
Stack360 will be Powin’s first product to use EVE cells. Production will begin in August, with deliveries scheduled through the end of the year.
Analyst firm Guidehouse Insights recently ranked Powin as a leading utility-scale energy storage system integrator, along with  Tesla, Fluence, RES, and other market players.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/12/xos-unveils-mobile-charging-station-for-ev-fleets/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Xos unveils mobile charging station for EV fleets,"Xos, Inc., a manufacturer of fully electric commercial vehicles has announced the release of Xos Hub, a mobile charging station for EV fleets. The tow-behind unit can be deployed in the fleet yard without having to wait for a traditional infrastructure installation, said Xos.
The mobile unit can charge up to five vehicles simultaneously with its CCS1 charge port connectors, and fits in two standard parking spots.
It can hold up to 3 MWh of energy storage and has 480v single and three-phase inputs. Solar panels on the roof of the unit power the cloud-enabled control and safety system.
The company also offers an on-demand infrastructure-as-a-service platform for site evaluation, energy storage development and installation, and energy management services.
The announcement of Xos Hub follows a recent business combination with NextGen Acquisition Corporation.
As the Biden administration announced its target of 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030 for the U.S., creative commercial solutions arise to address the need of rapid electrification. Charging access is often seen as a bottleneck for electric vehicle adoption, and Xos’ solution is one way to alleviate said bottleneck.
Work is already underway at the federal level to address the EV charging constraint, and recently the Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) announced a $62 million package for decarbonization of the transportation sector. The VTO said it will support expansion of EV infrastructure, hosting community-level EV demonstrations and installing EV charging within multi-unit housing, among other activities.

The proposed project would also entail the buildout of 20 MW/80 MWh of battery energy storage capacity.
The northern NY facility, close to Ottawa, Canada, is expected to generate $24 million in direct payments for the Town of Canton, and St. Lawrence County’s local school district and will be proposed through a combination of Payment in Lieu of Taxes and property tax payments, said EDF Renewables.
At peak, EDF said the construction will provide approximately 300 jobs, and will last two years, starting late 2023 and reaching commercial operation late 2025. The project is subject to approval, and currently is in an exploration stage, with aerial photographs scheduled this fall, and civil engineering planned for this upcoming winter.

Named Rich Road Solar, the project is expected to generate enough photovoltaic energy to power more than 75,000 New York households.
Before the project is built, 78 miles of transmission lines called the Moses-Adirondack line, constructed by the federal government in 1942, will need to be rebuilt. This phase is slated to be completed in 2023.
The project joins EDF’s larger pipeline of large scale solar and wind projects in New York, including the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority-approved 119 MW Tracy solar project, just south of Rich Road’s site, and western New York’s 94 MW Moraine project.
EDF said the construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of the plant will create opportunities for local business in the hospitality, material supply, and construction services sectors. Three or four full-time high-skill jobs will remain during the 35+ year operating life of the project.
Coupling the project with batteries follows a trend across the country of PV facilities being built with storage capabilities. While the NY-ISO has the lowest penetration of hybrid solar/storage projects proposed for interconnection (5%, California ISO is 89%), data suggest that deployment of this type of facility will continue to grow.

The solar total for the three projects is 965 MWac, roughly 1.20 GWdc, and 100 MW/400 MWh of energy storage.

For the 200 MWac Victory Pass Project and the adjacent 265 MWac Arica Solar Project, the BLM has opened its comment period and uploaded a collection of documents analyzing the potential impacts of the facilities. The 500 MWac Oberon Solar facility is expected to have documents uploaded and available for comment in the near future.
The Victory facility signed 15 year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with two California Community Choice Aggregators: Silicon Valley Clean Energy Authority and Central Coast Community Energy. The Arica project signed its own collection of PPAs, one of which is a 15-year contract with the Clean Power Alliance for 93.5 MWac of solar plus 71 MW of storage.
Victory facility’s PPA implies that there will be four hours of 100 MW battery capacity between the two adjacent sites.
The three projects were identified as suitable for development within the BLM’s 10.8 million acre share of the Desert Energy Conservation Plan issued by the State of California, the BLM, and other stakeholders. The plan seeks to balance the environment and development within the 22.5 million acre southeast California desert ecosystem.

Most of the documentation uploaded for BLM analysis is environmentally focused.
After refining the layout to avoid much of the desert dry wash woodland and sensitive plant species, the Ariva and Victory Pass fence lines were drawn to contain 2,665 acres of solar + storage, and an additional 50 acres for power lines, switchgear, and roads.
The plants would be wired to the power grid via a 3.2-mile shared overhead 230 kV transmission line that interconnects with the grid via the Southern California Edison Red Bluff Substation.

The documentation notes that during operation and maintenance periods, water would be required for panel washing, maintenance, and cleaning the substation restroom facilities. Both facilities are projected to require 15 to 25 acre-feet of water per year. An acre foot of water is 325,851 gallons; about enough to cover a football field with a foot of water.
The facilities are located in an area with multiple other solar facilities, including the Palen Solar Power Plant, Athos Power Plant facilities, Desert Harvest I & II, and the Desert Sunlight facility.

These latest solar facilities are located between two highways, California 177 and I-10. From an environmental and logistical perspective, this is an important variable in the project as evidenced by the 70-page transportation analysis in the Arica/Victory documentation.
Truck deliveries that are expected during the peak construction period of months six through 10, will total nearly 65 per week. During construction, the site will average 468 work commutes to the sites, with a maximum of 1,016 workers commuting during peak construction.
The Joshua Tree National Park is around six miles north of the Arica/Victory facilities. Joshua Tree has some of the darkest nights in Southern California and was designated an International Dark Sky Park.

Other areas near the facility include the Palen-Forn Playa Dunes, Chuckwalla, the Palen Dry Lake, Corn Springs, Alligator Rock, and the Desert Lily Preserve.
These “Areas of Critical Environmental Concern” start 300 feet south of the site for the Chuckwalla’s 514,000 acres of land, through the Desert Lily Preserve area 2.25 miles north of the facilities.
Recently, an 850 MWac solar power facility was withdrawn from BLM consideration in Nevada after local pushback and development considerations.

The most recent entry in this series looked at the report’s investigation of targeted campaigns, almost always focused at the state level, that have been undertaken by utilities and utility front groups to undermine residential solar in the eastern U.S.
Attempts to discourage rooftop solar development aren’t limited to the East, however, and the report outlines action that has occurred west of the Mississippi, even in states with massive solar potential.
In 2017, the Illinois Legislature passed the Future Energy Jobs Act, designed to support the state’s growing solar industry by ensuring that rooftop solar customers would receive full net metering credits for excess generation. Once customer generation reached 5% of the utility’s peak demand, the credits would be partially replaced with payments based on the value of solar to the grid. Regulators were to investigate how that value would be calculated once residential solar reached 3% of peak demand.

In April 2020, Ameren, the company that that runs the distribution system for electricity customers in about three-fourths of Illinois, announced that it had reached the 3% benchmark, triggering the evaluation investigation.
In response, solar advocates questioned Ameren’s calculations, asserting that the company was attempting to end net metering early. In July 2020, an Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) administrative law judge ruled that Ameren had calculated the percentage of rooftop solar power inaccurately. The judge asked Ameren to continue full net metering until the ICC could complete its audit of the utility’s calculations. Ameren declined.
In October 2020, Ameren announced it had reached the 5% threshold, and said new solar customers would no longer receive full retail net metering. Instead, they would receive rebates at some future point; the rebates worked out to be about half of the expected value.
This caused pricing uncertainty, which, according to the report, slowed residential installations and disrupted project payback timelines.
In December 2020, the ICC released a final order finding that Ameren had indeed miscalculated residential solar levels and inflated the apparent reach of distributed energy. The commission voted to order Ameren to restore full net metering credits and to make whole any customers who had signed up after October 2, 2020 and had not received full net metering credits.
According to the report, Ameren is still promoting methodologies that show it has reached the 5% cap.
Kansas had fewer than 1,300 residential solar energy systems at the end of 2019. Just 0.23% of the state’s power came from solar energy that year, despite the state having a high solar potential.
The report asserts that this is likely due in part to the state’s utility rate design that allows Evergy – Kansas’ largest utility – to charge solar customers extra fees, thus reducing the benefits for solar customers and discouraging others from adopting the resource.

The report alleges that, in 2014, the two investor-owned utilities (IOU) that have since merged to form Evergy (Westar Energy and Kansas City Power & Light), along with another utility, District Electric, and a number of front groups, including one claimed to be a Koch-backed group, lobbied for bills introduced in the Kansas House and Senate to eliminate the state’s net metering policy.
Net metering was not repealed outright, but an amended bill was passed. That measure reduced the value of the power solar owners sell back to the grid and reduced the size of solar installations that qualify for net metering.
In late 2018, Evergy instituted a demand fee for customers with residential solar installations regardless of the total amount of energy used. Regulators approved the fees, which were $3 per kilowatt of peak demand in each billing period during the winter and $9 in the summer.
In April 2020, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the utilities and regulators had engaged in illegal price discrimination against customers with solar installations and remanded the issue back to the regulators. Regulators have since ruled unanimously against both Evergy’s demand fee and minimum charge proposals in its central territory, although other service territories remain saddled with the fees.
Even the state with the most installed solar capacity and the highest percentage of electricity generated by solar has not always been the most residential-friendly environment.
The state’s renewable electricity standard and Million Solar Roofs program have helped spur the growth of solar energy, and rate structures that make rooftop solar power a financially viable option for millions.
According to surveys cited by the report, 71% of state voters want the state to encourage more use of solar power, and another 14% want to at least maintain the status quo. 80% of state voters support net metering, and 64% oppose proposals to reduce net metering benefits for state solar owners. So where’s the issue?

California’s three IOUs, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SoCal Edison) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), recently proposed changes to the state’s net metering program that would impose mandatory fees on solar customers and slash net metering payments.
These proposals were filed for consideration under the state’s ongoing process of updating its net metering rules (NEM 3.0), which you can read about here and, more recently, here.
On March 15, the three utilities issued their proposal for the next version of net metering, which included high solar fixed charges and severe cutbacks to net metering payments. SDG&E seeks a charge of almost $91/month on average for residential solar owners, while PG&E seeks $86/month on average and SoCal Edison $56/month on average, all among the highest such fees ever proposed in the country.
What’s mores, schools installing solar would need to pay an estimated $3,400/month in SDG&E territory, with SoCal Edison charging $1,100/month and PG&E charging $950/month.The utilities also seek to block solar power owners from rolling unused credits over from month to month, substantially cutting the value of solar power.
The report asserted that the utilities looked to the cost-shift defense, following the playbook of understating the benefits that rooftop solar delivers for electricity customers and the grid at large.
Rooftop solar’s ability to reduce the need for investments in long-distance transmission capacity is especially accute in California, yet utilities weren’t required until 2020 to calculate this and other avoided costs, such as distributed solar’s ability to create a more flexible and resilient power system, in the value provided by distributed solar power.
The report argued that if these criteria had been historically factored into calculation in good faith, then the utilities would find that the value provided by distributed solar often exceeds the compensation provided to its owners under net metering.
The next part of the series will outline recommended solutions offered by the report’s authors to counter anti-distributed solar efforts.

They produced a GIS-based interactive map that analyzes where, and how much solar is needed to reach at least 50% of the energy demands for each state.
The map allows users to modify numbers, tweaking the percentage of load needed to be met by solar power, adjusting the locational ground efficiency of PV panels, and modifying land use types with varied suitability for solar deployment.
The researchers reported their findings in a paper published in Solar Energy. They said that oversized/curtailed PV can meet half of U.S. energy demand firmly and affordably, and that the capacity would occupy 0.25% of the total continental U.S. land surface.
Image: University of Albany
The map showed there is more than enough suitable land in every state. A combination of building footprints and rights-of-way for high-voltage power lines together could supply most of the required space. 
In order to reach a 50% PV penetration figure, the researchers estimated 3.8 terrawatts of solar would be enough to meet electric, transportation, and building sector demands.
The university’s Senior Atmospheric Scientist Richard Perez and his co-authors arrived at their deployment estimates by contrasting two approaches, analyzing both a “top-down” approach with global land use data, and a “bottom-up” approach that accounted for only land areas open to PV deployment that also would not require a change of function (for example, transmission right-of-way.)
Both approaches suggested that enough room exists not only for a 50% PV penetration, but that every state can accommodate 100% PV. The Washington, D.C. region would be accommodated by solar capacity in neighboring Virginia and Maryland.
Image: University of Albany
Perez said there is a growing misunderstanding that there is not enough space to accommodate solar PV, or that arrays will destroy farmland and pollute the water. He said the map provides realistic numbers to refute these arguments. PV penetration, usable land types, and ground efficiency are all adjustable, so if users do not agree with the researchers’ specific assumptions, they can be changed and verified.
Perez has earlier argued for a strategy that he calls “implicit storage” in which renewable capacity is oversized, and energy curtailment is used. This is an alternative way to bridge the gap between intermittent renewable production and customer demand, something that rising energy storage deployment seeks to address.
