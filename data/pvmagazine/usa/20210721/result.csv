The service is made possible by Mapdwell, a division of Palmetto, which provides actionable data tools including remote site assessment and solar potential mapping technology, licensed from MIT. Mapdwell is able to accurately map three-dimensional rooftop geometry and determine solar access for every square meter of the roof, for every hour of the year. The technology takes into account variables like shading from neighboring buildings, the role of existing vegetation and other obstructions, and local weather data.
While currently available in 24 states, founder of Mapdwell and Palmetto Executive Vice President, Eduardo Berlin, shares that the company is in the process of building it out to cover the entire country.
On top of Mapdwell, Palmetto’s existing planning service allows potential customers to quickly estimate utility costs saved by switching to solar, supplementing their per-installation services with long-term monitoring and lifetime system support.

The projects will use the NX Horizon smart solar trackers and TrueCapture yield optimization software from Nextracker.
The 415 MW Radian project in Texas and the 313 MW Athos III project in California are expected to begin construction later this year, and will enter service in 2022. Series 6 photovoltaic solar modules will be supplied by First Solar for both projects.
The projects are the second set of utility-scale solar projects that Nextracker and Intersect Power have worked on together in the two states. The earlier portfolio of five projects is under construction, and has a combined installed capacity of more than 1.7 GW. Signal Energy was the EPC firm on three of the five.
Both Radian and Athos III will use Nextracker’s TrueCapture tracker optimization and control software to capture additional energy gain during diffuse light conditions. The technology continuously refines the tracking algorithm of each individual solar array in response to existing site and weather conditions. Nextracker said the software can deliver energy gains from 2-6%.
According to the most recent data available, more than 17 GW of solar had interconnection agreements in hand in Texas at the start of June, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. Nearly 2.1 GW of battery energy storage capacity also had secured interconnection agreements.

The principles aim to address inequities caused by climate change and the energy transition, specifically for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color community members, among others. 
“We envision a solar-powered future that invests in under-resourced communities, creates local, sustainable wealth, and adds to community resilience and a healthier future for all,” said Denise Abdul-Rahman, national field organizer for the NAACP environmental and climate justice program. 
Studies have shown that low-income and communities of color bear higher levels of exposure to pollution from fossil fuel-based energy production. The U.S. 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and presents an opportunity for future exploration and incorporation into policy development, said NAACP.

The project contains a 20MW/80MWh (4 hour) standalone battery energy storage system using GE’s Reservoir energy storage technology. The system is supported by a 20-year Resource Adequacy Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).
This grid-connected battery energy storage system represents a step forward in Calpine’s plans to expand its energy storage footprint. The California facility itself will be able to be expanded in future phases.
In late June, Arevon Asset Management opened the 100 MW / 400 MWh Saticoy battery energy storage system in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles.
The system was acquired by Arevon, a unit of global asset management firm Capital Dynamics, in May, together with infrastructure developer S&B USA Energy. Capital Dynamics owns 51% of the project and S&B USA the remaining 49%.

Electricity from the site is supplied to Southern California Edison under the terms of a 20-year purchase and sale agreement. The project was developed by Strata Clean Energy.
The system uses 142 Megapacks, Tesla’s utility-scale battery storage product. It also will use a battery storage performance management platform from Power Factors. The decision to build the Saticoy battery came after local residents and community leaders helped stop plans for a proposed gas peaker plant. Arevon completed the project in nine months. Energy stored on the site can power the city of Oxnard for four hours or all of Ventura County for 30 minutes.
Those project are among the 2,000 MW of energy storage capacity that is expected to enter service in California by August 1. Much of this capacity will have four hours of battery energy sitting behind it, nearly 8,000 MWh in total.
That storage capacity is already being felt on the state’s grid. In the early evening on July 9, California’s main grid noted that energy storage injected 999 MW of power during a “flex event” where rolling blackouts might otherwise have occurred.
Two of the world’s largest lithium ion batteries contributed to these capacity values, and backed up the grid during the flex event.
The first is LS Power’s 230MW lithium ion energy storage facility, which was scheduled to increase from 230 MWh to 690 MWh by this summer, and add more capacity at a later date. This plant is, for a moment anyway, one of the world’s largest lithium ion grid-connected batteries.
The second facility is Moss Landing’s 300 MW / 1,200 MWh facility, which joined the grid in December 2020. This facility might soon expand to 1.5 GW / 6 GWh.

The report has been developed as a part of the groups’ 30 Million Solar Homes campaign, and builds on previously identified policies that could help to spur this rapid adoption.
For context, consider that, as of the end of the first quarter the U.S. solar industry has installed 102.8 GW of capacity, enough to power roughly 18.6 million homes. Over the next five years, the country is expected to install an additional 160 GW.
The 30 Million Solar Homes campaign is working to achieve a distributed energy buildout unlike anything seen on any scale with renewables. Those 30 million homes would equate to 151 GW in new solar capacity, almost 50% more than all the solar capacity currently in place.
This proposed capacity is equivalent to shuttering 48 coal power plants for a year or taking 42 million cars off the road for a year. 
Along with job creation, installing solar on 30 million homes would lead to 100 GW of the 151 GW of proposed capacity being installed in marginalized communities, helping to improve access equity to solar and easing the historic economic imbalance of the resource. The benefits of local solar are particularly important for these communities as many have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and face a slow economic recovery.
The 30 Million Solar Homes initiative would also create an expected $69 billion in electricity bill savings, further helping economic recovery for marginalized communities. Starting in the sixth year of the program, if enacted, the installed solar would continue to generate bill savings of $30 billion annually.
All of this capacity will come with a cost, and in total, the 30 Million Solar Homes initiative calls for the federal government to invest more than $500 billion into local solar and other relevant clean energy and energy justice efforts.

The initiative asks the Department of the Treasury to improve two existing tax incentives: the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (HTC). The proposal would restore both the residential and commercial tax credits – currently at 26% and scheduled for reductions in 2023 – to 30% for the next 10 years (including a gradual sunset period), expands ITC access by transforming it into a direct pay option for residential and commercial projects under 2 MW, and would explicitly allow non-taxable entities to participate, such as local governments and rural electric cooperatives.
The proposal also outlines three additional incentives:
As for the HTC, the report proposes modifications to prioritize projects with on-site solar energy that provides a direct financial benefit to residents, such as through electricity bill credits.
The proposal also call on the Department of Energy to provide loan guarantees for equitable community solar projects; reauthorize clean energy block grants for state, tribal, territorial, and local governments; establish solar + storage grants for resiliency in marginalized communities; institute solar grants for schools to reinvest energy savings into operations; and establish grants for developing residential and community solar in marginalized communities.
Included are also proposals for some general quality of life and ease of service measures, like expansion and widespread adoption of virtual, automated solar permitting.

Chinese PV module maker Longi has achieved a power conversion efficiency rating of 25.19% for a TOPCon solar cell.
The achievement, which has been confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH), is purportedly a world record for a p-type TOPCon cell.
“Adhering to the development idea with result-orientation, choosing the proper technology direction based on the essence of technology, focusing on the development and mass production incubation of industry-leading technology products, firmly grasping the technological frontier, to win the future with strong technology output, and leading the technological change of the industry, are always our persistence,” said Dr. Li Hua, the director of the Longi Solar Cell R&D Center.
The company did not reveal how it achieved the efficiency increase.
In January 2019, Longi announced an efficiency rating of 24.06% for a monocrystalline p-type PERC cell on the front side. In June of this year, it recorded a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon cell. It also unveiled a new n-type, TOPCon bifacial module with 22.3% efficiency.

Demand for residential solar installations is “through the roof,” said Eric White, CEO of Dividend Finance, a top three provider of solar loans that partners with contractors to provide homeowners with financing.
He said that the residential solar market is throttled somewhat by supply chain and labor availability concerns, along with transportation and logistics bottlenecks. Even so, loan demand has grown 100% between the second quarter of 2020 and 2021. He said he expected no softening of demand through the end of the year and that the total number of projects that make it through to completion could grow by as much as 35-40% compared to last year.
White spoke during a recent webinar hosted by Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners. They were joined by Dan Javan, president and CEO of Suntuity, a top-10 solar installer; and Chuck Norris, strategic account manager with Gexpro, an electrical supply house.

Javan said that demand growth has been fueled in part by the emergence of origination platforms Solo and Nomo Energy, which got a boost in the stay-at-home days of the pandemic. As a result, they moved from little more than a blip on the project origination chart to spawning 20,000 to 25,000 transactions a month, each.
The online platforms marry origination and delivery capacity. “Covid led to a pivot to these platforms,” Javan said, and their backers have put a lot of capital into building them out.
Given the relative novelty of these platforms, White said that many forecast analysts have “grossly underestimated” residential solar growth.
Norris agreed that growth is exceeding projections based on what was expected to be a recovery from 2020. He said that supply chain issues mean that “everything that can be produced is being installed.” The rising tide seems to be lifting all boats, including manufacturers with smaller market shares. He said that rapid demand growth is likely to continue through the end of the year, even breaking through what traditionally has been a seasonal slowdown in the winter months.
Both seasonality and the overall economics of a residential rooftop solar installation are less of a concern to potential solar customers who are eager to install a system, he said.
One question is whether or not manufacturers can keep up with the demand. Norris said that he was less concerned about the availability of modules than he is about the supply of inverters. He said that inverter production has increased more slowly than demand, in part due to manufacturers’ worries about exposed capital if demand slows.
No less worrisome is the supply of semiconductors, whose constrained supply has troubled a range of electronics-based industries, including auto-making. The solar industry is at a disadvantage when it comes to competing against industrial behemoths for scarce chip resources and other raw materials.
“The supply chain can barely keep up with demand,” Javan said. “If you build it, we will consume it.”
