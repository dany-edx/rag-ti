https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/10/redwood-secures-2-billion-doe-loan-to-manufacture-battery-materials-in-u-s/,"BATTERY,EV,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,NEVADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023",Redwood secures $2 billion DOE loan to manufacture battery materials in U.S.,"Redwood Materials received a conditional loan commitment of $2 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) for the construction and expansion of a battery materials campus in McCarran, Nevada.
Redwood will manufacture anode and cathode materials, in part from recycled materials, which are used for the EV battery market. Together, these components amount to nearly 80% of the material cost of a lithium-ion battery, and currently they are manufactured overseas. According to the company, U.S. battery cell manufacturers are estimated to offshore more than $150 billion in value by 2030.
The company has a manufacturing facility that is already built and operational in northern Nevada, currently producing anode copper foil. The $2 billion DOE loan is supporting the construction and expansion of a gigafactory in McCarran, Nevada.
Panasonic is the first customer for copper foil at the Nevada factory.
The DOE LPO said that, once operational the Nevada gigafactory will be the first domestic facility to produce anode copper foil and cathode active materials in a closed-loop lithium-ion battery manufacturing process by recycling end-of-life battery and production scrap and remanufacturing that feedstock into critical materials.
Anode copper foil and cathode active material are the two most critical components of lithium-ion battery manufacturing for EVs, according to a release from the DOE. The company intends to use both new and recycled feedstocks, which are made up of critical materials including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. It will produce an estimated 36,000 metric tons per year of ultra-thin battery-grade copper foil for use as the anode current collector, and approximately 100,000 metric tons per year of cathode active materials.
The company says on average it can recover at least 95% of the critical battery elements (including lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper), and use these metals to manufacture anode and cathode components.
Redwood Materials’ Nevada operation already recycles end-of-life batteries from consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, and other electronic waste, repurposing these feedstocks into critical components that help support the domestic lithium-ion battery supply chain.
Redwood expects to produce 100 GWh per year of battery materials, enough to produce more than 1 million EVs each year. The DOE Loans Program Office estimates that 1 million EVs will reduce annual gasoline consumption by over 395 million gallons and avoiding more than 3.5 million tons of CO2 emissions each year.
This project marks a significant step toward meeting the Biden Administration’s target of seeing 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 being zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles.
Redwood expects to create 3,400 construction jobs and approximately 1,600 full-time employees. The company is expected to rely on a construction workforce made up of union, minority and/or woman-owned business enterprises in the construction of the project.
Redwood has additional plants for construction in Kansas, expected to come online in 2025, and South Carolina, which is to begin construction in Q1 2023.  The company has partnerships with Audi, Volkswagen Group and Toyota for the supply and repurposing of battery components.
Redwood Materials, headquartered in Carson City, Nev., was founded by J.B. Straubel, co-founder and former chief technology officer of Tesla. Redwood focuses on recycling battery materials, developing a fully closed loop for lithium-ion batteries.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/10/duke-energy-reports-q4-loss-pending-job-cuts/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,FLORIDA,INDIANA,KENTUCKY,NORTH CAROLINA,OHIO,SOUTH CAROLINA,TENNESSEE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023","Duke Energy reports Q4 loss, pending job cuts","Duke Energy reported a $531 million loss in Q4 2022 as it wrote down the value of its commercial renewable energy business currently on the auction block. The utility also announced plans to cut $300 million in expenses in 2023, partly through layoffs out of its Charlotte, N.C. headquarters.
During its Q4 2022 earnings call, chief financial officer Brian Savoy did not say how many jobs are being cut, but said the measure includes a “modest” number of staff as well as external contractors and consultants.
The investor-owned utility reported FY22 earnings per share of $3.33, considerably lower than reported EPS of $4.94 in FY21. Its reported earnings per share (EPS) is down based on the impairment on the sale of the commercial renewable energy business.
“Our path forward is clear and underpinned by the strength of our regulated businesses, a disciplined approach to cost management and a robust (five-year) $65 billion capital plan,” said Lynn Good, chief executive office of Duke. “We’re well positioned to earn solidly within our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2027.”
In November 2022, Duke Energy launched an auction for its commercial renewable energy platform, which is expected to close in the second half of 2023. Good said the utility is “on track to exit both the utility scale and the distributed energy businesses” this year.
Duke’s five-year capital plan of $65 billion is focused on energy transition investments, which Savoy said was considerable increase over previous multi-year budgets, while its current budget removes almost $3 billion of capital it would have invested in the utility solar and distributed generation business. In other words, the utility is increasing its regulated business spending by $5 billion, for which Duke says will result in a 7.1% earnings-based CAGR growth rate through 2027.
Savoy defended the company’s book value of the commercial renewables portfolio platform at $3 billion, despite the utility writing down a $1.3 billion impairment charge since the sale process launched in Q3 2022.  This led analysts to deduce the renewables platform will see proceeds of less than $1.7 billion.
Duke’s Q4 2022 results was marred by severe weather from winter storms hitting the southeast region, which forced its primary utility business Duke Energy Carolinas to issue a curtailment and power conservation notice during the Christmas week. Earlier in the month, up to 45,000 residents were in the dark in Moore County, N.C., due to a reported shooting incident at two sub-stations that were under investigation by the FBI, regional and local law enforcement.
Duke Energy initiated a sale process for its commercial renewables business, which includes a 3.5 GW wind and solar portfolio, in September 2022. In November the company said the value for the renewables business could exceed a book value of $4 billion. Media outlets including Infralogic reported the utility is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities for the review of its renewables platform.
Duke’s common shares traded at $97.55 per share today, up 4.65% from $93.22 per share on Nov. 2, when it reported Q3 2022 earnings. The utility has a $75.1 billion market capitalization and provides electric services to 8.2 million customers in six states, and gas services to 1.6 million customers in five states.
The utility has a 2030 goal of achieving net zero natural gas fleet emissions and a 50% reduction in gas emissions from its electric business, with full net zero emissions by 2050. The company continues to invest in grid enhancements including energy storage, hydrogen and advanced nuclear technologies.
Last week, the utility completed construction on a 2 MW solar and 4.4 MWh storage project in Hot Springs, N.C., an Appalachian town with population of just 500.  The microgrid uses lithium batteries from Wärtsilä Energy and provides grid reliability services to the electric grid, such as frequency and voltage regulation and ramping support and capacity during system peak power usage.
“Duke Energy has numerous smaller microgrids on our system, but this is our first microgrid that can power an entire small town if its main power line experiences an outage,” said Jason Handley, general manager of Duke Energy’s Distributed Energy Group.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/10/the-top-five-u-s-sports-stadium-solar-adopters/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023",The top five U.S. sports stadium solar adopters,"This weekend, Super Bowl LVII takes place between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the State Farm stadium in Phoenix, Arizona. Each year, the NFL and other sports leagues move closer towards covering their electricity usage with solar energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) tracks this clean energy progress.
Last year, over 40 million Americans attended a solar-powered sports event. If everyone watching the Super Bowl at home and at bars had rooftop solar, another 100 million solar-powered sports fan experiences would take place.
NFL stadiums lead the way with 32% of stadiums powered by onsite solar arrays, according to SEIA.  The Major League Baseball (MLB) league and the National Basketball Association (NBA) utilize solar on 30% of their stadiums. Sports arenas are a big drag on the grid, with as much as 10 MW of electricity pulled every game. At the steep rate this author paid on his most recent electric bill of $0.39 per kWh, that would equate to $3.9 million per game in electricity costs alone. Owning solar assets offers a shield to ever-rising utility rates, both for homeowners and stadium owners alike.
SEIA offered a list of the five largest stadium solar installations across each major sports league. Where does your team rank?
5. FedEx Field
Home of the NFL’s Washington Commanders, Fedex Field sports a 2 MW array. An early adopter, the team installed more than 8,000 panels onsite, making the array one of the largest in the D.C. area. The system meets 20% of gameday operation needs and covers all of non-gameday power usage.
4. America First Field
Major League Soccer makes the list as Sandy, Utah’s America First Field ranks fourth with 2 MW of capacity installed. Home to Real Salt Lake, the stadium has 73% of its total energy consumption covered by the 6,423 panels installed on site. It is the largest solar array investment in Major League Soccer.
3. Capital One Arena
The Washington Capitals of the NHL and the NBA’s Washington Wizards both play at Capital One Arena, which purchases power from a 3.5 MW offsite installation in nearby Maryland. It ranks as the second-largest offsite procurement of renewable energy in U.S. sports.
2. Lincoln Financial Field
The Philadelphia Eagles are headed to the Super Bowl, and back home they have another accomplishment to be proud of. Nicknamed “The Linc,” Philadelphia’s football stadium has an 11,000 panel array packing in 4 MW of power capacity. The team is expected to save over $60 million over the life of the array, which covered about one-third of the stadium’s annual energy usage. It was installed in 2013, making the Eagles a pioneering solar sports team.
The Eagles run a live production tracker for those who are interested in seeing the system in operation.
1. Golden 1 Center
Taking the top spot by a good measure, the NBA’s Sacramento Kings stadium sports an 8.6 MW portfolio. The Golden 1 Center uses a mix of both onsite and offsite installations and represents 58% of the capacity installed at NBA arenas. It is the world’s first arena to be 100% solar powered year-round.
