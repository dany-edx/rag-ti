Andrew M. Cuomo unveiled a host of initiatives to add renewable energy, build transmission, and boost the clean energy economy.
“Green energy is a pressing moral imperative and a prime economic opportunity,” said Cuomo. He said the green energy program would create 12,400 MW of green energy “to power 6 million homes, directly create more than 50,000 jobs, and spur $29 billion in private investment all across the state.”
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) highlighted the governor’s 2021 plans in an announcement. According to NYSERDA, the state has already entered public-private partnerships over the past five years to construct 68 new large-scale renewable energy facilities. Those projects total 6.1 GW and are expected to generate more than $12 billion of investment.
To build on that, New York will contract for another 24 large-scale projects this year, bringing the state’s total clean energy build-out to nearly 100 projects. The 23 solar farms and one hydroelectric facility are expected to total 2.2 GW, generate more than $2.9 billion of investment, and create 3,400 jobs.
New York is also embracing offshore wind power. The state plans to contract with Equinor Wind US LLC to develop two new offshore wind farms totaling 2.49 GW. According to NYSERDA, the state has also secured commitments from companies to make wind turbine components and help turn New York into what it called a “global wind energy manufacturing powerhouse.”
To prepare the future workforce, the state is investing $20 million in a new Offshore Wind Training Institute based at SUNY Stony Brook and Farmingdale State College.
Once the large-scale renewable and offshore wind farms are complete, NYSDERA said it expects more than half of New York’s electricity to come from renewable sources, putting the state ahead of schedule to meet its 70% by 2030 clean energy standard.
New York will also continue developing and deploying energy storage technology. To that end, the New York Power Authority (NYPA) has begun construction on a 20 MW battery project in northern New York, one of the largest projects in the state’s growing portfolio of almost 1 GW of contracted storage projects. According to NYSERDA, these projects will help meet the electricity demands of 1.2 million New York homes using renewable energy.
Then there’s the need for more transmission. To support the proliferation of renewables and avoid “unnecessary congestion” costs, the state will construct a 250-mile “green energy transmission superhighway” totaling $2 billion. Construction has already started on NYPA’s 86-mile Smart Path project, and construction will soon start on several key projects in other regions.
Furthermore, New York has issued a request for proposals for transmission arteries to bring renewable energy from upstate New York and Canada to New York City. According to NYSERDA, current and planned transmission investments will result in more than 1,000 jobs and $5 billion of public- and private-sector investment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/13/agencies-release-final-report-into-californias-heat-related-blackouts/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 13, 2021",Agencies release final report into California’s heat-related blackouts,"The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) issued its final root cause report into the rolling blackouts that hit the state last August.
The report confirmed the CAISO’s initial findings that a trio of factors were responsible for the blackouts: extreme weather conditions, resource adequacy and planning processes, and market practices.
The final report includes additional analysis of how a range of energy resources performed, including solar, energy storage, and natural gas.
(Read the final report.)
It also outlines steps that have been taken in advance of the summer 2021 demand peak to better ensure supply adequacy and reliability.
“This final report confirms our initial findings and reaffirms that our agencies are taking the right actions to update processes and strengthen California’s grid in the face of this crisis and worsening climate impacts,” said California Energy Commission (CEC) Chair David Hochschild.
On Aug. 14 and 15, 2020, the CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in California in the midst of an extreme heat wave. Following these emergency events, Governor Gavin Newsom requested a report on the root causes of the events leading to the August outages.
A preliminary report was issued in early October. This latest report serves as the Final Root Cause Analysis and incorporates additional data analysis not available when the preliminary report was published.
The final report includes analysis by the CAISO, CEC and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on how specific resource types performed during the August and September extreme heat waves.

The CPUC said it has improved the methods for estimating the reliability megawatt value of solar and wind, but the reliability value of intermittent resources is still over-estimated during the net peak hour. It said that improvements to the resource adequacy program should account for time-dependent capabilities of intermittent resources.
The report said that around 200 MW of battery storage resources were available in the CAISO market during the mid-August events and in early September. However, drawing specific conclusions about fleet performance was difficult due to the small sample size. The CAISO said it will continue to track and seek to understand the collective behavior of the battery storage fleet and work with storage providers to “incentivize and align” storage charge and discharge behavior with reliability needs.
The report said that under very high temperatures, ambient derates are not uncommon for the natural gas fleet, and high temperatures reduce these resources’ efficiency. After the emergency, the CEC hosted a workshop to explore potential technology options for increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the existing natural gas power plant fleet. The CPUC followed up by issuing a ruling intended to get the most out the gas fleet.
“All reasonable efforts should be made to increase the efficiency of the existing fleet” of gas-fired power plants, the report said.
The report stood by its initial assessment that three factors were primarily responsible for last summer’s blackouts: extreme weather conditions, resource adequacy and planning processes, and market practices.
It said that the climate change-induced extreme heat wave across the western United States resulted in demand for electricity exceeding existing electricity resource adequacy and planning targets.
Taking into account 35 years of weather data, the extreme heat wave experienced in August was a 1-in-30 year weather event in California, the report said. In addition, this climate change-induced extreme heat wave extended across the western United States. The resulting demand for electricity exceeded the existing electricity resource planning targets and resources in neighboring areas were also strained.

The report also said that resource planning targets “have not kept pace” to ensure sufficient resources that can be relied upon to meet demand in the early evening hours. This made balancing demand and supply more challenging during the extreme heat wave.
The rotating outages both occurred after the period of gross peak demand, during the “net demand peak,” which is the peak of demand net of solar and wind generation resources. With the current resource mix, behind-the-meter and front-of-meter (utility scale) solar generation declines in the late afternoon at a faster rate than demand decreases, the report said. This is because air conditioning and other loads previously being served by solar comes back on the bulk electric system. Resource mix changes and
the timing of the net peak have increased the challenge of maintaining system reliability.
“This challenge is amplified during an extreme heat wave,” it said.
The report said that since 2016, the CAISO, CPUC, and CEC have worked to examine the impacts of significant renewable penetration on the grid. By performing modeling that simulates each hour of the day, not just the gross peak, the resource adequacy program “has adjusted for this change in resource mix by identifying reliability problems now seen later in the day” during the net demand peak. However, the report said that additional work is needed to ensure that sufficient resources are available to serve load during the net peak period and other potential periods of system strain.
Finally, the report said that some practices in the day-ahead energy market “exacerbated the supply challenges under highly stressed conditions.”

It said that a subset of energy market practices contributed to the inability to obtain or prioritize energy to serve the CAISO load in the day-ahead market that could have otherwise relieved the strained conditions on August 14 and 15. Practices which obscured the tight physical supply conditions included under-scheduling of demand in the day-ahead market by load serving entities or their scheduling coordinators, and “convergence bidding.” The report defined this as a form of financial energy trading used to converge day-ahead and real-time pricing.
In addition, the CAISO implemented a market enhancement in prior years. In combination with real-time scheduling priority rules, this enhancement “inadvertently caused the CAISO’s day-ahead Residual Unit Commitment process to fail to detect and respond to the obscuring effects of under scheduling and convergence bidding” during August’s stressed operating conditions.
Although the CAISO said it is now “actively developing solutions” to these market design issues, most of the day-ahead supply challenges encountered were addressed in the real-time market as a result of additional cleared market imports, energy imbalance market transfers and other emergency purchases.
Since August, the CAISO, CPUC and CEC have taken a number of actions in an effort to prepare California for extreme heat waves this summer without having to resort to rotating outages.
Those actions and efforts include:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/13/average-ppa-prices-rose-in-2020-analysis-says/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,COVID-19,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 13, 2021","Average PPA prices rose in 2020, analysis says","For the first time since LevelTen Energy began reporting on PPA prices in Q2 2018, solar PPA offer prices rose in 2020, with Q4 2020 prices being 11.5% higher than in Q4 2019, for an average price of $30.56 per MWh.
Broken down by Independent System Operator, PJM experienced the highest prices, averaging $37.5/MWh. That was followed by MISO at $33.7/MWh, SPP at $30.5/MWh, ERCOT at $26.7/MWh and CAISO at $25.1/MWh.
The rise began at the start of 2020, around the same time as the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread internationally. But the virus was not the only factor that drove the rise, according to LevelTen.

“In addition to disruptions caused by COVID, grid connection delays and permitting challenges have created a bottleneck for projects in areas where demand is high, creating supply constraints that have put upward pressure on prices,” said Rob Collier, vice president of Developer Relations. He said that many of the most economically competitive projects have already contracted with offtakers, leaving higher-priced projects available in the market.
Developers with projects on the LevelTen Marketplace sang a similar tune. A survey conducted by LevelTen found that 74% didn’t choose to increase PPA prices to overcome challenges caused by COVID. Only 22% developed fewer projects, which would reduce the competition that put downward pressure on prices throughout 2019.
Image: LevelTen Energy
The only effect attributable directly to the pandemic was on renewable energy project timelines. In that same survey, 59% of respondents said COVID delayed commercial operations dates, and 41% said they delayed PPA negotiations and executions.
Collier commented on this as well, saying that some deals took a little longer than anticipated: procurement and finance teams were “understandably focused on other priorities when shutdowns began. But as the world adjusted to a new normal, renewable energy transactions picked back up. He said the firm does not expect the rising prices to soften demand in 2021, as boards of directors, investors, governments, employees and consumers will continue to push for sustainability commitments that will “require all large energy consumers to turn toward renewables.”
Overall, the number of PPA offers on the LevelTen Marketplace continued to grow in 2020, surpassing the number of U.S. offers available in 2019 by over 50%, showing that, in spite of rising prices, the market is still healthy and viable.
Because of the overall health of the market and the reality that large corporations are still pushing sustainability commitments that will require all large energy consumers to turn toward renewables, LevelTen expects that there will still be heavy demand, as these customers see PPAs as an economically attractive and proven way to achieve renewable energy targets.
The report also highlights a desire to “build back better,” a term coined by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, where companies that faced hardships in 2021 will look to rebuild their businesses for long-term sustainability and value creation.
Corporations aren’t the only buyers, however, and many municipalities, states and government agencies will look to stimulate their economy in a sustainable way, which LevelTen predicts will create more political will to spend on renewables. This will will be bolstered by the incoming pro-renewable administration and congress.

Clean energy jobs were no exception.
According to a new report, the U.S. clean energy industry finished 2020 with its fewest number of workers since 2015. It also marked the first year the industry saw a decline in jobs compared to the previous year. Although an uptick in employment in December was reported, with clean energy businesses adding 16,900 jobs, that left a gap of more than 429,000 (12%) of the industry’s pre-Covid workforce.
The report comes from BW Research Partnership and is based on an analysis of federal unemployment filings prepared for E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs), E4TheFuture, and the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). The report covered jobs in renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean vehicles, and clean transmission, distribution, and storage, among other clean energy sectors.
Ten months after the unemployment crisis began, 70% of the jobs lost in the clean energy sector have yet to be recovered, according to the monthly report. At the rate of recovery since June, it would take about two-and-a-half years for the clean energy sector to reach pre-Covid employment levels. The report added it would take another year to reach the levels of clean energy employment that had been projected for 2020 before the pandemic struck.
The jobs report did not include workers who had their work hours cut and are now underemployed.
According to the report, no U.S. clean energy employment sector grew by more than 0.7% in December. Energy efficiency saw the strongest employment growth, adding 12,300 jobs. It was followed by renewable energy (2,700) and clean transmission, distribution, and storage (750).
Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia are still reporting double-digit unemployment in clean energy, with 12 states experiencing unemployment of 15% or more. The report said Georgia has the highest rate, with more than 30% of its clean energy workforce still unemployed, followed by Kentucky at 27%.
In December, Hawaii had the sector’s highest growth rate at 1.2%. California saw the largest total increase in jobs with 3,300 positions added (0.7%). Florida, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, and Texas all added more than 600 jobs, while 15 states added fewer than 100 each.
The report noted that the impacts of the pandemic-fueled job crisis continue to disproportionately impact women and Black and Hispanic workers. Women—particularly women of color—and Hispanic workers lost jobs overall in December despite total clean energy employment growing slightly, at a rate of 0.6%.
The groups behind the report called on federal lawmakers and the incoming Biden administration to step up efforts to support those suffering from unemployment, reinvigorate the economy, and help boost the clean energy industry.
“December’s clean energy employment numbers can only be described as anemic,” said Gregory Wetstone, ACORE’s president and CEO. He called on the incoming Biden administration and the new Congress to move past “the endless cycle of temporary stopgap measures” to enact “the kind of comprehensive, long-term, scientifically driven climate policy that puts millions to work building the clean energy future Americans want and deserve.”

The complaint alleges that Esdec engaged in fraud and refused to meet terms of  the buyout agreed to in the companies’ merger.
The lawsuit alleges that Esdec showed “contempt” towards the company’s deal partners, including its refusal to pay the initial  $72 million buyout price, as well as an additional $3 million promised to shareholders if IronRidge met agreed-to performance requirements.
The filing also alleges that instead of paying, “Esdec reneged on the deal and concocted a plan to defraud the Stockholders into deferring receipt of that money and falsely promising” that Esdec would pay nearly $2 million related to certain tax credits.
Esdec did not respond to a request from pv magazine USA for comment.
The acquisition was originally announced in September 2019 along with a separate deal in which Esdec acquired Quick Mount PV. Esdec said the mergers represented more than 60% share of the residential mounting market, with annual revenue of over $250 million.
The lawsuit claims that Esdec required all of the approximately $5 million to be placed into an escrow account to serve as security for any indemnification claims (compensation for harm or actions taken in bad faith) Esdec might make, in addition to $3.72 million already placed into escrow to provide security to Esdec.
An escrow account is one where assets or money are held by a third party on behalf of two other parties that are in the process of completing a transaction.
That sum was to be paid out by March. But in the shareholder suit that was filed in October, Esdec allegedly knew that the deadline was approaching, and made plans to siphon as much of that escrowed money out of the deal by making inflated indemnification demands against that money, among other alleged tactics.
According to the lawsuit, Esdec began by raising tax-related issues that the company claimed created a possible risk of tax liability to Esdec and/or the surviving IronRidge entity. It then allegedly refused to pay the earn-out until those issues were addressed.
The lawsuit said the shareholders agreed to modify the agreement, moved more money into escrow, and deferred the payment due date until 2023.
The shareholders alleged that Esdec’s actions illustrate that it had no intent to abide by the agreement. The alleged actions include:
Shareholders are asking that the amendment to the merger agreement be rescinded and cancelled. Esdec has filed a demurrer to the complaint, essentially denying the complaint.

Purchase price was not disclosed.
The Slate project is a 300 MW solar plus 140.25 MW / 561 MWh storage project that is set to enter service by the end of the year. The power plant will include roughly 962,000 bifacial BiKu modules installed across 2,400 acres. Canadian Solar’s energy storage subsidiary, System Solutions and Energy Storage, will provide battery storage integration services.
PNC Bank is providing a tax equity commitment to the project, which has signed PPAs with five off-takers, four of which are solar and energy storage, and one that is solar-only.
The Slate project is Recurrent Energy’s largest solar-plus-storage project. Its U.S. storage pipeline currently stands at more than 4 GWh, the company said.
Two small utilities are adding solar power in Southwest Missouri and Southeast Kansas.
Liberty Utilities expects to complete this month its first 2.2 MW solar facility in Missouri at a cost of around $3.5 million. Meanwhile, in Kansas, Heartland Rural Electric Cooperative is building two 1 MW solar arrays.
Liberty is also completing three wind farms in both states.
Liberty officials told local news outlets that the solar project is the pilot for what could be a number of flexible power stations that can be placed where demand is growing but without having to expand power lines or build new fossil generation.
Liberty sited the solar array at a substation that was nearing peak capacity. By installing solar at select locations around on the system, the utility said it can ease constraints and improve system performance.
In Kansas, Heartland Rural Electric Cooperative is joining 11 other Kansas rural electric cooperatives to add 20 MW of power in 20 arrays across the state. Work on Heartland’s two solar projects is under way and is expected to be completed by June.
The arrays will be owned by Today’s Power Inc., a North Little Rock, Arkansas, company established by rural electric cooperatives in the state. Heartland signed a 25-year PPA with Today’s Power.
Today’s Power Inc. has installed more than 25 solar projects totaling more than 40 MW over the last five years in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
Mercom Capital Group,  a global clean energy communications and consulting firm, released its annual report on funding and merger and acquisition (M&A) activity for the solar sector.
The firm said that global VC funding in the solar sector came to $1.2 billion in 41 deals, compared to $1.4 billion in 53 deals in 2019.
Of the $1.2 billion, some $1.1 billion went to 27 downstream companies, $61 million for service providers, $17 million for PV companies, $15 million for balance of system companies, $15 million for thin film technology companies, and $5.5 million for concentrator photovoltaics companies.
The top VC funded companies in 2020 were Ayana Renewable Power with $390 million, Silicon Ranch Corp. with $225 million, Brighte with $76 million, Sunseap Group with $72 million, and Aurora Solar and Zero Mass Water with $50 million each.
In 2020, announced debt financing came to $8.3 billion, the firm reported. Eight securitization deals totaling $2.2 billion were recorded in 2020, the largest amount in a year.
Turning to mergers and acquisitions, the firm said that 62 deals were transacted in 2020 compared to 65 in 2019. Most of the transactions involved downstream companies.
In addition, there were 231 large-scale solar project acquisitions in 2020 compared to 192 transactions in 2019. A record 39.5 GW of large-scale solar projects changed hands in 2020 compared to 26.1 GW in 2019.
Consolidated Asset Management Services acquired the U.S. solar operations and maintenance business of Belectric Inc. The portfolio includes 141 operating sites in 11 states. Terms were not disclosed.
Greg Bobrow, COO of CAMS, said the purchase compliments and strengthens the company’s capabilities and markets in the power generation industry.
CAMS is a privately held company providing a range of services in the energy sector, including lifecycle management of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. Belectric has constructed globally more than 400 solar PV power plants with over 3.0 GW of installed capacity.
