Named the Jacumba Valley Ranch (JVR) Energy Park, the facility will be sited in San Diego County, close to transmission infrastructure operated by utility SDG&E. It is set to begin construction early next year, with an expected commercial operation date of the first quarter of 2023. 
SCDP is a not-for-profit community choice aggregator that will provide energy from the facility for five cities in the San Diego region, including Chula Vista, Encinitas, Imperial Beach, La Mesa, and San Diego.  
As part of the development plan, the project has committed to funding improvements of a local community park, as well as preserving 435 acres of native habitat. The developers said they expect the facility to offset more than 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by the end of its life. 
SCDP said it began serving commercial and industrial customers in June and will launch a residential phase in the first quarter 2022. The program aims to provide local control and consumer choice regarding energy decisions on a large scale. It is one of 23 major community choice aggregators in California, and adds to roughly 10 million customers involved in community choice solar programs across the state.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/08/siemens-and-malta-team-up-to-develop-scalable-energy-storage-technology/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 8, 2021",Siemens and Malta team up to develop scalable energy storage technology,"Malta, a long-duration energy storage system producer, and Siemens Energy have teamed up to build new thermal turbomachinery for energy storage. 
The pumped heat energy storage (PHES) system uses thermo-mechanic components for what Malta said is a novel energy storage application. The technology is charged with electricity from any source and is stored as thermal energy, which then can be dispatched as heat and electricity on demand. 
The partnership will develop heat pump and heat engine components to support a utility-scale 100 MW storage system for 10-200 hours of storage. The technology can further scale to gigawatt power range, said Malta. 
The company said components in development will support a range of services that the PHES will be able to provide to grid operators, including synchronous inertia, reactive power, and fast ramping. 
Synchronous inertia devices serve to increase power quality and decrease the occurrence of blackouts. Distributed generation sources like solar are not directly coupled with a rotating mass, which means they can cause frequency deviations and power swings in the grid. Grid-inertia devices are an important component in a healthy grid as renewable energy penetration expands.  
Reactive power devices aid in ensuring proper voltage on the grid, above or below nominal voltage levels. Reactive power service providers either absorb or generate power to ensure the grid is not overloaded or operating inefficiently. 
Fast-ramping tech works to dispatch power in times of high demand, serving to quickly address demand/generation mismatch events.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/08/solar-101-accessorize-your-rooftop-pv-with-batteries-panels-and-ev-chargers/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 8, 2021","Solar 101: Accessorize your rooftop PV with batteries, panels, and EV chargers","In our pv magazine USA Solar 101 series, we’ve discussed the major components that make up a solar power project:  solar panels, the inverters, and the racking.
However, there are some accessories to these basic items that are becoming more important every day. Three important technologies on this list are car chargers, batteries, and electrical panels.
We already discussed how many solar panels are needed to generate enough electricity for a new electric vehicle; however, charging it is another story! Your solar inverter manufacturer plays a big role in how your electric car is charged.
Inverter manufacturer SolarEdge clearly believes car charging is going to be a massive part of the future, as all of their new inverters include car charging capability. The company believes in this future so much that they’ve bought both a battery company and an electric car company, and are selling components to larger automotive companies.
SolarEdge’s car charging solution comes with a feature specifically designed for charging cars with solar power; they called it “Excess PV”. What this means is that when the sun is up, the inverter prioritizes solar power for the house, offsetting any onsite electricity usage. The available “Excess PV” electricity is then directed to the car – and, importantly – prevents charging from the power grid (which is typically fueled in part by fossil fuels.)
Of course, homes using large amounts of electricity may need to occasionally charge a vehicle with fossil fuels, but the smart inverter is designed to maximize the miles covered by sunlight.
A solar power project from Tesla will almost certainly come with an option to buy a car charger, a battery, and, naturally, a car. The company said that it’s working to more fully integrate this ecosystem, but is still in the early stages of that process. For now, you can add a Tesla car charger to any solar power project you install, regardless of whether or not that project is from Tesla.
In addition to these suppliers, several third-party car charging solutions are available for purchase. One technical difference to consider  is whether you need a Level 1 or a Level 2 charger, which refers to the rate at which you charge. A Level 1 charger outputs about three to five miles of driving range per hour. A Level 2 charger can push between 12-60 miles of range per hour of charge.
In addition, a Level 1 charger is little more than a power cable with a standard 120V wall plug on one end and a car plug on the other end. A Level 2 charger plugs into a high-voltage outlet, similar to a clothes dryer or an induction stove. In addition, a Level 2 charger requires additional gear in order to be considered legal and permanent.

Chargepoint, a leading seller of Level 2 chargers, has put together a handy guide describing the differences between Level 1 and 2 charging.
EV charging is still in its infancy, and we can expect more innovations. One prominent feature on the horizon is “vehicle to house” better known as “V2H”. V2H allows an electric vehicle to act as a backup generator, powering your home in an emergency via the car’s battery.
Recent headlines were made when Sunrun partnered with Ford on the all electric F-150 Lightning. The vehicle will be sold with an 80 amp (this is really big) car charger. The system will be designed to allow a home to run off of the enormous – greater than 100 kWh – battery system in the vehicle. That’s enough juice to run a typical home for several days.

Home energy storage is a hot topic, and most homeowners getting solar are also interested in batteries. Currently, battery storage does not pay itself off in most places, because most electricity companies don’t offer sufficient financial support for home energy storage. However, people who want a backup power source seem willing to accept that compromise.
With that in mind, it’s important to consider the amount of battery storage a home might actually require.
An average home uses about 10,000 kWh of electricity per year, which is about 27 kWh a day. A solar power system that is sized to meet 100% of your energy needs will generate roughly that much electricity, but with significant seasonal variances.

A battery backup system can be sized in many different ways. Some battery sizing considerations regularly used are:
These questions require another article altogether, so ask your contractor to help you with this. On a positive note, most energy storage systems currently available on the market will back up a whole home for at least a few hours.
Home automation, control systems, and smart electric panels are closely related to these battery backup and car charger questions and seek to seamlessly optimize your home electricity usage.
Generally, these components are installed between a solar power system, batteries, and the electricity consuming appliances in your home.

Recently, Span entered the market with an electric panel that gives circuit level control from your smartphone. This means that when an electricity event hits, preprogrammed tools will shut down circuits immediately and automatically, saving your electricity usage and allowing the battery to last as long as possible.
Sonnen energy storage systems can do pretty much anything a Span panel can do, plus run an entire housing community with its batteries. If given a choice, the ecolink from Sonnen would be in this author’s home. The unit monitors weather conditions, the price of energy, and home use patterns in order to optimize almost anything in a home that can be optimized, from closing windows to shutting off the AC when you leave the house.
With today’s available gear, a solar + Sonnen + car charger home is about the most advanced electrical management available for the home market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/08/improving-solar-cells-by-tackling-noise/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,UTAH",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 8, 2021",Improving solar cells by tackling noise,"Physicists at the University of Utah and Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin used a method called cross-correlation noise spectroscopy to detect small fluctuations in electrical current running through a silicon solar cell.
The technique allows researchers to pinpoint where cell inefficiencies and energy losses occur. 
Using noise to detect disturbances is not novel, the physicists said, but one problem is that noise-detecting devices create noise of their own. This is where the cross-correlation method steps in. It uses multiple detectors so that the noise of the sound detector can be analyzed and removed. That way, only the noise signals being looked for within the cell are detected. 
Heterojunction solar cells (HSC), high-end single-material solar cells, were selected for this study. HSC has one of the highest known efficiencies, capturing about 26.7% of energy in light, compared to the 15%-20% typically found in a residential solar panel.

The researchers said that a key to creating a highly efficient HSC panel is to ensure that all the layers are in alignment, so that there is a match between the photo-active silicon and the selective electrode. A misalignment of these ultra-thin layers means that defects can trap electrons, thereby negating overall output. 
The physicists likened trying to find the small noise signal to hearing one note in a chorus of hundreds of people, as a lot of interference needs to be filtered.
Once they successfully cross-cut the extraneous noise and isolate a noise signal inside the cell, the researchers could work backwards to understand the material that the physical process came from. They said that identifying the physical process noise itself is like discovering a musical note, and then studying its properties to determine what instrument it came from (in other words, the material and its properties).
The research identified two main areas where efficiency was compromised by imperfections. One was caused by the transparent layer that sandwiched five solar cell layers, called the ITO. The ITO modifies the underlying silicon layers, creating defects. A second process occurred when electron holes passed through a similar barrier on the back side of the device. 
The physicists said that their method, and the implementation of more layers and a higher range of materials, could allow solar panels to break through the elusive 30% efficiency barrier. 
The research at the University of Utah was supported by NSF and at Helmholtz-Zentrum by DFG.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/08/sunrise-brief-regulators-approve-nearly-1-gw-of-solar-ppas-for-georgia-power/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 8, 2021",Sunrise brief: Regulators approve nearly 1 GW of solar PPAs for Georgia Power,"Georgia Power won approval from state regulators to buy 970 MW of solar power from five other utilities.
The 30-year power purchase agreements are part of Georgia Power’s renewable energy programs included in its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan.
The new PPAs include CED Timberland Solar, 140 MW; Decatur Solar Energy Center, 200 MW; Double Run Solar, 220 MW; Wadley Solar, 260 MW; and Washington County Solar, 150 MW.
The company plans to have about 5,400 MW of renewable energy resources in its portfolio by the end of 2025, accounting for about 22% of its power generation mix.
Separately, Georgia Power is facing both federal and state scrutiny over its ongoing work to add two nuclear generating units at its Vogtle station. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is looking into Southern’s response to problems with an electrical cable system used as a safety mechanism at the new units. And state regulators are looking into construction delays that have resulted in the plant being years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.
First Solar said it has invested $11 million in what it said is an effort to “revitalize American communities and bridge racial gaps in health, wealth, and opportunity.” As part of the initiative, the company bought $10 million in Impact Notes from the Local Initiatives Support Corp. (LISC) and made a $1 million Transformational Deposit in the HOPE Credit Union.
LISC is a national non-profit Community Development Financial Institution conceived by the Ford Foundation in 1979. The Impact Notes are fixed-income debt securities issued by LISC, which help fund community and economic development projects across 36 cities and 2,100 rural counties in 45 states.
First Solar’s deposit in Mississippi-based HOPE Credit Union is intended to help provide business, mortgage, and consumer loans, and other financial services to Black communities across the South. HOPE works to import capital into underbanked communities where poverty has constrained the amount of savings and other assets.
BlackRock said it lined up more than $250 million in commitments from global institutional investors, governments, and philanthropies for its Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), a finance vehicle focused on investing in climate infrastructure across emerging markets.
The governments of France, through the French Development Agency (AFD); Germany, through KfW Development Bank (KfW); and Japan, through Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC); together with the Grantham Environmental Trust, the Quadrivium Foundation, and another unnamed private foundation committed a combined $112.5 million in capital. This capital will be used to leverage a broader institutional capital raise, starting with commitments from Dai-ichi Life Insurance, Standard Chartered Bank, and MUFG Bank.
CFP will target investments in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The fund’s focus on the climate infrastructure sector include grid connected and/or distributed renewable power generation; energy efficiency in residential, commercial and/or industrial sectors; transmission or energy storage solutions; and ultra-low emission or electrified transportation and mobility services. The Partnership is targeting at least $500 million.
Hull Street Energy acquired the management team and development pipeline of Foundation Solar Partners, an independent renewable development company that specializes in identifying and developing utility-scale solar generation projects in the eastern U.S. Foundation Solar Partners was established in 2019 and has developed and sold 1 GW of solar projects in the PJM transmission territory.
Through affiliates, the firm will own 52 power generation stations providing 900 MW of renewable, gas-fired, and dual-fueled generation capacity. Baker Botts LLP acted as legal counsel to Hull Street Energy and Jon Staley acted as legal counsel to Foundation Solar Partners.
Eos Energy Enterprises said that Koch Strategic Platforms will make a $100 million investment in convertible senior notes to support the company’s growth. Eos manufactures long-duration energy storage batteries that use its zinc-based battery technology.
Under terms of the investment, a Koch unit will buy $100 million in convertible senior notes with an initial conversion price of $20.00 per share. The notes will mature in June 2026. Interest payments made in cash will be based on an interest rate of 5.0% per year, and interest payments made by issuing additional notes will be based on an interest rate of 6.0% per year.
