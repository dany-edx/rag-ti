The proposal was met with strong support among environmental groups for the appropriation of Clean Energy Reliability Investment Plant (CERIP) funding.
Community solar and storage offers access to affordable solar by connecting all utility customers, regardless of housing type, to subscribe to a solar array and receive credits off utility bills for the energy generated by the project. Without the ability to purchase and install solar directly on a rented residence, community solar offers a pathway to the 45% of Californians who rent their homes, and the 70% of renters who are considered low-income.
California passed Assembly Bill 2316 last year, opening a process to create a formal community solar market. The program requires at least 51% of program capacity to serve low-income customers. The program is being designed with the California Public Utilities Commission, with rules expected to be ironed out some time in Summer 2023.
The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. The White House targets for community solar deployment would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW by 2025. The Department of Energy estimates customers enrolling in community solar will save an average customer about 20% on monthly electricity bills.
“The $400 million funding will help us build on the enormous potential of AB 2316, bringing affordable solar and storage within reach for many more California families,” said Stephanie Doyle, California regulatory director, Vote Solar. “Thank you to the Senate Budget Committee for recognizing the need for bold investments in equitable and impactful clean energy solutions. This commitment will help California secure federal investments that can help expand access and benefits for more Californians.”
The funding proposal is expected to make California more competitive for securing funding from the $7 billion “Solar for All” federal fund exclusively earmarked for expanding solar access for low-income and disadvantaged communities.
California Governor Gavin Newsom and the state assembly said they are currently considering their own “budget trailer bills,” referring to implementing policies outlined in the state budget. The bills are expected to be negotiated and final versions will be voted on before the legislative session ends in September.
“This proposed commitment from the Senate will go a long way in helping frontline communities to access clean energy. The Governor and the state assembly should follow their lead and champion environmental justice by approving a $400 million appropriation from the CERIP funding for community solar and storage,” said Alexis Sutterman, energy equity program manager, California Environmental Justice Alliance. “California is far behind other states in community solar and storage when it should be leading.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/26/oberlin-sheep-grazing-team-to-reduce-solar-mowing-costs-by-more-than-44/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,SUSTAINABILITY,OHIO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 26, 2023",Oberlin sheep grazing team to reduce solar mowing costs by more than 44%,"Just as Oberlin College students were leaving campus this past week to enjoy their summer recess, a new group was entering campus by farm truck. On May 24, a class of 70 ewes from the Old Slate Farm in Knox County, Ohio, showed up on campus to begin chomping away at weeds, grass and other edible vegetation at the college’s 2.3 MW solar field.
Some 70 Katahdin breed sheep were dropped off on campus this week at Oberlin’s 10-acre fenced-in North Field. There they will graze through mid-June, stomping grass and weeding the solar field in a move aimed at alleviating the need for costly operations and maintenance involved with a commercial lawnmowing crew, according to a report by the school’s Conservatory institute.
Additional sheep drops this summer will bring the total number of grazers at Oberlin’s on-site solar facility to between 150 and 200 heads of sheep.
The sheep will be delivered to the college’s solar field three times per year over the spring, summer, and fall season. A form of agrivoltaics, where land is used for both agriculture and energy generation, the sheep’s handiwork will reduce Oberlin’s emissions from fossil fuel. It is also expected to reduce regular damage to equipment that results from mowing a rough terrain.
Oberlin signed an agreement with Old Slate Farm in April to begin deploying the sheep grazers before summer.
The college reportedly has spent $15,000 to $30,000 per year on mowing expenses on the 2.3 MW solar field, while the use of up to 200 sheep will reduce its O&M costs on the solar field to about $6,600 per year, Oberlin campus energy and resource manager Joel Baetens told the Oberlin Review.
The solar grazing approach will aid the college in achieving goals of becoming carbon neutral by 2025, a goal the school set in 2006. The college was one of the first U.S. university systems to come out with a campus-wide environmental and sustainability framework under the Carbon Commitment program (formerly the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment).
Over the following years, the college installed additional solar arrays as well, with a 59 kW rooftop array on the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies and a 101 kW car canopy system on a parking garage.
The Midwest college didn’t stop at just shy of 2.5 MW of solar installations though. In the Spring of 2021, the college announced a $140 million geothermal energy project aimed at drilling 1,100 geothermal wells at its South Campus buildings. The geothermal wells will reduce energy, heating and cooling costs, including decades-old cooling infrastructure that costs the school about $1 million per year in excess energy costs.
The project will convert the college’s decades-old boiler plant with geothermal energy, using thermal energy equipment as a natural gas backup system, in addition to the geothermal wells across the campus. The geothermal installations are expected to be deployed by 2025 under partnership with Ever-Green Energy, a St. Paul, Minn.-based district energy company.
“Obies care deeply about our collective impact on the environment,” said Meghan Riesterer, assistant vice president for campus energy and sustainability, about the geothermal project. “This is a collaborative solution developed by representatives from across our community, together with experts.”
Old Slate Farm is a cut flower and Katahdin sheep farm in Mount Vernon, Ohio. In addition to flower arrangements and raising sheep, the midwestern farm also hosts weddings on its large farmstead in central Ohio.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/26/solar-module-prices-at-two-year-low-deployment-to-reach-300-gw-this-year/,"INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 26, 2023","Solar module prices at two-year low, deployment to reach 300 GW this year","A National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Spring 2023 solar market update shows strong global demand for PV. Worldwide, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that 231 GW of solar was installed globally, bringing cumulative solar deployment to 1.2 TW.
China remains the frontrunner for solar deployment, growing its installations by 57% year-over-year in 2022, representing 42% of global demand. The majority of China’s installations are smaller distributed projects, versus large, centralized utility-scale projects, said IEA.
NREL said analysts project installations worldwide to reach 300 GW this year and 400 GW by 2025.
In the U.S., PV represented about 46% of new electricity generation capacity additions, showing impressive growth from the 4% it represented in 2010. Yet, solar has a long way to grow to play its part as a core technology in the energy transition. PV represents 9% of net summer capacity and 4.7% of annual generation in 2022, said NREL.
California has made the longest strides in solar, with 27.3% of its electricity generation being sourced from solar. Solar has at least a 5% share in the generation mix in 16 states as of the end of 2022.
Cumulatively, the U.S. has installed 140 GWdc of solar, representing a little over 10% of global installations. The U.S. represents about 17% of global electricity generation. In 2022, the nation added 20.2 GWdc of solar, said NREL, though the American Clean Power Association (ACP) places that number at 25.5 GWdc, representing the third largest year for solar deployment. This was a 15% slowdown in installations from 2021, largely due to project delays resulting from component supply issues.
Energy storage across the U.S. added 14.1 GWh, 4.8 GW of energy storage, leading to an average duration of about 3 hours. Batteries and other forms of storage are being used in a variety of ways, from short-duration peaker plants supplanting new natural gas peakers, to longer-duration storage to match the intermittent cycle of solar generation.
Pricing
Utility-scale PV systems in the U.S. increased in prices to $1.49 per Wac, rising 13% year-over-year. The lowest and highest reported prices in 2022 were $1.06 per Wac and $2.10 per Wac, respectively.
Residential system prices increased as well, though slower, at about 6.3% year-over-year, with a median price of $2.85 per Wdc, per EnergySage.
Prices changes varied by project sizes. In a sample of projects from major markets Arizona, California, Massachusetts and New York, prices changed as follows:
Global polysilicon reached an 18-month low in January of $20 per kg, rebounding to $30 per kg in mid-February, and then dropping to $24 per kg by mid-April 2023.
Module prices have fallen to a two-year low globally in April 2023, declining steadily since fall 2022 despite strong demand. In the first two months of 2023, average U.S. module prices were $0.36 per Wdc, down 11% quarter-over-quarter. Modules traded at a 57% premium over the global spot price for monofacial monocrystalline silicon modules.
The solar PV experience curve, known as Swanson’s Law, displays the relationship, in logarithmic form, between the average selling price of a solar module and the cumulative global shipments of modules. For every doubling of cumulative PV shipments from 1976 to 2022, there has been on average of a 22% reduction in module prices, said NREL.
Manufacturing
Global solar shipments increased sharply in 2022, rising 46% over the 2021 total, reaching 283 GW. Most of the shipments, 96%, were monocrystalline silicon panels, up from 35% in 2015. N-Type modules are increasing in share, representing 51%, up from about 20% in 2020 and only 5% in 2019.
“Via higher open-circuit voltage values, you can achieve higher efficiencies and power ratings. In and of itself, that is likely going to move manufacturers to n-type TOPCon cell designs, as soon as they can get there,” said Kenneth Sauer, principal engineer, VDE Americas.
In 2022, the U.S. produced about 5 GW of solar modules, though that number is expected to grow significantly as the Inflation Reduction Act has attracted strong global and domestic investment in manufacturing solar components in the U.S. ACP said the $369 billion spending package has already attracted $150 billion in private investments, leading to 46 new manufacturing facilities or significant capacity upgrades.
While the U.S. is betting big on domestic manufacturing, it today relies heavily on imports. According to U.S. Census data, 28.7 GWdc of modules and 2.5 GWdc of cells were imported in 2022, a growth of 21% year over year. Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand represented 73% of all module imports, placing significant importance on the ongoing policy battle over President Joe Biden’s moratorium on solar tariff imports from the four nations.
In 2022, only 10%, or about 2.7 GWdc, of modules reported a tariff, compared to 56% (13.2 GWdc) in 2021, said NREL.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/26/solar-project-cuts-carbon-saves-energy-costs-and-builds-resilience-for-tohono-oodham-nation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ARIZONA",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 26, 2023","Solar project cuts carbon, saves energy costs and builds resilience for Tohono O’odham Nation","A solar installation in the San Xavier District of the Tohono O’odham Nation in Arizona was sorely needed to reduce energy costs, but the benefits are far exceeding cost savings alone. One of 11 districts that comprise the Tohono O’odham Nation, the San Xavier District, sits on nearly 72,000 acres of Sonoran Desert near Tucson, Arizona. The District accounts for 7% of the Tohono O’odham Nation’s population, currently about 2,300 individuals, of which only approximately 1,200 reside within the District’s jurisdiction.
Reducing the tribe’s carbon footprint was the initial impetus behind the project, but they also wanted to reduce their energy costs. With high electric rates and plenty of sunshine in the area of Tucson, Arizona, solar was a preferred solution. Furthermore, they saw it as a way to educate the community on the importance of renewable energy.
The project, which cost about $870,000 and was co-funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Indian Energy, generates 440,000 kWh per year, or enough to power approximately 41 average homes for one year. The cost savings to the Tribe is estimated to be $2,570,000 over the 25-year life of the system.
“Our savings are incredible. It’s literally saving thousands of dollars a month on our bill,” said Sandi Alvarez, director of administration, San Xavier District of the Tohono O’odham Nation. Alvarez said the district has been able to turn the cost savings into additional funding for social programs such as education tuition, housing, repairs, and elderly programs.
The grid-tied carport solar installations serve two buildings: the district administration building and education center. The systems are using Trina Solar frameless bifacial 360 W modules and Canadian Solar inverters. The 182 kW system for the administration building produces 310,000 kWh per year and displaces about 80% of the energy use of the building.

The 73.5 kW system for the education center produces roughly 130,000 kWh per year and displaces about 95% of the building’s energy use. The anticipated 25-year cost savings from the 255 kW systems are estimated to be approximately $1,750,000 and $820,000 for the administration building and the education center, respectively.
This is not the first solar installation for the District. The first one was a 60 kW array installed in 2013 to reduce utility costs and dependence on commercial power. In 2019, a 100 kW facility was constructed for the District’s senior services center and the maintenance building. The success of these two projects was motivation to do more.
The project was competitively selected under the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Indian Energy’s Fiscal Year 2019 funding opportunity announcement “Energy Infrastructure Deployment on Tribal Lands – 2020.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced $34 million in funding to advance clean energy technology in 18 American Indian and Alaska Native communities. This funding will enable more tribal communities to cut costs, build resilience and self-sufficiency, while also bringing the U.S. closer to the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of enhancing tribal energy sovereignty and reducing energy costs for all Americans.

According to the 2022 American Clean Power Association (ACP) annual report, 25.5 GW of new renewable energy assets were deployed last year, the third largest years for renewables, representing 80% of all new power entering the U.S. grid. With the new additions, the U.S. generated 228 GW of solar, wind and energy storage resources, representing 15% of the power mix and powering 62 million U.S. homes.
Despite the third strongest year on record, Clean Power reported that 2022 saw a decline in deployments for the first time in five years, based on trade barriers, supply chain issues, ongoing permitting delays and regulatory challenges that resulted in a 15% slowdown in installations, largely represented in the utility solar market.
Texas and California remain the frontrunners in renewables, deploying a staggering 9.16 GW and 4.68 GW of solar, wind and storage projects in 2022, followed distantly by Oklahoma (1.45 GW wind), Florida (1.12 GW), and Nevada (855 MW), which saw gains in utility solar plus storage projects.
Clean Power notes that Texas has led the U.S. in renewable installations since 2017, and last year the Lone State state installed nearly twice as much capacity as any other state, including California.
Project delays persisted in 2022 and are a primary cause of the annual decline in installations compared to 2021. Over the last year, 66 GW of projected experienced some sort of delay, while into 2023 nearly 9 GW of delayed projects are now operational.
Solar accounts for the 68% majority of project delays, due to difficulty sourcing panels as a result of the 2022 trade restrictions tied to the import restrictions of solar panels from banned Southeast Asian countries.
Energy storage project delays were the least severe in 2022, at 14% total projects delayed, with the delayed projects primarily tied to colocation with large utility solar projects.
In 2022, energy storage projects were deployed at a strong rate, at 4 GW / 12 GWh of projects commissioned, an 80% increase in operating storage capacity year-over-year.
Since the August 2022 passage of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. utility-scale renewables market has announced 47 new manufacturing facilities, expansions or reopenings of existing facilities, with $151 billion of capital investment into the onshoring of 96 GW in announced new capacity manufacturing facilities.
The IRA stimulus has already created onshoring efforts with 18,000 new manufacturing jobs.
Clean Power’s assessment reveals the IRA will deliver 525 GW to 550 GW of new utility-scale renewable energy projects from 2022 through 2030, which in turn will bring $550 billion to $600 billion of new capital investments. The research shows that $500 billion of U.S. gross domestic product will be added over the decade, bringing $14 billion in GDP each year as the U.S. becomes more self-reliant in the renewables supply chain.

According to a Department of Energy report titled U.S. Energy and Employment Report 2022, the country’s solar, wind and storage markets staffed nearly 443,000 workers at year end 2021. The report shows the solar market makes up the largest share of workers with 253,052, an increase of 20,000 from 2020.
In 2021, the U.S. renewable energy market came close to matching the workforce of the fossil fuel energy market, which includes coal generation and extraction (124,143) and natural gas (322,969).  The next 2023 DOE energy jobs report will be released in June 2023.
More than one-third of U.S. renewables workers are located in California (108,626), where more than one-third of the U.S. solar industry (87,200 jobs) is based. That is followed by Texas (42,188), Massachusetts (18,641), Florida (16,449) and New York (15,918).

The annual Clean Power report ranks the top purchasers of renewables across the U.S., and for the first time, social media giant Meta (Facebook) edged out Duke Energy for the number 5 spot of top purchasers of renewable energy, with just shy of 5 GW of solar, wind and storage capacity powering its data center operations.
Amazon is the only other corporate renewables buyer to appear in Clean Power’s top purchasers list, while it has edged out southeast utility Southern Company and midwestern Alliant Energy with capacity nearing 4 GW from primarily wind power and some solar. Further down in the pack of corporate purchasers are Google, Microsoft, Walmart and AT&T.
American Clean Power held its annual CleanPower 2023 conference and expo earlier this week in New Orleans, La. The annual event drew more than 8,200 attendees this year plus more than 480 exhibiting companies.

The new facility represents a $4.3 billion capital investment and the Georgia facility will be located adjacent to a Hyundai manufacturing facility currently under construction.
The signing ceremony took place in LGES’s headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, with Youngsoo Kwon, CEO of LG Energy Solution and Jaehoon Chang, president and chief executive officer of Hyundai Motor, in attendance.
“Two strong leaders in the auto and battery industries have joined hands, and together we are ready to drive the EV transition in America,” said Youngsoo Kwon, chief executive officer of LG Energy Solution. “By further advancing our product competitiveness and global operational expertise, LG Energy Solution will commit our best efforts to offering the ultimate sustainable energy solutions to our customers.”
Hyundai Mobis, which is the parts supplier to Hyundai as well as other automotive manufacturers, will assemble battery packs using cells from the plant, then supply them to the Group’s U.S. manufacturing facilities for production of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis EV models.
The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in August 2022, includes $10 billion in tax credits for a variety of manufacturing facilities, including EV and battery manufacturing facilities. Since its passage, auto makers and battery companies have announced an estimated $11 billion in new investments into the North American EV battery supply chain. Panasonic opened a $4 billion factory in Kansas and is now eyeing Oklahoma, Toyota increased its commitment to a North Carolina battery production facility from $1.3 billion to $3.8 billion, and Statevolt intends to spend $4 billion on a factory in California. In March, LGES announced plans to invest $5.5 billion oin two manufacturing facilities in Arizona. One is intended to be for cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles and the other for lithium iron phosphate pouch-type batteries for energy storage systems.
Hyundai is committed to the electric transformation of the automotive industry. The company currently has three all-electric models and two plug-in hybrids. The annual production capacity of the new facility is estimated at 30 GWh, or enough to support the production of 300,000 units of EVs annually.
“Hyundai Motor Group is focusing on its electrification efforts to secure a leadership position in the global auto industry. We will create a strong foundation to lead the global EV transition through establishing a new EV battery cell plant with LG Energy Solution, a leading global battery producer and long-time partner,” said Chang.
Starting construction in the second half of 2023, the facility is expected to begin battery production at the end of 2025 at the earliest. With this JV, LGES now has seven battery plants currently operating or being constructed in the U.S., where the company is concentrating most of its resources to expand the production capacity.
LGES was formed in 2020 after being spun off from LG Chem, and it debuted on the Korea Exchange (KRX) in January 2022. In 2017 LG Chem was the first international player to enter the U.S. residential battery market, and now, as LG Energy Systems, focuses the burgeoning U.S. battery market for electric vehicles and energy storage systems. In January, LG Energy Systems announced that it will pursue 25% to 30% increase in the annual consolidated revenue in 2023, and plans to double its capex over the previous year; however, there is currently no indication as to whether those plans will change with this new, increased investment in U.S. manufacturing.
