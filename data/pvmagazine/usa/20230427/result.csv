https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/27/california-proposes-income-based-fixed-electricity-charges/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 27, 2023",California proposes income-based fixed electricity charges,"The Public Advocates Office (PAO) for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has released a proposal to add a monthly fixed charge on electric utility bills that is based on income level.  
The rate change is designed to lower bills for the lowest-income residents, while aligning billing more directly with utility costs. 
PAO’s recommendation for the Income Graduated Fixed Charge places fees between $22 per month and $42 per month in the three major investor-owned utilities’ territories for customers not enrolled in the California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) program. CARE customers would be charged between $14 per month and $22 a month, depending on income level and territory, as seen below.
For households earning $50,000 or less per year, the fixed charge would be $0, but only if the California Climate Credit is applied to offset the fixed charge.
Meanwhile, usage-based electricity rates are lowered in the PAO proposal. Average rates would be lowered between 16% to 22% for the three major investor-owned utilities.
The lowest-income bracket of Californians is expected to save roughly $10 to $20 a month under the proposal, while middle-income customers may see costs rise by about $20 a month.
“We anticipate the vast majority of low-income customers ($50,000 or less per year) will have their monthly bills decrease by $10 or more, and a small proportion of the highest income earners ($100,000+ per year) will see their monthly bills rise by $10 or more,” said the PAO.
The charges are an effort to help suppress ever-increasing rates for electricity generation and transmission, which are among the highest in the country. Rates are expected to continue to rise sharply as wildfire mitigation efforts are being implemented by the utilities that were found at fault for their origin.
“We are very concerned. We do not see the increases stopping at this point,” Linda Serizawa, deputy director for energy, PAO, told pv magazine. “In fact we think the pace and scale of the [rate] increases is growing faster than we would have anticipated, for several years now.”
The proposed charges are also meant to more directly couple billing with the fixed charges that utilities incur. Activities like power line maintenance, energy efficiency programs, and wildfire prevention are not expected to vary with usage, so these activities would be funded through the fixed charge.
Michael Campbell of the PAO’s customer programs team, and leader of the proposed program, likened paying for grid enhancements and other social programs with utility rate increases to “paying for food stamps by taxing food.” Instead, a fixed charge would cover these costs.
PAO said the move to lower rates for usage should help encourage electrification as California moves to replace heating and cooling, appliances, and gas combustion cars with electrified counterparts. Lower rates mean the cost burden of running these devices is improved.
However, the program is expected to provide more savings to high energy users than to those who use less electricity. This aspect of the policy works in direct contrast to goals of energy efficiency, and is a boon to investor-owned utilities that benefit from serving increased electricity demand.
What about solar?
While the progressive fixed charge may marginally lighten costs for the lowest-income customers, analysts fear that the charges are a penalty to rooftop solar customers.
The fixed charge arrived on the heels of passing Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0, which slashed compensation rates for exporting clean, local energy to the electric grid by about 80%. NEM 3.0 requires solar customers to rely on self-consumption, charging a home battery and using their own production.
Solar customers would be subject to the fixed charge, even those who store their power and draw little to no power from the grid. This is damaging to the economics of rooftop solar, and would be a disincentive for new installations. Lowered rooftop solar adoption leads to more reliance on utility-built centralized generation and transmission infrastructure.
However, the PAO said this ratemaking proposal is more about affordability, equity, and readying for electrification.
“This is not about solar,” said Campbell. “This is about equity and trying to promote the state’s bold climate goals [to promote more electrification]. Having all of our costs put into a volumetric rate is at a collision course with that.”
Wildfire fund
Much of the funds from the fixed charge are to be directed to wildfire recovery funds and wildfire hardening costs, said PAO.
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), the state’s largest investor-owned utility, has been found at fault for wildfires due to negligent safety practices for long-distance transmission lines.
In 2017, PG&E’s downed transmission wires were found to be the cause of massive wildfires and leaving many Californians without homes. The company was stuck with a $7.5 billion bill as it was found at fault for negligence in maintaining vegetation around its centralized transmission wires. These costs incurred by the utilities are harmful to all Californians, as the financial fallout from these disasters is picked up by ratepayers in the form of a higher bill.

Rather than having ratepayers at large bail out the major investor-owned utilities for their negligence in transmission requirements, environmentalists and solar industry advocates argue that the CPUC should instead focus on incentivizing technologies like distributed rooftop solar, which lessen the need for regional transmission buildout and offer backup power in times of grid outages.
Microgrids
The CPUC has made some moves towards supporting localized resilience through distributed assets, though it has been perceived as a “Jekyll and Hyde” approach.
On the same day that the CPUC rejected an application from rooftop solar provider Sunnova to implement a microgrid community, it announced a $200 million microgrid program for the investor-owned utilities to roll out.
(Read: “How solar emergency microgrids provide resilience to vulnerable communities“)
“It is interesting because that is, in fact, a cost shift,” Meghan Nutting, executive vice president, government and regulatory affairs at Sunnova Energy, told pv magazine. “The non-participating ratepayers will have to contribute to that $200 million that utilities will use to deploy microgrids. Then [investor-owned utilities] will receive a rate of return for any money they spend to build them, causing another cost shift onto non-participants,” she said.
What’s next?
If implemented, the Income Graduated Fixed Charge is expected to roll out in Summer 2024. Implementation may prove to be difficult, as income levels will need to be proven to utility companies to justify rates.
One method the CPUC has proposed is to automatically place all Californians in the highest income bracket, and ratepayers must opt-in to a program that allows investor-owned utilities to access their income information to be placed in a less-costly tier.
Norm Miller, emeritus professor of the University of San Diego’s Knauss School of Business, warned that it may be undesirable to ““inject utility companies into the personal finances of households.”

The Houston-based distributed energy systems company recorded more than 5,000 of new customers in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the recent quarter, representing its second highest market after California, where it added 5,512 new customers.
Revenue increased to $161.7 million in Q1 2023, a 146% increase over the prior year, as a result of an increased number of solar systems put in service and the sale of inventory.
“Our strong growth trajectory can be attributed to our continuous investments in software, service, and multiple channels for growth, which have allowed Sunnova to increase market share and widen its total addressable market,” said William “John” Berger, chief executive officer of Sunnova.
Sunnova has 1.95 GW of solar and 801 MWh of energy storage resources under management, with solar up 41% year-over-year and the storage retention rate at 15.6%, up from 12.5% a year ago.
“Just last week, we announced a conditional commitment with the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office to expand access to Sunnova’s Energy as a Service offerings, potentially adding to our growth by making our energy services accessible to homeowners who may not have qualified without this commitment,” said Berger.
The company raised its 2023 full year guidance, with customer additions increasing from a range of 115,000 to 125,000 to a range of 125,000 to 135,000.
Sunnova’s common stock traded up more than 12.8% today, to $18.43 per share from $16.34 a day ago, on Q1 2023 earnings strength and increased guidance.
Earlier this week, Sunnova announced a $3 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office to support a new consumer loan channel called Project Hestia. If approved, the loan office will backstop the company’s deployment of up to $5.2 billion of collateral projects for the deployment of virtual power plant (VPP) systems. Hestia is designed to increase accessibility to solar and VPP networked solutions for disadvantaged communities who previously may not have been able to finance residential solar projects or energy storage.
Sunnova vice president of capital markets Dan DeSnyder told pv magazine USA that the landmark securitization will take about three years to deploy. The asset-based financing will support new customer solar plus integrated residential solutions installations such as EV charging, smart thermostats and other equipment interconnected to the company’s MySunnova smartphone app, he said.

Grid Alternatives, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that installs clean energy projects, announced a renewed partnership and financial commitment of $300,000 from Bank of America to fund a workforce development program, the SolarCorps Fellowship Program.
The new funding will support Grid Alternatives’ 37 SolarCorps fellows in obtaining experience, mentorship, professional development, and increased knowledge about careers in solar development and other clean energy markets.
Since 2014, 422 individuals have become SolarCorps Fellows, and the experience helped 73% of the individuals land their next job following the fellowship. Since 2010, Bank of America has provided $2.2 million in total funding to Grid Alternatives and has supported 200 fellows in their career advancement since 2017.
“We are at a moment in time when we can create access to clean energy and clean energy jobs in underrepresented communities like never before,” said Alex Liftman, global environmental executive, Bank of America. “That’s why we are pleased to support SolarCorps and the broader mission of Grid Alternatives, which are helping to meet that demand and creating healthy communities and economic mobility in the process.”
The nonprofit development firm’s mission is to build community-powered solutions to advance economic and environmental justice through renewable energy across the U.S., as well as in Tribal authority nations, and worldwide.
Grid Alternatives’ work has taken centerstage in response to the Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory predict strong growth in the solar industry workforce as a result of the IRA.
(Read: “DOE workforce program matches recent grads with energy fellowship opportunities“)
The nonprofit is proud to be a part of the solar industry’s job growth by providing workforce development and training programs, resulting in over 33,000 trainees, students, and volunteers gaining valuable experience in solar installations and construction, and outreach and community solar education.
The organization has demonstrated its commitment to a just workforce transition by serving historically underrepresented communities in the energy industry, including women and Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)-identifying individuals.
Grid Alternatives recruits job training participants from economic and environmental justice communities located in its affiliate offices’ regions, including Riverside, Los Angeles County, Sacramento, Fresno, Oakland, San Diego, Calif., as well as Denver and Kingman Park in Colorado; and Washington, DC.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/27/shoals-technologies-and-brookfield-renewable-launch-ev-charging-as-a-service/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,EV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 27, 2023",Shoals Technologies and Brookfield Renewable launch EV charging-as-a-service,"The need for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations accelerated in the United States after President Biden set a goal of building out a national network of 500,000 chargers. The plan got an added boost with the announced funding to accelerate the creation of zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) corridors that expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure. In a recent report, Wood Mackenzie forecast that the market for public charging networks in North America will grow rapidly by 2050.
Playing their role in the adoption are Shoals Technologies and Brookfield Renewable who jointly announced a strategic partnership to introduce a charging-as-a-service (CaaS) solution for EV charging infrastructure. The new service is designed to eliminate large up-front payments and enables streamlined deployment of charging networks for fleets, retail, multi-unit dwellings and other large commercial properties.
EV charging infrastructure normally requires a large up-front capital investment in charging equipment, electrical infrastructure, and installation, and it can require trenching, which can disrupt site operations. There can also be technical and regulatory hurdles. These challenges have been a barrier to the deployment of EV charging at scale. Shoals and Brookfield report that their CaaS solution eliminates some of these challenges with what they are calling “turnkey” above-ground EV charging solutions that make use of the Shoals Big Lead assembly.
The EV charging infrastructure is based on Fuel by Shoals, which is an above-ground EV charging infrastructure solution. Through the partnership, Shoals and Brookfield will provide commercial, technical and financing expertise.
The CaaS solution is aimed at commercial and industrial and public sector customers, EV solution providers, vehicle manufacturers, fleet operators, and other industry participants. The solution offers end users the flexibility to choose EV chargers from various manufacturers. Subscribers will pay a monthly subscription fee over a fixed time period instead of paying costs upfront, freeing up capital for other core priorities.
The CaaS solution can also be customized, allowing customers to include solar, battery energy storage, and other distributed energy products.
“Coupling Brookfield’s financing and operating expertise with Shoals’ leadership in charging infrastructure, our combined CaaS offering will provide a solution for charge point operators looking to replace the necessary up-front capital investments with payments over time, while enabling faster EV charging deployment with minimal site disruption,” said Jeff Tolnar, president of Shoals Technologies.
Brookfield Renewable is the renewable power company of Brookfield Asset Management. Its portfolio consists of hydroelectric, wind, solar, distributed energy, and sustainable technology solutions across five continents. The company reports that its capacity totals approximately 25 GW and a development pipeline of approximately 110 GW of renewable power assets.
Shoals Technologies Group is a provider of electrical balance of system solutions and components for solar, battery storage and EV charging applications. The company reports that its solutions are deployed on over 20 GW of solar systems globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/27/nevados-all-terrain-solar-trackers-chosen-for-three-virginia-solar-farms/,"INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 27, 2023",Nevados all-terrain solar trackers chosen for three Virginia solar farms,"Nevados, a California-based all-terrain solar tracker company, announced a partnership with Energix Renewables, an Israeli renewable energy developer and independent power producer (IPP), to provide its tracker platform as part of a long-term supply agreement.
Energix plans to use the Nevados solar trackers to minimize grading on domestic projects with severe topographical challenges. The company expects that by using the all-terrain trackers it will be able to develop solar projects in sloped areas that otherwise would need extensive grading.
According to Yezin Taha, co-founder and CEO of Nevados Engineering, modeling has shown that trackers on a 17% slope can capture 6% more solar energy than trackers on flat ground, and up to 30% more energy than fixed tilt systems.
Nevados began its R&D process in 2014, winning a 2015-2016 SunShot award from the U.S. Department of Energy. Its All Terrain Tracker fits to undulating terrain due to its design that integrates the driveline and articulating capability into the same components. Incorporated into the Nevados design are bearings that allow for installation on slopes up to 37% with slope changes as great as 26% across a foundation.
Other unique design aspects include non-continuous torque tubes, shorter pilings, and large tolerances, all of which simplify and speed up the installation, according to Jenya Meydbray, chief commercial officer at Nevados. Top-clamp clips also reportedly help solar modules to align during installation and accommodate different module sizes. The torque tube and damper designs improve wind performance and Meydbray noted, have proven to withstand hurricane-force winds with zero structural damage.
Energix U.S. LLC, its Arlington, Virginia-based subsidiary, reports that it currently has over 6 GW in its U.S. solar project pipeline. With operations in the U.S., Israel and Poland, Energix reports it has approximately $500 million invested in the U.S. with nine operational projects, six projects in construction and others in its project pipeline.
“Our goal is to build high-performing solar projects that respect the natural landscape and benefit local communities,” commented Itamar Sarussi, country manager of Energix U.S. “The new partnership with Nevados means Energix can deploy best-in-class solar assets with minimal topographical impact and help ensure our projects on topographically diverse sites are successful.”
The partners will begin their collaboration with three solar farms in rural Virginia, two of which are located on rolling topography in the highly regulated Chesapeake Bay watershed. Apple Grove Solar is a 20 MW solar project in Louisa County with plans for a pollinator garden on site. The 37 MW Endless Caverns and 25 MW River Trail solar projects are reportedly among the first large-scale solar farms to be located in Rockingham County and Carroll County, respectively.
“As the renewable energy transition spreads to regions with more variable terrain, environmentally responsible construction that eliminates grading will drive the solar industry’s next phase of growth,” said Meydbray.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/27/robotic-solar-pile-driver-three-times-faster-than-humans/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 27, 2023",Robotic solar pile driver three times faster than humans,"Built Robotics has launched the RPD 35, a “fully autonomous” robotic pile driver that integrates survey data, pile distribution, pile driving, and inspection. The company claims it’s the world’s first, and believes they can deploy utility-scale solar foundations up to five times faster than standard installation methods.
According to Built Robotics, the RPD 35 can install an estimated 300 piles per day with a two-person crew, a notable improvement in efficiency compared to the 100 units typically installed per day by a conventional two-person team.

The RPD 35 adds four components to a standard excavator, which work together to facilitate the autonomous pile driving process.
The sleds consist of steel arms extending from both sides of the excavator. Two baskets rest on the sleds, collectively holding close to 200 piles. These baskets are strategically loaded to ensure precise pile placement in the correct sequence. A custom-designed hammer assembly, located at the end of the excavator’s arm, drives the piles into the ground.

The hammer, weighing 7,000 pounds, impacts piles up to 500 times per minute with 4,000 pounds of force per foot. On average, the unit can place a single pile in 73 seconds.
The Exosystem (CPU) serves as the brain of the PRD 35, managing the entire operation. The company claims the unit helps drive piles with ‘sub-centimeter’ accuracy.
Contained within are a liquid cooled Intel Xeon computer processor and a vision system powered by Nvidia graphic processing units. Because the computer is installed on the outside of the excavator and exposed to potentially harsh construction site conditions, its design features shock and shock and vibration resistance, as well as robust protection from water and dust ingress.

In a previous robotization project, the company’s modified excavator performed trench work for underground wiring.
Built Robotics’ website shows that the Exosystem computer is compatible with most mid-sized late-model excavators ranging from 15 to 50 tons. 
Built Robotics reports that it has participated in over 2 GW of solar installations since 2018. The first RPD 35 units are scheduled for deployment in the fourth quarter of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/27/a-new-era-for-solar-energy-not-without-tackling-these-challenges-first/,"EMPLOYMENT,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 27, 2023",A new era for solar energy? Not without tackling these challenges first,"Solar adoption has made important strides in the last decade, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has great potential to help those adoption rates skyrocket. According to SEIA projections, solar capacity is projected to increase to 69% more than what would have been expected without the IRA. Furthermore, it estimates that by 2032, the U.S. will have installed 682 total gigawatts (GW) — more than five times the amount installed today.
That’s due, in part, to the never-before-seen incentives and provisions in the IRA to drive solar adoption and combat climate change. The IRA includes a tax credit of 30% that applies to solar and energy storage projects, and that credit can increase by 10%-20% depending on where materials are manufactured or where the project is located.
Despite its promise, the pathways to IRA benefits are convoluted. Currently, solar tax credits only last until 2032, and there are numerous challenges along the way that the industry, and federal and state governments must overcome. Let’s dive into the current challenges and how the industry can overcome them.
Solar supply chain
Currently, 80% of the panels consumed by the U.S. solar industry originate in four Southeast Asian countries, namely Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Last June, the federal government issued a 24-month reprieve on tariffs for panel imports from these four countries in response to the Auxin petition to the Commerce Department that investigated whether solar companies were circumventing tariffs by shifting their operations to these countries. Moreover, the U.S. government is also navigating the allegations of human rights abuses in manufacturing and trade concerns with China. All of this is directing the U.S. solar industry to secure a domestic supply chain.
We have started to see the results of these efforts. Nearly $5 billion in solar manufacturing investments, including 47 new manufacturing plants have been announced since President Biden took office. Additionally, the IRA includes two specific tax credits to bring solar manufacturing back to the United States. While these are positive steps towards a domestic supply chain, establishing manufacturing capabilities that can meet industry needs isn’t going to happen overnight. It will take years for manufacturing output to match the solar panel demand of the U.S. solar industry. The 24-month reprieve is essential for the industry to get its bearings as it strengthens its local manufacturing base.
Unfortunately, a controversial Congressional Review Act (CRA) seeks to roll back the current freeze on tariffs. Through a joint letter, clean energy trade groups are currently urging members of Congress to oppose the bill and its potentially devastating effects on the industry. As of most recently, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 26-13 to send the solar CRA to the full House. If passed, the CRA would compromise the economics of current and future projects by making some too expensive to deploy, potentially eliminating 14% of the solar industry’s anticipated deployment in 2023, and costing 30,000 jobs in the solar industry. This would      negate the intentions of the IRA and elongate our clean energy transition timeline. A well-oiled supply chain requires strong commitments from developers to procure local materials. While that support and commitment is there, any setbacks such as through the CRA can completely derail the vision that the solar and clean energy industry has for the future.
Workforce shortages
IRA’s build-out of a domestic supply chain as well as clean energy asset deployment will not happen without an adequate number of skilled workers. SEIA projects an additional 200,000 solar jobs will be created by the IRA, leading to 538,000 in total by 2032. Even when domestic manufacturing processes are solidified, there will still be a worker shortage to fully realize the IRA’s potential.
Government, industry, labor, community, and workforce training leaders must convene to      guide the creation of industry relevant training programs. In addition, local governments must provide adequate financial compensation especially to retain solar trainees who opt to leave positions in other industries, and developers can offer assurances in regard to hiring once training is completed. States also need to implement relevant skilled training at high school and community colleges to encourage workers to get into solar and clean energy manufacturing. States that offer robust solar tax incentive in addition to skilled training programs will rise to the top in attracting clean energy investment.
Permitting and interconnection woes
Permitting, interconnection, and transmission remain the biggest challenges yet to be solved. Lack of transmission development remains the number one hurdle for scaling clean energy assets as well as number one cause of interconnection delays for distributed generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reports that about 1,700 GW of solar, wind, and storage await interconnection — up 28% from last year.
Solar industry groups are proactively working to streamline permitting processes for solar installation, but permitting reform will mainly rely on the speedy deployment of transmission infrastructure that would enable large volumes of solar and wind projects to come online. The sooner we can move on adding new transmission capacity, the quicker we can meet the renewable energy capacity demand that will follow the roll-out of IRA incentives. Even with IRA’s allocation of funding towards transmission and grid upgrades, differences between states’ approaches to transmission development can derail infrastructure projects. With this, both state and federal decision-makers will need to work closely with developers and renewable energy industry groups to strategically deploy new transmission and expedite interconnection processes.
Energy equity
Lastly, it would be amiss to not touch on energy equity. A top priority under the IRA is ensuring low-income and energy communities benefit from the multitude of benefits ranging from job and wealth opportunities to clean energy access. For the past decade, solar incentives have largely defaulted toward development in greenfields and around higher income communities. Now with the IRA, a 10% bonus tax credit is available for projects in “energy communities,” defined as brownfields, former coal mines, and coal-fired power plants. Another 10%-20% tax credit will be allocated to projects on Indian land or in low-income communities. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a key funding source within the IRA, also offers $7 billion to states and local governments for projects and initiatives that support greenhouse gas reductions, with an emphasis on projects for low-income and disadvantaged communities.
Incentives for both energy communities and low-income communities will increase energy equity, but they both come with their challenges. For energy communities, the biggest barrier right now is lack of comprehensive mapping tools to help identify those sites, and with brownfields especially, there are liability risks and lack of clear understanding on who would assume those risks.
One of the key ways for developers to ensure energy equity is through community solar,  something the federal government hopes to see 700% growth in by 2025. The IRA allocates a 20% bonus incentive for projects on low-income housing or designated low-income economic benefit projects. Development of community solar projects in urban areas, brownfields, energy communities, and low-income communities will ensure that the benefits flow easily to low-income residents.
Despite the federal incentives, developers cannot utilize these incentives unless states have an enabling legislation to deploy community solar projects. California’s Public Utilities Commission is currently deliberating whether to create a community solar program that ensures at least 51% of subscribers are low-income, and New York is incentivizing community solar projects on brownfields.
But incentives aren’t one size fits all; different communities have varying needs and states must be mindful of what incentives they currently offer and how that merge with the IRA incentives. States should invite the perspective of qualified solar and storage industry participants to better understand how different permutations of incentive structures will affect projects and establish an incentive package that accommodates the unique income structures, energy rates, and environmental obstacles for that region.
Other barriers that developers are currently faced with are zoning constraints and solar development moratoriums in suburban and rural areas, all of which are red flags for industry.
The IRA presents plenty of viable paths for communities and businesses across the country to utilize renewable energy. It’s a historic moment for the solar industry, but right now, developers and other market participants face far too many uncertainties and potential roadblocks to quickly benefit from the landmark legislation. The solar industry must continue to collaborate with multiple parties to improve the supply chain and development processes to expeditiously reap the benefits the federal government is offering and meet the vision this legislation was set out to achieve.
