In this series, pv magazine talks with experts in storm modeling, risk insurance, and damage mitigation to learn how solar arrays can survive nature’s wrath. Read Part 1 here.
The generally accepted consensus around hail damage mitigation for solar projects is that it’s a recently developed area of focus. Only recently have projects come on-line in hail-prone areas, so when disaster struck at Midway, the industry and adjacent risk management industries were entirely caught off guard.
But after talking to Michael Kolodner, U.S. power and renewables industry practice leader for insurance broker Marsh, that consensus doesn’t tell the full story. To understand what has happened to the solar insurance market since Midway, you have to understand insurance’s role in risk management.
Midway, of course, refers to the 178 MW Midway Solar Project that sprawls across 1,500 acres of West Texas near Midland. In May 2019, a monster hailstorm ripped through, damaging or destroying more than 400,000 of the plant’s 685,000 Hanwha Q cell modules; insurance losses totaled $70 million.
Kolodner said that in Texas and the Plains states, big hail events are neither unforeseen nor unexpected. Yet, as new and surprising as Midway was to many in the solar industry, it was equally surprising to many on the underwriting side. This is partially due to underwriting being such a highly specialized and segmented part of the solar sector.
However, for all of the parties that were caught off guard by that May storm, Kolodner also said that there were plenty in the risk and insurance spaces who were well aware of hail’s hazardous nature when it comes to solar. The issue ultimately came down to the maturity of renewable developers when it comes to risk management.
“Insurance often serves as the language for risk management,” said Kolodner, who added that the full spectrum of risk management is much broader.

Prior to Midway, access to insurance was taken as being synonymous with risk management: As long as developers could insure the project until its sale and the buyer had reasonable access to insurance, hail was just something that would be addressed if it ever came up…or down.
And then it did come down on Midway.
Two years after the storm, the market has hardened and insuring projects against hail damage has become more expensive but also less of a catch-all solution. In turn, the risk management aspect of project development has been forced to rapidly mature.
Developers looking to build projects in potential problem areas now include risk assessment as part of their pre-construction process. They also are using hardware and engineering techniques that allow them to better mitigate the potential effects of a catastrophic event. One example is trackers that have a safe-stow function to protect panels in the event of hail.
Kolodner said this sort of diligence has paved the way for a healthier and more diverse insurance market, one that is itself more mature and resilient than a few years ago when insurance was seen as a cover-all solution.
“If you’re taking a more mature approach and the market is not naive or underpricing the risk, now you have a broader spectrum of supply that’s available,” said Kolodner. Underwriters now offer a more diverse  supply of products to support solar energy projects because price points have been adjusted and developers are more sensitive to the risk. “They’re managing it better and they present a more attractive risk profile” to an insurer, he said.
The goal, Kolodner said, is not to insure as much as possible. Rather, the goal is to assess and mitigate risk enough to allow insurance to cover the perils that will always be present. That means that developers working in hail-prone regions can take a number of steps to decrease how much damage hail can inflict on their project, but they can’t eliminate the risk entirely. And it’s just that enduring sliver of risk where insurance fits in.

It would cross 1,500 acres of reclaimed strip mine in two counties southwest of Indianapolis.
Company representatives went before the Vigo County Council in early March, seeking a 10-year tax abatement on property and 10-year tax abatement on personal property of $100 million. About 605 acres of the project would be in that county; the remainder would be in Sullivan County.
If the project moves forward, construction could start in 2023, with commercial operation anticipated for mid-2024. The installation would generate about $50 million in taxes over 35 years: $29 million in Vigo County and $21 million in Sullivan County.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/07/black-hills-signs-15-year-ppa-for-energy-from-200-million-solar-facility/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,COLORADO",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 7, 2021",Black Hills signs 15-year PPA for energy from $200 million solar facility,"Black Hills Energy signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with 174 Power Global for energy from the planned $200 million, 200 MW Turkey Creek Solar facility south of Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Construction is expected to start in 2022, with the project coming online in 2023. Under terms of the deal, Black Hills will buy all power generated by the project. 174 Power Global will lead project development and construction, the engagement and permitting process with local agencies, and also will own and operate the facility.
In January, French energy giant Total and 174 Power Global formed a 50/50 joint venture to develop 12 utility-scale solar and energy storage projects of 1.6 GW cumulative capacity in the United States. The projects are in Texas, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, Virginia, and Hawaii. The first project started production in 2020, and the remainder are expected to go online between 2022 and 2024.
Black Hills Energy is based in Rapid City, South Dakota, and serves more than 1.28 million electric and natural gas utility customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
174 Power Global is owned by South Korea-based Hanwha Group, and has offices in Houston, Irvine, California and New York City.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/07/sunrise-brief-maxeon-will-ramp-up-solar-shingle-module-production-scout-u-s-site/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 7, 2021","Sunrise brief: Maxeon will ramp up solar shingle module production, scout U.S. site","Maxeon Solar Technologies said it will ramp up efforts to sell its Performance line shingled module technology in the U.S., facilitated by the deployment of up to 3.6 GW of new assembly capacity in two phases.
The expansion depends on the company obtaining debt or equity financing to buy equipment, after which initial sales are expected to start in the first quarter of 2022.
Maxeon already has a presence in the U.S. rooftop market through its supply of interdigitated back contact (IBC) panels to SunPower Corp. Maxeon said it will also supply the Performance panels to SunPower. Maxeon was launched in 2020 as an independent company following its spin-off from SunPower.
Maxeon said that in phase one of its capacity expansion it will use existing facilities to ramp 1.8 GW of new capacity. Large-format G12 mono-PERC solar cells are planned to be manufactured in the company’s site in Malaysia, and module assembly is planned to be done at a facility in Mexicali, Mexico.
The company next will select a site for a U.S.-based module assembly facility with a capacity of up to an additional 1.8 GW. Depending on site conditions and market demand, the second phase is expected to begin operation in 2023.
The company said that greater volume in Malaysia and Mexico will improve its overhead utilization, helping to drive down costs for its IBC products. It said its Mexicali factory is well-placed to reach customers in the Southwest U.S.
The new capacity will be used to manufacture Maxeon’s shingled bifacial panel technology, with a rated power of up to 650 W per panel and efficiency that the company said is greater than 21%. It said its primary target market for the new capacity will be utility-scale power plants and large commercial and industrial systems.
Canadian Solar said it began work on four solar projects in Japan totaling 143 MW. This portfolio includes the 100 MW Azuma Kofuji project located in the Fukushima Prefecture, and other projects totaling 43 MW in the Ibaraki and Hiroshima Prefectures.
The Azuma Kofuji project is Canadian Solar’s largest project in Japan to date. It will be powered with the company’s HiKu modules and is expected to reach commercial operation in the first quarter of 2023. Energy generated will be bought by the Tohoku Electric Power Co. at the rate of $0.34 per kWh.
The project is financed by Nomura Capital Investment Co. with construction debt of roughly $230 million. Juwi Shizen Energy will serve as a global EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) firm on the project. The project is expected to participate in the Climate Bonds green certification process which is compatible with the new European Union Green Bond Standard.
The Government of Canada is investing more than C$7.6 million ($6.03 million) for three clean energy projects in remote Arctic settlements in Nunavut.
The  investments include:
The government is investing an additional C$300 million ($238 million) over five years to offer rural, remote and Indigenous communities currently reliant on diesel the opportunity to be powered by clean, reliable energy by 2030.
All three projects were funded through Natural Resources Canada’s Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities program, an eight-year program to reduce reliance on diesel in rural and remote communities by deploying and demonstrating renewable energy projects, encouraging energy efficiency, and building local skills and capacity.
It is also part of the Government of Canada’s Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, a more than C$180-billion ($143 billion) investment over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade, and transportation routes and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
