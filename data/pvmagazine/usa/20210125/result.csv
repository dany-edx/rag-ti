The Millville Planning Board unanimously approved the 50 MW solar farm during its monthly meeting on January 12, clearing the way for construction to begin by year’s end. Called Nabb Solar I, the project will be located in western Millville and is anticipated to begin operation in fall 2022.
Timothy Daniels, Dakota’s principal and co-founder, said the local officials were “quick to see the value of this project.”
Over the 30-year expected life of the project, Nabb Solar I is estimated to generate a total of approximately $7.8 million in taxes. Dakota said it will pay annual real estate taxes of approximately $102,295 to the City of Millville, $67,547 to Millville Public Schools, and $98,166 to Cumberland County, for a total of $268,008 in local taxes per year.
Joe Derella, director of the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners, called the project a “massive $70 million investment in our region” that will create hundreds of jobs.
“This is what the future of energy looks like in New Jersey,” said Millville Mayor Mike Santiago.
Nabb Solar I is one of six similar New Jersey projects being proposed by Dakota Power Partners, which has offices in Millville and Denver, Colorado. In total, Dakota is proposing a $1 billion utility-scale solar investment in the Garden State.
Utilizing a portfolio of utility-scale solar and solar+storage projects across the state, the company said it intends to achieve generating capacity totaling more than 1 GW in New Jersey.
According to Dakota, the company has participated in the development of more than 3.15 GW of operating and in-construction wind and solar projects around the U.S., representing an aggregate capital investment in rural communities in excess of $3.8 billion.

According to the DOE, the new Energy Storage Workforce Innovation Center will serve as a training center based in the Midwest. It will support the battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing industry in the northeast region of Ohio–referred to as “Voltage Valley” due to the EV sector’s regional investments–by helping supply a capable workforce.
The DOE said the U.S. is in a period of “tremendous advancement in battery technologies, presenting new opportunities for electric vehicles and energy storage systems,” and it’s essential to “prepare a workforce that will lead the next generation of energy storage technologies into practice.”
This effort supports the DOE’s Energy Storage Grand Challenge, which draws on the research capabilities of the U.S. national laboratories, universities, and industry to accelerate the development of energy storage technologies. The DOE added that the Energy Storage Grand Challenge Roadmap outlines a department-wide strategy to accelerate innovation across a range of storage technologies and develop a skilled workforce based on three concepts: Innovate Here, Make Here, and Deploy Everywhere.
U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, representing Ohio’s 13th District, called this new partnership a “great example of how government can work to bolster efforts on the ground in our community to dominate in the clean energy economy.”
The $1 million project is sponsored by the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office and the Advanced Manufacturing Office.

It would mark the first time that cutbacks outlined in drought contingency plans drafted two years ago have been put in place.
Everything from hydroelectric power generation to agricultural production to the bubbling fountains at Las Vegas casinos could be impacted.
Impacts on hydro generation could have ripple effects across the Southwest, including solar and energy storage.
A forecast released in mid-January by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said that the federally owned Lake Mead and Lake Powell — the nation’s two largest reservoirs and critical storage for Colorado River water and its 40 million users — are both approaching near-record-low levels. If those levels continue dropping as expected, agreements signed by the seven Colorado River Basin states in 2019 will go into effect, with water deliveries curtailed to keep the federal government from stepping in and imposing cuts of its own.
The Upper Colorado River basin region includes all or parts of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Drought has been an ongoing problem across much of the region for most of the century. The Bureau of Reclamation’s latest quarterly report showed Lake Powell at 42% of capacity and Lake Mead at 40%.
Three hydro plants that could be affected as water levels fall are the 1,312 MW station built at Glen Canyon Dam in 1964, and two hydro plants at Hoover Dam, which were built in 1936 and have a combined capacity of 2,078 MW.
In 2019, the Glen Canyon station generated nearly 4 million MWh of electricity. Combined, the two Hoover Dam stations generated roughly 3.4 million MWh, according to S&P Global.
The Bureau of Reclamation said in its report that during the 21-year period from 2000 to 2020, inflow to Lake Powell, which is a good measure of hydrologic conditions in the Colorado River Basin, was above average in only four of the past 19 years. It said the period 2000-2020 was the lowest 21-year period since the closure of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963.
The report said that under the current most probable forecast, the total water-year 2021 inflow to Lake Powell would be 5.72 million acre-feet, or roughly 53% of average.
If worst-case projections materialize, the water level at Lake Powell could drop below a critical level — measured as 3,525 feet above sea level — in early 2022, threatening the ability of Glen Canyon Dam to generate electricity.

In an announcement, Clorox said it has reached its goal to power the company’s U.S. and Canadian operations using 100% renewable electricity. Part of the corporation’s environmental, social, and governance commitments, the target was achieved four years earlier than originally planned, thanks, in large part, to a solar contract.
In 2019, Clorox signed a 12-year virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) to buy 70 MW annually from Enel Green Power’s Roadrunner solar project in Texas. Enel kicked off construction on the 497 MW Roadrunner facility in 2019 and completed the two-phase project in late 2020, making it one of the largest solar plants in the Lone Star State.
Moving forward, Clorox will maintain its 100% renewable electricity goal through the VPPA and other market purchases of renewable energy credits. Schneider Electric Energy & Sustainability Services advised the company on the deals.
Ed Huber, Clorox’s chief sustainability officer, said the manufacturer feels “a sense of urgency to address climate change” and recognizes “businesses play an important role in driving needed progress.”
Clorox also joined a coalition of other corporations–including Amazon, McDonalds, Pepsi Co., Walmart, and Facebook–calling on the Biden Administration to help pave the way for a zero-carbon U.S. power sector.

And while many companies already have gone on record about the needs to cut emissions and move towards a renewable power sector, the difference here is that this group, working in collaboration with the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), outlines specific policy actions that must be taken to achieve the zero-carbon goal.
The companies call on the Biden Administration to:
The statement points out that federal energy research, development, and demonstration is significantly underfunded, which  results in what the group calls an “insurmountable barrier” for pre-commercial clean energy technologies on the path to market.
The group also expresses the goal of expanding access to clean energy for all energy buyers. This goal has already been roadmapped by Google, one of the group’s members.
In a white paper, Google established that it is looking to create utility programs that enable broader access to affordable clean energy and develop new models where multiple users can share clean energy assets.
The company also said that the approaches would not be exclusive to just Google – that’s the whole point. The idea is to make them replicable and scalable for companies and customers that want to procure multi-source and multi-technology blended power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA portfolios that comprise a mix of wind and solar can help corporations extend the clean energy production hours of their portfolio, and provide risk diversification benefits.
Companies like Google have an inherent advantage in managing all of the necessary data that comes with moving entirely to 24/7 renewable power. Recognizing this advantage, the white paper describes the process in part as an obligation to open the same energy purchasing pathways to customers of all scale, so that they can fit their specific power needs.

The $261 million transaction is expected to close in the first quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
Leeward is a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, an investment arm of OMERS, one of Canada’s largest benefit pension plans.
The deal includes the Rabbitbrush, Madison, Oak Trail, Horizon, and Ridgely projects, which are expected to start construction in the next two years, and the 30 MW Barilla Solar project, which is operational.
The project pipeline includes projects in the California, Southwest, and Southeast markets. Sale of the platform is a result of a strategic review First Solar announced last year, said CEO Mark Widmar. The sale is part of a transition that is intended to enable the company to focus on scaling, developing, and selling module technology.
First Solar will retain 1.1 GW of projects in the U.S. that it said will be sold separately. Key members of the First Solar project development team are also expected to join Leeward upon closing.
Leeward also will buy 650 MW of First Solar’s Series 6 PV solar modules for its additional development opportunities. Leeward’s acquisition includes purchase orders for 888 MW of Series 6 modules for the five development projects.
Leeward’s acquisition will include 242 MW of Series 4 modules safe-harbored under the solar investment tax credit (ITC) program, 148 MW of which have previously been booked.
“This acquisition will support our aggressive growth strategy as a leading independent power producer and elevate Leeward’s prominent position in today’s energy market,” said Jason Allen, CEO of Leeward Renewable Energy.
The sale is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
First Solar has 1.9 GW of annualized manufacturing capacity in Ohio and also operates manufacturing facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia. It produced 5.9 GW of Series 6 modules globally in 2020.

The firm said that annual solar installations are predicted to grow by more than 30% in 2021 after “volatile demand” in 2020 triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.
It said that although global installation numbers increasingly de-link from reliance on the Chinese market, China will still account for 35% of global annual installations in 2021. There are now 18 markets globally that have +1GW cumulative solar installations, compared to six a decade ago.
This market demand comes despite an increase in production costs (up 10–15%) driving a historic surge in module prices, especially in the first quarter. However, production costs are set to drop in the second half, IHS Markit said, lowering module prices and laying the ground for record solar installations at the end of 2021.
“We will see for the first time a situation in which global demand grows over 30% despite high module prices in the first half of the year, which is unprecedented in the solar photovoltaic industry,” said Edurne Zoco, Executive Director Clean Energy Technology.
Spain, India, and the Middle East region will continue to be the markets with the lowest solar levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). IHS Markit said it projects photovoltaic (PV) system capex to continue declining in 2021 by 5% year on year, largely driven by decreasing component prices.
Meanwhile, average module efficiency records continue to increase, surpassing 22.5% in PERC monocrystalline cell commercial production and are forecast to reach 24% by 2022.
Perovskites technologies, a promising solar cell technology development with significant potential to increase cell efficiencies and reduce costs, is set to continue breaking efficiency records, the firm said. But the technology will only be mature for commercial production in the next five years.
Sunrun released early financial results and operating metrics for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2020.
It said that megawatts deployed (MW) were roughly 171.6 MW, up 10% from the third quarter. This reflects deployments for around 23,500 customers during the period, resulting in total customers of more than 550,000. Cumulative megawatts deployed reached 3,885 MW.
The company said that gross earning assets were $6.9 billion. Net earning assets, which Sunrun defines as gross earning assets less project debt and pass-through financing obligations, was $2.9 billion. Adjusted project-level debt and pass-through financing was $4.0 billion.
Total debt was $5.1 billion; fourth quarter transaction costs related to the acquisition of Vivint Solar were estimated at $60 million to $70 million.
The company said it will issue fourth quarter 2020 earnings on or about February 25.
In a related move, Sunrun said it plans to offer $350 million of senior notes due 2026 in a private placement. The company said it will use a portion of the proceeds to pay the cost of capped call transactions. It will use the rest to repay outstanding debt and for other corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions and future transactions.
Borrego, a developer, EPC and O&M provider for large-scale renewable energy projects, announced a brand identity, a reorganized corporate structure, and a strategy focused on utility-scale solar and storage opportunities. The company’s growth plans call for each of its business units to reach gigawatt scale by 2024. It also said it hopes to increase its workforce by 25% this year.
Borrego implemented most of the organizational changes in 2020. Its three business units—development, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), and operations and maintenance (O&M)—have already begun operating independently. The development and EPC businesses also set up utility-scale divisions last year.
As part of its strategy shift, each of the company’s businesses has a goal of operating at gigawatt scale by 2024. The O&M group is the first business to achieve this milestone; as of November 2020, the team reached 1 GW of solar and storage projects under management, the majority of which Borrego EPC did not build.
The company also shifted from single-transaction, smaller, behind-the-meter projects to supporting long-term partners. This pool of systems owners, independent power producers and utilities can be served in multiple ways across multiple businesses to power their growth over time, the company said.
The company said its development and EPC businesses have already booked “hundreds of megawatts of large-scale projects,” many of which are in the late-pipeline or active construction stages.
