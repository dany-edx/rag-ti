The Charger Solution program, which was approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission last August, enables users to install an EV charger with no upfront cost and monthly payments starting around $14 a month, according to Duke Energy.
The program lets EV drivers select from a range of chargers. The $14 monthly fee, for example, is for a three-year residential rental contract for a Level 2 charger, which Duke says can typically fully recharge an all-electric vehicle within eight to ten hours. Businesses may choose from options including a four-year rental term for a Level 2 charger or a seven-year rental term for a DC Fast Charger.
The Charger Solution program supports North Carolina’s goal of 1.25 million EVs in the state by 2030. It also supports the Biden administration’s goal of building a national network of 500,000 public EV charging ports by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
Last year Duke launched its Charger Prep Credit program, which provides credit to help defray the cost of upgrading a home’s or businesses’ electrical system in preparation for a charger installation. Duke reports that 6,000 residents have taken advantage of the program to date.
In addition, Duke Energy launched the Home Charging Plan, a 12-month EV charging subscription pilot program designed to enable residential customers to charge an EV at home for up to 800 kWh per month for a fixed monthly fee. As part of the agreement, participants allow Duke Energy to manage charging through its automaker app and participate in periodic demand response events. The pilot for this program is now closed to new subscribers in North Carolina.
Periodic demand response events will help Duke Energy operate the grid more effectively by shifting demand on the grid to hours of the day where clean energy supply is more available or cost effective for customers. The subscription pilot is currently closed to new enrollments in North Carolina. Duke reports that it is seeking regulatory approval of similar programs across all its service areas.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/29/sunrun-solar-plus-storage-power-the-grid-during-peak-demand/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-01-29,Sunrun solar-plus-storage powers the grid during peak demand,"Residential solar installer Sunrun has partnered with utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) to enroll solar and energy storage customers in a program called Peak Power Rewards, which compensates customers for dispatching power during times of peak demand on the grid.
Sunrun enrolled 8,500 customer systems in California, operating the assets as a distributed network that forms a power grid. Under the program, the assets delivered an average of 27 MW of power during peak hours for over 90 days consecutively.
“PG&E was able to confidently rely on the renewing daily resource of Sunrun’s fleet of home solar and storage systems,” said Mary Powell, chief executive officer, Sunrun. “We are rapidly transitioning to a storage-first company and the results of this partnership highlight the unique capability that distributed power plants provide communities.”
The distributed solar and storage assets provided an instantaneous peak output of nearly 32 MW and frequently provided up to 30 MW of power, enough for more than 20,000 homes.
Sunrun said it managed the fleet of home batteries and provided power to PG&E in the same way a traditional centralized power plant would. However, the program was operational within six months of signing the contract with the utility, a timeframe that far outpaces the development cycle of utility-scale assets.
Enrolled batteries in the Peak Power Rewards program discharged energy to the grid from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. from August through October, a time of peak electricity demand in California. Customers received an upfront payment of $750 and a free smart thermostat for participating. Sunrun said that batteries enrolled in the program retain enough energy to meet personal, essential needs in the event of a power outage.
“Solar-plus-storage plays a significant role in California’s clean energy future and we’re proud of our customers who are leading the charge with their clean energy adoption. Every day, we’re looking at new and better ways to deliver for our hometowns while ensuring safety, reliability and resiliency for our customers,” said Patti Poppe, chief executive officer of PG&E Corporation.
PG&E has the most behind-the-meter solar installations in the nation attached to its grid, with approximately 820,000 customers connected adding roughly 8 GW of capacity to the grid. The utility said nearly 75,000 PG&E customers have connected energy storage systems to its grid, representing 670 MW of capacity.
“What is happening in California will soon need to be replicated across the country,” said Powell. “Residential solar-plus-storage systems networked together as distributed power plants are answering the demand call by providing flexible, on-demand power stabilization while also guarding against increasing rates.”
Despite adding new value to customers through battery aggregation programs, residential solar installers in California have been faced with increased challenges to acquiring new customers. High interest rates have worsened the return on investment for customers, and the move toward NEM 3.0 has altered the value of exported electricity. The California Solar and Storage Association recommended policy changes to improve market conditions and revive the state’s wounded behind-the-meter solar industry.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/29/secondary-market-for-solar-modules-presents-low-cost-buying-opportunities/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-01-29,Secondary market for solar modules presents low-cost buying opportunities,"EnergyBin maintains a business-to-business solar equipment commerce platform, selling secondary-market components for goods that are not sold via primary distribution channels. In its recent report, “PV Module Price Index for the Secondary Market”, the company noted an increase in secondary market volume, and a decrease in module prices industry wide. 
“Half-way through 2023, we began to see prices drop as the market sought to correct itself,” said Renee Kuehl, chief operations officer, EnergyBin. “Yet, we expect prices to continue to fluctuate as supply ebbs and flows. Therefore, it’s more imperative than ever to keep a watchful eye on prices.” 
The most recent report shows data for module spot prices transacted in December 2023. Secondary market modules traded on EnergyBin traded at $0.261 per watt for all black modules, high efficiency modules fetched a price of $0.376 per watt, mainstream modules $0.246 per watt, low-cost modules $0.199 per watt, and used modules averaged $0.095 per watt. 
Mainstream modules are defined as standard modules with efficiencies between 19% and 21% and typically built with mono p-type or n-type PERC, HJT, or TOPCon cells. This category of modules has decreased in price 38.5% year-over-year since December 2022. Over 80% of the modules traded on EnergyBin in 2023 had efficiencies of 19% or greater. “Low-cost” modules are legacy or lower wattage modules in new condition with efficiencies at or below, and these modules have decreased 44.1% year-over-year. 
EnergyBin’s report is based on the sale of over 5.4 million solar modules, with several transactions exceeding 15,000 units. Its largest lot sale was 65,520 modules. The company noted a 17% increase year-over-year in total count of modules sold and 27% growth in the MW capacity of the total sale of modules. 
Solar modules have several different ways of reaching the secondary market. This can include remarketed products that primary buyers aren’t purchasing, including clearance, close-outs, surplus, and miscellaneous one-off sales. Modules may also enter the market via asset liquidations from acquisitions or bankruptcies, products for resale as a result of cancelled projects, delays, or downsizes. EnergyBin also sells products that are used, refurbished, or have no manufacturer warranty. 
Buyers engage in the secondary market to efficiently request quotes from multiple suppliers, access bulk order discount, or locate hardware that primary vendors do not carry or do not have in stock. Secondary markets often give buyers the chance to secure low costs for equipment. 
The report noted that U.S. module pricing is about $0.10 to $0.15 per watt higher than global prices due to Section 201 and AD/CVD tariffs and other administration costs like customs bonding. 
EnergyBin said the most sought-after brands in 2023 were Canadian Solar, Jinko, REC, JA Solar, Qcells, and Longi. The most common module format are 144-cell “mid-size” commercial modules that typically measure around 82 inches by 41 inches and are compatible with microinverters and power optimizers. 
“I have urged some module manufacturers to maintain their production of 450 W to 500 W mid-sized modules rather than producing the 500 W to 600 W modules,” said Paul Kriedermacher, owner and engineer of commercial and industrial solar installer MinnSolar Inc. “Ideally, we’d like to see a module in that range with its junction box positioned at the end of the module to provide superior wire management that meets NEC screening requirements for these types of systems.” 
The report also noted high demand for U.S.-made solar modules, which on average fetched 40% to 45% higher prices than imports, excluding those from Western Europe. Tax credit bonuses allocated for solar projects using domestic content are driving the demand for U.S.-made components. 
Looking ahead, EnergyBin expects prices to continue to fluctuate through 2024 as new players enter the market and the solar industry transitions from p-type to n-type cell technology. 
“Like the primary market, the secondary market is not just about hardware,” said EnergyBin. “Much of the market’s success lies in value-added services that seek to maximize the performance and lifespan of PV assets and provide responsible disposal solutions for end-of-life material. Companies that add services, including inspection, testing, repair, remarketing, and recycling to their business models will increase profits over time while contributing to a sustainable circular economy.”

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/29/solar-is-a-team-sport/,"BUSINESS,GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,QUALITY,UNITED STATES",,2024-01-29,Solar is a team sport,"Despite the infrequent failures and ‘thermal events’ that are verifiably caused by solar, the hundreds of thousands of solar ecosystem members globally suffer when an issue with a solar site gains media attention. In most cases, a sober root-cause analysis will uncover a relatively minor issue that started a cascade of other, more serious problems. However, most resulting mainstream media coverage and industry scuttlebutt oversimplifies or ignores the root cause entirely; that’s easier to write about, makes for better headlines, gets more clicks, and helps disperse blame.
A similar thing happens with self-driving cars. Of the 6.7 million reported car accidents on U.S. roadways in 2019, only 327 accidents involved self-driving vehicles. Even in the face of this miniscule percentage, the latter received outsized attention in the media and rarely is the coverage truly nuanced.
For the reported thermal events in the United States, fire departments around the nation responded to an average of 346,800 home structure fires from 2015 to 2019. According to the National Fire Protection Association, the top five leading causes of home fires, in order, are cooking, heating, electrical distribution and lighting equipment, intentional fire setting, and smoking materials. Note that electrical distribution includes electrical outlets, outdated/worn electrical wiring, cords and electrical circuits, old appliances, light fixtures, and portable heaters and does not account for rooftop solar systems.
Fires caused by rooftop PV systems are historically underreported, but the Solar Energy Industries Association maintains that spontaneous combustion from a PV system is extremely rare. The quantitative analysis determined an annual fire incident rate of 0.0289 per MW. A 2022 fault tree analysis published in the Journal of Building Engineering revealed that modules, isolators, inverters, and connectors play a significant role in igniting PV fires, with connectors contributing to 17% of incidents.
The reality is that fires found to have been caused by solar equipment are vanishingly rare. Just like how a self-driving car that crashes on the highway makes the evening news, there is no shortage of media attention when there is a presumption that a structure fire was caused by solar. In the face of the challenge of misconceptions about solar equipment, the industry must come to terms with the reality of collective responsibility and modify its behaviors and practices accordingly. The outcome will be fewer bad headlines for solar and a more unified solar sector overall.
Embracing responsibility, together
One of the challenges with attributing responsibility for a problem on a solar installation is the number of companies involved in the value chain. A fertile ecosystem of blamestorming develops when equipment from half a dozen vendors is deployed at an installation, a seventh designs the system, an eighth installs it, a ninth maintains it, and a tenth owns it. In some cases, this number is even larger. For any individual entity, the path of least resistance is to point to one of the others for culpability. In reality, the companies technically all share responsibility. Reputationally, however, the entire solar industry suffers; all are punished.
To protect the next round of growth, the industry must come to terms with the fact that solar is a team sport. Reliable and efficient solar energy systems depend on the expertise of installers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies. These installers, in turn, lean on quality system design and skilled labor for their success. Hardware and software providers occupy a pivotal role in delivering solutions that are not only reliable but also user-friendly and feature rich. The points at which the work of these entities intersect, however, have been too transactional for too long.
‘Crosstalk’ and the solar value chain
Since stating a problem without suggesting a (possible) solution is not productive, here is a recommendation for every company involved in the solar industry: According to the Department of Energy (DOE), solar system quality issues fall into three categories: design flaws, faulty installation, and equipment defects. Any possible solution, therefore, should address one, several, or a combination of these three possible causes. A worthy and real example through which to investigate the blame-reputation dialectic is ‘crosstalk.’
Any large electrical system with long wire runs and multiple transmitters is susceptible to crosstalk. The term is solar industry shorthand for electromagnetic interference (EMI), created by the interaction of two or more electromagnetic fields of adjacent energized cables. The phenomenon is present in wired communications in home automation, automobiles, or entertainment systems in commercial buildings and residences.
Crosstalk can be minimized, even eliminated, when several preconditions are met, starting with well-trained engineers who design systems such that crosstalk does not occur. In large-scale C&I solar installations, the most efficient wire layouts often require that home runs to inverters share cable races. When array voltage increases towards the inverter-side of the cable run, as multiple strings come together, the close proximity of these cables can result in mutual EMI radiation. That is not a big issue for shielded cables that only carry current, but this type of interference can cause problems for data communications signals.
The installation process is another node in crosstalk mitigation. Installation teams must be well-trained, follow equipment vendor installation guidelines, use high-quality components, and install those components correctly. For systems that were designed according to crosstalk avoidance strategies but were not installed properly, diagnosis and rework are usually costly, margin-eroding exercises that can foul reputations and sour customer relationships.
The final piece of the quality puzzle is the quality of the products being deployed. Suppliers should have a continuous improvement approach to quality with a systematic root cause corrective action analysis, thorough documentation, and a great support team.
Hanging together
Although a single self-driving car accident damages the reputation of all purveyors of self-driving cars, we do not impugn the automobile industry at large. In reality, self-driving car accidents are rare, just like fires caused by solar equipment. Perception, however, often becomes reality. Every company in the value chain has a role in upholding the reputation of solar energy. And that goes for every step in the solar value chain, too; from engineering, procurement and construction to installation teams and distributors.
By prioritizing quality in design, installation, equipment, and service, we collectively propel the growth and success of solar energy solutions. This shared commitment contributes significantly to paving the way for a more sustainable future powered by the brilliance of solar innovation.
Beyond our close-knit solar community, any hiccups in commercial installations tend to cast a spotlight on ‘solar’ as the culprit. This holds true for the customers we collectively serve. Whether for better or worse, we find ourselves sharing the same ‘solar’ identity, which implies that our fortunes and misfortunes are connected. The solar industry is maturing rapidly, and the quality across every aspect of the value chain is good, but focusing on continuous improvement is critical.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/29/a-retirement-boom-for-fossil-fuels/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-01-29,A retirement boom for fossil fuels,"The United States hasn’t built any “net new” fossil electricity generation facilities since early 2003, over twenty years ago. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) December 2023 860M report, the nation has seen the commissioning and decommissioning of approximately 258 GW of gas, coal, and other fossil capacities.
As fossil fuel generation plateaued, the U.S. embraced renewable energy, bringing 162 GW of solar and 150 GW of wind capacity online. This transition has been running parallel to a surge in economic strength, as well: the nation’s gross domestic product grew more than 67% over an inflation-adjusted $15.5 trillion in 2003 (actual figure $11.4 trillion) to just over $26 trillion by 2023.

The nation’s electricity consumption also increased about 10% over the same period. The annual growth of the formerly nascent wind and solar sectors now far surpasses any foreseeable increase in U.S. electricity consumption.
This shift is leaving fossil fuel plants, particularly those coming online in the past two decades, underutilized and operating at progressively lower capacity factors. Gas peaker plants, which represent a large volume of the new fossil generation, run at capacity factors ranging from 5% to 15% annually.
Analysts at the data analytics firm Rhodium Group reported that over a similar period of time, the U.S. power sector’s annual emissions were cut by 40%, from roughly 2.5 billion to 1.5 billion metric tons. This decrease has occurred while nuclear and hydropower have fallen in output, coal has been replaced by gas, and wind and solar have grown.
Going forward, these patterns are expected to continue: more fossils retiring than being built, coupled with massive amounts of renewables stepping up to take their place.

In 2024, the expected retirement and introduction of fossil fuel plants are projected to offset each other, each contributing less than 5 GW of capacity. However, a shift is anticipated for 2025, with 15 GW of fossils retiring, predominantly coal generation, against the commissioning of just 5 GW of new gas plants.
In stark contrast to the fossil retirements, the U.S. is expecting to install over 100 GWdc of new solar power capacity in 2024 and 2025, bringing the solar fleet to greater than a quarter of a terawatt of capacity. Additionally, the EIA projects 15 GW of batteries to be installed in 2024, followed by much more in the following years.

Although battery storage doesn’t generate electricity, it plays a crucial role in optimizing energy use, storing power during low demand periods and releasing it when demand peaks. These upcoming battery installations are specifically targeting the very high cost electricity required during peak demand periods, areas traditionally serviced by gas peaker power plants operating at modest 5% to 15% capacity factors.

A research team from the U.S. Department of Energy’s NREL has reviewed the degradation of commercial and utility-scale PV sites from across the United States between 2008 and 2022.
Their data set, thought to be the largest of its kind for such a project, consisted of data from 25,000 inverters across almost 2,500 commercial and utility-scale PV sites in 37 states and U.S. territories, equivalent to almost 8 GW of solar. The mean age of the PV systems observed was five years.
The researchers found a median loss in performance rate of 0.75% per year, matching similar values reported by previous studies. The analysis discovered systems in hotter temperature zones exhibited twice as much performance loss than those in cooler climates, at 0.88% per year and 0.48% per year respectively. Overall, 90% of systems studied saw losses in performance of less than 2% per year.
Chris Deline, a group manager for PV field performance at NREL, said the median loss in performance is a “crucial number.”
“First, it shows that our fleet of PV systems, on the whole, is not failing catastrophically, but rather degrading at a modest rate within expectations,” he said. “It’s important that we quantify this rate as accurately as we can, because this small but tangible number is used in almost all financing agreements that fund solar projects and provides critical guidance for the industry.”
The short-term impact of extreme weather, such as flooding, high winds, hail, wildfire and lightning, was minimal in most PV systems studied. The median outage length after an extreme weather event was two to four days, resulting in a 1% median loss in annual performance.
A total of 12 systems out of 6,400 experienced outages of two weeks or more. Most outages occurred because of flooding and rain, followed by wind events. Most systems in the data set experienced only one weather-related outage.
The researchers, however, found that when powerful enough, extreme weather can accelerate long-term degradation. Hail greater than 25 mm in diameter, winds over 90 km/h and snow of depths greater than 1 meter were found to lead to greater annual performance losses in PV systems, such as mechanical stresses cracking solar cells.
“We don’t feel any of this analysis suggests that PV systems are unreliable or especially vulnerable to extreme weather. PV has demonstrated that it can provide backup power and save lives when surrounding infrastructure is damaged by extreme weather events,” said NREL researcher Dirk Jordan. “Yet, there are further measures we can take to improve the quality of equipment and especially installation best practices to increase resilience to these weather events.”
Ownership may lie with module manufacturers and PV testing organizations understanding the thresholds at which damage can occur. Then, the NREL says, the industry can begin to design for these conditions and create tests that subject panels to realistic stresses created by wind, snow and hail.
“High-quality installations are also key to increasing resilience against extreme weather. Standardizing installation practices, such as using through-bolting and mounting modules far enough from the edge of roofs in wind-prone areas, could help mitigate system performance impacts,” Jordan added.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/29/tribes-to-sponsor-1-to-3-gw-of-renewables-to-help-retire-dams-and-restore-salmon/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,OREGON,WASHINGTON",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,2024-01-29,Tribes to sponsor 1 to 3 GW of renewables to help retire dams and restore salmon,"An agreement among the U.S. Government, Washington, Oregon and four Native American tribes will facilitate the buildout of at least 1 GW to 3 GW of tribally sponsored clean energy capacity, the Biden Administration said.
Federal funding potentially reaching more than $1 billion will support the agreement, which began as a proposal to the Biden Administration from the four tribes and two states. The agreement encompasses the original proposal, known as the Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative, and has the ultimate goal of restoring salmon, steelhead and other native fish populations in the river basin.
A key feature of the agreement is the goal of breaching four dams on the lower Snake River, whose locations, all in southeast Washington, are shown in the image below from Trout Unlimited with the labels 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Salmon populations in the river system have been dwindling due to the presence of hydroelectric dams, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported. Salmon and steelhead populations on the lower Snake River are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
A 2022 report sponsored by Washington Governor Jay Inslee and U.S. Senator Patty Murray from Washington recommended that the services of the dams on the lower Snake River be replaced before any dams were breached.
The new agreement is aligned with that recommendation. It specifies actions by the parties to deploy renewable generation that would serve as replacement power for the lower Snake River hydroelectric dams, to pave the way for an authorization by Congress to breach the dams.
Under the agreement, the U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture will work with the signatory tribes to provide technical assistance, planning and funding for whatever role tribes want to take with regards to renewables projects, such as “individual or collective ownership, leasing, power procurement, etc.”
The four tribal nations that signed the agreement are the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the Nez Perce Tribe. Dates of their treaties with the U.S. Government are shown below.

The U.S. Department of Energy will also provide funding to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and potentially other DOE labs to complete a regional energy needs planning process.
DOE said it would work with the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that operates the region’s transmission, to “continue to advance reforms to BPA’s interconnection processes, aiming to significantly speed the interconnection process and identify means for more efficient use of existing transmission.”
Chairman Shannon F. Wheeler of the Nez Perce Tribe said in a statement “As Nimiipuu (Nez Perce) we are bound to the salmon and the rivers – these are our life sources. We will not allow extinction to be an option for the salmon, nor for us. The United States is bound to salmon and to us by Treaty where we reserved all our fisheries – our Treaty is the supreme law of the land under the United States Constitution.”
The recommendations issued by Governor Inslee and Senator Murray in 2022 called for immediate action to deploy the scale of clean energy infrastructure necessary to confront the climate crisis, regardless of whether Congress authorizes the breaching of the lower Snake River dams.
Several of the parties signing the agreement are parties to pending lawsuits to protect native fish populations in the Columbia River Basin, who agreed to put their lawsuits on hold in favor of pursuing the agreement.
Regarding the planned replacement of hydropower with renewables, Nancy Hirsh, executive director of the NW Energy Coalition, said that in the past decade the region has replaced 2 GW of coal generation with new wind, solar, battery storage and energy efficiency. She highlighted a 2022 study by the consultancy Energy Strategies that her group sponsored, which found that building 1.3 GW of solar, 1.4 GW of wind and 0.2 GW of battery capacity would be the least-cost option for replacing the four dams’ annual generation in a way that would balance the region’s substantial remaining hydropower generation.
The Bonneville Power Administration estimated that the agreement will have an annual average rate impact of 0.7%.
Hirsh said “no one is saying these replacement energy services are free, but the cost of maintaining the lower Snake River dams is substantial and managing salmon to extinction is unacceptable.”
The 92-page agreement among the tribes, states and the U.S. Government was filed in the Federal District Court in Oregon, and is available in three parts: the memorandum of understanding, the Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative, and the federal government’s commitments.
