The agreement for the recycling of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar modules builds on Orsted’s existing recycling contract for thin-film modules signed with First Solar.
With the two partnerships engaged, all modules in Orsted projects are now connected to a recycling agreement. While Orsted’s U.S. solar projects are still in the early stages of their lifetime, the company has already recycled 4,000 panels. The company has over 1.1 GW of solar assets in the U.S. that will have coverage by Solarcycle, with an aim to have 17.5 GW of onshore wind and solar capacity by 2030. This presents a massive opportunity for the company to recoup materials as their assets reach end-of-life.
Solarcycle, based in Texas, opened its recycling facility in 2022 to accelerate the circular economy for the solar industry. It offers a process for recycling solar modules that includes either repurposing them for other applications or extracting valuable materials from the modules.
The extraction process is able to reclaim 95% of a module’s materials including silver, silicon, copper and aluminum. Solar glass can also be reused or recycled. Research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that by 2040, for key materials, recycling can meet 25% to 30% of domestic solar manufacturing needs in the United States.
“Solar energy is an integral part of Orsted’s growing land-based portfolio and is one of the most powerful technologies we have to produce the clean energy our communities and business partners need,” said David Hardy, Group executive vice president and chief executive officer Americas at Orsted. “As a leader in sustainability, we are thrilled to work with such an innovative American company to ensure c-Si solar modules are disposed of properly and to support a company spearheading solutions on behalf of the solar industry. Not only does this advance sustainability for Orsted and the industry, but it also strengthens the American renewable energy supply chain.”
Today, less than 10% of all end-of-life modules are currently recycled in the U.S., but that is expected to change as companies adopt sustainable best practices for end-of-life management. Target, for example, just decommissioned a 360 kW solar installation in Los Angeles and sent the modules to Solarcycle where the modules will be processed, recycled, and reintegrated into the supply chain.
Rystad Energy estimates that recyclable materials from PV panels at the end of their lifespan will be worth more than $2.7 billion in 2030, up from only $170 million this year, and the value will approach $80 billion by 2050.
Based on the rate of installations and a 15-year lifespan for some solar modules, Rystad estimated that the North American market for recycled solar modules will be worth $1.5 billion in 2037, and this number may be on the conservative side, as the projection was prior to the solar boom ignited by passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Solarcycle is at the head of the curve and has been the recipient of generous funding during its first year in business. The company raised $30 million in Series A funding, bringing the company’s total funding to $37 million since its inception.
“Orsted’s 100 percent commitment to recycling their solar projects in the U.S. and globally is notable and the first-of-its-kind. Their leadership is walking the walk, and we are grateful to collaborate with their team to meet their circular economy goals,” said Suvi Sharma, CEO and co-founder of Solarcycle. “Today’s announcement also demonstrates that the industry no longer sees recycling as an afterthought, but it is rapidly becoming the norm to plan for end-of-life practices years in advance.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/07/exponential-growth-for-long-duration-energy-storage-investment/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 7, 2023",Exponential growth for long duration energy storage investment,"As renewable energy sources like solar and wind are increasingly relied upon for supplying electricity, a buildout of energy storage capacity is needed to address the intermittent cycles of generation of these technologies. 
Today, much of the energy storage added to the grid is short duration, replacing the role of reserve natural gas peaker plant capacity that are fired up as electricity demand reaches its high points. Energy storage across the U.S. added 14.1 GWh, 4.8 GW of capacity in 2022, leading to an average duration of about 3 hours, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  
As more renewables are integrated with the grid, longer-duration storage methods are in-demand for their ability to supply reliable baseload power. Long duration energy storage typically can dispatch power for 10 to 12 hours, making it well-suited to complement the day-to-night intermittency of solar generation. 
A study by the Cleantech Group showed that investments in long-duration energy storage (LDES) has grown sharply to $1.8 billion last year, as seen below. 

Investment has largely been directed towards electrochemical (i.e., battery) solutions, with thermal storage, chemical storage, and mechanical storage all holding a considerable share. The report said that the variations in technology used are shaped by the environment the projects are installed in. For example, mechanical storage would be suitable for countries with abundant land and high solar penetration, whereas hydrogen would be appropriate for areas focused on wind energy with salt caverns available, said the report. 
“It will not be a one-size-fits-all situation; different LDES solutions will be required for different geographies and technologies,” said Selene Law, senior associate, energy & power, Cleantech Group. “For example, Form Energy’s iron-air technology will not be suitable for balancing solar power. Conversely, vanadium flow will not be the best solution for seasonal storage.” 
(Read: “Innovations in long-duration energy storage”) 
The U.S. Department of Energy released a report outlining a pathway for LDES to attract up to $530 billion in cumulative investment by 2050.
DOE said maintaining this trajectory will require the deployment of six to 10 GW of LDES projects and the allocation of $6 billion to $9 billion in capital investment by 2030. To align with the 2050 goals, it will need to establish a manufacturing capacity of 10 GW to 15 GW and roll out further deployments by 2035.
The DOE objectives for 2050 include the deployment of 225 GW to 460 GW of LDES capacity, which is projected to save $10 billion to $20 billion of system costs annually, compared to scenarios without such deployment. By 2030, inter-day LDES project costs must decrease from $1,100 to $1,400 per kW to $650 per kW and improve round-trip efficiency from the 69% seen in best-in-class technologies in 2022, to about 75%, said the DOE report.
The Cleantech Group shared that Spain, Canada and Australia are among leaders outside the U.S. Spain has set a target of 20 GW in grid-scale storage by 2030, while Canada aims for 12 GW.
“The emergence of support schemes like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S., carbon prices of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide in the European market and increasing penetration of renewables have created a fertile ground for developing new LDES solutions,” said Law.
The Cleantech Group will hold a webinar, “Long-Duration Energy Storage: The Next Frontier or The Next Hype?” on June 28th at 10:00 a.m. EDT / 3:00 BST.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/07/50-states-of-solar-incentives-oregon/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,OREGON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 7, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Oregon,"Oregon’s largest city, Portland, carries the historic nickname of Bridge City. A state with more than 7,000 bridges, including more than 50 picturesque covered bridges, it’s hard to not imagine rivers, timber and snow-capped mountain peaks just outside of its cities.
As such, hydropower from its riverways represented more than 51% of the Beaver State’s power mix last year. Wind power followed behind with 14% of the state’s power mix, which is more than 70% renewable energy, according to the Energy Information Administration.
In 2022 Oregon’s solar market grew from under 100 MW of installed capacity per year to a respectable 1.4 GW, with more than 176 MW deployed in 2022. The state ranks 21st in the U.S. for solar generation and will move up to 19th place in five years, based on a strong 2.5 GW backlog of projects, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Incentives
With about 15 rural electric cooperatives and two investor-owned utilities, Portland General Electric (PGE) and PacifiCorp, the state’s utility regulator allows residents to generate up to 25 kW of residential and 2 MW of commercial and industrial solar.
For PGE and PacifiCorp customers, net excess generation (NEG) is carried over to the customer’s next bill as a kilowatt-hour credit for a 12-month period. The annual billing cycle concludes at the end of the March billing cycle each year. Any excess generation credits remaining at the end of a 12-month period is credited at the utility’s avoided-cost rate to customers enrolled in Oregon’s low-income assistance programs.
Customers outside of the northern and southernmost utility’s cities can see excess generation purchased at the rural electric cooperative’s avoided-cost rate or credited to the customer’s next monthly bill as a kWh credit. At the end of the year, remaining credits are enrolled in a low-income assistance program, credited to the customer outright or to other local use, according to DSIRE’s database.
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Oregon residents and all U.S. residents alike are offered the Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC). The credit applies to 30% of the installed system cost and can be rolled over if you do not have a large enough tax appetite in year one.
Community solar
Enacted in July 2022, the Oregon Public Utility Commission under legislation UM 1930 allows for utility customer subscription to three of the state’s utility-assembled community solar projects located in PGE, PacifiCorp or Idaho Power service territory.
According to the state’s community solar database, about 60 community projects ranging from 300 kW to 5.6 MW are available or under development across the state, with projects in PGE and PacifiCorp territories allowing for up to 40% of residents in low-income communities to participate.
Agrivoltaics
While its community solar program might not provide full accessibility to all ratepayers, Oregon has seen a blossoming agrivoltaics market crop up in recent years. Agrivoltaics, or the shared land use of solar energy generation and agriculture applications, has put Oregon State University’s agrivoltaics program on the map for progressive farming and energy land use.
Located in Aurora, Ore., Oregon State University in October 2022 began construction of the five-acre Solar Harvest project at the school’s North Willamette Research and Extension Center, 20 miles south of Portland. The ground-mounted solar photovoltaic project is projected to generate 326 kW upon completion and at $1.5 million capital cost, is the result of a partnership between Oregon State and the Oregon Clean Power Cooperative, which developed the solar system. Additional financing came from a grant from utility PGE’s Renewable Development Fund, and nonprofit Roundhouse Foundation, a climate-focused impact fund based in the Sisters, Ore.

The Solar Harvest project is designed for agrivoltaics research, with panels that are more spread out than traditional project and able to rotate to a near vertical position to allow farm equipment to easily pass through.
Maggie Graham, facility research assistant at OSU’s College of Agricultural Sciences, tells pv magazine USA in May 2023 that Solar Harvest project was 98% complete in recent weeks. “We have an assortment of interdisciplinary research projects going on this spring including vegetables, forages, nursery stock, (and) potted trees” at the agrivoltaics research site, Graham said.
The OSU agrivoltaics program is also engaged with fourth-generation family farmer Jack Southworth to test cattle grazing agrivoltaics use cases on the beef cattle farmer’s 12,700 acre farm in Bear Valley, Ore., which is seeing a 1.5 MW solar system deployment on an eight-acre tract on the farm that dates back to 1885.
Notable project
Avangrid, a power development company owned by the Iberdrola Group, in April announced the commercial operations of the Pachwáywit Fields solar farm in Gilliam County, Ore., becoming the largest operating solar farm in Oregon at 205 MW(DC) power capacity.
Pronounced Patch-Why-Wit, meaning “sun” in the Sahaptin language of the Columbia River, Oregon-based Native American tribe, the project is located on ceded lands of the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs.
Avangrid spokeswoman Mariel Huerta Meza told pv magazine USA the project location was determined based on interconnection, transmission and offtake interest, solar resource, willing landowners, permitting, and constructability. For many years, Avangrid has brought clean energy jobs to Oregon communities near the Boardman power plant, a retiring coal generating facility. The Pachwáywit Fields location is also adjacent to operating Avangrid wind facilities, providing easier interconnectivity with existing infrastructure, she added.

The 8.9 MW array, now the largest active floating PV facility in North America, will provide approximately 95% of the electricity needs for the Canoe Brook water treatment plant.
The floating PV array is mounted on plastic floats that are moored to the reservoir’s floor. Floating PV is typically left for human-made bodies of water, preventing the risk of tides or saltwater degrading the equipment.
The array spans 17 acres of water surface and is comprised of 16,510 panels. water treatment plant serves over 84,000 homes and businesses in the area. The array cost $7.2 million to build, said Rettew, a Pennsylvania-based firm that constructed the project.
Researchers from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and State University of Ponta Grossa in Brazil studied the beneficial effects of mounting PV on water, which cools the array, offering improved operational efficiency. The scientists compared the efficiency of the floating solar module with ground-mounted systems, as modeled by Sandia National Laboratories. The results show that a maximum of 3% efficiency gain is possible, compared to the ground-mounted Sandia model.
“It takes a lot of energy to pump that water,” said Mark McDonough, president of New Jersey American Water. “When we can use a cleaner, greener, more efficient energy source, we want to seize that opportunity.”
The project is owned and operated by NJR Clean Energy Ventures. Since 2009, the company has invested over $1 billion in commercial and residential solar projects. As one of the largest solar owner-operators in the state, the company maintains 65 commercial solar assets across four states and a portfolio of more than 440 MW of installed capacity. The Canoe Brook marks the second floating PV project in the company’s portfolio, adding to the 4.4 MW array activated in 2020 in Sayreville, New Jersey.
“Floating solar technology creates new opportunities for underutilized bodies of water, allowing space that would otherwise sit vacant to enable large-scale renewable energy generation, which helps to bring the benefits of clean energy to even more customers,” said Robert Pohlman, vice president, NJR Clean Energy Ventures.
Floating photovoltaics, sometimes referred to as “floatovolataics,” are expected to establish a sizeable new global market by 2026, said Global Industry Analysts (GIA), which has projected a 4.8 GW deployment by that year.
Generally, 1 MW of FPV plant covers water bodies of about 17 acres to 25 acres and can generate electricity of 1500 MWh, said GIA.
The market is currently pegged at about 1.6 GW globally, and GIA predicts it will move at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.7% by 2026, reaching 4.8 GW. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the largest market share at around 60%, with China the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 59.4%. Floating PV’s cost is much higher than that of stationary solar panels, the key hinderance in its growth, said GIA.
GIA said the U.S. has over 24,000 human made water bodies that are anticipated to be suitable for floating PV development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/07/community-solar-legislation-introduced-in-ohio/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,OHIO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 7, 2023",Community solar legislation introduced in Ohio,"Ohio state representatives James M. Hoops (R-Napoleon) and Sharon Ray (R-Wadsworth) introduced legislation HB 197, a bill that will kickstart the community solar market in Ohio under a pilot program.
HB 197 and other Ohio solar initiatives have gained momentum in part due to Governor Mike DeWine administration’s support of the economic benefits that in-state manufactured solar panels can bring to the Midwestern state. 
“Our state is primed for community solar and all its economic benefits,” said Representative Hoops. “This new bill will ensure that projects across the state can generate clean energy, ratepayer savings, and local jobs in a fast-growing solar manufacturing industry right here in Ohio.” 
Community solar projects are small generation installations of solar arrays typically below 5 MW of capacity, sited on brownfields, industrial sites, and other preferred areas in proximity to electric customers they’re intended to serve, including households, small businesses, and public institutions.   
“Ohioans want jobs and the power to choose where their energy comes from. This bill brings both of those things plus more to our state,” said Representative Ray. 
HB 197 is expected to advance Ohio’s energy security goals while increasing economic revenue.  
First, the bill establishes a pilot program that will consist of 1.5 GW of community solar, enough energy to power almost 300,000 homes. Subscribers to any community solar program will be eligible for a bill credit, usually equal to 10% to 20% savings, from their utility provider for their proportional amount of energy generated from the community solar facility.  
Second, the bill would make community solar developed on brownfield sites eligible to receive grants to help cover costs associated with site preparation and construction. A working group will bring electric distribution utilities, consumers, and community solar industry representatives together to engage in proactive conversation to ensure the pilot program operates smoothly.
“Ohio has the potential to lead the region in community solar, but past legislation did not create ample opportunities,” said Carlo Cavallaro, Midwest regional director at the Coalition for Community Solar Association. “This bill, in its establishment of a pilot program, would generate energy across the entire state — bringing residents bill savings and the state billions in economic development and millions in local tax revenue.” 
To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have established community solar platforms from pilot stage to statewide implementation. Most recently, Maryland passed community solar legislation HB 908, making it the 23rd community solar market.  
Additional states that currently have bipartisan or Republican-sponsored community solar bills that could become law include New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  
A cumulative 5.6 GW of community solar generation capacity has been installed in the U.S., and Wood Mackenzie’s most recent community solar market outlook predicts that there will be 6.2 GW power installed across the country by the end of the year. 
Ohio currently has over 927 MW of solar installed, ranking 26th in the country, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Solar provides 0.9% of Ohio’s electricity, but that is expected to change, as SEIA’s projection is that 8.25 GW of solar will be installed over the next five years.
In addition to a growing solar industry, the Buckeye State is home to several manufacturers of solar products including thin-film manufacturer First Solar, racking manufacturer Applied Energy Technologies (AET) and glass supplier Glasstech.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/07/solar-power-crosses-the-political-aisle-75-million-for-agrivoltaics-research/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 7, 2023",Solar power crosses the political aisle; $75 million for agrivoltaics research,"In August 2022, no Republican votes were cast in favor of President Biden’s IRA climate law. However, now that the legislation is in effect and cash is on the table, leaders of conservative states are reaching across the aisle and participating in the inevitable renewable energy revolution.
Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Mike Braun (R-IN) are breaking the partisan mold by introducing the $75 million Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Act of 2023. The funding will be dispersed at a rate of $15 million per year from 2024 through 2028. The act stipulates that the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) must collaborate with the Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE) and other pertinent specialists to conduct extensive research and demonstrations of agrivoltaic systems.

According to White House estimates produced before the IRA was passed (and summarized by Bloomberg), red states are expected to gain $337 billion of financial benefit from IRA funded factories and wind, solar and energy storage facilities, while blue states would draw $183 billion. Since the signing of the IRA, these projections have held true as clean energy related factory announcements have strongly trended toward red states.
An agrivoltaic system, as defined in the bill, refers to a system where both solar energy production and agricultural activities, including crop or animal production, are carried out concurrently on the same land. These dual-function systems offer numerous benefits over standalone farming or solar setups, including amplified farm profits and decreased water consumption. The panels create a ‘microclimate’ that conserves evaporated water, while plant transpiration cools the panels, significantly enhancing their performance. Solar panels also provide protective cover to crops against severe rainfall and hail.

Source: National Renewable Energy Laboratory
The research required by this bill will encompass a broad range of aspects, including but not limited to:
Based on the study’s findings, the Secretary of the USDA will create a 5-year plan for utilizing the research and various USDA activities to provide better support to agrivoltaics. A comprehensive report outlining the study’s results will be submitted to the relevant committees within three years of the Act’s implementation.
Furthermore, the Act requires the Secretary of Agriculture to “collaborate with USDA Climate Hubs and extension programs to share research findings and translate research findings into educational, outreach, and technical assistance materials for agricultural producers.” It also mandates the establishment of a network of research and demonstration sites across various U.S. regions to examine and showcase the effectiveness of agrivoltaic systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/07/fresno-community-solar-farm-to-reduce-electricity-costs-for-low-income-residents/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 7, 2023",Fresno Community Solar Farm to reduce electricity costs for low-income residents,"The Fresno Disadvantaged Community (DAC) Solar Farm is unique in many ways. It’s the first utility-scale solar facility of its size within the city limits of Fresno, California. It’s the largest solar project constructed to serve low-income residents in California. It pays prevailing wages and brings job training to formerly incarcerated individuals who are looking to join the clean economy.
Once the project begins operation, it will provide low-cost, clean energy to local PG&E customers under PG&E’s Disadvantaged Communities Green Tariff (DAC-GT) Program.
Multiple stakeholders collaborated to bring the project to fruition. A team including local developers Larry Westerlund (a former Fresno City Council member) and Richard Spencer (a prominent Fresno businessman) who partnered with California-based solar developer White Pine Renewables to bring the project from concept to construction readiness. The long-term project owner is AB CarVal, a global alternative investment manager that has deployed over $3.0 billion in clean energy investments.
The project development team worked closely with local partners in Fresno. City Council Member Miguel Arias said, “the Fresno DAC Community Solar Farm is the perfect case study of ensuring equity in the new green economy through public-private partnerships that benefit all Fresno residents.”
White Pine co-founder Evan Riley told pv magazine USA that the project is “a win-win-win, as it provides a benefit to the local community through utility bill savings, increased lease revenue to the City of Fresno as the landowner, helps PG&E meet their DAC goals, and valuable job training and high-paying construction opportunities to local community members.”
Riley added that the project’s location in an urban, disadvantaged community, “enables local residents to see a direct link between renewable energy and economic benefits.”
Job training
Workers for the project were hired locally through a jobs training program run by Grid Alternatives, a national nonprofit organization based in Oakland, Calif., that has been a leader in renewable energy workforce training for decades.
“AB CarVal and White Pine proved their commitment to inclusive solar workforce development as the key partner for our recent training in Fresno,” commented Karina Gonzalez, co-executive director of Grid Alternatives Central Valley. “Their team advocated for our program’s graduates as they sought employment, and job placements have far exceeded our expectations as a result.”
Nearly 70% of the participants in Grid Alternative’s program have already secured jobs with AB CarVal and White Pine’s regional installation subcontractors and other local solar companies, including several graduates who are now on the project construction team.
The project, located in Council District 3, was made possible by close collaboration with the City of Fresno. Riley told pv magazine USA that Westerlund first identified the project site as suitable for solar, and the project development team worked closely with council member Arias and local community members throughout the permitting process. Riley praised Arias, noting that Arias “was really the champion within the city who helped rally a number of local stakeholders to make this happen.”
“The Fresno DAC Community Solar Farm is the first project of its kind in California, but it will not be the last,” said Riley, adding that “our collective success has paved the way for future, equity-focused utility-scale community solar projects across the state.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/07/rfp-alert-usda-opens-1-billion-loan-program-for-rural-renewables-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 7, 2023","RFP alert: USDA opens $1 billion loan program for rural renewables, storage","The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Utility Service will open on June 30 its platform for letters of interest for a $1 billion loan forgiveness program for renewable energy projects that will serve a mostly rural population.
The window for letters of interest will remain open until September 29. USDA will then invite selected applicants to submit a full application.
Projects that use wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, or biomass generation are eligible for loan forgiveness under the Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) program, and projects may use renewable energy storage as well.
The baseline loan forgiveness amount will be up to 20%. Up to 40% loan forgiveness will be available for projects serving primarily energy communities or distressed or disadvantaged communities. Projects serving Puerto Rico or a tribal area, or owned by a tribe, may qualify for up to 60% loan forgiveness.
The PACE program’s goal is “to increase clean energy in rural America and make it significantly more affordable for consumers, especially for those in energy distressed, disadvantaged and tribal communities, to do things like cool their homes, run their businesses and farms, and power their cars,” said Bob Coates, a policy and outreach branch chief with USDA, on a webinar.
The Rural Power Coalition has said the program will aid rural electric cooperatives that are “minimally taxed,” and thus cannot directly receive tax credits for wind and solar developments. Under the IRA, these cooperatives may now receive a direct payment from the federal government rather than a tax credit, the coalition said, which thus “opens the door for new clean energy investments.”
Eligible applicants must generate electricity for resale, and may serve residents in both rural and nonrural areas, but at least 50% of the population served by a proposed renewable energy project must live in communities with populations of 20,000 or fewer.
Seemingly any type of entity that could develop a large-scale renewables project is eligible, as listed on a USDA web page describing the program:
The PACE program’s official notice of funding opportunity spells out the program’s selection criteria and requirements to apply for loan forgiveness. While that notice does not use the term “utility-scale,” Coates said on the webinar that the program is looking for “utility-scale” projects. Asked for the program’s definition of that term, Aliza Drewes, a senior advisor on energy for USDA, said “We do not set a definition and leave it up to applicants to assess. The minimum loan amount is $1 million, so that is one rough way to assess utility-size.” The maximum loan amount, inclusive of forgiveness, is $100 million.
USDA has scheduled several more webinars to explain the application process and answer questions from prospective applicants. USDA has also posted a fact sheet on the program, a slide deck, and a list of answers to frequently asked questions, which USDA is updating regularly.
PACE awards will be made between September 1, 2023 and December 2025, and all funds will be fully disbursed by September 30, 2031. The PACE program is authorized by section 22001 of the Inflation Reduction Act.
