To assist the process and build capacity among its varied utilities, a knowledge sharing platform has been funded by the Canadian federal government.
The Electricity Transition Hub was launched today and will be managed by the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA). Speaking at its launch, the senior director of the hub, Phil McKay said that while the initial funding will get the hub off the ground, the intention is for the initiative to prove its worth and become “self-standing” after the initial three years.
McKay noted that knowledge sharing among regional utilities is of great importance given the diversity among Canadian utilities.
“In Canada we have a representation of many of the different grids that exist around the world, from islanded systems to fully integrated metropolitan areas,” McKay told pv magazine. “So, what we’ve heard from each one of those utilities is actually quite different based on their context, which is why it is quite important for us to tailor the information.
“So, we’re not looking for a single silver bullet here, we’re looking to help with the transition at each of those regional contexts, cultural contexts, and the existing infrastructure that is there.”
The Electricity Transition Hub already boasts 13 inaugural partners including the Alberta Electric System Operator, BC Hydro, City of Medicine Hat, EPCOR, Essex Power Corporation, Fortis Inc, NB Power, Manitoba Hydro, Ontario Power Generation, Qulliq Energy Corporation, SaskPower, Toronto Hydro, and Utilities Kingston.
Accelerating deployment
Robert Hornung, the outgoing president and CEO of CanREA said that Electricity Transition Hub will play a very important role in informing Canadian utilities about the rapidly changing renewable energy technology landscape, at a time when the industry must ramp up to meet Canada’s decarbonization goals.
Canada has a legislated national goal to achieve net zero economy-wide emissions by 2050. The country also has the target of implementing a zero-emissions electricity network by 2035. To meet these goals, Hornung, who has a career spanning close to 20 years in Canadian renewable energy industry organizations, said solar and wind deployment must rapidly accelerate.
“To get onto a net zero pathway, we think we are going to need to add 30 GW of wind and solar within the next eight years,” Hornung told pv magazine. “The good news is that we already have commitments made, procurement processes in place that will take us to at least half of that total. And now it’s a case of ensuring that those are successfully implemented and ensuring that we get onto the other half.”
Limited distributed energy resources (DER)
Hornung acknowledged that distributed solar and energy storage continues to play a limited role in Canada’s energy mix, although there is an increasing willingness among provincial governments and utilities to foster its adoption.
“I think it is fair to state that at this point in Canada, we don’t have the same frameworks to support that deployment that we’ve seen in other countries.
“We do see some signs in terms of a willingness by governments to revisit net metering and net billing frameworks going forward, and to enable more corporate or customer procurement – which is a rarity in Canada because of our vertically integrated monopoly utilities,” said Hornung. “But this innovation is now coming to the fore because people recognize that DER will play a role but more importantly, customers are demanding it.”
Speaking at the Electricity Transformation Canada conference, Jeff MacAulay, the CEO Charge Solar said that awareness of the cost competitiveness of rooftop PV among Canadian households and businesses remains low. Charge Solar is a rooftop PV distribution company and engineering services provider, that has been active in the market for more than 30 years. It claims to partner with over 1,000 installers across Canada.
“Awareness remains a top concern for us,” said MacAulay. “Solar is a new topic for a lot of homeowners, and many are unaware that solar LCOE is already below many utility rates. Public education remains a top priority for us.”
Energy Transformation Canada 2023 will take place on Oct. 24-25, in Calgary, Alberta.

Sweden-based start-up Swedish Algae Factory has developed a new material, called Algica, to improve the efficiency of silicon and thin film solar panels. As part of their Sunalgae Life project, the team cultivates single-celled photosynthesizing algae called diatoms to extract their shells, which reportedly have unique light-manipulating properties, including blocking ultraviolet (UV) light.
The shells are then added to the encapsulant of silicon modules or to the anti-reflective coating on the glass of thin film modules, which the Swedish team claims could boost their efficiency by 4% and 36%, respectively. These enhancements were “measured in indicative flash tests performed by external institutes,” including the Chalmers University of Technology, according to the team’s website.
The algae shells should also reduce the degradation of solar panels over time caused by UV radiation. The team estimates the resulting modules would be 3.9% cheaper compared to currently commercialized panels.
The Sunalgae Life project required a €4 ($3.99) million investment, partly awarded by the European Union. One of its goals is to commercialize the algae material for use in solar panels. The team has now inaugurated a pilot facility in Sweden to mass produce the material. The new facility is expected to cultivate 500 kg per year and subsequently 1,000 kg per year. Until now, the team has cultivated 30 kg per year in a greenhouse.
“Material produced from the facility will [be] tested for repeatable efficiency enhancement in solar panels,” the project website says. The team claims the production process is circular. “The material is produced in an environmentally friendly process where water is cleaned, valuable nutrients are recycled, carbon dioxide is absorbed, and a valuable sustainable organic biomass is also produced.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/28/nearly-4-of-u-s-homes-have-solar-panels-installed/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",Nearly 4% of U.S. homes have solar panels installed,"According to the 2020 Energy Information Administration (EIA) residential energy consumption survey, about 3.7% of U.S. single-family homes generated electricity from small-scale solar arrays. In EIA’s 2018 commercial energy consumption survey, it was found that 1.6% of commercial buildings have small-scale solar generation.
Residential solar buildout varies widely by region. The West had the most with 8.9%, followed by the Northeast (4.7%), the South (1.7%), and the Midwest (1.4%).
Commercial solar adoption was also most common in the West with 3.8% of buildings generating electricity with local solar. This was followed by the Northeast (2.5%), the Midwest (0.8%), and the South (0.6%).
The presence of small-scale solar on residential and commercial buildings also differed by year of construction, said the report. Buildings constructed after 1980 were more likely to have solar installed.
The report also found that 5.7% of households with incomes of more than $150,000 installed solar, while 1.1% of households with incomes less than $20,000 installed solar.
The EIA survey also found that government-owned buildings were more likely to have small-scale solar generation than non-government ones. Buildings used for public assembly, education, office space, or retail accounted for 61% of all commercial buildings that reported having small-scale solar generation.
On the rise
Solar adoption at all sectors, residential through utility scale, is expected to increase significantly over the next decade. Following the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, a study by Princeton University said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The Act is expected to lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.
Annual U.S. energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% in 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and industry. This translates into hundreds of dollars in annual energy cost savings for U.S. households. Tax credits, rebates, and federal investments in the Act would shift costs from energy bills to the progressive federal tax base.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/28/first-solar-announces-270-million-investment-in-rd-innovation-center/,"MARKETS & POLICY,OHIO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",First Solar announces $270 Million investment in R&D innovation center,"Following a loss reported in its quarterly earnings report, First Solar announced plans to invest approximately $270 million in a dedicated research and development (R&D) innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio.
In its Q3 earnings call yesterday, First Solar CEO, Mark Widmar said that in Q3 First Solar produced 2.4 GW of modules, and shipped 2.8 gigawatts. “Although showing signs of the recent easing, the overall shipping and logistics environment remains challenging,” Widmar said. Third-quarter revenue of $629 million missed analyst estimates of $744.35 million, according to Benzinga Pro, and the company reported a quarterly net loss of 46 cents per share, which missed average estimates for a loss of 27 cents per share.
Nevertheless, Widmar expressed optimism. “The continued long-term demand for our products and the fact that our technology is expected to serve as the backbone for many of our customers’ long-term growth plans is a testament to First Solar’s strong fundamentals.”
The company plans to expand capacity to approximately 10.7  GW in 2026. Additionally First Solar will spend  up to approximately $200 million to upgrade and expand its Ohio manufacturing footprint at both of its current operating facilities, and a third is under construction and scheduled to come online in the first half of 2023. Widmar estimated that its Ohio nameplate capacity will increase by almost 1 GW to just over 7 GW by 2025.
The newly announced R&D facility will be located near First Solar’s existing Perrysburg manufacturing facility, and will an area of approximately 1.3 million square feet. Plans are for a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, which will produce full-sized prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules.
“With a record shipment backlog and consistent demand for our modules, we face the twin challenges of optimizing existing and planned production capacity to deliver on our commitments, while ensuring that our technology roadmap does not lose momentum,” said Widmar. “This investment allows us to create an R&D sandbox separate from our commercial manufacturing operations, ensuring that we can accelerate innovation without the cost of taking mission-critical tools offline.”
First Solar’s manufacturing line currently handles both commercial production of solar modules and the company’s product development efforts. The line, however, cannot handle both activities simultaneously.
“We expect that this new facility will play a pivotal role in solidifying America’s leadership in the development and responsible production of high performance thin film photovoltaic semiconductors,” said Markus Gloeckler, chief technology officer, First Solar. “This facility will be designed with the future in mind and we expect that it will directly enable the next generation of advanced photovoltaics.”
First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building its first new manufacturing facility in India, scheduled to begin operations in the second half of 2023. On completion of its expansion plans, the company expects to have over 20 GWDC of annual global manufacturing capacity in 2025.

Startup Mango Power recently unveiled a 3.5 kWh battery system that can be used to meet both home backup needs and portable power requirements. The system can be expanded up to 14 kWh.
Up to two standalone or expanded units can be connected to further increase the total capacity to 28 kWh. The system provides a 3 kW output capability (expandable to 6 kW) and supports a 240 V output to power heavy-duty appliances.
Mango Power has incorporated four charging methods, as well as 16 output ports, to make the Mango Power E suitable for various scenarios. Input methods include AC wall outlets (up to 3,000 W), solar panels (up to 2,000 W, 60 V to 150 V), EV charging (EV1772), or generators. It charges up to 80% in one hour in quick-charge mode.
In terms of output, the Mango Power E includes four 20 A (AC) output ports, six 27 W USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports (65 W and 100 W), one car power output at 12 V/10 A, two DC 551 ports, and one AC RV port at 30 A.
The system features CATL’s lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. Its lifespan exceeds 2,000 cycles. The Mango Power E also comes with a five-year warranty.
Mango Power is a newcomer to the battery energy storage space. It said it launched late last year, after crowdfunding more than $1 million for its “two-in-one, home-and-portable battery system” in a matter of “minutes.”
Its latest product announcement follows the launch of the Mango Power M Series earlier this year. The product  can be used as an 18 kW PV energy system, as storage with a 15 kWh to 20 kWh battery for daily use and emergency purposes, and to provide full house power backup, including fast charging for EVs.
In addition, the M Series uses CATL LFP battery cells and comes with a 10-year warranty. It comes in different versions for the US and EU markets, and supports single- and triple-phase connections with 12 kW of output capability.
The recommended retail price for a 12 kW/15 kWh system is $19,499 ($19,899 with 9.6 kW home EV charger), and $22,999 for a 12 kW/20 kWh system ($23,399 with a 9.6 kW home EV charger).

It’s time to combat utility opposition to solar  As part of Aurora Solar’s Empower 2022 online solar summit, Bernadette Del Chiaro, from the California Solar & Storage Association, will moderate a talk about electric utilities and how they have abused their monopoly position to discriminate against solar in the U.S. 
Cooling down solar modules by increasing space between panel rows  A U.S. research team claims to have demonstrated that increasing the spacing of solar panels between rows improves PV system efficiency and economics by allowing airflow to cool down the modules. The method could improve a project’s LCOE by as much as 2.15% in certain climates.
Solar tiles connected to an air heat pump  Germany’s Paxos is currently testing the solar tile in a testing facility connected to an air heat pump. The panel can provide heat and electricity at the same time, while also improving the heat pump’s coefficient of performance by around 25%.
U.S. Army builds further resilience with flow battery pilot project at Fort Carson  The redox flow battery dubbed GridStar Flow is intended to help protect the installation during emergency situations.
