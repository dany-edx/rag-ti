Following the completion of phase II, the project is now 16 MW in capacity, with the remaining 8 MW set to come in phase III. Construction on phase III is expected to begin in the 4th quarter of 2021.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund program is responsible for cleaning up some of the nation’s most contaminated land and responding to environmental emergencies, oil spills and natural disasters.
Built in 1907, The Milford Paper Mill encompassed over 73 acres, but when it closed in 2003 only 21 acres could be built on. It was listed as a Superfund site in 2009 and the EPA conducted several elements of the site’s cleanup. The process included removing hazardous materials, storage tanks, oil-containing electrical equipment, asbestos, construction and demolition debris, concrete, scrap metal, and over 10,500 cubic yards of contaminated soil.
An hour North up route 182, CEP is developing another solar project on an EPA Superfund site: the 25.6 MW community solar installation on the site of the former Combe Fill North Landfill. Once complete, the project will be among the largest solar installations developed on a capped landfill in the nation. It is expected to provide clean power for over 4,000 homes. There is currently no public timetable for project development and construction.
New Jersey is the state with the highest number of Superfund and brownfield sites in the nation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/21/recycling-solar-panels-making-the-numbers-work/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2021",Recycling solar panels: Making the numbers work,"If the solar industry wants to claim it has green cred, then solar panels must be managed in a sustainable manner at the end of their usable lives.
Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry.
The research was published in Nature Energy and offers a real number for policy makers to consider: a $10-18 per panel subsidy to pay for recycling at the end of the panel’s life.
The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. At that price, a profitable and sustainable solar panel recycling industry could establish itself by 2032.
The NREL research said that specific tools could be effective at minimizing the landfilling of solar panels. The first simply would ban solar panels from landfills. The second option would subsidize solar panel recycling in order to lower the effective cost of recycling solar panels as the industry scales.
 
A qualitative description of each graph’s overarching influence is below, starting from the top left and moving to the right:
The NREL research said that recycling targets could be reached earlier and at a lower overall cost when panel subsidies are increased. Based on $28/module recycling costs and an $18 per module subsidy, (which lowers the cost to $10/module as shown in the graph below), it would take 12 years to reach a 20% solar panel recycling rate and profitable recycling. That’s six years earlier than the $10 per module subsidy, which lowers recycling costs to $18 per module and takes 18 years to achieve the same 20% rate.
In this model, subsidizing at a higher rate per module – early in the program when there are fewer modules to recycle – results in subsidizing for fewer years, thus lowering the program’s overall costs.
Due to the growing nature of the solar industry, we could tax all newly sold solar panels at a low rate to raise the $18 per solar panel being recycled. The reason the tax rate per new panel can remain low is that new panel production greatly outnumbers the quantity of panels being recycled. In the United States by the end of 2020, more than 70% of all panels had been installed in the previous five years. That means few of those panels will need end-of-life considerations for a long time.
In a mature solar industry, however, solar panels become just as likely to be replaced as newly installed. And since the average panel life is around 25 years, we might assume that eventually, 1/25th of all solar panels will be recycled each year, on the order of 4%.
Research by the International Renewable Agency forecasted that 1% of panels might fail in the first two years (mostly due to damages from shipping and installation). It also estimated that around 2% of solar panels would be landfilled after 10 years. This implies that panels in a young U.S. market are currently failing at a rate of around 1% per year. But since plenty of panels are already being reused, the number of landfilled panels is lower than 1%.
For sake of argument though, let’s assume that 1 GW of our 100 GW fleet will be thrown away in 2021.
Since the U.S. is on track to install roughly 25 GW this year, diverting the entire 1 GW of failed panels away from landfills would result in a 25:1 ratio between the newly installed panels and the failed ones. If we assume that an average panel that is being recycled produces 350 watts, then a subsidy of $18 per panel would cost $51 million.

Spreading that cost across the estimated 25 GW of newly installed solar results in a fee of about $0.002 per watt. The cost per panel works out to roughly $0.78 cents per residential solar panel, and just over $1.oo per utility-scale panel.
For a rough comparison, consider that some states levy a recycling fee of 5 or 10 cents on a six-pack of beer. Seen that way, one panel equals a little more than a six pack.
Such a fee would increase the cost of the average 7 kW residential project by around $15. Commercial project price increases would range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. And utility-scale projects would take on a fee ranging from somewhere in the tens of thousands of dollars up to around $1 million for a gigawatt-scale facility.

If we were to finance that fee over the solar panel’s 25-year lifetime, we would end up paying about $0.0001/kWh on a house. More efficient utility-scale facilities would cut that number down to $0.00005.
A Google worksheet showing this equation is available here.
Surely this is a reasonable investment for an industry beaming with optimism and potential.
NREL suggested that we could have a profitable solar module recycling industry by 2032. That estimate is partially based on the learning rates that first described the price decrease of these same solar panels since the 1960s. Evidence supporting these recycling learning rate potentials has already emerged. One of NREL’s projections showed that if 94% of the silver and 97% of the silicon in c-Si PV modules were to be recovered, the profitability of solar panel recycling would be greatly enhanced.
And in August, researchers from South Korea published a technique that promised 100% recycling of the glass, silver, and silicon from end of life commercial solar panels. In fact, the silicon was remade into new solar cells.
How’s that for a circular economy?

In its latest step, the  Chicago-based company hired Wisconsin solar installer Sunvest to build a fully integrated solar array on four of its rooftops.
The combined array is expected to have a 2.4-year payback, and is expected to save the company $50,000 annually in energy costs. The system is designed to produce 737,000 kWh a year using 375W Canadian Solar modules.
The 606 kW system is equipped with four SE 100K and one SE 66.6K three-phase SolarEdge inverters, as well as 808 SolarEdge power optimizers. The optimizers offer module-level monitoring, maximize energy production, and reduce operation and maintenance costs through remote troubleshooting.

The inverters are equipped with a SafeDC feature that reduces voltage to a safe level when required, protecting installation and maintenance personnel. 
The installation is expected to offset more than half of Radio Flyer headquarters’ electricity usage.
In 2020, Sunvest installed a 2.25 MW solar array at Harley-Davidson’s Pilgrim Road Powertrain Operations facility in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. The solar array is part of We Energies Solar Now program, and at the time was the largest single rooftop solar panel system in Wisconsin.

The company said it plans to use the funds to advance its closed-loop material production technology that accepts a mixed input of scrap batteries and end-of-life batteries to produce cathode material.
Battery Resourcers also said it plans to expand commercial plants that will be operational in the U.S. and Europe by the end of 2022.

Hitachi Ventures became the newest investor in the company, joining Orbia Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover, Doral Energy, At One Ventures, TDK Ventures, and Trumpf Ventures.
Global demand for electric vehicle batteries and energy storage at the residential, commercial, and utility levels is placing increasing importance on lithium, an active component in batteries.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $200 million in funding to support EV development and the battery supply chain. The DOE’s blueprint for 2030 is the establishment of a secure battery materials and technology supply chain that supports long-term U.S. economic competitiveness.
With China currently having over 80% of global lithium refining capacity, recycling is viewed as a key to the U.S. quest for supply chain relevancy.
As with solar panels, aging and decommissioned batteries present an opportunity for a circular economy, something that Battery Resources said it aims to establish.

Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The idea here is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
Although deployment of energy storage is on a steady climb, attachment rates of batteries remain low: in 2020 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
Many options exist with multiple battery chemistries available for home energy storage. Bottom line, however, is that in the United States two brands dominate the space. More than 90% of the market is served by LG Chem and Tesla Powerwall, which are lithium-ion batteries, according to LBL. Tesla has more than 60% of the entire market share.
The Tesla PowerWall has a limited warranty that says the device will be free from defects for 10 years following installation. It also warrants that the PowerWall will start its life with a capacity of 13.5 kWh, and will retain energy capacity based on a degradation schedule.
LG warrants that its system will retain at least 60% of its nominal energy capacity (9.8 kWh) for 10 years. The battery must operate between -10 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees Celsius to remain warranted. Total throughput of energy within the warranty is limited to 27.4 MWh.
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between 5-15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20-30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.

Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimized. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.

Swedish start-up Clean Motion plans to start producing a solar-powered delivery van Re.Volt starting in the fall of 2022.
The manufacturer said the solar modules deployed on the vehicle’s roofs ensure over 100 km of additional range, with the overall range estimated at around 400 km. The maximum range from the vehicle’s batteries is estimated at between 70 and 280 km/day and the maximum range from solar energy at 130 km/day, depending on geography.
The 23% efficient n-type monocrystalline solar cell technology used was provided by Finnish producer Valoe, with which Clean Motion signed a cooperation agreement in August. Valoe’s products are interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells developed by Germany’s International Solar Energy Research Center Konstanz e.V. (ISC Konstanz), which specializes in IBC technology. The Finnish business began manufacturing its cells in Vilnius, Lithuania, in December after installing IBC production equipment bought from defunct Italian manufacturer Megacell Srl.
The vehicle has a size of 300 x 140 x 170 cm and, when unloaded, weighs in at 250 kg. When loaded, its weight can reach up to 700 kg thanks to a cargo space of 2,500 liters. Further technical details of the vehicle were not revealed.

Hochul calls for 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030,"NY-Sun, a state solar incentive program for distributed generation assets, has been targeted for expansion today by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The Governor is now pursuing a goal of supporting at least 10 GW of distributed solar installed by 2030, up from the current goal of 6 GW by 2025.
Currently, installed distributed solar projects, combined with the projects that are under development, bring the State to 95% of the current goal to install 6 GW of solar by 2025.
The expansion is expected to create 6,000 new jobs, a portion of which will be long-term operations and maintenance positions that would remain throughout the 25+ year project lifespans. The program expansion is also planned to deliver at least 35% of the benefits from the investments to disadvantaged communities and low-to moderate- income New Yorkers.
The expansion of NY-Sun is also expected to speed up the state’s progress towards its stated goal of achieving 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030, a milestone on the path to a zero-emission grid.
Gov. Hochul has also called on the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and New York State Department of Public Service to develop a distributed solar roadmap, charting the path to the expanded goal.
The Roadmap will ensure that all projects are developed and sited in a manner that fully considers land use and are advanced in close collaboration with local stakeholders and agricultural communities. Once the Roadmap is filed with the Public Service Commission, it will be issued for public comment and subsequent decision-making in early 2022.
The projects resulting from the expanded goal are expected to power nearly 1.7 million homes.
There are currently over 114,000 NY-Sun supported projects and nearly 6,000 in the NY-Sun pipeline, which are complemented by 73 New York State-supported utility-scale solar projects under development throughout the state. All combined, these projects will deliver enough electricity to power more than 2.2 million homes once completed.
Since being launched in 2011, NY-Sun has put forth more than $1.8 billion to advance the scale-up of solar and move the State closer to having a sustainable, self-sufficient solar industry. Tangibly, this funding has supported:
“Governor Hochul’s directive to expand the NY-Sun goal sends a clear signal that New York State is committed to continuing to grow its thriving solar industry, in recognition of the critical role that solar energy plays in meeting the State’s climate and clean energy goals.,” said President, CEO, and Climate Action Council Co-Chair for NYSERDA, Doreen M. Harris.
Harris went onto outline that NYSERDA expects 2021 to be New York’s largest year yet for distributed solar installations, and that NYSERDA will stand ready to develop and implement the roadmap.
