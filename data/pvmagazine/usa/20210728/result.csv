In addition, GEBs could lead to a 6% reduction of all power sector carbon dioxide emissions.
Those numbers were quoted by Natalie Mims Frick, program manager at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Berkeley Laboratory. She spoke at the Smart Electric Power Alliance’s Grid Evolution Summit.
She, along with other presenters from utilities shared their findings on the the role that GEBs can play in decarbonizing the grid and reducing energy costs. GEBs use a combination of energy efficient devices, appliance electrification, total building efficiency, and smart technology-enabled building systems to reduce energy use, especially during peak demand hours.
Lisa Reed, energy programs manager at Colorado-based Holy Cross Energy spoke about the cooperative’s market-based approaches that incentivize smart energy use in buildings. In one program, Holy Cross sends automatic emails to customers, offering a paid incentive in exchange for reduced energy use. Depending on the scale of the demand spike, the incentive pays between $0.50-$1.00 per kWh.
The cooperative also instituted a program called GreenUp, in which customers are encouraged to increase their electricity usage during peak renewable energy production. During those periods customers are encouraged to charge devices and run high energy-demand appliances and other energy-intensive operations. In turn, energy is sold at a discounted rate.
The presenters said that such incentive programs are in their early stages. Smart thermostats, peak demand controllers, smart energy storage, insulation, and other home energy efficiency upgrades were offered as vital parts of a healthy GEB offering. They said that although the financial benefit of each individual device and incentive program may be small, the overall net effect can be tangible and of mutual benefit to building owners and power providers.

Specifically, WAAREE delivered 385Wp and 390Wp Mono PERC Solar PV modules for installation, with some of the modules expected for use in other installations within Westlands Solar Park, as the delivery capacity exceeds Aquamarine’s capacity.
As for the installation, the panels will be installed on steel posts at a height of 8 to 10 feet above the ground on a fixed-tilt system. There is set to be a short turnaround between delivery and installation, as Aquamarine is expected to be fully operational by fall 2021.
The Aquamarine project is owned by CMI group, and has one power purchase agreement (PPA) in place for 50 MW of capacity with Valley Clean Energy Alliance, a locally-governed electricity provider for the California cities of Davis, Woodland, Winters and unincorporated portions of Yolo County. The project also has 75 MW in place with the city of Santa Clara, and another PPA of undisclosed capacity with Anaheim Public Utility. Additional PPAs are being pursued for the remainder of the project’s capacity.

Of the 778 MW of renewable capacity, 634 are set to be derived from solar projects, with the remaining 144 MW coming from wind projects. In total, one solar farm, three solar-plus-storage assets and one wind power project are under joint contract, while the remaining wind project is under 100% contract to SVCE, and a 70 MW solar installation with 17.5 MW of storage is under 100% contract with CCCE.
One of the joint projects is in Arizona, while the remainder are in California.
The new capacity comes as a result of the Request for Offers jointly issued by the two agencies in 2019 and 2020, and the signings mark now 12 total power contracts that the agencies have come to terms to together, totaling 1,470 MW at a cost of $2.77 billion.
The vast majority of the projects included in this procurement are in various stages of construction and development, with just the 66 MW AES Mountain View wind project having already achieved commercial operation.
Moving forward, both agencies are part of a larger group looking to procure 500 MW of long-duration storage, along with seven other CCAs through California Community Power.

The tracker utilizes what the company calls zero-backlash technology, and can rotate the large structure around the azimuth axis with accuracy.
The structure has performed in extreme weather conditions and high winds, from coastal Halifax, Canada winters to desert locales. Often in harsh environments, geared trackers experience cracks and failure, but Mechatron’s gearless design has proven resilient in among the harshest environs.
(Read: “Dual-axis tracker supports power production in cold climates”)
Following a 30-month review, the M18KD tracker has earned a patent, and is among the largest tracker platforms available, with a 90-panel, 144-cell per-panel mounting table. The single-mast platform offers what the company said is the highest energy density and yield compared with solutions using the same number and type of panels.

The company claims a 99.87% uptime of the 90 MW total installed capacity of their dual-axis trackers, dating back to the first installation in 2008 and spanning North America and Europe.
The company also builds a M16KD model, designed for agrivoltaic applications. The mount features extra spacing between vertical panel stacks to permit light to pass through to crops beneath the structure.
Hydraulic components perform the North-South axis actuation and are now refined for sub-zero operations. The zenith axis can move from flat to 70 degrees, allowing for snow and soiling shedding.
The azimuthal axis performs a caterpillar-like “Catch-Move-Release-Return” movement, which Mechatron said increases stability and safety. The central braking system makes the system highly durable and virtually unbreakable, said Mechatron.

About a decade ago, Professor Thomas Nann realized the key to achieving a zero carbon economy was not renewably generating electricity, which was already well on its way to undercutting fossil fuels, but rather energy storage – figuring out how to make these clean electrons dispatchable, able to be summoned on demand.
Professor Nann is today the Head of the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Newcastle but became a chemist in his homeland, Germany.
In April, he launched startup Allegro Energy with two of his former students, Fraser Hughson and Rohan Borah. The startup seeks to commercialize its microemulsion battery electrolyte which, although mostly water by mass, has overcome the voltage limitations that typically hinder water-based solutions.
Electrolyte sits between batteries’ anodes and cathodes, allowing ions to pass between the two conductors. In batteries, electrolytes are usually either water-based or use an organic solvent. Both these forms present their own issues. Organic solvent-based solutions, for instance, tend to have good electrochemical stability but are expensive and potentially toxic. With water-based or aqueous electrolytes, the issue is the solution only remains stable up to 1.23 volts, at which point the water splits into its separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
So when Professor Nann began training his attention on battery storage, he came up against precisely these issues which have puzzled researchers for decades. “At some point, I just thought ‘why not do both?’” Professor Nann told pv magazine Australia. That is, why not make an electrolyte with both water and solvent components in the form of a microemulsion. “We were completely blown away at how well it worked.”
Of course, microemulsions aren’t quite as simple as adding dishwashing liquid and oil to water – rather, it’s the combination of water molecules with hydrophobic liquid, coupled with a surfactant which allows the two normally repellent solvents to bond. Basically the combination happens on such a ‘micro’ level it is not able to be split. “It’s thermodynamically stable,” Professor Nann said. “That makes them special and that’s why we can use them in a battery.”
When I asked why the concept had never been applied to battery storage, Professor Nann laughed – “that’s a really good question!”
“Actually when we submitted the patent in the first place, the patent officers came back to us and said ‘well, that’s too trivial’ and we made exactly that argument – why did no one else do that then?” he aid. “I think just no one has thought of that.”
The nub of Professor Nann and his co-founders’ discovery is that if you use a microemulsion as a battery electrolyte, you can overcome water’s pesky 1.2 volt barrier. “That’s kind of the secret sauce,” Professor Nann said.
“It’s very unusual – normally when you do research, you fail 99% of the time but that worked straight away,” he added. “It opened up a whole new world of research.”

Only natural gas (1,617 billion kWh) produced more electricity than renewables in the United States in 2020, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). Renewables surpassed both nuclear (790 billion kWh) and coal (774 billion kWh) for the first time. EIA said this outcome was due mostly to “significantly less coal use” in U.S. electricity generation and steadily increased use of solar and wind.
U.S. electricity generation from coal in all sectors declined 20% from 2019, while renewables, including small-scale solar, increased 9%. Wind, currently the most prevalent source of renewable electricity in the United States, grew 14% in 2020 from 2019. Utility-scale solar generation (from projects greater than 1 MW) increased 26%, and small-scale solar, such as grid-connected rooftop solar panels, increased 19%.
Favorable economics will likely result in coal retaking its second-place spot in 2021, EIA said. Renewables are again forecast to eclipse coal in 2022 as capacity grows and coal’s cost advantage eases.

The Energy Sector Innovation Credit (ESIC) Act would incentivize clean energy innovation to scale up and compete. The credit is designed to scale down as technologies’ market penetration grows, a device intended so that taxpayer dollars do not subsidize market-mature technologies.
The bill was introduced by Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mike Crapo (R-ID), and is co-sponsored by John Barrasso (R-WY), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jim Risch (R-ID), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO). House Ways and Means Members Tom Reed (R-NY) and Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) introduced identical legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The bill’s sponsors said the credit is designed to offer a flexible investment tax credit (ITC) or production tax credit (PTC.) It would target technologies in electric power generation, storage, and carbon capture. Fossil fuel and nuclear technologies are covered as is the production of “clean” hydrogen.
Among its provisions:
The bill is supported by groups that include the Evangelical Environmental Network, the U.S. Nuclear Industry Council, the Nuclear Energy Institute, The Nature Conservancy, Clean Air Task Force, American Public Power Association, Long Duration Energy Storage of California, Environmental Defense Fund, Carbon Utilization Research Council, Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition, American Petroleum Institute, and National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association.
