The company is expected to deliver modules to market by the fourth quarter of this year.
The company said it would manufacture high-efficiency products for the residential, commercial, and utility-scale markets. JA Solar’s leading efficiency line, Deep Blue 4.0, is said to be currently available for sale. It was launched as a 22.4% efficiency TOPCon product for the three markets.
Currently, the company’s website lists only Deep Blue 3.0 monoPERC solar modules.
The press release noted that the assembly line would be highly automated, and that the facility would employ 600 workers.

The EcoProgetti Solar Module Manufacturing Line Catalogue lists modules assembly lines ranging from 20 to 500 MW a year of capacity. The 500 MW package above is the largest standard production line the company offers, and is composed of at least twenty unique machines. EcoProgetti notes that it’ll require three shifts running, 24 days a week and 330 days a year to reach the 500 MW a year number.
Per the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Fall 2022 Solar Industry Update, (which was released October 27, 2022 and is now woefully out of date), approximately 42 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity had been announced.

NREL’s report notes that of the announced 42 GW, 32.5 GW is slated for the production of standard silicon products like JA Solar, and 9.5 GW is destined for thin film products styled like First Solar. Other steps of the solar panel manufacturing lines announced between ten to fifteen gigawatts of subcomponent manufacturing for polysilicon, wafers, and cells.
JA Solar’s announcements only refer to the assembly of panels, not the preceding subcomponents.
In the last two months, JA Solar has announced three deals valued $4.2 billion in total. The announcements were distributed throughout each of the supply chain stages – ingots, wafer, cells, and modules – totaling over 75 GW of production capacity.
The company is in the midst of a move from 40 GW of module manufacturing capacity at the end of 2021, to 75 GW by the end of this year. They continue to expect cell and wafer manufacturing capacity to make up 80% of their module manufacturing capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/11/50-states-of-solar-incentives-texas/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 11, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Texas,"No state has more solar capacity on the way than Texas in the coming years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects as much as 36 GW of solar capacity will be added in the next five years, adding on to the 16 GW installed thus far and leapfrogging the Lone Star State over California in terms of installed capacity.
To date, Texas has enough solar capacity to power the equivalent of nearly 2 million homes. Over 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that over $19 billion has been invested in the technology there through Q3 2022. Nearly 5% of Texas electricity is generated by PV.
(Read: “Texas has enough solar and wind planned to permanently shut down coal”)
Most of this capacity is being built at the utility-scale, with a large band of projects occupying the drier, sunnier western half of the state. While this region benefits from cheaper land and more solar irradiance, it comes with some challenges. Delivering electricity generated in the west to the high-population centers in the east requires substantial transmission capacity. Currently, Texas is dealing with growing problems of large projects “leapfrogging” interconnection queues, leading to grid congestion, reliability issues, renewables curtailment, and high costs from “congestion rent.”
Distributed rooftop solar on homes and businesses can help address these grid-scale problems, especially when paired with battery energy storage.
Incentives
Texas is a deregulated electricity market, which leads to a wide set of offerings depending on the utility service and retail energy provider selected. Though the state does not have a mandated net metering rule, many utilities offer net metering.
Net metering involves a utility crediting a customer’s bill for sending excess solar generation back to the grid. Utilities CPS Energy, El Paso Electric, and many others offer net metering. Prospective solar owners can understand the options available to them by using SolarReviews Solar Calculator, which creates production and savings estimates based on the assumptions of the local utility rates and programs.
Rebate programs also vary widely by utility. For example, CPS Energy customers are offered $2,500 for installing solar, with a $500 adder if the panels are locally sourced. Austin Energy provides a $2,500 rebate and has a sizeable tariff that pays $0.097 per kWh generated by the system.
Like many states in the union, Texas also offers a property tax exemption for solar panels. Zillow estimates that an owned solar array can boost a home’s value by an average of 4%, but tax assessments will not include this home improvement as an additional tax cost.
Many Texans live in areas controlled by homeowner’s associations (HOA). While HOA’s sometimes try to stand in the way of making changes like adding a solar array, Texas law grants home and business owners access rights. In general, HOAs may not prohibit or restrict property owners from installing a solar energy device, though there are some exceptions.
As with every U.S. state and territory, solar customers in Texas are offered the federal investment tax credit that covers 30% of the installed system costs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended the 30% credit through 2032, offering long-term stability for the solar industry.
Landmark project
A 15 MW solar portfolio powers 16 Dallas-based Class B and Class C multifamily housing developments that house over 3,600 units. Property manager Granite Redevelopment Properties worked closely with Dallas’ own The Solar Company to develop the plan.
Chet Dyson, head of operations, shared with pv magazine that solar modules installed by The Solar Company range from 400 W to 450 W and are a mix of about two-thirds Canadian Solar panels and one-third Znshine. The inverters used were Solis single-phase inverters, with multiple inverters around 10 kW in size stacked to meet the need of the distributed system.

“When we ran the numbers for overall project returns, we were sold and wanted to go all in. Not only is it a responsible decision from an environmental standpoint, it also makes tremendous financial sense and adds millions of dollars to the overall value of our portfolio,” said Tim Gillean, president of Granite Redevelopment Properties.
The project is particularly beneficial to the “all bills paid” model that Class B and C multifamily housing units offer. The project cuts costs and provides price predictability for the landlord, while providing clean, local, and reliable power to the residents.
The 15 MW portfolio is distributed throughout numerous units and will also comprise solar carports that cover 2,000 parking spaces, providing the dual benefit of cooling the vehicles below while producing clean energy. The 40,000-panel system was completed in July 2022.
“Granite is setting a trend for owners of Class B and C apartments – and potentially the entire multifamily industry. By removing one of the biggest expenses for many landlords with rooftop solar panels and solar carports, the math is hard to argue with,” said Wildeman.
Wildeman said he sees bright days ahead for the Texas solar industry. He comes from a background of over 20 years in commercial real estate underwriting and has noticed a trend among his connections from his past career. “People are excited to talk about solar here in Texas,” he said.

The project is developed by Southern Current, an energyRe company. The 572-acre facility is expected to reach commercial operations and begin delivering clean energy at the grid-scale in 2024. Named Lone Star solar, the project stands alone as the largest battery under development in Dominion Energy South Carolina service territory.
Next steps for the project include acceptance from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and other related regulatory approvals. Once complete, the project will represent an estimated $200 million invested toward powering the equivalent of about 17,000 homes and businesses.
Lone Star Solar is expected to generate $10 million in local property taxes and create 185 temporary construction jobs. In total, the project is expected to avoid more than 140,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.
“This agreement will stimulate significant local investment, job creation and emissions reductions across the region. Building on Southern Current’s industry leadership, we are harnessing our expertise and experience to advance renewable energy in the Southeastern United States and beyond,” said Miguel Prado, chief executive officer, energyRe.
Southern Current was acquired by energyRe in Q3 2022, bringing along a portfolio of more than 9 GW of projects in development.
energyRe is advancing several high-profile renewable energy projects across the United States, including Clean Path, NY, which is an $11 billion public-private partnership to develop 3,800 MW of new wind and solar power in New York. The project also includes a 175-mile, underground 1,300 MW HVDC transmission line in the state.
Upon operation in 2027, Clean Path NY is planned to deliver 8 million MWh of electricity annually and reduce fossil fuel-fired electric generation in New York by 22% per year on average.
Distributed joint venture
In a joint venture with Starwood Energy, energyRe also launched Radial Power, a distributed solar developer serving large real estate, commercial and industrial customers.
In partnership with Related Companies, a large-scale real estate investor, the joint venture seeks to build cost-saving distributed solar assets. Starwood and Related Companies together have over 102,000 residences in their portfolios.
Radial Power’s stated goals include leveraging its codified set of proprietary tools and processes to design and deliver a fully financed deployment plan for portfolios with 1,000+ assets of various classes within 45 days from initial contact.
“The increasing cost competitiveness of clean energy technologies, maturing regulatory frameworks, and local, state, and federal incentives serve as tailwinds for adoptions of clean energy solutions,” said John Bates, CEO of Radial Power. “Radial Power seeks to access this enormous market opportunity and to deliver significant economic and environmental value to stakeholders across the board.”
South Carolina solar
South Carolina’s solar industry was essentially born six years ago in 2016, when a boom in both residential and utility-scale solar occurred in the state. Before this, there was an infinitesimal cumulative capacity of solar. In 2020, the state experienced peak deployment, with nearly 600 MW of capacity installed, the vast majority of which was utility-scale.
South Carolina ranks among the top three sunniest states east of the Mississippi River along with Florida and Georgia. However, it lags cloudier states like New York and Massachusetts in terms of solar deployment. Thus far, just over 2 GW of solar has been installed in the state.
In total, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that $2.6 billion has been invested in solar in South Carolina to date. There are 73 solar companies, including 18 manufacturers in the state. SEIA projects an additional 1.4 GW will be installed over the next five years, which would mark a deceleration in deployment compared to the previous five. This projection may not include the increased buildout that is expected following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a record $370 billion in climate and energy spending.

The fire test result under UL 9540A ensures that additional lithium-ion batteries supplied by the company can be used in EV charging infrastructure and energy storage applications.
Historically, lithium-ion batteries have been prone to malfunctions, causing the sides of the battery assembly to heat up, creating a safety hazard that required spacing between enclosures.
The Mark 1 battery is paired with project partner Veloce Energy’s VPort battery energy storage system (BESS). The UL test shows that the integrated system eliminated the need for side clearance in the battery assembly.
“This result gives us the smallest footprint in the industry because the VPort does not require any dedicated clear areas to either side, and only requires 8 inches to the back,” said Jeff Wolfe, chief executive officer of Veloce. “This allows us to fit our BESS on an EV charging island, in the margin along the side of a building, or at the fence line of existing solar arrays.”
“Our goal is to produce the safest lithium-ion cells and modules in the industry,” said Lindsay Gorrill, chief executive officer of KORE Power. “This test result should give Veloce’s customers confidence in the safety of the VPort system, powered by Kore Mark 1 modules.”

VPort EV Charging System
The VPort system is available in 78 kWh to 468 kWh configurations and can be connected in parallel to deliver MWh storage capacity.  The system delivers three-phased charging in 40, 80 and 120 kW charging increments.
The charging tower’s base footprint measures 3.5 feet by 7.5 feet and requires 3.2 feet of front clearance. The charger is rated at temperatures of -40 degrees F to 113 degrees F.
The charger is pre-installed with Veloce’s Argos software, which combines grid edge AI and machine learning for system design, operations and electrical infrastructure, as well as FastConnect, an architectural installation method which allows for modular expansion from 78 kWh to 468 kWh without additional digging and trenching required.
The VPort is available in the North American market and is currently shipping.

There is no question the Inflation Reduction Act has been financially attractive for solar manufacturers, opening a door to opportunity that has never existed before.
For manufacturers, the bill contains tax incentives for domestic fabrication, including an increase in the investment tax credit available, from 30% to 40% for projects using domestic content, as well as production tax credits linked to specific products. But the real benefit is the timeframe, which extends the bill’s credits and incentives for 10 years, making manufacturing investment tenable for the first time.
Big draw
The U.S. market has always been one of the biggest that has attracted solar module suppliers. As a global manufacturer of solar modules and mounting structures, Philadelphia Solar has had its sights set on this market for years. We see the future being not just in supplying modules but in investing in the U.S. to set up domestic manufacturing capacity. We took serious steps towards this in 2020 by putting a bid on a building in Texas to set up U.S. manufacturing operations. However, we pulled back because of changes in regulation – namely the cancellation of Section 201 trade tariffs on imported bifacial solar modules. The exclusion of bifacial products from a trade tariff imposed because of the volume of imports, meant that, if we were to invest in production capacity for U.S.-made bifacial modules, we would have faced extreme pricing headwinds from imported bifacial products. In the absence of any other incentives, our return on investment would have been untenable.
As a multinational tier-1 solar module manufacturer, it would have made more sense for us to export our monocrystalline PERC (passivated emitter, rear contact) modules to the US market, rather than manufacturing them in-country. Of course, that would also have meant that the supply of bifacial panels to the U.S. market would have continued to be subject to supply-chain pressures which, even while remaining unknown, still presented a lower risk to us than the investment required to set up US manufacturing in the pre-IRA trading environment.
Policy certainty
To be clear, the only way to bring stability to the U.S. solar market is to open doors for high-quality, U.S. -made solar modules, particularly monocrystalline bifacial modules, which are widely seen as essential for utility scale solar development. The lessons of the past few years have taught the world that energy independence must be based on viable local sources. Currently, the U.S. solar market is dominated by outside manufacturers, including those accused of price dumping. While efforts have been made to curtail unfair trade practices, U.S. trade regulations are imposed for two years before they are reviewed. A judge can stop these at any time, making the long-term investment necessary to set up viable manufacturing facilities too risky. Investment in U.S. manufacturing, by companies like ours, is critical to bringing true energy independence to the U.S. and it requires a much longer investment period than the usual regulatory cycles allow.
The IRA dramatically changed all this. The 10-year timeline for the bill’s provisions has brought us clarity over an extended period for the first time. Now we can move forward with confidence in implementing a two-pronged strategy that aligns perfectly with the U.S. market and its solar ambitions.
Through a joint-venture with U.S.-based Translucent Energy, we can immediately offer competitively-priced, high-quality bifacial and black modules made in our Middle East facility, to meet the current market demands for these panels. At the same time, by moving forward on our plans to set up domestic manufacturing under the Philadelphia Solar USA brand name, we are on track to supply U.S.-made monocrystalline PERC units by 2024 at a better price point. We also are actively transitioning all our manufacturing facilities to heterojunction (HJT) solar manufacturing, so we will be able to bring higher-efficiency domestic modules at increasingly lower price points by 2025.
In the long run, we are hoping for more than just the IRA. Of the 11 raw materials we need to build a panel in the U.S., seven need to be imported and all of these are currently subject to tariffs.
The IRA’s tax credits and other incentives are attractive enough to offset such trade measures but it’s critical to understand that almost half of the cash we will receive back through the IRA will go to pay customs duties on raw materials. With the remaining 50% of tax-related cashback, we will still be profitable producing a U.S.-made panel that can compete with bifacial imports that continue to be excluded from Section 201 tariffs. The margins are slim, however.
As domestic U.S. production accelerates, there is a reasonable expectation that the bifacial exception from 201 tariffs will not be extended past its current term. Reimposing such duties would bring greater profitability to U.S.-based manufacturers in the near future. This is essential. While we are excited to be playing an active role in bringing a clean and independent energy future to the U.S. we, like all the manufacturers involved, must also be profitable if that future is to be sustainable.

The 200 MWh battery component to the system remains unchanged.
The Sunnynook solar expansion was scaled up to help the Alberta government achieve its decarbonization goals.  The expansion enables the project to deliver clean energy to 62,000 households, rather than 44,000 households as initially planned.
Sunnynook is currently in Stage 3 of the Alberta Electric System Operator’s (AESO) interconnection process and will submit an application for construction and operation of the facility by the end of Q1 23 to the Alberta Utility Commission.
Recently the project recently received a referral letter from Alberta Environment and Parks in support of the planned construction.
“The Sunnynook expansion adds significant potential value to this asset as we prepare our application for AUC approval,” said Francesco Paolo Cardi, vice president of development at Westbridge.  “Westbridge is committed to originating and acquiring high-quality renewable projects that will meet the demand for utility-scale renewable energy in Alberta.”
With the expansion, Westbridge’s project development pipeline now stands at 1.38 GW of solar generation assets plus 553 MW / 1.1 GW of energy storage systems.
The Georgetown, Sunnynook, Dolcy and Eastervale projects comprise Westbridge’s Canadian portfolio, located in southern and central Alberta, with a total solar capacity of 1.15 GW and 500 MW / 1 GWh of storage. The company expects the four Canadian projects to be shovel-ready by late 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Accalia Point solar is the company’s lone American project with 221 MW of generating capacity in Cameron County, Texas. Westbridge acquired Accalia, located near South Padre Island  and the U.S.-Mexico border, from Aelius Solar in October 2021.
In the U.K., Westbridge has developed a standalone battery storage system with 53 MW / 106 MWh output.

In November, the company received approval from the AUC for construction of the Georgetown Solar and Energy Storage Project in Vulcan County, Alberta. The commission also granted the company a substation permit and license to operate the 1015S substation, which is interconnected to the solar plus storage facility near Mossleigh, Alberta.
On September 30, Westbridge officially rebranded from Westbridge Energy Corporation to Westbridge Renewable Energy in order to better align its strategy with the energy transition. The company currently trades for a $38 million market capitalization.
According to Green Alberta Energy, 10,739 solar projects have been installed to date in the province with an aggregate generation capacity of 2.18 GW.  The province ranks third in Canada for solar development, of which the largest regions include Fortis’ Southern Alberta territory (37%), Enmax’s Calgary metropolitan region (25%), and Edmonton, Alberta (22%), where EPCOR is the grid operator.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/11/qcells-announces-2-5-billion-investment-in-u-s-solar-supply-chain/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,GEORGIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 11, 2023",Qcells announces $2.5 billion investment in U.S. solar supply chain,"In what is being called the largest investment in U.S. solar history, Qcells announced that it will invest more than $2.5  billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States. This makes the Korean company, a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions, the first company to establish a fully-integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the U.S.
“Today’s Hanwha Q CELLS announcement to make the largest solar investment in U.S. history is a big deal for Georgia’s working families and the American economy. And, this investment is a direct result of my economic plan and the Inflation Reduction Act,” said President Biden.
Qcells intends to break break ground on the new, state-of-the-art facility in Bartow County, Georgia, where it will manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells and finished modules. The company also has a facility in Dalton, Georgia, where it will assemble an additional 2 GW of modules. With plans to boost the Dalton production by another 5.1 GW, Qcells anticipates that its total production in Georgia will be 8.4 GW in 2024.
The announcement was made by Qcells’ parent company, Hanwha Solutions, a public company headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.
“As demand for clean energy continues to grow nationally, we’re ready to put thousands of people to work creating fully American Made and sustainable solar solutions, from raw material to finished panels,” said Justin Lee, chief executive officer of Qcells. “We are committed to working with our customers as well as national and Georgia state leaders to bring completely clean energy to millions of people across the country.”
Qcells is no stranger to Georgia, having opened its first factory there in 2019. At the time it hired 750 people to manufacture 1.7 GW of solar.  In 2022, it announced a plan to add 1.4 GW to its manufacturing output and hire 535 more people. Today’s announcement means Qcells will hire an additional 510 people in Dalton, bringing Qcells’ total employment in Georgia to 4,000 and accumulated investment in the state to $2.8 billion.
Hanwha’s Q CELLS investment will create thousands of good-paying jobs in Georgia, many of which won’t require a four-year degree. It will bring back our supply chains so we aren’t reliant on other countries, lower the cost of clean energy, and help us combat the climate crisis. And, it will ensure that we manufacture cutting-edge, solar technology here at home. It’s a win for workers, consumers, and our climate, said President Biden.
Qcells cites Senator Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, now part of the Inflation Reduction Act, as playing a key role in promoting additional investments in the U.S. The IRA offers numerous tax credits for clean energy manufacturing.
“We are proud to announce our new solar module manufacturing plant will be in Dalton, Georgia. Nobody has been a bigger champion for Qcells and domestic solar manufacturing than Senator Ossoff,” said Lee.
As of Q3 22, Qcells had been a top player in the U.S. solar market for the past five years, according to the Q4 22 U.S. PV Leaderboard report from Wood Mackenzie. Additionally it has been the leading module provider for the U.S. commercial sector since 2019. Today’s announcement, however, is about much more than modules. Qcells plans to thwart the solar supply chain challenges that are currently stalling development by producing ingots, wafers and cells—as well as modules.
Qcells is already involved in the production of silicon. In March 2022, parent company Hanwha Solutions became the largest shareholder in REC Silicon, a silicon producer located in Moses Lake, Washington. That facility is expected to start production in the second half of 2023.
Back in March 2022, Lee hinted at the company’s intention to manufacture across the solar supply chain.
“Our commitment to the U.S. is more serious than ever before,” Lee said. “We plan to make investments to secure capabilities across the entire solar supply chain, with the goal of supplying our partners with ‘Made in America’ products that will help the U.S. regain its leadership in clean energy solutions.”

PGE is rolling out Expeto’s NeXtworking solution as its commercial private wireless network deployment, part of its plan to  accelerate grid modernization and renewable energy outcomes.
PGE expects the Expeto-enabled private wireless network to support automated grid resiliency, monitoring of field conditions with smart sensors and devices, and connected workers for enhanced employee safety. It will also support charging stations for electric vehicles on the public grid.
The Oregon utility is part of a coalition that supports Oregon’s decarbonization law (HB 2021), which sets decarbonization goals for the electric sector of reducing GHG emissions to 80% below baseline levels by 2030, 90% by 2035 and 100% by 2040.
PGE has been ahead of the carbon-reduction curve, announcing back in 2017 a 39 MW energy storage plan that included a planned investment of somewhere between $50 million and $100 million. This investment exceeded the state-mandated energy storage requirement by more than seven times. In 2015, the Oregon legislature passed House Bill 2193, which required all investor-owned utilities like PGE to add at least 5 MW of energy storage, not to exceed 1% of its 2014 peak loads.
Last year PGE and NextEra Energy Resources completed the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility a first-of-its-kind renewable energy project that consists of a 300 MW wind farm, a 50 MW solar facility, and a 30 MW (4 hour discharge) battery storage system. The project was one of the first in the United States to combine wind generation, a solar array, and an onsite battery energy storage system (BESS). The wind farm began operations in 2020.
The Expeto solution for wireless networking is intended to provide the scalability needed to support the large number of grid nodes including distributed energy and EV chargers, among other devices, to help reduce carbon, while increasing resilience and meeting safety goals. The plan is for the network to eventually cover 4,000 square miles and connect 250,000 devices using existing cellular networks at one-tenth the cost of traditional solutions.
PGE selected Expeto based on one year of successful testing during which PGE found that Expeto delivered a powerful, secure, virtual private network based on connectivity from tier-one mobile operators.
“We had a choice between dedicating a large capital outlay on a new network that would take many years to build or immediately growing our business through renewables and grid applications as part of a more cost-effective option,” said Ananth Sundaram, senior manager Grid Asset Engineering at PGE. “Expeto put sophisticated use cases within reach, like having a private network experience over public connectivity anywhere we need it. The company’s enterprise first approach has resulted in a strategy that gives us confidence our network connectivity is reliable and secure, freeing us to focus on accelerating the transition to a clean, reliable and equitable energy future.”
