As a NABCEP Registered Training Provider, the company will offer educational resources to help solar professionals work safely, efficiently, and accurately in support of the growing industry. 
“Over the past decade, U.S. solar employment has more than doubled from 105k jobs in 2011 to 255k jobs in 2021,” said Will White, NABCEP solar application specialist and educator, Fluke. “However, the need to train and equip this new workforce with the right knowledge and tools could quickly become a bottleneck constraining the industry’s growth.” 
Solar now represents 59% of the clean power capacity in development, gaining 4% in share from 2021 to 2022, said the American Clean Power Association. In order to reach the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) target of solar making up 30% of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030, SEIA estimates that the solar and storage industries will need an estimated 800,000 new workers for a total workforce of more than 1 million workers.   
Fluke recently launched its new NABCEP-registered training course, Tools and Techniques for Commissioning and Maintaining PV Systems to support solar workforce development nationwide.
Fluke will also be offering its new training course online. The next scheduled course will take place on Wednesday, April 26, 2023. The course will review the different steps in the process of building and maintaining a solar array and the appropriate test tools used at each step, including digital multimeters, clamp meters, thermal imaging cameras, insulation resistance testers, I-V curve tracers, irradiance meters, power quality meters, and solar asset management software.
A well-trained workforce will be essential to ensure the energy transition will be built effectively and efficiently. What’s more, for projects to receive the full 30% base Investment Tax Credit, rather than just 6%, Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a requirement that 12.5% of a project’s labor hours must be from qualified apprentices participating in an apprenticeship program. Qualified programs must be registered with the Department of Labor (DOL) or a state equivalent.
SEIA training
SEIA has also announced the launch of a workforce development program, called the SEIA Online Learning Center. Among other resources, the center will include a Solar 101 online training program.
Solar 101 is designed for newcomers to solar as well as those with extensive experience looking to expand their skills. The program includes 30 short modules in 5- to 10-minute video format that contain valuable expert insight into a variety of areas including topics such as solar technology, market segmentation, transmission, project development, permitting, and more.
“We have a responsibility as an industry leader to provide resources that welcome a diverse group of people into the solar and storage family,” said SEIA vice president of equity and workforce development Erika Symmonds. “This new platform builds a bridge into one of America’s fastest-growing industries, and SEIA is committed to making sure that training and other wealth-building opportunities are accessible to communities of all backgrounds.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/12/regional-clean-hydrogen-hub-applications-seeking-7-billion-in-funds-submitted-across-the-u-s/,"HYDROGEN,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 12, 2023",Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub applications seeking $7 billion in funds submitted across the U.S.,"The Department of Energy’s (DOE) “Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub” application window closed on April 7, 2023. The program seeks to deploy $7 billion to stimulate the six to ten regional hydrogen hubs. In November, the DOE announced that 79 projects had been submitted to the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which oversees the program. The projects sought $60 billion in funding, and represented $200 billion in total investment.
DOE encouraged 33 of the projects to submit their proposals by the recently passed deadline. Several organizations have released maps showcasing the locations of known hydrogen projects.

Among the applicants was the Northeast Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, an organization that includes New York, New Jersey, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, and Massachusetts. The organization requested $1.25 billion in funding (the maximum allowed for a single grant) for a series of projects totaling $3.6 billion in investment and involving more than 100 partner organizations.
Limited details are available on the applicants and their proposed projects, as the DOE keeps applicant data confidential. The Northeast Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub’s press release said funding would go toward clean electrolytic hydrogen production for use in transportation, high-temperature industrial thermal applications, and communal utilities for heat, all representing hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/12/california-senate-transport-committee-passes-solar-parking-canopy-and-highwayside-law/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 12, 2023",California senate transport committee passes solar parking canopy and highwayside law,"Senate Bill 49, introduced by Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo), aims to support the buildout of solar above parking lots and along highways throughout California. It was unanimously passed by the California Senate Transportation Committee by a bipartisan 11:0 vote. 
The bill will next head to the Senate Governance and Finance Committee. If approved, the legislation will then be reviewed by the state senate’s Appropriations Committee. 
California targets a 100% clean energy goal by 2045. State planners estimate that California will need 110 GW of new solar to get there. SB 49 is expected to make it easier for the state to develop state capacity, energy storage, and transmission while reducing the need to disturb undeveloped land. 
The bill includes two main provisions. First, it provides a sales tax exemption for the materials to build solar canopies over parking lots. Second, it requires the state to develop a plan to make its highway rights-of-way available for solar, energy storage and transmission infrastructure. By leasing state-controlled land along highways for solar power, California can earn revenue from lease payments and save money through avoided maintenance costs of leased areas. 
“We are going to need a lot more solar, that means a lot more land. So how can we do this by preserving sensitive ecosystems protecting our productive agricultural lands from excessive encroachment? These two strategies in this bill are good ways to build more solar without displacing other uses,” said Senator Becker. 
The bill is sponsored by a coalition of 64 organizations, including Environment California, Environmental Working Group, and CALPIRG, among others. 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reports that pavement makes up 35% to 50% of total surface area in cities, and 40% of that pavement is parking lots. Placing a solar canopy over an existing parking lot is a more efficient use of space than acquiring land for a ground mount system. 
Los Angeles County alone has 101 square miles of parking lots, and about 25% of the state’s population. A press release by Senator Becker extrapolates these numbers by population, inferring that there should be approximately 400 square miles of parking lots in the state, equivalent to 26 GW of solar canopies. 
Analysis from Yale University found that more than one-third of the state’s electricity could come from solar-covered parking lots. The authors found that the final 8,416 sites across the state could generate 9,042 GWh of electricity within their first year of operation. The total capacity of these sites was 7,021 MW of solar power. Priced at $3.00 per watt to install, the solar canopies would generate approximately $21 billion in construction activity. 
In addition to covering parking lots, the legislation would make tax incentives available for building highway-side solar. California has over 52,000 lane miles in its state highway system and over 23,000 lane miles of federal interstate highways, freeways, and expressways, reports Caltrans. 
“California’s ample supply of parking lots and highways can contribute substantially [to supporting a transition to clean energy]” said Steven King, clean energy advocate, Environment California. “By moving this bill forward, the state Senate can make sure California keeps its nation-leading solar capacity growing. We thank Chair Lena Gonzalez, the Senate Transportation Committee, and Sen. Josh Becker for passing SB 49 out of committee today.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/12/masdar-uae-developer-acquires-50-of-u-s-solar-project-from-edf-renewables/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 12, 2023",Masdar UAE developer acquires 50% of U.S. solar project from EDF Renewables,"Masdar, a clean energy company based in Abu Dabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) is expanding its presence in the United States’ renewables market after closing the acquisition of a 50% stake in a combined solar and battery storage project from EDF Renewables North America. The acquisition was a long time in process, as first close was announced more than two years ago.
The Big Beau project, located in Kern County, California, achieved commercial operation in 2021. The facility comprises a 128 MWac solar plant and a 40 MW/160 MWh battery energy storage system. At full capacity the plant generates enough electricity to meet the consumption needs of up to 64,000 average California homes, or the equivalent to avoiding the greenhouse gas emissions from 67,000 passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year.
EDF Renewables signed two 20-year power purchase agreements (PPA) with Silicon Valley Clean Energy purchasing 55% of the output, and Monterey Bay Community Power purchasing 45%.
Big Beau and the other projects that we are operating with EDF Renewables are already making an active contribution to U.S. clean energy targets, highlighting the strength of the UAE-U.S. relationship that the recent PACE announcement seeks to build on,” “If we are to keep the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees alive, we need to see countries coming together in concerted action – one of the key areas of focus for the upcoming COP28 in the UAE. Partnerships between companies like Masdar and EDF Renewables are also vital in ensuring we hold back emissions, not progress, said HE Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE minister of industry and advanced technology, COP28 president-designate and chairman of Masdar.
In November 2022, the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) was announced. In partnership,  UAE and the U.S. would allocate $20 billion to fund 15 GW of clean energy projects in the United States before 2035, led by Masdar and a consortium of U.S. private investors. The intention is to focus on the scalable development of low-emission energy sources, with the goal of deploying 100 GW of clean energy globally by 2035. In a statement, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the two countries “will also invest in the management of harmful emissions like carbon and methane, the development of advanced nuclear technology, and the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors”.
Masdar and EDF Renewables North America agreed in 2020 to jointly partner on the 1.6 GW portfolio, which includes three utility-scale wind projects in Nebraska and Texas totalling 815 MW, and five solar projects in California totalling 689 MW,  two of which include battery energy storage systems representing 75 MW. All of the projects are operational, and combined they are displacing more than 3 million tons of emissions per year.
Masdar is active in more than 40 countries and invested in projects with a combined capacity of more than 20 GW, and is targeting a combined portfolio capacity of at least 100 GW by 2030, with expectations of doubling that in coming years. The company recently announced a new shareholding structure and additional focus on green hydrogen, and has set a goal of producing 1 million tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030.
EDF Renewables’ North American portfolio consists of 16 GW of developed projects and 13 GW under service contracts. EDF Renewables North America is a subsidiary of EDF Renewables, the  renewable energy affiliate of the EDF Group.
