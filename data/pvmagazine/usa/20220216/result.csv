One way they have reduced costs is to reduce dealer fees for loans that have a dealer fee, according to Patrick Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer of Mosaic. The amount of the reduction varies widely based on the rate and term of the loan selected. “The company has also reduced interest rates on loans that do not have a dealer fee by about 50 basis points. We have also lowered our minimum FICO requirement and increased maximum loan amounts,” Moore told pv magazine.
As the US deals with rising costs and interest rates, we asked how Mosaic can lower its pricing at this time. Moore explained that while prevailing interest rates do impact the cost of borrowing, “but not all loans move in lockstep with changes in the prevailing rates”. Loan products such as mortgages do tend to track closely with overall interest rates, but supply and demand matter, too. “Solar lending is a newer, still-maturing loan type with increasing investor appetite,” Moore said. As Mosaic realizes lower cost of funds, the company passes that benefit through to its installer partners through better pricing, and they are able to “pass that through to homeowners”, he said.
Mosaic offers financing for solar, solar-plus-storage systems, and other sustainable home improvements, often providing homeowners with a credit decision in minutes for no money down loans with fixed interest rates and multiple term options. The company reports that since 2012 it has provided loans for more than 200,000 households to help them switch to sustainable home improvements. Between 2017 and 2021, the company issued 11 solar loan securitizations, totaling $2.9 billion of offered securities. The company also prides itself on the low cost of funds on bonds.
Just a year ago Mosaic announced new financing partnerships that were expected to provide loans to more than 100,000 homeowners.
“Combining competitive pricing with MosaicScore, our proprietary solar loan credit score, we believe we are able to offer our partners the best combination of pricing and homeowner approval coverage available anywhere in the market,” said Billy Parish, founder and CEO.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/16/crossing-ev-barriers-with-microgrids-and-managed-charging/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,MONITORING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 16, 2022",Crossing EV barriers with microgrids and managed charging,"Electric vehicle (EV) sales are taking off at breakneck speeds, reaching an all-time high in Q3 2021, even amidst an overall new-vehicle sales decline, according to Kelley Blue Book. Sales of new vehicles declined 13.4% year over year in Q3 primarily due to low inventory and high prices, while sales of electrified vehicles, which includes fully-electric vehicles, hybrids, and plug-in hybrids, jumped by nearly 60% during that same timeframe.
As of September 30, 2021, auto manufacturers in the US sold more than one million new electrified vehicles, and EV accounted for 10.4% of total vehicle sales in Q3, nearly double the volume of Q3 2020, when electrified vehicle sales comprised only 5.5% of total sales.
In June, General Motors said it would increase its EV and AV investments through 2025 to $35 billion, building on an initial commitment in March 2020 to invest $20 billion over the time period, including capital, engineering expenses and other development costs. In November 2020, it increased that total to $27 billion.
However, as EV adoption booms, deploying charging infrastructure that can support electric fleets remains a considerable barrier to be overcome. The Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) has developed a report outlining how microgrids and managed charging can streamline deployment of charging infrastructure, while lowering energy costs, reducing carbon emissions, facilitating interconnection and improving the charging experience.
As the authors outline, utilities and fleet managers (think UPS or a transit authority, like MARTA) are typically presented with three options to meet the demand from fleet electrification.
According to the report, the first and second options can prove to be the most cost-effective if the fleet has flexibility in vehicle usage and scheduling; however, in any other scenario, the third option could prove to be similar in cost and have the ability to be implemented more quickly. Utilities and fleet managers with resilience mandates, interests, or policies, in the opinion of the authors, should explore options for on-site generation and microgrid capabilities to ride through an outage to charge their fleet.
Differences in fleet microgrids
When compared to a traditional microgrid for a building system, the report outlines that microgrids for fleet electrification present new challenges highlighted by the fact that microgrids for fleet electrification are modeled on anticipated demand, rather than an existing load, which can make reliable load-based modeling more difficult.
Source: Apparent Inc.
While this presents some difficulties in planning, fleets often permit charging flexibility within defined boundaries, providing a unique dispatchable resource that can be tuned to fit the needs and energy resources of the customer, enabling greater control over energy usage.
Especially among transportation authorities, fleet microgrids, and onsite solar-plus-storage have become a popular option for lowering electricity costs, while also providing free and programmable fueling options for vast quantities and different types of EV.
Barriers to fleet electrification and microgrids
In preparing the report, SEPA conducted industry interviews across auto manufacturers, solution (solar, storage, and microgrid) providers, fleet operators, and utilities, to identify the initial needs from each stakeholder group and some barriers standing in the way of fleet microgrids and overall fleet electrification.
Among auto manufacturers, the pressing needs were for more clarity for how needs vary for each customer class (are they buying sedans, heavy-duty work vehicles, busses, etc.), overcoming knowledge gaps with customers, understanding the different options their customers have when working with utilities and energy-as-a-service providers, clarity around the cost of charging infrastructure/utility service upgrades, and clarity regarding new and emerging business models from energy-as-a-service.
The biggest barriers these manufacturers identified were standards for how their vehicles will operate in a fleet microgrid, cost, space, and manufacturing constraints, sales cycle and long-term sales and manufacturing planning, and the lack of seamless communication between chargers, vehicles, and backend systems to connect to the vehicle.
Among solution providers, better approaches for determining a value of resilience; finding the right balance of sustainability, resilience, and economics; and understanding and awareness of energy-as-a-service or resilience-as-a-service business models were identified as the pressing needs.
For barriers, the providers identified a need for better managing and educating relevant stakeholders, the need for standardization around new technology, cost, and complexity in planning and implementation.
Fleet operators and utilities identified more comprehensive and specific needs.
For fleet operators:
For fleet operators, the barriers identified were lumped together with the previously-identified barriers by auto manufacturers.
For utilities:
Utility barriers identified included funding availability, logistics, load forecasting, and cost.
Fixing the issue
Summarizing the litany of barriers and needs, the authors of the study presented four comprehensive issues and their best-case potential solutions.

The first identified barrier is that customers don’t know what their load will be in five years, 10 years, and beyond, and this issue is most tied to fleet operators and the utilities who serve them.
To fix this issue, the authors recommend improving communication and information sharing between fleet operators, solution providers, and the utility. This includes stakeholder-informed load forecasting and coordinated fleet planning amongst all stakeholder groups. The authors also identify a need for regulatory and policy actions to address the unpredictability may include increased funding for make-ready infrastructure, innovative tariffs, data transparency and consistency, and nationwide databases of programs and rate structures.
The second identified barrier is a lack of understanding on which stakeholder groups need education, and what exactly they need to be educated on to advance fleet electrification, since multiple groups identified lack of  customer education as a major barrier.
The fix here, as proposed in the report, is to encourage cross-pollination between industry groups via conferences and workshops to educate all parties on EV, EV charging systems, and fleet electrification impacts on the grid. This can include basic training courses or virtual and in-person networking events. Regulatory and policy actions to close the education gap are also viable pathways.
The third barrier comes down to logistics, as the stakeholder environment is complicated and it’s not always clear what the roles and responsibilities are of each stakeholder group when a project is initiated.
Here, the proposed solution is to be flexible when identifying stakeholder roles and responsibilities in a given project with new energy and resilience-as-a-service business models. Before identifying each stakeholder groups’ roles and responsibilities, it’s critical to list out the scope of roles and responsibilities.
Finally, the report identified a lack of seamless communications between electric vehicles, charging, and the backend systems. Open charge point protocol and standards are not implemented uniformly across vendors, which is a barrier to scaling deployment.
The answer here is guidelines and best practices to streamline communications and implement standards for electric vehicles, charging, and the backend systems. Policy and regulatory actions to address standardization may include developing a clear and transparent process for how standards will be developed following a singular goal. This includes data sharing between vendors, fleets, and utilities, as well as updating interconnection requirements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/16/nrel-continues-to-explore-marine-wave-energy/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 16, 2022",NREL continues to explore marine wave energy,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that US waters hold enough wave energy to produce 80% of the country’s needs. While this energy cannot practically all be harnessed, NREL is exploring ways that marine wave energy can support the nation’s shift to non-emitting energy sources. 
Wave energy isn’t expected to rival solar or wind power, but NREL sees use cases for the technology, especially in remote island communities, which currently largely depend on costly, carbon-heavy diesel imports for power. NREL also sees avenues for ocean wave power in offshore fishing, marine research, or deep-sea military operations. 
“We have to ask ourselves,” said Krish Thiagarajan Sharman, the endowed chair in renewable energy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, “why have we been working on this for so long? Why don’t we have grid-ready, commercial-scale wave energy systems out in the world? 
The technology was first conceived in 1974, when University of Edinburgh professor Stephen Salter sent “ducks” into the sea, house-sized floating generators. The ocean’s power ultimately created too much force for the equipment to handle, battering and breaking the equipment. 
This intense power of the ocean remains a problem today in wave energy design, said NREL. There is a trade-off between strengthening and bolstering the equipment with heavy elements like steel, and a cost to those components. NREL said today, about 35-50% of wave energy costs are spent on structural enhancements, something that has prevented the technology from scaling. 
NREL’s team recently developed a system that may meet the needs of cost reduction, high energy production, and structural resilience. The design is a variable-geometry, oscillating, surge wave energy converter. The device opens windows for the waves to pass so that the devices aren’t bearing the brunt of the waves. As the waves move from productive to destructive, the device adjusts to open and let more wave energy pass, limiting damage.
 
Two years ago, the concept design earned a $30 million US Department of Energy award via the Technology Commercialization Fund. The funding will help move the design from theory to practice, said NREL. A prototype has been developed at the University of Massachusetts Amherst where it is tested in a wave tank. 
The NREL team is also exploring integrating a raised foundation to the technology. Often, wave energy harnessers are placed at the bottom of the ocean, where sand can create interference. Near the surface, ocean waters are often more energetic, so raising the devices could lead to a boost in production, said the researchers. 
“We look at waves not as a force to reckon with,” said Sharman, “but to use to harness energy. It’s a very holistic, symbiotic approach to manage our interaction with the ocean.”

The panel said that import levels are too low to justify the tariffs, and therefore gave the recommendation for termination. The Biden administration recently extended the tariffs for another four years. Alterations to the 201 tariffs included an increased 5GW tariff rate quota, and an exclusion for bifacial panels.
In negotiations, the US sent a trade representative to attempt to suspend the CUSMA agreement, which has now made its recommendation. The United States has until March 16th to eliminate the tariffs.

Two companies set to benefit from the ruling are Heliene and Silfab Solar, both Canadian module producers that export to the US. Since the Section 201 imports were put in place in 2018, Canada to US solar panel trade has decreased as much as 82%, said the Canadian government.
“Canada’s long-standing and close collaboration with the United States on cross-border trade and supply chains is critical to supporting our shared economic recovery, fighting climate change, and ensuring our long-term growth and competitiveness,” said Mary Ng, Canadian Minister of International Trade.
Ng said Canada will work toward the complete removal of the “unjustified” tariffs.
US manufacturing push
Tariffs are seen as one way the US attempts to encourage domestic manufacturing. In another push for US fabrication, House Representative Val Demings (D-FL) introduced the Reclaiming the Solar Supply Chain Act in September. It would allocate $3.5 billion to US solar manufacturing.
The proposed act won support from groups like the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance (ULCSA). ULCSA director Michael Parr said too many solar panels and other components are made in global supply chains with high carbon emissions, and that supporting domestic manufacturing can leverage American innovation and low-carbon manufacturing processes.
In November, the US passed the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, sponsored by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA). The act includes numerous tax credits for US solar fabs.
An earlier proposal Build Back Better Act also had provisions for US manufacturing. Included in the bill was an incentive for the manufacture of thin film PV or crystalline PV cells. The incentive would pay $0.04 per watt DC capacity of the cell. PV wafers would be offered $12 per square meter, and solar-grade polysilicon is offered $3 per kilogram U.S.-made solar modules are offered an incentive of $0.07 per watt. The bill also had incentives for the manufacture of trackers, purlins, fasteners, inverters, and other balance-of-system components.
The BBBA was halted in December, when Sen. Joe Manchin pulled back his must-have vote in a last-minute surprise to the nation.

Upon arrival, the local fire department found roughly ten battery racks that were completely melted. The fire department representatives said that the fire was extinguished.
North County Fire District Chief, Joel Mendoza, was quoted by local news saying,
We could confirm that it does have a fire suppression system, that the fire suppression system activated, and actually extinguished or cooled the batteries to the point where there wasn’t any flame or fire.
Vistra Energy released an official statement on its website. The company says the onsite fire suppression systems performed as required, at least in the sense that the fire incident was isolated.
The California ISO energy website does show a drop in battery output at 7 p.m. local time. There is no indication this is related to the Moss Landing facility.

Vistra has suggested that the event might be a similar event to the September incident that took down Phase I of the facility. According to a statement from Vistra, that incident involved a cascading series of events which may have started with the failure of a ball bearing in a fan.
The suspected bearing failure is presumed to have set off the very early smoke detection apparatus (VESDA), which in turn armed the heat suppression system. Vistra stated that due to ‘failures of a small number of couplings on flexible hoses and pipes’, water sprayed directly onto additional battery racks, causing short circuiting and arcing, which damaged the batteries and made more smoke. The additional smoke set off more alarms and caused even more water to spray from the failed couplings.
While the cascading events following the smoke detection can be seen in the data, investigators have not explicitly determined what set off the smoke alarm in the first place.
Vistra says that they had been bringing the Phase I facility back online incrementally, but have now decided to pause those activities. pv magazine was not able to confirm whether any of the larger facility’s capacity has come back online.

To meet workforce needs, new job training programs have been launched, and hiring expanded.
The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (SB 2408), passed last September, is an energy package that sets the state on a trajectory toward 100% clean energy by 2050. The law also provides immediate steps that help accelerate the renewable energy transition that’s already underway in Illinois. Among the many provisions is $34 million in funding for a grant program to provide seed capital to emerging disadvantaged businesses; $1 million for the Jobs and Justice Fund, a nonprofit “green bank” that will infuse disadvantaged businesses with capital; $21 million for a 16 clean energy workforce training hubs across the state.
Prior to the passing of the act, residential solar installations were down nearly 90% in Q2 last year compared to 2020, as the state was in “solar incentive limbo”. Just 313 small rooftop solar projects were completed statewide in Q2 2021, compared to 2,908 a year earlier. In fact, SEIA ranked Illinois 21st in solar installations in 2021, after holding at #13 the previous year. But what a difference legislation makes. Data from the Illinois Power Agency shows that:
A survey of solar businesses in Illinois found that:
The Illinois Power Agency maintains an online map of solar projects that participate in the state’s adjustable block program here – roughly 25,000 solar projects have been completed since the program launched in 2017. The Agency is currently developing its long-term renewable energy plan that will establish the path for renewable energy growth for coming years. The plan will establish an Equity Eligible Contractor certification and an Equity Accountability System in the next 12-18 months.
SEIA estimates that 3,235MW of solar will be installed in Illinois over the next 5 years, or a rank of 12th in the nation.

The latest set of numbers posted by SolarEdge again emphasized how well the Israeli inverter and energy storage company appears to have weathered the Covid-19 crisis, with CEO Zvi Lando reporting record revenues for the final three months of 2021 and the full year.
The figures he was highlighting were $552 million of business in the October-to-December window – up 5% on the previous three months and 54% on the same period of a Covid-affected 2020 – and $1.96 billion for the whole year, which amounted to a 35% rise on the $1.46 billion recorded in 2020.
The only flies in the ointment were a dip in gross margin during the final three months of last year, which saw SolarEdge bank less profit per product according to quarterly and annual comparisons and the fact the company posted lower net income in the last quarter than it did in July-to-September.
Neither of those numbers, however, appear to have affected the resilient company’s bottom line, with SolarEdge reporting it had $548 million in the bank at the end of the year, some $24 million more than it had three months earlier.
That net income dip in the final quarter failed to prevent the manufacturer posting a full-year figure which, at $169 million, was 21% higher than the $140 million banked for 2020.
Putting aside a rare proofreading error in the summary of the figures released by SolarEdge yesterday – which suggested the three-month outlook section of the document related to Q4 2021, rather than the current window – and Lando and the board appear positive about current performance, amid predictions of more record-busting quarterly revenue of $615-645 million, including $575-595 million from the company’s solar business.

The author laments the ‘enormous amount of money, lobbying, and legal firepower that is being deployed by Big Wind and Big Solar’.
The database of solar power rejections totals 21 individual line items. The list starts in 2017 with one rejected site. There were no projects in 2018, five in 2019, two in 2020, and thirteen in 2021. The list includes one project that was double counted, and three legislation references that don’t specify a particular project.
The majority of the rejections are town votes against changing zoning classifications to allow for the construction of a solar power facility on agricultural land.
The list’s author requests that his readers send him any additional rejections of facilities that he hasn’t yet discovered.
 

 
It is possible that a recent decrease in support for solar power is related to large scale development.
The pushback comes in multiple forms — though the language used in local town meetings tends to consistently reference bucolic views, rural character, and property values. Actual evidence of decreasing property value is inconclusive.
Recent research has found that solar power pushback begins to increase considerably as solar power facilities break 50 acres in size. pv magazine USA reported extensively on the Spotsylvania 500 MWac solar power facility, which went through a two-year battle of various approvals and rejections. A large section of that facility ultimately went online last summer.
The rejections do hurt the individual developers, land people, and the land owners of these projects. However, 17 rejections since the start of 2017 represent a very small fraction of the 2,681 utility scale facilities that actually were installed over that same time period, per the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration 860-M report. These facilities totalled 35.1 GWac of generation capacity.
One example of a project that isn’t yet on the list occurred recently, in North Carolina. The landowner, Megan Taylor, said the offer by the solar company to lease her land for the next 35 years would “send my children to college and will allow me to secure our future.”
The town rejected her, and her family’s, secure future.
