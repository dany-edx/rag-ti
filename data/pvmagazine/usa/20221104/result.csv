The retailer is expected to save up to $4.5 million on energy costs over the next 20 years and about $157,327 in estimated savings in the first year of operations. 
EnergyLink served as the primary design-build contractor for the project that is now among the largest rooftop solar arrays in the state. The company managed the project from the initial auditing phase to the engineering, procurement, and construction phases. 
Trina 410 W solar panels were selected for the installation, along with 62 kW SMA inverters and AeroRack racking systems. 
The project is expected to produce 2,176,200 kilowatts of electricity annually, which is the equivalent of 3,399,528 pounds of CO2 emissions, burning 1,704,607 pounds of coal, or charging a smartphone 187,601,523 times.
“Wading through the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) requirements for a solar installation of this size and scale was the biggest challenge for the project, but EnergyLink’s administration team worked closely with our construction crew to ensure everything was done on schedule and met local regulations,” said Midway in a case study report on the project. 
The project was completed in phases managed by EnergyLink: 
“The MidwayUSA project is the new benchmark for corporations looking to be more sustainable,” said Jeremy Nolen, EnergyLink’s lead on the project. “This is proof that, with the right ESCO, it’s possible to be more sustainable in an economically viable way.”
EnergyLink is a NAESCO accredited Energy Efficiency Contractor (EEC) that designs, builds, and funds renewable energy and energy efficiency products for commercial businesses, public institutions, cities, municipalities, and nonprofits.

Production will take place the company’s facility in Memphis, Tennessee.
The company’s Hover Array System is a rooftop-mounted microgrid combining wind, solar and energy storage with the company’s Integrated Energy Management System (IEMS) software platform. The IEMS system integrates energy generated by both wind (alternating current) and solar (direct current) into a unified 480 volt, 3-phase direct drive power system to provide back-up power to building owners and residential customers.
Hover’s consumer wind turbine is mounted along the windward-facing edges of the rooftop, able to generate continuous power during the day. The company said it produces a multiple of power per square foot that is considerably more than a comparably sized rooftop solar system. The wind technology uses an “aerodynamic design that uses the building as a sail” to deliver commercial scale power.
The company’s complementary on-site solar panels are meanwhile mounted on the rooftop center, away from the shadow of the turbine’s parapet, generating sufficient solar power during a majority of the daily peak afternoon hours.
Initial testing of the Hover Array System shows that the 36 kW system can offset 100% of a building’s power consumption in the majority of cases, although as with any microgrid system, daily time of use is the only setback to providing continuous power around the clock.
“Hover spent nearly 8 years in R&D, followed by two years of rigorous testing at our installation site,” said Chris Griffin, Hover’s president and CEO.  “We know of no other wind technology that has survived two hurricanes (i.e. Ian) and is still functioning properly.”
The company is partnered with RealTime Group since 2021 and Jabil since 2017 to test the array system and for the supply of components used in the Hover Array System, respectively. Hover installed its first array system on Jabil’s Strategic Development building in St. Petersburg, Florida in 2021.
The company holds 22 issued or allowed patents to its wind-powered microgrid technology out of 32 U.S. and international patents, and to date has installed microgrids in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean markets.
Formed in 2015, Hover has been funded by its management and $710,000 in debt financing it raised in April 2019. Prior to Hover, Chris Griffin was CEO of formed Regenedyne, also a wind turbine start-up, and before that spent 15 years in corporate finance at various Wall Street firms.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/04/california-set-to-release-anti-rooftop-solar-net-metering-plan/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",California set to release anti-rooftop solar net metering plan,"In California, there has been a multi-year war waged over the fate of a mechanism called net energy metering (NEM). The process involves customers sending their excess solar-generated electricity to the grid and receiving a credit on their utility bill at a retail rate for all exported electricity.
A new revised NEM proposal is set to be released after the elections on November 8, 2022. It will be watched closely by Californians as utilities now argue that the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act will make fair net metering rates unnecessary.
Net Energy Metering has been a critical policy in launching the California rooftop solar market, which has grown to a robust 1.3 million homes covered in panels, representing about 50% of the US residential market. It also helped launch distributed commercial rooftop projects, another key part of California’s race to electrical decarbonization.
It came under threat when a new investor-owned utility-backed proposal, NEM 3.0, was placed on the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) desk. The proposed decision included roughly an 80% reduction in the payment for excess solar energy sent to the grid, and tacks on an $8 per kW monthly charge for all solar customers, regardless of whether they have battery energy storage or not. A common-sized 8 kW system would be charged $64 a month, a fee that makes solar a non-option for most customers.

In fact, at the time of the proposal, a survey of 4,000 active home solar shoppers found that 95% of homeowners were no longer interested in buying solar after viewing the cost assumptions of the new rate plan. Laura Deehan, state director Environment California condemned the proposal as “a tax on the sun.”
(Read: “Thousands of Californians protest NEM 3.0”)
After the proposal was decried by environmentalists, energy experts, jobs experts and Californian citizens alike, it was revised. The new decision was still chock-full of anti-rooftop solar and pro-centralized utility structuring.
“Non-bypassable charges” that were added in the revised NEM 3.0. These charges would add a proposed $0.05/kWh to all customers, whether they have solar on their roof or not. The charges would even apply to power generated by the customer’s home solar system, which is unconventional considering the utility does not have ownership over the solar array and did not invest in it. For context, the average American pays about $0.145/kWh for electricity, so the addition of a $0.05/kWh non-bypassable charge would be a heavy hitter on Californians’ utility bills.
ROTH Capital Partners Phil Shen said in an industry note that the new proposal, expected on November 8, may add a $10 to $20 per month fixed charge and a rapid glide path to low export rates between two to six cents per kWh. This net metering payment is a far cry below the 29 cents per kWh the average Californian is charged by the utility.
Cost shift?
The reason behind the policy appears simple, investor-owned utilities want to sell Californians power, they want to retain monopoly control. NEM 3.0 is backed by all the major utilities in the state, including PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E.
The utilities have pushed the concept of a “cost shift,” indicating that rich Californians reap the benefits of rooftop solar while poorer Californians pick up the tab for net metering costs. However, this theory has held little water under analysis, and new policy and data makes the argument even more flimsy.
Sixteen state-level studies have disproven the cost-shift argument, as has a national study, completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LNBL). Berkeley found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar, and in many cases had cost benefits. Read more about the utility-backed push of NEM 3.0 and the cost shift argument here.
Two major changes
The cost shift argument holds even less weight under the light of new data from LNBL and new policy in the state.
In its annual Residential Solar-Adopter Income and Demographics Trends report, it found that about one-third of California households that installed rooftop solar in 2021 were solidly working- and middle-class families, with annual incomes between $50,000 and $100,000. Only 12 percent of households had annual incomes of $250,000 or more. It also found that the median income among all U.S. households that installed solar in 2021 was roughly $110,000, compared to $129,000 in 2010.
“The numbers of middle-income California households adopting rooftop solar is encouraging news and further underscores how successful the state’s current financial incentives have been at making the clean energy option available for budget-minded families,” said EWG President and California resident Ken Cook.
These findings buck the argument that working-class families are subsidizing richer residents. But what about renters, and those with homes unsuitable for rooftop solar? New policy changes have also made headway in this area.
Following Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, California passed AB 2316, the Community Renewable Energy Act. The law creates a community renewable energy program, including community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes.

Community solar projects are often smaller than utility-scale facilities, and are ideally built on landfills, former industrial sites, and other brownfield locations. Customers typically subscribe to a share of energy produced by the local clean energy project, accessing lower bills and reducing their carbon footprint. 
Without the ability to purchase and install solar directly on a rented residence, community solar offers a pathway to the 45% of Californians who rent their homes, and the 70% of renters who are considered low-income. The program’s structure ensures that at least 51% of subscribers are low-income customers, triggering at least a 40% federal tax credit on solar panels under the Inflation Reduction Act.
“Community renewable energy is a proven powerful tool to help close California’s clean energy gap, bringing much needed relief to millions struggling with high housing costs and utility debt,” said Alexis Sutterman, energy equity program manager at the California Environmental Justice Alliance.
The new NEM proposed decision will be presented to the CPUC on after the elections on November 8. Utilities now argue that fair net metering rates aren’t necessary based on new clean energy incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. But those who understand the value of distributed rooftop solar aren’t buying it.
“The CPUC and Gov. Newsom should follow the facts, not the narrow interests of the power companies, and reject their plot to rip away access to rooftop solar for working-class Californians. The data shows these are the folks relying the most on the state’s residential solar program,” said Cook.
Those interested in supporting a healthy, long-term extension of fair rooftop solar rulemaking can sign a petition made by the Environmental Working Group of California at the bottom of the linked page.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/04/baaaaa-wa-optimizes-its-business-model-for-agrivoltaic-sheep/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",BayWa r.e. optimizes business model for agrivoltaics,"It all comes down to energy. Food is energy, and electricity is among our species’ greatest energy enablers. So what could be better than combining food production with solar electricity generation? The synergy of the food + energy production of an agrivoltaic facility jives in a common-sense, fundamental manner.
BayWa r.e. is deploying many plant-based agrivoltaic experiments – growing strawberries, apples, and red currents – and it has plans to develop tens of megawatts of solar facilities in the coming years. It has also been experimenting with agrivoltaic operations involving livestock, like bees and sheep.
At RE+ 2022, pv magazine USA sat down with BayWa r.e.’s David Barnes, managing director and executive vice president of BayWa r.e. Operation Services, to discuss the dirt beneath our solar hardware.
Image: BayWa r.e.
At its 270 MW solar power facility in Texas, BayWa r.e. was quoted approximately $275,000 each time their 1,700 acres was mowed, a job that needed to be done twice each year. If a solar field were to sell electricity under a $0.04/kWh power purchase agreement, that 13.75 million kWh/year facility could exchange roughly 2%, or 7.5 MW of its yearly electricity production for those mowing expenses. As we can see from the graph above, grazing livestock could reduce those costs by around 80%.
But here’s the kicker: The facility appears to have lost 1,035 solar modules to projectile debris, thrown by mowers as they traversed the rocky fields. That damage totaled approximately $306,000 in procurement and repair work.
So BayWa r.e. decided to study how sheep at this location could help manage the vegetation. And after several rounds of buying sheep, their flock has grown to more than 700. Sadly, they lost seven of the sheep to predators, though they have gained a few back from lambing. The company pays a shepherd to manage the sheep, and splits profits from lambs and any mutton sold.
The end result is increased electricity generation and a savings of $413,774 compared to the cost of mowing. The sheep appear to have damaged two solar modules, as compared to the 1,035 panels damaged by projectiles.

BayWa r.e. is now refining the number of sheep onsite. They now estimate that closer to 900 sheep will be needed to rotate the flock quickly enough to cover the entire facility, before the grass grows tall enough to shade modules. The table above demonstrates the amount of grazing required by each of the eight sections of the solar facility.
The logistics have become better defined with experience. For instance, the shepherd must check on the sheep, which takes a few hours, several times per week. And it takes up to four people to move the sheep from section to section. The herds would graze on 5 acres to 8 acres per day at this site.
Depending on time of year and the temperature, the sheep need approximately 600 gallons to 1,200 gallons of water each day.

Lines distributing water from local ponds and wells were built to save on supply costs. BayWa r.e. thought that it was unwise for them to take on the responsibility and risk of providing water to the sheep, as such a task falls outside of their expertise.
Of course, some challenges remain.
Sheep draw predators. Part of the requirement for the sheep herder is to protect the sheep – typically with dogs, or a donkey. David points out that donkeys are risky – they are often stubborn animals who might kick the solar panels or racking systems.

Under the best of conditions, sheep can be challenging animals to raise. Lambing requires intensive management, often posing risks to the ewes and requiring swift veterinary intervention. The strong herd mentality of sheep has frequently been compared to the behavior of lemmings.
At another facility in Mexico, BayWa r.e. owns their own sheep and works with a shepherd  who is paid to shepherd the flock via being given the lambs. BayWa r.e. owns the sheep in Texas, paying a flat fee to their contractor for management. They’ve also been in discussions with a large group of sheep owners in North Carolina.
There is, of course, a different financial model for each of their facilities. The quantity and rotation of sheep depends on the total amount of grass that grows on a site, and several other variables.
As agrivoltaics operations evolve via government research, and small farming operations, the big-time solar developers like BayWa r.e. are leading the way for large-scale implementation.

Heating technology manufacturer Carrier is set to start field testing its prototype air-source heat pump for cold climates.
The project is part of the “Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge” developed by the U.S. Department of Energy. It aims to develop and commercialize a new heat pump technology to more efficiency heat residential homes in climates with freezing temperatures.
Heat pump prototypes participating in the project must perform efficiently at temperatures equal or below negative negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit. They are designed to be grid-interactive, provide high-efficiency heating performance in harsh climates, and employ environmentally friendly refrigerants.
The prototype heat pump first underwent a lab testing phase, with results allowing it to pass to the field-testing phase.
“We’re pleased with the lab performance of our prototype heat pump and the final test results,” said Justin Keppy, president, North America residential and light commercial HVAC at Carrier. “Our team of dedicated engineers and product managers are hard at work continuing to develop next generation heat pumps to increase efficiency, save consumers money and benefit the environment.”
Carrier joins Irish-based Trane Technologies and U.S.-based Lennox heat pump manufactures in developing prototypes entering the field-testing phase. Other manufacturers participating in the project include Bosch, LG, and Daikin. Commercialization of the successful units is expected by 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/04/pv-as-energy-infrastructure-technology-renaissance-or-marketing-hype/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",PV as energy infrastructure – technology renaissance or marketing hype?,"The day in 2005, as the U.S. Congress passed the original Investment Tax Credit (ITC), many of us were on a conference call discussing the legislation. There was great anticipation as to whether it would pass and what it would mean over the long term to the industry.
When someone announced that the legislation had passed, the energy and excitement was palpable. After what seemed to be a few minutes of whooping and hollering in joy and excitement, everything went silent until someone said, “I wonder if we asked for the right things.”
Now 17 years later, after a similar yet more encompassing and dynamic piece of legislation passed, we cross an event horizon, a wick that lights the fireworks for the forth PV industry energy boom.
This time, it is not the ITC, it is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022!
After writing on energy, environmental and infrastructure topics for decades, just like in 2005, my thoughts and those on many of our colleagues’ minds are asking the same question, “What does this mean and how will it play out over the next 15 years or so”?
At Solar Power International 2022 (SPI) during RE+, I looked at tens of thousands of PV enthusiasts who all of a sudden are in the PV infrastructure business. When I asked colleagues the question, “What does infrastructure mean to you?”, almost without exception the initial response was a stunned look.
Maybe it is because once the excitement hits and has passed, it is time to process the thoughts and feelings, and ask a series of new questions. “What is PV and Energy Storage Infrastructure, what does it mean, and how will it impact all of us today and into the future?”
The expansive range of topics and discussions of PV as energy infrastructure are not new subjects or topics. However, today these technologies and their applications come to the market with a new set of urgencies and necessities. When looking back, how will we determine PV industry success or failure?
Hopefully, success will be measured in more effective PV plant lifecycle power quality and quantity, and just as critically, system reliability, availability, maintainability including testability and safety (RAMS). This translates into having an abundance of high quality energy at an effectively reasonable price to address the wants, needs, and interests of all stakeholders. If and when delivered, will it leverage economic development internationally, raise living standards, improve PV system health and condition, to offset hundreds of years on negative environmental impacts?
So, what does all of this mean and how might it roll out over the next decade or so?
Will we be entering a PV/energy storage as Energy Infrastructure Renaissance or will it be a variety of new energy market hype?
Before we get to that point in time, there are tough questions the industry must ask itself and its stakeholders. We can begin with some of the following as we lay out what we hope delivers a new energy era.
While PV and energy storage will not be the only critical set of energy technology challenges, it will be a key element.  Moving forward, let’s begin the industry questions and discussions.
Through 2023, we will be investigating the possibilities as we stimulate the discussion and meaning of PV as energy infrastructure. We will do so through interviews, polling, and digging into technology today and its further applications.
In essence, the discussion must address a myriad of perspectives, wants, needs and realities, beginning with yours.
So, consider if you will what PV and Energy Storage as Energy Infrastructure is to you globally including your short and long term needs?

“We’re encouraged by the market response to our Commercial Renewables business and will proceed with a sale targeting a second-quarter 2023 closing,” said Lynn Good, chief executive officer in the company’s third-quarter earnings release.
The potential sale was disclosed in August in its second quarter profit report when Lynn Good, CEO, expressed that the company would stick with its regulated consumer utility operations.
“Commercial renewables has played an important role in our business strategy for over 15 years, establishing a core competency in renewable energy development and operations that will continue to serve us well as we advance our strategy,” said Good in a press release. “But as we look forward to the remainder of this decade and beyond, we see significant investment opportunities in our regulated operations and believe now is the time to review the strategic fit of our commercial portfolio.”
Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke Energy provides electric services to more than 7 million customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, including retail natural gas service to over 500,000 customers in Ohio and Kentucky. About 95% of Duke’s earnings has come from its regulated utility business, with 5% coming from the renewables unit, which includes wind, solar and battery storage.
Duke said it remains committed to its clean energy goals of reducing carbon 50% by 2030 and aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company is also taking steps toward reducing carbon emissions, including decreasing use of coal to less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal by 2035 as part of what it says is the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry. It also plans to convert 100% of its light-duty vehicles to electric and 50% of its combined fleet of medium-duty, heavy-duty and offroad vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids or other zero-carbon alternatives by 2030.
With the announcement of the sale, Duke seeks a strategic owner who has the potential to grow the renewables business. Duke’s Q3 earnings per share was $1.78, just shy of projections of $1.84.
