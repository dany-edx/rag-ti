The researchers will work to identify methods to extend the life of lead batteries. Their work will focus on conducting an atomic-level examination of organic materials that could improve cycling efficiency and allow for more lifetime cycles, thereby extending overall battery life.
The research aims to improve the performance of advanced lead batteries, which are recyclable, and for which recycling capacity already exists in the U.S.
According to previous research on the subject, the key to extending lead battery life is to investigate the interaction among materials and the unwanted formation of crystals that can limit battery life span.
This is similar to the obstacle faced by Urban Electric Power, a battery startup which, through chemical tweaks to alkaline batteries, achieved a breakthrough in battery recharging. The breakthrough could help unlock the chemistry’s potential as an inexpensive long-term storage option.
The Argonne Lab-backed research group will not work with alkaline batteries, but will instead focus on lignosulfonates, which are naturally occurring organic materials used in the lead battery’s negative plates to maintain an optimum energy flow.
The battery companies joining Argonne and UToledo are Crown Battery, based in Fremont, Ohio; Clarios, based in Milwaukee; East Penn Manufacturing, based in Lyon Station, Pennsylvania; Ecobat, based in Dallas; and EnerSys, based in Reading, Pennsylvania.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/30/data-confirm-the-rise-of-solar-plus-storage-hybrids-across-the-u-s-grid/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 30, 2021",Data confirm the rise of solar-plus-storage hybrids across the U.S. grid,"At least 226 co-located hybrid front-of-the-meter power plants greater than 1 MW in size were operating in the United States at the end of 2020, according to data tracked by the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The total installed capacity topped 30 GW.
Based on Form EIA-860 data, the most common configuration is PV + storage (73 projects totaling 992 MW of solar and 250 MW storage), followed by several fossil-based hybrid categories.
Co-located or hybrid power plants–namely, ones that integrate energy storage on-site with power generation sources, or that co-locate two or more different types of generation–have been part of the U.S. energy mix for years. The dominant trend today is to combine solar PV plants with batteries.
Interconnection queue data from across the country that is tracked by LBNL show a strong commercial interest in hybrid power plants. At the close of 2020, there were more than 460 GW of solar plants in the interconnection queues. Of that, 159 GW, or 35%, was classified as hybrid, typically a solar-plus-battery configuration. For the 209 GW of wind in interconnection queues, roughly 6% of projects were proposed as hybrids, with most of those paired with battery storage.

Solar installations generally spur higher battery attachment rates, as the projects in interconnection had a median storage to generation capacity ratio of 60% for solar, and 35% for wind. Solar also had the longest median-duration storage attached, at about 2 hours.
Almost 93% of all hybrid projects in the interconnection queue were solar + battery, representing 88% of the total hybrid capacity. Proposed solar plus battery capacity accounted for more than seven times the combined generator capacity of all other proposed hybrid configurations.
California’s grid CAISO saw the highest rate of solar projects with batteries included, with 89%. That was followed by the West non-ISO territories at 67%, and then the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and Electric Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) regions at 22% and 21%, respectively.
In general, the west has shown a greater interest in such projects, as eastern grids including NYISO, ISO-NE, and PJM had hybrid project rates of 5%, 12%, and 19%, respectively.
CAISO data suggest co-location models are more popular than a true hybrid approach. Co-location entails distinct modeling and dispatch instructions for individual resources behind shared interconnection. Hybrid models use a single bidding approach for multiple resourced behind shared interconnection, meaning there is no separate renewable resource forecast and dispatch. Most of the CAISO capacity planned through 2024 falls under this category, shown in the figure to the left.
Berkeley Labs also tracked PV+battery plants with offtake agreements to get a better view of the near-term hybrid pipeline. A sample of 134 projects showed a trend toward longer duration storage and higher battery-to-PV capacity ratios than in currently existing hybrid plants.
Overall weighted-average battery duration of these new offtaker-secured projects was 3.4 hours, with a battery-to PV-capacity ratio of 50%. These numbers were higher than for existing projects, which had an average duration of 2.6 hours and a 25% storage-capacity ratio. Most of the upcoming battery capacity of these projects were in California, Nevada, Texas, and Hawaii.
Based on a review of power purchase agreements, Berkeley Labs found that the cost of adding storage increases linearly with the battery-to-PV capacity ratio, and that overall PPA prices have declined over time, even with the increase of battery-to-PV capacity ratio. This trend held everywhere but in Hawaii, where PV projects often have a 100% storage capacity ratio, and storage-coupled projects come at a premium.

Tesla has sold Maxwell Technologies, a company it bought in 2019 in an all-stock deal. Tesla did not officially announce the sale to investors or the market, or mention it in its earnings call, unlike its acquisition announcement.
Instead, a press release issued by ultracapacitor company UCAP Power said it had purchased the “Maxwell brand [and] Maxwell Technologies Korea business, as well as other assets from Maxwell Technologies.”
Hidden in the detail was the fact Tesla has held on to key Maxwell technology, namely its dry battery electrode (DBE) process methodology.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed the sale in a series of tweets, noting the irony of selling off technology he had personally investigated. Musk said lithium-ion is sufficient for Maxwell’s capacitor technology.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/30/tc-energy-advances-1-gw-pumped-hydro-energy-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,CANADA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 30, 2021",TC Energy advances 1 GW pumped hydro energy storage project,"Calgary-based TC Energy Corp. said it reached an agreement with the Canadian Department of National Defense that allows for development of a 1,000 MW pumped hydro energy storage project on federal lands in Ontario.
The Ontario Pumped Storage Project, proposed to be built on Department of National Defense’s 4th Canadian Division Training Centre property by TC Energy, would be the province’s largest energy storage project.
TC Energy operates across North America, including 57,900 miles of natural gas pipeline, more than 653 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage, and 4,200 MW of electric power generation.
The pumped hydro project aims in part to reduce the amount of electricity that is exported from the province at a loss. The developer said that exports to Quebec and Manitoba, as well as to New York, Michigan, and Minnesota, result in a loss of C$384 million ($309 million).
“Ontario consumers are effectively paying for electrical capacity that contributes to the clean-up of other jurisdictions’ energy systems,” according to the company web site. It said that in 2016, Ontario exported 14.6 TWh of electricity at a loss.
The pumped storage project would help to optimize the province’s electricity system and deliver more than C$250 million ($200 million) in annual savings to electricity consumers.
TC Energy said is will now move on to the next phase of project development. That includes provincial and federal environmental and impact assessments. It said further development remains subject to conditions, including approval by the company’s Board of Directors, regulatory approvals, and assurances that the project will not impact military activities and training.
