Shaw Renewable Investments. The Louisiana investor-owned utility company announced the purchase of power generated from the solar facility one week after the project commenced commercial operations on November 1.
Entergy recently signed a 20-year power purchase agreement to purchase power from the solar facility which was developed, engineered and constructed by D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments (DESRI) on a 492-acre tract of land in Franklinton, Louisiana, using 187,000 solar panels.
“DESRI was thrilled to commission the Iris Solar facility and to deliver this project’s new renewable energy to Entergy’s customers,” said David Zwillinger, CEO of DESRI. “Our team considers Entergy a close partner and we look forward to bringing more solar projects online for them in the next few years.”
Construction began in October 2020 for Iris Solar and St. James Solar, located in Vacherie, Louisiana, while both projects combined are expected to provide enough power for 13,000 homes per year.
DESRI manages a portfolio of 67 utility-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects in 25 states with 6.31 GW of total power capacity across various development stages. In January the company filed an S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list itself on the Nasdaq exchange.
Entergy operates five utilities which collectively own 908 MW of ground-mounted and rooftop solar assets in four states, while the utilities purchase an additional 812 MW of solar PPA contracts from various IPPs around the southeast region. The utility has a 7 GW development pipeline of solar and wind farms planned for construction in the MISO and Southwest Power Pool region from 2023 – 2027.
Iris Solar is the second solar project Entergy New Orleans is purchasing power from out of facilities with 96.5 MW of aggregate power capacity in the state of Louisiana. Its third solar PPA project, St. James Solar, is a 20 MW utility-scale project in Vacherie, Louisiana scheduled for completion by the end of this year.
According to SEIA, including Iris Solar about 260.9 MW of total solar installations have been deployed in Louisiana to date, and through Q2 22 the state employed 3,210 in the solar market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/10/california-proposed-decision-to-cut-payments-rooftop-solar-net-metering/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",California proposed decision to cut payments for rooftop solar net metering,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has released its proposed decision for Net Energy Metering (NEM), implementing a net billing mechanism and slashing payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%. Based on an initial analysis, the new proposed decision would cut the average export rate in California from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, making the cuts effective in April 2023.
Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association (CALSSA) said, “The CPUC’s new proposed decision would really hurt. It needs more work or it will replace the solar tax with a steep solar decline. An immediate 75 percent reduction of net energy metering credits does not support a growing solar market in California.”
NEM has been a critical policy in launching the California rooftop solar market, which has grown to a robust 1.3 million homes covered in panels, representing about 50% of the US residential market. It has also been instrumental in launching the state’s commercial and industrial solar market.
Under the new net metering structure, payments for excess solar production to the grid will be cut to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a minute fraction of the retail rate paid by customers for electricity supplied by the grid. CPUC said the new proposed decision will lead to an average payback of nine years for residential rooftop solar, based on an assumption of a $3.30 cost per Watt. Read the complete proposed decision here.
The net metered payments will be based on hourly Avoided Cost Calculator rates, averaged over days in a month with separate rates for weekends and holidays. An avoided cost “ACC Plus” adder will be applied to boost net metering payment rates as a constant for nine years and varies by utility. Low-income customers are offered a higher adder rate. SDG&E customers are not eligible to receive an adder.
The proposed decision comes after a year of rulemaking battles waged between investor-owned utilities and rooftop solar advocates, including environmentalists, employment and labor groups, small businesses, and concerned citizens. A year ago the proposed NEM 3.0 was introduced as CPUC determined rooftop solar customers cross-subsidize customers who source their energy from the traditional centralized power grid.
(Read: “Coalition received $1.7 million from three California utilities to push NEM 3.0, a rooftop solar ‘killer’“)
CPUC determined that the NEM 2.0 structure “negatively impacts non-participating ratepayers; disproportionately harms low-income ratepayers; and is not cost-effective.” These assumptions, which were determined by CPUC in a “Lookback Study” have been challenged by the rooftop solar industry. CALSSA said a number of the study’s assumptions are flawed, and the source code necessary to investigate or replicate the study’s main conclusions is not provided. It said the CPUC also failed to make the Lookback Study analysts available for discovery or cross-examination.
Protect Our Communities (PCF) said the Lookback Study underestimates the benefits of behind-the-meter generation because the calculator does not adequately quantify avoided transmission costs or the resiliency benefits of net energy metering solar, or account for the air quality and climate benefits.
CPUC’s NEM 3.0 decision said the new structure should, “should promote equity, inclusion, electrification, and the adoption of solar paired with storage systems, and provide a glide path so that the industry can sustainably transition from the current tariff to the successor tariff and from a predominantly stand-alone solar system tariff to one that promotes the adoption of solar systems paired with storage.”
“If passed as is, the CPUC’s proposal would protect utility monopolies and boost their profits, while making solar less affordable and delaying the goal of 100 percent clean energy. California needs more solar power and more solar-charged batteries, not less,” said Del Chiaro.
Rooftop solar is vital to reaching California’s clean energy goals. With the promise of battery storage for grid reliability, and new federal incentives for going solar, a wide coalition of solar supporters are calling on the CPUC to keep solar growing and affordable for all Californians. More than 160,000 people submitted comments to the CPUC and Governor Newsom calling for a strong NEM-3 decision, the highest count in CPUC history.
“We urge Governor Newsom and the CPUC to make further adjustments to help more middle- and working-class consumers as well as schools and farms access affordable, reliable, clean energy,” said Del Chiaro.
Oral arguments, limited to three minutes, will be held by CPUC on November 16 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. PST. Register to view the proceedings here.

OYA Renewables announced it has created a joint venture platform with Oil Well Shares (OWS), an Appalachian oil and gas exploration company.  The JV platform, called Chrysalis Energy, will develop and construct 3 GW utility-scale solar, wind, and energy storage facilities across the PJM region. The assets will be installed on 1.5 million acres of mainly contiguous, rights-owned land in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. 
The initial phase of development is expected to be completed by 2030 and Chrysalis will follow with ongoing energy transition infrastructure development in perpetuity, the company said. 
“The sheer magnitude of the land position is remarkable, likely the single largest private land inventory in PJM and comprising 1/1000th of the entire continental U.S. acreage,” said Manish Nayar, founder and executive chairman of OYA Renewables. “Proximity to the Great Lakes is also highly significant, allowing us to explore green hydrogen opportunities in addition to solar, storage, and wind. We’re very proud to partner with an energy innovator like OWS. Its boots on the ground local presence will be invaluable as we move to assess and develop renewable energy at scale.” 
Under the Chrysalis JV, OYA and OWS will develop, construct, jointly own and operate the portfolio on OWS land.  The JV platform is expected to increase security and resiliency of the region’s energy supply. Chrysalis Energy said it is focused on local economic growth and the support and advancement of local Appalachian workforces through new job creation in engineering, project construction, development, operations and management. 
“This unique JV is the right solution at the right time to address Appalachia’s current and future energy needs, with the key components and heft to deliver a sustainable solution at scale,” said Sid Sinha, CFO of OWS. 
Based in Warren, Ohio, Oil Well Shares is an exploration and production company active in the Marcellus-Utica oil and gas producing shale of Pennsylvania and Ohio for more than a century.
Formed in 2009, OYA Renewables is a New York-based developer of commercial, industrial and utility-scale solar projects in New York, Minnesota and Ontario.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/10/doe-announces-31-finalists-for-100000-prize-for-community-solar-projects-and-programs/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022","DOE announces 31 finalists for $100,000 prize for community solar projects and programs","The Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar is a $100,000 prize competition that recognizes community solar projects and programs that use or develop best practices to increase equitable access to community solar for subscribers and their communities.
Community solar is any solar project or purchasing program in which the energy from a solar project flows to multiple customers such as individuals, businesses, nonprofits, and other groups within a certain geographic area. It is a solution for those who can’t afford to go solar on their own, those who don’t own a rooftop, or those whose rooftops are not applicable for solar.
The concept of community solar is taking off in the United States. In August pv magazine reported that the community solar market in the United States would add at least 7 GWdc in existing markets over the next five years, based on a report by Wood Mackenzie and the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).
Despite the growth of community solar projects, the concept is still relatively new, and programs vary significantly in their structure, implementation, and benefits. The Sunny Awards intend to move community solar beyond the nascent stage by providing a blueprint for community solar developers, state energy offices, utilities, and others to help achieve the National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP) target to power the equivalent of five million households with community solar by 2025, generating $1 billion in electricity bill savings.
The Sunny Awards, which were announced in July, offer a $100,000 grand prize to the top teams, plus an additional $1,000 to the recently announced finalists. Finalists are chosen for the effective way in which they equitably deliver the specific, meaningful benefits of community solar identified by NCSP.
Community solar projects and programs eligible for the award must be able to prove that they are providing meaningful benefits in at least one of the following primary meaningful benefit categories:
Meaningful benefit category special recognition will be given to the top three competitors in each of the primary meaningful benefit categories above, as well as in community engagement and impact.
Applicants were asked to submit a narrative application along with a set of verifiable supporting evidence for either a community solar project (individual community solar installations) or program (state, district, territory, or utility-run initiatives that enable, incentivize, or otherwise support the development of multiple community solar projects within a specific jurisdiction).
The official rules are available on the HeroX platform.
In the finalist stage, 31 competitors were selected by DOE reviewers and each will receive a cash prize of $1,000. These competitors will advance in the prize challenge. The panel of external reviewers used a pre-determined and publicly available set of scoring guidance to select winners for two types of Grand Prize awards.
All finalists that meet eligibility requirements across two or more meaningful benefit award categories will compete for a Sunny Grand Prize Award for Equitable Community Solar. Up to five projects or programs that demonstrate significant achievement in delivering meaningful benefits across multiple categories will be selected as Sunny Grand Prize Award winners and will be eligible to receive $10,000 in prize money.
Furthermore, DOE will present non-monetary awards that recognize up to three programs or projects in each of the meaningful benefits categories, including the two innovation categories.
Winners of both the Sunny Grand Prize Awards and Meaningful Benefit Special Recognition Awards will be publicly announced by DOE in early 2023 and will be invited to participate in a series of DOE-hosted webinars and events on community solar best practices.
Winners’ best practices will also be used to develop a collection of case studies to encourage greater adoption of these practices.

(ESS), a manufacturer of iron flow batteries, was retained by the Michigan utility Consumers Energy to supply batteries to a solar-plus-energy storage microgrid project powering a gas compression facility.
Consumers Energy will deploy the company’s Energy Warehouse solution to deliver a 20-plus- year long-duration energy system. The project is intended to help the utility achieve goals laid out in the Michigan Department of Environment’s Energy Storage Roadmap, which aims to see the installation of 1 GW of energy storage projects by 2025 and 4 GW by 2040.
Using abundant iron, salt and water resources in its electrolyte, the ESS Energy Warehouse is an environmentally safe long-duration storage solution that is suited for daily time-shifting renewable energy. In this instance, the Energy Warehouse manages the gas compression facility’s daily demand charges and balances the intermittency of renewables on a constrained grid.
“ESS is proud to provide our safe and non-toxic battery storage system to a leading utility provider in the Midwest serving millions of customers,” said Hugh McDermott, senior vice president of business development and sales at ESS.
In a recent interview with pv magazine USA at the RE+ conference, McDermott said the long-duration energy storage market is ripe to expand its manufacturing base in various markets such as Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, and California.
In the U.S., ESS is seeking to expand its manufacturing to 25 MW per year by the end of 2022, and to over 100 MW by the end of 2023, while the company is also flexing to produce 400 MW per year in Australia.
ESS aspires to produce at 750 MW per year, which was mentioned on the company’s Q2 22 earnings call. The company sees demand reaching far beyond 1 GW per year of manufacturing capacity. The Long Duration Energy Storage Council issued a report suggesting that under the right conditions, 1.5 to 2 TW/85 to 140 TWh of long duration batteries could be deployed by 2040.
Consumers Energy’s parent company CMS Energy published a 2022 ESG and sustainability report following a 2021 IRP that calls for a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions from its utilities’ service territory by 2025, including the retirement of its 1.88 GW coal generation fleet by 2025, and the installation of 8 GW of new solar capacity by 2040 to drive $650 million in customer savings to ratepayers. In that timeframe the utility’s generation mix will shift from its current mix of 39% natural gas, 19% coal generation, 11% renewable energy and 8% nuclear power to a power generation mix comprised of 63% renewable energy, 12% energy storage, 10% natural gas and 15% customer saving programs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/10/are-sheep-eligible-for-the-itc/,"MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Are sheep eligible for the ITC?,"pv magazine USA published an interview with BayWa r.e., discussing recent developments they have made in managing the sheep that assist with site upkeep. During the course of that interview, an interesting question arose: “Are sheep Investment Tax Credit (ITC) eligible?”
While BayWa r.e. didn’t share their opinion on the topic (our interview discussed O&M, not finance), they did share important data that pretty clearly shows how using sheep for solar O&M, rather than commercial mowers, is in the best interest of the project.
First, some numbers:
For the 270 MWdc solar project highlighted in the article above, BayWa r.e. estimated a need for approximately 900 sheep, which included 875 ewes, and 25 rams. Assuming that each ewe costs $350, and each ram costs $600, the cost for all the sheep totals $321,250. If we add the additional cost of running water lines to the 1,800-acre facility ($101,673), we arrive at $422,923. Some might argue that these costs should qualify as an expense, which is eligible for the ITC.
Considering the facility is 270 MW, the cost of the sheep is a trivial $0.0015/W, or less than two tenths of a penny per watt. If the project were to claim these costs for the 30% ITC, the financial benefits would total $126,876; a small drop in the bucket for a project worth a quarter of a billion dollars.
On the other hand, that’s a solid base salary for an engineer. And so we had to ask: Are sheep eligible for the ITC? For most tax professionals, the answer was a fairly consistent “no.”
David Burton, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, described the logic as follows:
“The same reason a lawn mower is not eligible.  Sheep are not “integral” to the generation of electricity in the view of the tax law.  Someone does need to cut the grass or else it would grow so tall as to interfere with generation, but land and transmission are also not “integral” in the view of the tax law, and those are both needed for a functioning project; integral has a particular nuance in the tax law.”
We asked Burton if sheep might be considered eligible for an incentive in cases where the sheep were essential to the viability of a project, or to get through local zoning. He suggested that the question is complicated, but he leaned toward “no”, since generally, zoning costs are not eligible.
Amusingly, Burton added, “If the sheep manure was collected and fed into a power plant that converted the manure to electricity, then the power plant would be ITC eligible.  This is called open-loop biomass.”
On LinkedIn, Tax & Energy Lawyer Brian Treby gave a broader perspective on the types of questions surrounding the issues. He directly followed up with pv magazine USA to add some nuance to the discussion:

 
The first point Treby made was that this is a question to leave to the IRS and Treasury, but that a project owner should ask first before jumping out too far.
Then he offered a masterclass in how to approach the situation:
An adage in tax, “pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered” – unfortunately, somewhere out there a taxpayer will take the position on his/her return to include sheep in the basis calculation for ITC. Your sources seem to say clearly, “no, don’t do it”. My comment supposes they already have and asks questions, the answers depending might soften that precarious position. Having civil tax liability is different than tax fraud and sometimes showing vagaries to the trier of fact can reduce the penalties to a misguided taxpayer, especially where facts and circumstances may be considered.
Treby followed with a second comment:
A taxpayer’s patriotic duty and obligation is to pay all the taxes owed but not one cent more. If a taxpayer’s position can be justified because sheep are used at a certain time in a project’s lifecycle or financed one way versus another, and the law is ambiguous on the matter, a taxpayer’s intent to comply with the tax code can help mitigate the specter of fraud and even carry the day in audit or even court.
Professionals like Treby say that they ‘practice’ law or accounting or medicine. This is out of respect for the breadth of their field, and also because these trades are constantly evolving. Oftentimes this evolution results from private parties who follow their duty and push for definitive answers.
One path to supporting the particular position such as ‘sheep are eligible property’ is to request a Private Letter ruling on the matter. Treby notes that these letters can be time consuming, expensive to develop, and stressful when going through the process, but it is sometimes necessary for justice to be served when the Treasury department oversteps its authority.
In one example, commercial solar rooftops using bifacial solar panels that install a highly reflective white roof can claim the portion of the white roof in addition to a standard roof installation under the tax credit.
For what it’s worth, Silicon Ranch does deploy sheep at their facilities – many of which the company owns – and they do not include them in their ITC considerations.
The company notes that the ITC eligibility of the flock is less of a concern than being good land stewards and owners of livestock. Their Regenerative Energy land stewardship program will be covered later by pv magazine USA.

 
Nick de Vries, senior vice president of technology & asset management at Silicon Ranch, says “We have to think about water sources, predations, animal health, and forage levels.  This is critical to get right, and is ultimately what will dictate whether your grazing program is successful or not.”
“On some of our solar farms we staff shepherds, have veterinary bills, breed sheep, and invest in infrastructure to support our land management activities. Though it’s related to our core business of renewable energy generation, we view it as an agribusiness within the company. Similar to projects where we have our own O&M staff who provide services to the entity that owns our solar power projects within Silicon Ranch.”
Kevin S. Krause, an auditor in the rates and tariff section of the Michigan Public Service Commission, responded to the ITC question by asking whether it’s actually in the best interest of the electricity rate payers.
In the Twitter thread, Krause noted that before any considerations were made, he would first need to see data. “Show me where sheep have been used, what they cost, what was the control group for comparison, and if all that pencils, why would I expect it to work here.  I’d want at least three years of data.”

If there were a shift to this “new technology,” the auditors group would want to see evidence that this tool is both better than existing tools (gas lawn mowers), and better than other new innovative technologies, like robotic electric mowers. At Baywa r.e.’s facility, gas mowers turned their rocky terrain into projectiles, destroying 1035 panels worth $306,000. Their sheep damaged only two.
The regulator also noted that there isn’t really a place to record sheep ownership and operating costs in the Uniform System of Accounts form the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Taking all of these details into consideration, Krause sees sheep as a cost effective agrivoltaic O&M solution, under the right circumstances.
So, while sheep might occupy a very important position in the agrivoltaic niche, they’re not yet considered fundamental to the upkeep of solar power facilities, according to the Internal Revenue Service. However, from a professional perspective using sheep to maintain solar assets is still a fairly new concept and as we were taught by BayWa r.e., there are compelling financial and performance-related benefits that sheep provide.
So… who’s throwing down on the pv magazine USA IRS’ Private Letter, “Sheep for ITC” GoFundme?

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/10/automation-tool-helps-speed-rooftop-solar-connection-to-the-grid/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Automation tool helps speed rooftop solar connection to the grid,"As solar energy ramps up in the United States, interconnection queues have grown to almost unmanageable levels. The growth will continue, as the U.S. strives to meet the Biden administration’s goal of 80% clean energy by 2030. In January, a PV Intel report found no less than 639 GWac of large-scale solar projects in the queues of the seven wholesale power markets, plus TVA, the Bonneville Power Administration, and two of the nation’s largest investor-owned utilities (Florida Power & Light and Southern Company). Comparing that to the queues that PV Intel tracked in 2019, it shows a more than 3x increase.
While queues to connect large utility-scale projects slow the ramp up of clean energy in the U.S., the queue for rooftop solar is substantial as well. Utilities are receiving hundreds of applications a week to connect these systems to the grid, with no sign of slowing.
The rate of solar adoption is a good problem to have, but the increasing number of interconnection requests is a new challenge for utilities. Each application received requires a technical evaluation to assess the potential grid impacts of the new solar installation, looking at how the connection will affect power quality and infrastructure assets.
Right now utilities are evaluating interconnection applications manually, which means there is increased demand on distribution engineers. Some also rely on hosting capacity analysis to provide public visibility into the capacity of their networks to accommodate solar, however, these maps do not answer the question of whether individual solar applications can interconnect to the grid, as every interconnection can trigger unique local distribution system constraints.
Grid researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) partnered with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) to look at a way to streamline the interconnection process.
“Our project team set out to understand how a utility can assess solar applications in a fast, robust fashion while still being technically thorough,” said Killian McKenna, a senior researcher in NREL’s Grid Planning and Analysis Center and the principal investigator on the effort.
The team came up with an automation tool, PRECISE (preconfiguring and controlling inverter set-points), which performs fast and automated interconnection assessments and integrates with SMUD’s existing business interconnection workflow.
“PV interconnection evaluation is becoming a time-consuming process as each proposed solar power system must be individually reviewed in detail to make sure it works safely with our grid,” said Sheikh Hassan, a principal distribution engineer at SMUD. “PRECISE significantly reduces this evaluation time by instantly determining optimal inverter settings for a given location.”
PRECISE went live at SMUD on Feb. 26, 2022, and has processed over 1,700 applications in its first six months of operation, an average of 13 applications each business day and as many as nearly 30 applications in one day. The tool itself can scale to process any number of applications. Through automation, data integration and fast computing techniques, PRECISE can easily handle hundreds of applications daily.
“This is a tremendous result for our team and has ensured staff gets the help they need while speeding up the interconnection process and lowering costs for our customers,” said Sruthi Nadimpalli, an information technology (IT) project manager with SMUD. This functionality won PRECISE an R&D 100 Award in 2019, has helped customers safely and efficiently install more solar energy in SMUD’s service areas, and has worldwide potential.
PRECISE automates the modeling of all of SMUD’s 40,000-plus distribution secondaries—or the low-voltage distribution system connected to houses and rooftop solar—and pulls in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data as required. The tool also takes into account local irradiance measurements across SMUD’s service area and creates mathematical models of each incoming PV system. To do this, it models every component of the solar panels and their orientations, as well as the inverters and smart inverter capabilities, to make the assessment.
The process begins as soon as an interconnection application is received by the utility when PRECISE pulls in data and updates business teams downstream (i.e., planning, metering, line design) once its calculations are complete.
To handle requests to interconnect solar power systems larger than the grid can accommodate in a specific location PRECISE automates an assessment of what size system the grid can accommodate and how advanced inverter functions can support approval. In these scenarios planning engineers manage this information and can work with the customer to find a solution to enable the PV system to successfully interconnect.
For every residential solar PV interconnection application, PRECISE assesses the impact of the interconnection proposal and evaluates the need to use smart inverter functions.
“The task to determine optimal smart inverter settings in order to maximize our PV hosting capacity will become more complex and time intensive as the number of PV interconnection applications increase,” Hassan said. Smart inverter functions can be the deciding factor on whether an interconnection must be downsized or not, and PRECISE enables that evaluation, leveraging inverter functions as needed to help accommodate more solar onto the grid.
In developing PRECISE, NREL worked closely with a SMUD team that included more than 20 personnel. The project was the first automation of the technical interconnection evaluation process of its kind, one that could serve as a template for many utilities to use to automate the evaluation of new interconnection requests.
“PRECISE is a cutting-edge PV interconnection evaluation tool that enables utilities to cost-effectively host more solar,” Hassan said.
NREL and SMUD are exploring future collaborations, now that PRECISE has linked the diverse utility data sets (e.g., meter data, GIS, interconnection applications) needed for automated evaluation of new distributed energy resources. PRECISE could now be applied to large commercial solar sites, to assess battery energy storage or to evaluate the impact of electric vehicles connected to the grid.
“The future for grid planning and operations is increased automation for evaluating the health, impact and opportunities of increasing levels of distributed energy resources,” McKenna said. “PRECISE is a first step of many to reach that future.”

NOMAD, a newcomer to the battery scene, recently unveiled a portfolio of utility-scale transportable battery energy storage solutions. Its plug-and-play solution combines a fully enclosed trailer chassis with high-density lithium-ion battery cells and a proprietary docking system. There are three versions of the system: a 1 MW/ 2 MWh unit called “The Traveler,” a 500 kW/1.3 MWh unit called “The Voyager,” and a 250 kW/ 660 kWh unit called “The Rover.”
The mobile units – when paired with the company’s patent-pending PowerDock  system for easy connection/ disconnection, setup, upkeep, and secure system control – allow the fleet to arrive on-site in a completely weather-tight enclosure, with all wires contained within its unique interconnection system. All NOMAD systems also share a common interconnection design, allowing a single unit platform to be expanded with more PowerDocks. Each version uses lithium-ion cells made by KORE Power.
NOMAD units are said to combine the benefits of a fixed-site energy storage system that can be relocated, “enabling a single unit to serve multiple locations for seasonal, intermittent (outages) or temporary use (capital deferral), increasing asset utilization versus a fixed asset.”
The units have a range of use cases, including power backup and emergency response and seasonal load mitigation. The company says customers well suited to the technology include utilities, C&I entities, disaster relief organizations, and renewable generation assets.
NOMAD has also revealed that it has sold “the industry’s first mobile energy storage unit with 2 MWh capacity” to Vermont-based utility Green Mountain Power (GMP). Mari McClure, the CEO of GMP, said The Traveler offers a range of applications and provides another important innovation to join GMP’s storage fleet, increasing resilience and reliability while lowering costs for customers.
NOMAD Transportable Power Systems is based in Waterbury, Vermont, founded by KORE Power.
