https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/29/developer-begins-construction-on-800-mw-illinois-project-with-u-s-made-components/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ILLINOIS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 29, 2023",Developer begins construction on 800 MW Illinois project with U.S. made components,"Swift Current Energy, a Boston-based solar and wind project developer, has kicked off construction on the Double Black Diamond solar project in Illinois, an 800 MW(dc) utility solar project that is vying for the recognition of being one of the top three largest U.S. solar projects.
The project is slated for commercial operations by Fall of 2024, and when operational will be owned by the developer. First Solar is providing 1.6 million U.S.-made solar panels and Nextracker is supplying its U.S.-made tracking systems for the project.
The developer recently tapped McCarthy Building Companies as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor on the massive project. During construction, expected to last 14 months, the companies will retain 435 construction workers for the Double Black Diamond project.
The midwestern project checks off a few additional boxes for Inflation Reduction Act initiatives and rebates. The project has set apprenticeship, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring goals, which are being facilitated with local unions for carpenters, laborers, operators, electricians, and crew leads.
In partnership with local unions, McCarthy will train workers who are inexperienced in utility-scale solar construction to assist with future workforce needs and accommodate the exponential regional and national growth of the solar industry.
Once operational, Double Black Diamond will provide enough clean energy equivalent to more than 85,000 Illinois households per year.
In collaboration with Constellation Energy, the City of Chicago will be a key offtake customer. Starting in 2025, the city will partially source its large energy uses such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport with renewable energy from Double Black Diamond. The project is expected to bring $100 million in tax revenue to the Counties of Sangamon and Morgan counties, where the project is located.
“As one of Double Black Diamond’s largest end users, the City of Chicago is proud to support a project that will generate solar energy right here in Illinois and will be constructed according to our shared labor and equity goals,” said Angela Tovar, chief sustainability officer for Chicago’s Office of Climate and Environmental Equity.
Additional offtake customers for the large project include State Farm Insurance and PPG, a producer of paints, coatings and specialty materials. State Farm will procure about 103,000 MWh of clean energy per year from Constellation as part of the insurance company’s continued efforts to reduce environmental footprint.
Formed in 2016, Swift Current Energy is a utility-scale developer whose management team has developed a combined 10 GW of renewable energy projects over its career. In April 2021, the company was acquired in a majority stake transaction by Buckeye Partners and Nala Renewables, both of which are backed by IFM Investors, an Australian infrastructure fund manager with $68.4 billion of assets under management.
A midwestern rivalry has also emerged for the development of the largest U.S. utility solar project. Savion, a Shell Energy-backed solar and wind developer, is constructing its own 800 MW utility solar project, Oak Run Solar, located in Madison County, Ohio. If approved, construction on the project will begin this year, with commercial operations coming online in phases starting in early 2025. The solar project will also include 300 MW of Tesla energy storage systems, which is expected to have a 20-year lifespan.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/29/hitachi-to-supply-converter-stations-to-multi-state-2-4-gw-power-line/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,CALIFORNIA,UTAH",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 29, 2023",Hitachi to supply converter stations to multi-state 2.4 GW power line,"The state of California’s bold initiative to procure 15.5 GW of solar resources for the California Public Utilities Commission through 2027 positions the state to rapidly improve distributed generation resources. It will also boost power transmission lines to allow for gigawatts of solar from across state lines to reach the Golden State’s metropolitan markets. And with the increasing wildfires, the state continues to innovate with new technologies to upgrade existing infrastructure.
This week, power and industrial systems distributor Hitachi Energy was selected by the Intermountain Power Agency in Utah to supply two high voltage direct current (HVDC) converter stations to modernize the Intermountain Power Project (IPP) power transmission link project between Utah and the Los Angeles metropolitan area of California, increasing system reliability and efficiency.
The IPP system transmits up to 2.4 GW of electricity over 488 miles from Delta, Utah to Adelanto, California. The transmission project is important for meeting demand for power in the southern California region and to shift toward more renewable energy resources entering the market from across the Southwest region.
Hitachi Energy will supply two converter stations to replace existing high-voltage converter stations first built in 1986 on a 4,614-acre power transmission and distribution facility site near Delta, Utah. Hitachi was an original equipment supplier early on to the IPP power infrastructure site in 1986 when connected to a coal-fired generating facility.
The order is part of “IPP Renewed,” a project that will retire an existing coal-fired generation plant in Utah and introduce new renewable generation units using a 840 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer to enter operations by 2026. IPP will use renewable energy to produce hydrogen as fuel in the plant, in one of the industry’s largest planned green hydrogen production systems.

The new generating units will be designed to use 30% hydrogen fuel at start-up, transitioning to 100%  hydrogen fuel by 2045 at the 100 metric tons facility as the IPP site transitions from fossil fuel resources to hydrogen plus on-site renewable power over the coming decade. IPP will store hydrogen produced in underground salt caverns for use as fuel to drive electricity-generating turbines.
“We’re pleased to be working with Hitachi Energy once again to further strengthen the power grid,” said Cameron Cowan, general manager of Intermountain Power Agency.  “The Intermountain Power Project represents nearly four decades of successful regional energy cooperation. Modernizing our Southern Transmission System will enable many more decades of delivering the energy resources that our participants want and need.”
Quanta Services, a power transmission engineering firm, partnered with Hitachi Energy to provide a turnkey project solution for the IPP modernization effort.  Quanta will manage the HVDC construction and building installation at the Delta and Adelanto terminal sites.
Plans for IPP Renewed have been in development for over a decade by IPP participants. Going forward, these entities will continue to play key roles in the implementation of the project:
The Intermountain Power Agency has kept to a project schedule with construction, supply and financing milestones along the way:
According to the Utah Foundation, the IPP modernization effort has contributed to an annual financial contribution of $866 million to the state of Utah, providing 4,600 non-farm jobs and $222 million in wages to contracted workers. The IPA has paid approximately $700 million in direct tax payments to Utah and Utah communities.
The construction of the hydrogen, power transmission and infrastructure system upgrade is forecast to employ 800 workers with peak employment in mid-2023, while by operations in 2025 will help preserve operational jobs that would have been lost from the coal generator’s shutdown, according to the power project’s website.
In mid-2022, the IPP project procured $800 million of 3.57% weighted municipal bonds to finance the first phases of construction, according to the 2022 annual report for the IPA.
Aces Delta LLC, a JV of Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development, is the hydrogen supply and energy storage project partner for the IPP project, called the Advanced Clean Energy Storage (ACES) hub.   Mitsubishi  and Magnum in June 2022 closed a $504.4 million loan guarantee from U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) to fund the ACES hub, which is set to become the world’s largest industrial green hydrogen facility once completed, the companies said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/29/giving-women-support-to-engineer-the-renewable-energy-future/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 29, 2023",Giving women support to engineer the renewable energy future,"I could count on one hand the number of fellow female engineers I graduated with from Marquette University. This mirrors the demographics across the country where women account for only 14% of engineers and only 8% of the nation’s electrical engineering workforce.

We’re simultaneously facing another not-so-quiet crisis: our nation is in dire need of more power engineers to do the difficult work of interconnection studies, maintenance, and operation of our quickly fraying electricity grid, which is growing more complex by the day. Gigawatts of renewable energy generation projects are stuck in interconnection queues, waiting for their turn to bring us the cleaner energy system we needed yesterday.
Electrical and power engineers are not the only ones in the energy industry in very short supply. There is also a dire need for more trained electricians to do the critical work of wiring the solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries we need to make the transition to a renewable energy system. The gender disparity is also stark for trained electricians with only 2% of those employed being women.
We can solve both problems at once: recruiting more women into the engineering workforce and making more opportunities available in electrical engineering programs. This will foster true gender equity and help solve our current shortage of qualified people doing the hard work of transitioning our power grid from one dependent on fossil fuels to one built upon a distributed network of non-emitting solar, wind and energy storage projects.

My own path to electrical engineering was successful because of well-timed interventions from adults who saw my potential. When I was in high school, my chemistry teacher noticed that I enjoyed math, problem solving, and science – and he suggested that I attend an engineering camp during the summer. I had a basketball tournament the weekend before camp started, so I put my basketball bag on one shoulder and my camp bag on the other and set off to give it a try. Sure, it was challenging and a bit nerve-racking at first to step into a new experience, but that small leap of faith put me on a career path to working on nuclear power plants, mission critical facilities, airplane screen displays, and now energy storage systems that store solar energy and stabilize electricity grids. Our storage systems help fill the intermittency gap of renewable energy sources – ensuring that the energy captured before the sun goes down can be saved for later, when the demand for electricity rises. Without the nudge to give an engineering camp a try, I wouldn’t have known about the fascinating and impactful engineering careers like the one I have now. Because of preconceptions of what girls can do, we leave so much potential skill and brainpower untapped, and we need everyone onboard to make the energy transition happen.
That’s not to say there won’t be challenges in the way. When I enrolled at Marquette University, I was the only engineer on the school’s basketball team. I wasn’t getting much playing time on the team and engineering proved difficult at times.  A few months in, I called my mom, ready to quit both. She gave me the advice I needed to persevere; in basketball, she said to keep up my training and wait it out. Sure enough, by the end of the season, my hard work and dedication paid off and I started getting playing time. During my senior year, I was captain of the basketball team, learning the valuable leadership skills that would serve me professionally for years to come. My mom also encouraged me to find tutoring and a study group for my engineering work. I found other students who stayed as part of my support network for years. No one expects you to know everything all the time. That’s true for school and it’s true once you enter your profession. Find mentors and ask for the support you need.
Engineering careers provide steady, high paying employment. Electrical engineers are going to have plenty of work for decades to come in the energy sector alone. Engineering training also provides highly transferable skills: Henry Ford and Soichiro Honda were both engineers before they went into business and management.
Giving opportunities to girls and young women to attend camps and experience engineering requires involvement from all fronts. First, we must create opportunities for girls in middle school and high school to try Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). In addition, we need to support young women to overcome the fear that comes with trying something new, especially skills and interests that society has cast aside as “nerdy” or just for boys. It may sound trivial, but that kind of mentality and stereotyping can be a big hurdle in preventing young women from seeing themselves as engineers. So often fear holds us back. It whispers doubt into our ears at every possible turn, keeping us from opportunities that we deserve.
My advice is this: don’t let fear get in the way. That’s not to say things won’t be challenging at times, but I’m living proof that it can and should be pushed through. And I hope to see many more young women enter the field to engineer the renewable energy solutions of today and tomorrow.
Let’s set up young women for the best possible success and show them the immense opportunities that await them in engineering and renewable energy. Get girls inspired, get them the support they need, and let’s ensure that we shine a bright light on the girl power needed to build the clean energy future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/29/california-tops-the-virtual-power-plant-market/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 29, 2023",California tops the virtual power plant market,"California dwarfs all virtual power plant (VPP) markets in North America, housing 24% of projects in the region, according to Wood Mackenzie’s ‘North America VPP market: H1 2023’ report.
“VPPs continue to receive growing attention from the energy industry. Our new market study unveiled California as the clear leader, containing more VPPs than the three follow-up U.S. states combined,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of Grid Edge at Wood Mackenzie.
VPPs are aggregations of distributed energy resources (DERs) that provide grid services to utilities and wholesale markets. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) says a VPP is a virtual aggregation of DERs like solar, energy storage, EV chargers and demand responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). Jigar Shah, director of the DOE LPO, sees VPPs as providing more than just decarbonization and grid services, increasingly giving grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. He noted in the article Real barriers to virtual power plants that “by deploying grid assets more efficiently an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.”
Wood Mackenzie’s VPP report is based on an analysis of a database of over 500 VPP projects to determine how to define VPPs, as well as to find geographic, technological and customer trends. According to its findings, half of all VPP projects that incorporate electric vehicles (EVs) are located in California, and 41% of those incorporate behind-the-meter batteries.
Wood Mackenzie determined that VPPs are highly market dependent. The top four states by VPP deployment, California, New York, Texas, and Massachusetts, are located within an organized retail power market, but also offer aggregator-friendly standard offer programs for distributed energy resource (DER) capacity. The California solar market was recently dealt a serious blow in December when the California Public Utilities Commission adopted Net Energy Metering 3.0 . As is often the case in the technology world, the U.S. will be watching California’s response to the rollout of NEM 3.0 as an indicator for how their state’s respective utility commissions will adopt rulemaking changes and how its market participants pivot around new rules. Many solar companies see California as a market ripe for VPPs. For example, PearlX, self-described as a flexible energy provider, recently announced the launch of a multi-family virtual power plant (VPP) service in California dubbed ‘Flexifornia’. 
Utilities are also seeing the advantages of VPPs. Swell Energy, a VPP and DER integrator, partnered with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District to aggregate 20 MWh of residential battery capacity and 10 MW of co-located solar power capacity into a residential VPP system.

The landscape of VPP operators is highly concentrated, with seven having over 1 GW of disclosed capacity under management. The top four, CPower, Enel, AutoGrid, and Voltus, have portfolios greater than 4 GW in North America, which would place each within the top ten largest independent power producers in the U.S. backseat to the supply side. We are seeing that change, a trend that will accelerate given transmission constraints, generator interconnection delays, and regulator recognition that demand response is an essential tool to prevent grid failure,” Hertz-Shargel said.

According to the report, EVs have not reached the level of penetration in VPPs that behind-the-meter batteries have. Nearly all participation today involves charging curtailment, with vehicle-to-grid functionality remaining at the pilot phase. This may change, however, as EVs and EV charging systems proliferate. President Biden set a goal of building out a national network of 500,000 EV chargers, which got a boost with the announced funding to accelerate the creation of zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) corridors that expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure. A recent Wood Mackenzie report forecasts that the fast EV charging market will grow sixtyfold by 2050. Such growth will bring opportunities for EVs to shore up VPPs.
The Wood Mackenzie analysis found that among the 50% of VPPs that incorporate EVs outside of California, very few are market integrated, with 68% participating in utility residential demand response or managed charging programs.

“Considerable first-mover advantage therefore remains to bring EV flexible capacity to utilities and wholesale markets. This is particularly true for public EV charging stations and commercial and municipal fleet depots, many of which will be deployed with collocated storage and will be capable of providing advanced grid services,” Hertz-Shargel concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/29/dsd-completes-1-85-mw-solar-project-for-retirement-home-first-in-virginia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,VIRGINIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 29, 2023","DSD completes 1.85 MW solar project for retirement home, first in Virginia","DSD Renewables, the New York-based commercial and industrial solar developer, has completed installation of a 1.85 MW ground-mounted solar project at the Village at Orchard Ridge, a National Lutheran Community & Services (NLCS) retirement home in Shenandoah Valley, Virginia.
Located along the Blue Ridge Mountains, the scenic project marks the developer’s first project developed in Virginia, expanding DSD’s footprint into 23 states.
The Shenandoah Valley project is located adjacent to the NLCS’ retirement facility complex and is a part of the organization’s commitment of achieving 100% clean energy usage across its facilities. The project will meet 85% of the community’s energy needs and produce 2,396 MWh of clean energy each year, the equivalent of 330 homes.
NLCS is a faith-based, not-for-profit group of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) that operates retirement homes and nursing care facilities in Maryland and Virginia.
Construction of the project lasted for about nine months and was also the first solar project for a local Virginia utility company, the developer said, overcoming interconnection limitations and designing a project site that complimented the aesthetics of the retirement community.
The Shenandoah Valley project uses SMA Solar inverters and Shoals Technologies’ BLA Disconnect 1500V load balancing systems.
“We believe that ‘Leadership by Doing’ is the best way to make a meaningful impact on our community,” said Richard Mazza, chief financial officer and executive vice president of business development at NLCS. “This project is a testament to that mindset. Not only does it reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs, but it also gives our residents an opportunity to be proactive in environmental initiatives. We’re happy to serve as a model to other Life Plan Communities of what’s possible when it comes to what many non-profits may consider beyond their reach or expertise.”
Over the last three years, Virginia pivoted its energy policy, centering squarely on solar and wind energy buildout. The Department of Environmental Quality set a target of 5.5 GW of renewable energy, at least 3 GW of which should be under development by 2022. In the last two years, the state has deployed gigawatt-scale capacity in solar, dwarfing years past.
Virginia targets 30% renewable energy by 2030, and 100% by 2050. While much of the buildout thus far has been at the utility-scale, the state also has significant incentives for solar and energy storage at the residential and commercial levels. 
Based in Schenectady, N.Y., DSD’s origins date back to 2012 as the former GE Solar business, which rebranded as Distributed Solar Development LLC in 2019.  In mid-2020, DSD was acquired by BlackRock Real Assets with a $250 million equity raise.  Now in 23 states, the company has developed C&I projects for Home Depot in eight states, as well as IKEA, Partners Healthcare, MGM and T-Mobile, among others.
