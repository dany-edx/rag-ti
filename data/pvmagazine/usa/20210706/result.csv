The concept of a ‘zero energy home’ is one that efficiently uses energy directly produced on-site to enable energy independence and personal emission reductions. The concept is achieved via ‘active technology’ -generation resources – and ‘passive technology’ – energy efficiency measures.
Q CELLS’ role in the partnership is to provide solar modules and energy storage systems (ESS) to customers, as well as Q CELLS’ home energy management system, Q.ONNECT. The software/hardware combination therein allows homeowners to collect and manage all data on generation, storage, and total usage in real time. Q.ONNECT also provides an optimized ESS operation service that utilizes expected charge amount data and local weather forecasts.
When linked to Samsung Electronics’ SmartThings platform, the data will give homeowners control to optimize home energy use. The platform can link to Samsung and non-Samsung devices for centralized appliance management. The service is intended to give homeowners a clearer view of how energy is consumed by heat pumps and appliances, letting them set up a more sustainable energy management plan.
In addition, the two companies plan to develop business cooperation such as joint sales, mainly in the U.S. and Europe.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/06/vde-acquires-renewable-energy-test-center/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 6, 2021",VDE acquires Renewable Energy Test Center,"VDE, the parent company of VDE Americas, has acquired a 70% stake in Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC), a certification and testing company that has become a leading independent lab for testing photovoltaic and battery products.
This acquisition serves as an extension of the partnership that RETC and VDE have had for the better part of a decade now, according to RETC President and CEO, Cherif Kedir. He also told pv magazine that, while his company has had other partnership and evolution opportunities in the past, they are a testing and certification lab at heart, and maintaining the independence they were founded upon was a paramount concern.
“The difference now is that we have access to the entire VDE infrastructure and experts worldwide,” Kadir said. “Any sort of expansion or growth, these things take time. With VDE now, we have immediate access to facilities, expertise, and infrastructure that existed for years. There is a lot of potential for us.”
From VDE’s perspective, the acquisition of RETC aligned well with the company’s global testing strategy, specifically in developing a network of testing facilities across the planet.
Kedir and Sedgwick both stressed the importance that RETC’s independence as a testing and certification lab plays in their future collaboration. In short, the acquisition presents an expansion of opportunities and capabilities for RETC, with access to more resources, funding and experienced personnel, while RETC brings to VDE a proven-quality track record in testing and data collection for solar and energy storage systems.
By keeping RETC’s work entirely free from any influence or pressure from VDE or any other body, the results of their testing are unbiased and reliable, and thus more valuable to project developers and investors, said RETC.
“The whole transaction was, it’s such a cliche to say, but, amazingly synergistic,” said President of VDE Americas, John Sedgwick.
According to both Kedir and Sedgwick, a big value draw that RETC brought to VDE was RETC’s Photovoltaic Module Index (PVMI). The service is an entirely independent module ranking system that scores modules based on an exhaustive list of credentials, from performance in damp heat, to performance in thermal cycling sequences, to hail and other extreme weather resilience. The index is structured in such a way that shows off what each module excels at.
In 2020, only five modules of the more than 300 that RETC tested achieved the company’s high performer designation, Kadir told pv magazine. The high-performer distinction requires a module to perform at an elite level in every applicable testing metric. The index also has granular data about which modules are top-performers in specific environments with specific project needs.
VDE has already relied on RETC’s PVMI in providing comprehensive assessments of real-hail risk for projects in areas subject to frequent and damaging hail. On their own, VDE developed a financial loss model that assesses historical weather trends in affected locations to estimate and project loss risks at specific return intervals, like risk over 10-, 20-, or 30-year project lifetimes.
By supplementing this model with the PVMI’s hail index, VDE can present to investors and developers a comprehensive risk outline of their investment, with estimated costs and independently-backed performance ratings of their intended hardware.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/06/elon-musk-could-lose-billions-in-tesla-solarcity-acquisition-suit/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 6, 2021",Elon Musk could lose billions in Tesla/SolarCity acquisition suit,"Tesla founder Elon Musk will attend Delaware court this month, as he is the sole remaining defendant in an approximately $2.2 billion lawsuit filed by shareholders. If ruled liable, this judgement would be among the largest ever cast on an individual corporate executive in history. 
The suit alleges that the Tesla’s purchase of major installer SolarCity was an attempt to bailout Musk’s cousin’s struggling company, of which Musk was the largest investor and chairman. The shareholders’ suit also accuses Tesla’s board of having a lax approach to corporate governance. 
Much of this lawsuit revolves around why SolarCity was purchased to begin with. Peter and Lyndon Rive founded SolarCity in 2006 with encouragement from their cousin, Elon Musk. By the time Tesla purchased the company, Musk owned 22.2% and was chairman of the board. Though it had grown to be the largest U.S. installer in 2016, earning record revenues of $730 million, losses were mounting, with $820 million in net losses that year. The company had accumulated more than $1.5 billion in debt by the year of the purchase.  
SolarCity’s business model relied on marketing, spending heavily on advertising and door-to-door sales, all while offering low-priced, no-upfront cost long-term leases. Post-purchase, the strategy changed, as Tesla began to slash marketing costs, moving sales to direct-from-website and in-store sales. Musk noted in a 2019 deposition on the lawsuit that the door-to-door and other sales channel strategies did not match Tesla’s brand. 
Musk also said in the deposition that problems with the Tesla Model 3 caused the company to reassign much of its SolarCity workforce to bolster its vehicle production operations. He could not confirm exactly what portion of the workforce was reassigned. 
Tesla’s power division is now mostly focused on the home energy storage system, PowerWall. The product accounted for the largest portion of the power division’s $1.99 billion in revenue last year. Meanwhile, solar installations have fallen behind, with 205 MW installed in 2020, a fraction of the 803 MW SolarCity deployed in 2016. 
The development of Tesla’s solar roof program has taken things in a different direction than SolarCity’s model. SolarCity installed panels and equipment from top manufacturers, and focused on getting customers signed to long-term leases. Tesla’s solar program now focuses on direct sales and uses proprietary solar tiles in their “solar roof” installations. 
Also included in the purchase of SolarCity was a Buffalo, NY panel manufacturing plant. Tesla aimed for a 1 GW a year of solar production, but its partner, Panasonic, has since walked away from the project. It is now unclear what volume of panels or roof tiles Tesla currently produces at the facility. 
While no investor can argue against the fact Tesla has shown dramatic share growth, the SolarCity deal has not panned out the way some, including Musk, had predicted. In 2016, Musk called the purchase as “pretty transformational,” but now he faces significant potential damages in the July hearing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/06/recycling-a-key-in-the-u-s-quest-for-lithium-ion-battery-supply-chain-relevancy/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 6, 2021",Recycling: a key in the U.S. quest for lithium-ion battery supply chain relevancy,"The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow from $40.5 billion in 2020 to $91.9 billion in 2026, per ResearchandMarkets, as demand for electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and electronics continues to ramp up.  
With this wellspring of battery creation also comes supply-chain and cost issues that may hamper further U.S. growth in the sector. Research groups and U.S. companies are turning to recycling, reuse and resource reduction as solutions to the problem. 
China’s dominance of the lithium-ion supply chain 
Lithium battery growth is a part of national plans to evolve and decarbonize the energy and transportation industry, as evidenced by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) announcing $200 million in funding to support the full value chain of batteries, from raw materials to end-user products such as EVs and battery storage systems. 
DOE and the Biden administration have identified the need to establish a secure end-to-end battery materials and technology supply chain that supports long-term U.S. economic competitiveness, equitable job creation, and national security.
However, currently the U.S. does not have a strong foothold in the global lithium-ion battery production market, with China standing at 75% of total capacity, per a Wood Mackenzie report. China is investing heavily to build out more manufacturing facilities to extend that dominance, as well. 
While the U.S. is making some strides toward manufacturing batteries, they are limping behind in the race for raw materials. China currently has over 80% of the world’s lithium refining capacity, over 60% for cobalt, and more than a third of global nickel refinement, said the report.  
The report projects a need for a 70% rise in U.S. production of nickel by 2040; 200% for cobalt; and 600% for lithium. China has positioned itself well for the future of these resources, increasing ownership of cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, lithium in Chile, and nickel in Indonesia. 
This demand is driving U.S. companies to create innovative methods and build capacities for reusing and recycling these increasingly precious materials.
The current common methods of lithium-ion battery recycling 
Recycling and repurposing of materials is one way U.S. companies are staying competitive in this tightening supply chain. The two most common methods for the reuse of lithium-ion battery material are pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. 
Pyrometallurgy involves the burning batteries to remove unwanted organic materials and plastic. Generally, pyrometallurgy produces just a fraction of the original material, leaving behind copper, or some nickel and cobalt from the cathode. It is typically done in a fossil-fuel powered furnace, and a lot of aluminum and lithium are lost in the process. While the process is not ideal from an energy and materials standpoint, pyrometallurgical smelters exist commonly and are ready to take on the rising supply of end-of-life batteries. 
The other, less common, approach to recycling is called hydrometallurgy. Often called leaching, the process involves soaking the battery cells in acids to dissolve the metals into a solution. This causes a higher amount of useful materials to be drawn out, including lithium. The process is a bit more involved than smelting, and requires the recycler to reprocess the cells, removing plastic casings and draining the charge on the battery.  
U.S. commercial models – Recycle 
GM is now engaged in raw material recovery through recycling and reuse of excess manufacturing scrap. GM battery maker Ultimum has partnered with Li-Cycle to use hydrometallurgy to repurpose scrap materials from their manufacturing process, deriving cobalt, lithium, nickel, and other useful materials. 
Li-Cycle said 95% of the repurposed scrap material can be used in the production of new batteries. About five-to-ten percent of material used in battery production ends up as scrap, said the company. 
Li-Cycle also recycles end-of-life batteries, using a hub-and-spoke model to process the materials, with “easily deployable” spokes set up around a hub facility. The spokes shred the batteries, creating a black mass that is then processed at a hub facility into materials that include the three key materials in focus. The company said it will soon be able to process 20,000 tons of end-of-life batteries per year, once its new operations in Arizona are fully operational. 
Redwood Materials operates in Carson City, Nevada, taking in batteries from the Tesla Gigafactory that do not meet quality standards to hit the road. They employ a combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes to repurpose the battery into lithium carbonate, cobalt sulfate, and nickel sulfate. 
The company said it can recover between 95-98% of a battery’s nickel, cobalt, copper, aluminum, and graphite, and over 80% of its lithium. Their CEO Eric Straubel said the materials can be reused “almost infinitely” as there is no inherent metal degradation to the metal atoms.
National lab efforts – Reuse 
Argonne National Laboratory has been tasked by the DOE with leading the ReCell center, a program dedicated to finding ways to improve lithium-ion recycling techniques.  
A key goal of the center is the support of direct recycling. Rather than smelting or breaking down the materials with acid, direct recycling allows components from the battery with complex nanostructures to be reused. That way, raw materials do not have to go through a costly step in being processed back into useable components. The processes for direct recycling have worked in lab trials, but a scalable economic model has yet to be developed. 
Another method proposed at the ReCell center is changing the design of batteries so that they are optimized for recycling. Currently, batteries are designed to maximize efficiency, not for reuse. Unless there is a financial incentive in place to reduce efficiency for the sake of recyclability, most companies are not expected to make that change. 
One such company supporting this idea of recyclability is Aceleron, who have engineered a simple solution. Most EV batteries have all their cells welded together for a low-cost final product. Aceleron instead connects the cells in a hard-shell case, and each cell is not welded together. This allows a cell to be taken out by removing some nuts and bolts, making it easier for replacement or reuse. 
Alternative materials approaches – Reduce 
Manufacturing methods for batteries using other less hotly-demanded materials are under development, as well. Tesla and VW are both examining using manganese instead of cobalt, a material more abundant, affordable, and stable in price.  
Typical manganese prices can run about $2000 per metric ton, a far cry from cobalt, which has widely ranged from $30,000 to $115,000 per metric ton in the last decade. There are, however, concerns with manganese related to its ability to achieve the same power density as cobalt. It also is less stable in preventing thermal runaway, or fires. 
The reduction in need for cobalt, nickel, and lithium will go a long way toward supporting the U.S. goal of being a global leader in energy storage and electric vehicles. With the stage set for China to dominate the supply chain of these materials for the foreseeable future, continued innovation will be key in achieving decarbonizing our transportation sector and hitting energy storage targets.

Previously undisclosed state records revealed by local press show that seven solar projects have been proposed for development in Louisiana, with a combined capacity roughly five times greater than the state’s entire installed capacity thus far. The projects in question would be developed in Vacherie,  Thibodaux, Bogalusa, Singer and Franklinton.
Three of the projects are slated to be 200 MW in capacity, an unheard of level of development in a state where the combined installed solar capacity currently sits at 190 MW. Those projects would be in Singer, Thibodaux and Bogalusa. Vacherie would be home to three projects, those coming in at 120, MW 90 MW, and 80 MW, respectively. The installation in Franklinton is proposed to be 50 MW.
Proposals say the project in Franklinton and the two smaller ones in Vacherie would be completed in 2023, with the four largest finished in 2024. Each project would support 160 to 300 construction jobs, and, if approved, all seven could be operational between 2023 and 2024.
