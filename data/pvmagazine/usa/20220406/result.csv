Most solar panels today are silicon-based and have a single junction. The upper theoretical limit of energy absorption efficiency for silicon solar cells, called the Shockley-Queisser limit, is about 33.7%.
Currently, Fraunhofer holds the record for commercial silicon single-junction solar cells at about 26%, so there is much room for improvement to hit the limit. But researchers at Arizona State University and the University of Oklahoma may have discovered a way to burst through the theoretical limit by taking advantage of excess heat.
As much as 50% of the energy absorbed by a solar cell is lost as heat. This excess energy comes as a result of the charged particles in the photovoltaic process taking in more energy than is needed to excite an electron and send it on its way as electricity. The teams are developing pathways to build what are called hot carrier solar cells (HCSC) to combat these thermal energy losses and improve efficiency.
HCSC was first conceived decades ago by R.T. Ross and A.J. Nozik. The two researchers theorized that particles carrying excess heat, or hot carriers, could be isolated and stored in a lattice structure that captures the energy. Experiments proved this was possible, but a functional HCSC cell has not yet been built.
New research in the Journal of Photonics for Energy outlines the many conditions that must be met to bring HCSC from theory to practice. The practice involves creating “satellite valleys” in the band structure of semiconductors, where hot carriers can temporarily be stored without energy loss. The satellite valley changes the kinetic energy of the excess heat particles into potential energy, changing the particle from a loss to one that is stored.
The researchers were able to successfully demonstrate storage of heat through the satellite valley effect by using a indium-gallium-arsenide and aluminum (InGaAs/InAlAs) structure.
The researchers noted that the concept is not a complete solution, and efficiently gathering the stored potential energy as electricity requires further testing. But the demonstration of storing this excess energy opens pathways for a technology that might finally overtake the Shockley-Quiesser limit.
Elsewhere, new technologies such as N-TOPCon and heterojunction (HJT) cells are working toward pushing the needle forward for PV efficiency.

Once all of the projects have been completed and energized, Vesper will then use the software to support financial and commercial management of its operational portfolio.
Power Factors’ BluePoint is an asset management software solution that helps stakeholders manage daily tasks and maximize efficiency at their assets, through controls that include managing project contracts and tasks, setting regulatory and contractual compliances, recording information about the assets, producing automated reports, and invoicing for power purchase agreements, among others.
According to Vesper, the decision to use BluePoint is a preemptive one, as the company shares that its growth trajectory projects a sizeable portfolio of high value assets from stakeholders which Vesper is looking to foster transparency with, and by adopting the software at the start of development, the Vesper team will benefit from a full dataset on the history of each asset in the portfolio moving into operations.
“Compliance and transparency are fundamental pillars of responsible asset management – both throughout the development phase and into long-term operations,” said Robert Jansen, director of asset management at Vesper Energy. “Using BluePoint from day one not only helps us create efficiencies in administrative processes that benefit our stakeholders; it gives us control and ownership of all of our essential data and empowers us to make better-informed decisions as we manage contractual risks and build a high-performing clean energy portfolio.”
In June 2021, Vesper Energy expanded an existing $100 million letter of credit facility to $140 million, a move which was made to allow the company speed development of its 3.5 GW of solar and 2.5 GWh of energy storage pipeline.
Since its start in 2015, Vesper Energy has commercialized more than 680 MW of utility-scale solar projects in the U.S. It plans to start work on two facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania in early 2022, and has a larger construction program planned for 2023.
Vesper Energy earlier said that its Deer Creek Solar + Storage project signed a 20-year PPA for 50 MW of solar energy and 200 MWh battery storage with Desert Community Energy, a community choice aggregator in Palm Springs, California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/06/nautilus-completes-24-9mw-community-solar-portfolio-in-new-york/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 6, 2022",Nautilus completes 24.9MW community solar portfolio in New York,"Nautilus Solar Energy announced the completion of a 24.9MW community solar portfolio in New York. Comprised of four projects located in Allegany, Cattaraugus, Genesee, and Steuben Counties, the combined portfolio provides enough power for an estimated 1950 households and multiple commercial subscribers, including the Target, Lowe’s, and Hannaford Brothers.
The additional 24.9MW of community solar further establishes New York as the number one community solar market in the United States. Just last month the state passed the 1GW mark for installed community solar.
“Reaching this nation-leading milestone – with more than one gigawatt of community solar installed – is a testament to New York’s aggressive pursuit of clean-energy alternatives that will supercharge our economy and bring us one step closer to a carbon-neutral future,” Governor Kathy Hochul said.
New York’s distributed solar pipeline moves New York closer to achieving 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and the governor’s goal to achieve 10GW of solar by 2030. According to the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie’s Solar Market Insight 2021 Year in Review report, New York is not only the national leader for installed community solar, but is installing new projects at more than double the rate of second-place Massachusetts.
New York is Nautilus’s largest community solar market, representing 45% of the company’s total megawatts produced, and nearly 30% of its total community solar installations.
“Nautilus is proud to play a role in the growth of community solar in New York. It’s a wonderful example of how investing in local community solar can ensure the cost-savings benefits are available to all New Yorkers, including improved access for low-to-moderate income customers and disadvantaged communities,” said Daniela Pangallo, Business Development Director of Nautilus.
The recently completed community solar sites are in the NYSEG and National Grid utility territories. Any residential customer of either utility are eligible to subscribe to a portion of the energy produced by the local Nautilus community solar project and receive savings on their utility bill with no upfront cost, no long-term commitment and no cancellation fees.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/06/array-technologies-may-be-insulated-from-anti-circumvention-said-roth/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,CAMBODIA,MALAYSIA,NORTH AMERICA,SOUTH KOREA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 6, 2022","Array Technologies may be insulated from anti-circumvention, said ROTH","Array Technologies, a solar mount/tracker provider, released its fourth quarter results, and issued a strong forecast for revenues this year. This comes despite the Department of Commerce’s investigation into antidumping and anticircumvention cases levied against four Southeastern Asian countries that supply 80% of the nation’s solar panels.
In an industry note, Phil Shen, managing director, ROTH Capital Partners, said the strong guidance initially came as a surprise, as the Solar Energy Industries Association reports that roughly 75% of companies report cancelled or delayed module supply, 50% said that 80% or more of their 2022 project pipelines are at risk, and that the investigation has a “devastating negative impact” on 60% of solar and 35% of storage businesses.
However, ROTH noted that the strong guidance may be a result of a strong relationship between Array Technologies and First Solar, a US-based manufacturer of thin-film CdTe solar panels. ROTH speculates that Array may be paired with a majority or a substantial amount of the 9GW module delivery expected from First Solar this year.
Array also has a strong relationship with South Korean panel manufacturer Hanwha, which is currently not under any anti-circumvention investigation. Hanwha performs final assembly of the modules in the US and is expected to produce 2GW of modules this year. 
Maxeon is another significant partner for the tracker company. Recently, Array announced it would be paired with the 1.8 million modules that will comprise the 690MW Gemini solar project in Nevada.
With these factors in mind, ROTH reissued a “buy” rating, and set a price target of $25 per share.
ROTH noted some risks, including competition from incumbents and new entrants, new tracker technologies entering the market that may pose risks to Array’s centralized tracker systems, the rise of commodity prices squeezing margins, and weaker than expected global solar project policies.
Results
In the fourth quarter 2021, Array Technologies posted a revenue of $219.9 million, up from $180 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter revenues for 2022 are estimated to be upwards of $290 million.
For the full year 2021, Array secured $853 million in revenues. This was a slight step down from 2020 revenues of $872 million; however, guidance is very strong for this year, with revenues expected to land around $1.5 billion for 2022.
The company executed a record $1.8 billion in contracts in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $43.2 million for the year, and an adjusted Basic and Diluted net income per share of $0.07.
“Despite a challenging 2021 it is important to re-iterate that the foundation of Array’s growth remains stronger than ever,” said Jim Fusaro, CEO. “This is most evident by the fact that we enter 2022 with $1.8 billion in executed contracts and awarded orders. To put that number in context, we have organically more than doubled the legacy Array portion from $705 million at December 31, 2020 to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021… the legacy Array business alone is forecasted to grow at approximately 40% at our mid-point, despite the current module challenges and supply chain disruptions.”

The solar PV cell has both a hot and a cold side that generates voltage and current from the outgoing heat flow from the solar cell and the surrounding air.
The researchers conducted their work based on the premise that the outgoing heat flow occurs during both day and night, and harvesting that heat could generate power at night. They constructed a device that integrates a PV cell with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) module, and the result is that the solar cell generates power from daytime solar radiation while the TEG generates power from radiative cooling during nighttime. An added benefit is that it generates extra daytime power from solar heating of the PV cell.

“You want the thermoelectric to have very good contact with both the cold side, which is the solar cell, and the hot side, which is the ambient environment,” said author Sid Assawaworrarit. “If you don’t have that, you’re not going to get much power out of it.”
The team demonstrated not only that it can generate power from the device at night, bu that during the day, it runs in reverse and contributes additional power to the conventional solar cell. They achieved 50 mW/m2 nighttime power generation with a clear night sky, with an open-circuit voltage of 100 mV, which is orders of magnitude higher as compared with previous demonstrations, the researchers report.
The setup could be incorporated within existing solar cells. It is simple to construct and uses basic, off-the-shelf components, the researchers say, making it possible to put it together in remote locations.
“The most expensive thing in the whole setup was the thermoelectric itself,” said author Zunaid Omair.
Using electricity at night for lighting requires a few watts of power. The current device generates 50 milliwatts per square meter, which means lighting would require about 20 square meters of photovoltaic area.
“None of these components were specifically engineered for this purpose,” said author Shanhui Fan. “So, I think there’s room for improvement, in the sense that, if one really engineered each of these components for our purpose, I think the performance could be better.”
The next step in their work is to optimize the thermal insulation and thermoelectric components of the device, and they’re looking at improving the solar cell itself to enhance the radiative cooling performance while maintaining its solar energy harvesting capability.

Scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed an aluminum-nickel (Al-Ni) molten salt battery that, under thermal cycling, exhibits high retention of cell capacity over periods of weeks.
The scientists described the small prototype as a “freeze-thaw battery” that cuts off the self-charge function when a battery is idling. “It’s a lot like growing food in your garden in the spring, putting the extra in a container in your freezer, and then thawing it out for dinner in the winter,” explained researcher Minyuan Miller Li.
The battery is charged by heating it to around 180 C, with its ions flowing through the liquid electrolyte. The device is then restored to room temperature and the electrolyte becomes solid, thus trapping the ions that transport the stored energy.
“The freeze-thaw phenomenon is possible because the battery’s electrolyte is molten salt – a molecular cousin of ordinary table salt. The material is liquid at higher temperatures but solid at room temperature,” the scientists said.
They noted that the battery can be heated again, as the ions restart flowing through the electrolyte when energy is needed. They built it with an aluminum anode and a nickel cathode, immersed in a sea of molten-salt electrolyte.
They added sulfur to the electrolyte to increase the battery’s storage capacity. A ceramic separator was embedded between the anode and the cathode to avoid breakage during the freeze-thaw cycle.“The PNNL battery uses simple fiberglass, possible because of the battery’s stable chemistry. This cuts costs and makes the battery sturdier when undergoing freeze-thaw cycles,” said the scientists.
They claimed that the battery can retain 92% of its initial capacity over a period of 12 weeks. They said it has a theoretical energy density of 260 W/hours per kg.
“The battery’s energy is stored at a materials cost of about $23 per kilowatt-hour, measured before a recent jump in the cost of nickel,” they said. “The team is exploring the use of iron, which is less expensive, in hopes of bringing the materials cost down to around $6 per kilowatt-hour, roughly 15 times less than the materials cost of today’s lithium-ion batteries.
The scientists described the battery in “A freeze-thaw molten salt battery for seasonal storage,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
