https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/05/georgia-rooftop-solar-program-levels-the-playing-field-for-low-income-households/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 5, 2024",Georgia rooftop solar program “levels the playing field” for low-income households,"Georgia has launched its Building Renewables & Investing for Green, Healthy, and Thriving Communities (BRIGHT) program, extending access to solar for residents that may not qualify for traditional financing.
Run by the Capital Good Fund, a nonprofit institution, the program is supported by a $1 million grant from the Arthur M. Blank foundation.
Under the program, customers are offered solar leases for no upfront cost, even for customers with credit scores too low for traditional solar financing. Capital Good Fund owns and maintains the solar installation over a 25-year lease term, with an option to buy the panels at year seven. The system is offered at 65% of the original price at that time.
The program ran a pilot project in September, signing up 200 households that make less than $100,000 per year across Georgia.
Program managers said the average family should expect about 20% savings per month on their electricity bills, or about $10,000 to $15,000.
About one-third of Georgians spend more than 10% of their monthly income on energy bills, a level that places them in “energy poverty.” The median household pays about 3% of their monthly income on power.
“If we can make cost-saving solar work for people in a state like Georgia, there is hope for households who need this type of relief across the South,” said Southern Environmental Law Center senior attorney Jennifer Whitfield.

Funding for low-income solar is on the rise in the United States, boosted by the $7 billion Solar for All program, contained within the Inflation Reduction Act. The program funds rooftop solar projects in lower income communities and provides solar workforce development. Solar for All grants are expected to be awarded this year.
“The Georgia BRIGHT program is just a preview of the transformative power of Solar for All grant funding,” said Whitfield. “We’ll be able to prove that solar is not only resilient and cost saving, but economically viable here in the South.”
Last July, first-stage grant applications were invited from states and other eligible entities for the $7 billion Solar for All program. States, territories, tribal governments, municipalities, and eligible nonprofits were invited to apply for a grant in an amount between $25 million and $400 million.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/05/tesla-releases-api-for-solar-powerwall-ev-charger/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 5, 2024","Tesla releases API for solar, Powerwall, EV charger","Tesla announced it has released an application programming interface (API) for its solar, Powerwall battery energy storage and electric vehicle chargers.
An API is a software intermediary that allows applications to communicate with each other. The new API will enable third parties to interact with software controlling the home energy components.
The EV and home solar provider released an API in October for electric vehicle fleet management. Now, its API supports coordination of distributed energy assets.
Tesla has increasingly been implementing software plans to coordinate distributed energy assets in programs like virtual power plants (VPP). In a VPP program, customers enroll their solar and storage assets in a program that taps their stored or produced electricity during times of peak demand. Customers are financially compensated for these electricity export events.
Developers can find the API here.
Powerwall 3
Tesla’s Powerwall will be a key component in VPP program implementation and fleet management. The company announced its third-generation Powerwall in September 2023.
The new battery has an energy capacity of 13.5 kW and offers continuous on-grid power of 11.5 kW. The system measures 110 cm x 61 cm x 19.3 cm and weighs 130 kg.
The battery includes an inverter featuring six solar inputs with maximum power point trackers (MPPTs). The device has reportedly a solar-to-grid efficiency of 97.5%. The new product comes with a 10-year product warranty.
“PW3 is optimized for ease of installation & high power, which means that a single Powerwall can serve as an uninterruptible power supply for most homes. This is a big deal for ensuring that the lights stay on and you can power all your devices in the event of a power outage,” said chief executive officer Elon Musk.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/05/texas-solar-generation-surges-amidst-north-americas-contrasting-december-patterns/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 5, 2024",Texas solar generation surges amidst North America’s contrasting December patterns,"North America experienced a sharp contrast in irradiance levels, driven by a high-pressure system in the Atlantic and intense low pressure in the North Pacific. These varied patterns have impacted solar generation across the continent, in particular driving stronger than expected December irradiance in Texas, delivering a Christmas increase in generation for the large solar assets in the ERCOT region.

The South experienced up to 30% higher irradiance than the long-term December average, resulting from a persistent Atlantic high-pressure system driving easterly winds. which kept moisture from the Gulf of Mexico offshore. In contrast, Florida, which is more exposed to the Atlantic, faced above-average rainfall and 20% lower irradiance than long-term average. Similarly, the Northeast experienced a warm, moist south-easterly Atlantic air mass, bringing storms that left many without power and resulting in above-average rainfall and slightly below average total irradiance.

As seen in the graph above, the Solcast API simulations of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region highlight that 2023 has seen the highest hypothetical production since 2007. This analysis uses the current installed utility scale capacity, and applies previous years’ weather to model how much could have been produced with current assets.
This December, Texas’ utility scale solar generation exceeded seasonal expectations, having 20% above the long-term average due to above-average irradiance. Texas is an attractive location for solar in the USA, as irradiance during the winter months is as much as 3 times higher than that seen near the northern US border. Indeed, year-on-year growth in solar in the ERCOT is currently more than 50%.

British Columbia and Washington State faced a different scenario, experiencing 30% lower irradiance due to anomalous low pressure in the North Pacific which drove a deep, moist, and relatively warm airstream bringing heavy rainfall onshore. California saw a slightly cloudier than usual December, with total irradiance of 5-10% below long-term average. Meanwhile, the Midwest enjoyed up to 15% higher than average irradiance, as the low pressure systems in the Pacific weakened the fronts that typically move eastwards across North America in the winter.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/05/department-of-energy-to-provide-40-million-to-train-energy-audit-workforce/,"EMPLOYMENT,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JANUARY 5, 2024",Department of Energy to provide $40 million to train energy audit workforce ,"The Department of Energy (DOE) is now accepting applications for competitive grants to help states train a workforce to conduct energy audits of commercial and residential buildings. The Energy Auditor Training Program (EAT) will award up to $40 million in total to qualifying applicants. 
EAT augments a broader effort by the DOE to invest in a clean energy workforce that implements the $8.8 billion Home Energy Rebate Programs, among other initiatives intended to help residents, businesses, states, and local governments save money as they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The Home Energy Rebate Programs include two incentives geared toward reducing the costs of renewable electricity generation and any infrastructure or equipment necessary to improve energy efficiency in non-commercial residences. 
The Home Efficiency Rebates will be awarded to state energy offices to provide discounts for those implementing energy-saving retrofits in single and multi-family buildings. Recipients can receive up to $4.3 billion through grants remaining available until September 2031. The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates are intended to help state energy offices and tribal entities scale a practical home electrifying rebate program. This fund has about $4.5 billion available for use through September 2031. The DOE states that $225 million is allocated for Tribes.  
The DOE estimates that these rebates could save residential buildings about $1 billion on energy bills annually while creating more than 50,000 jobs. Last year it released a jobs report that showed that the clean energy workforce outpaced the growth rate of the overall U.S. workforce.
The EAT program supports the Justice40 Initiative, as EAT’s short-term goals include closing job access gaps to increase a diverse talent pool. In the long term, the training program intends to continuously update its industry-standard auditor certification course to better cater to a broader audience with varying skills for improved job quality and, thus, diversity.  
The lack of a skilled workforce has been cited as one of the challenges to the build-out of renewable energy in the United States, which is the impetus behind the many federal initiatives launched since the passage of the IRA. For example, the DOE’s registered apprenticeship (RA) programs help individuals gain training in the solar and storage industry while on the job. RA initiatives also help organizations receive more tax credits or deductions in the long run, per the IRA’s registered apprenticeships and prevailing wage standards. 
The DOE’s Office of State and Community Energy Programs is managing the implementation of these initiatives. It works with state and local entities to accelerate the deployment of clean energy infrastructure on all levels.  
To register for the EAT funding opportunity, applicants should submit a Community Benefits Plan with their application. The proposal should describe how it will support local community and labor, invest in the workforce, advance diversity, equity inclusion, accessibility, and further economic and environmental justice programs.
The deadline for submitting concept papers is March 28, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. ET, and applications are due on June 28, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. ET.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/05/alliant-energy-deploys-six-new-solar-projects-in-wisconsin/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WISCONSIN",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"JANUARY 5, 2024",Alliant Energy deploys six new solar projects in Wisconsin ,"Alliant Energy has deployed six new solar projects in Wisconsin, collectively amounting to 514 MW and tripling the utility’s solar generation capacity.
All six projects are online and operational, and are single-axis tracker systems, Tony Palese, a spokesperson for Alliant Energy, told <b>pv magazine USA</b>. They include durable, high-performance bi-facial solar panels, which can cope with severe weather conditions, like snow. The sites were constructed beginning in 2022, and employed almost 1,000 workers, according to the utility. 
The projects include the 50 MW Albany Solar Project in Green County; 50 MW Cassville Solar Project in Grant County, 150 MW Onion River Solar Project in Sheboygan County, 65 MW Paddock Solar Project in Rock County, 100 MW Springfield Solar Project in Dodge County and 99 MW Wautoma Solar Project in Waushara County. The modules at the six completed sites are primarily from Trina and First Solar, Palese said. 
Completing these projects is a huge milestone in Alliant Energy’s journey toward a “brighter energy future,” David de Leon, Alliant Energy’s Wisconsin president, said.
“We’re proud to leverage new technology and locally generated energy solutions to increase customer value and help avoid long-term costs,” de Leon added. 
The new batch of projects are among 12 utility-scale solar projects that are part of Alliant Energy’s clean energy blueprint in Wisconsin. The company deployed three projects, amounting to 250 MW, last year, and have three more that are in the final stages of construction. Once all the projects are online – expected to be by mid-2024 – they will collectively generate 1,089 MW.
The company is also making investments in energy storage. Alliant Energy has announced plans to construct battery energy storage systems at two of its solar sites, Palese said,  a 100 MW and 75 MW system that will be constructed at solar facilities in Grant County and Wood County respectively. Last February, the utility also announced plans to deploy a 99 MW battery system adjacent to its Edgewater Generating Station, which is scheduled to retire in 2025.
“We expect to begin construction on all three battery projects this spring,” Palese said. 
In September, Alliant announced it had been selected for an up to $30 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations for a planned 200 MWh energy storage system, with a 10-hour storage duration. The project would use a technology that compresses carbon dioxide gas into liquid to store energy, and then convert that liquid back into a gas to power a turbine, creating electricity when demand rises on the grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/05/more-awareness-of-heat-pump-capabilities-and-incentives-could-drive-adoption/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 5, 2024",More awareness of heat pump capabilities and incentives could drive adoption,"The Department of Energy (DOE) is promoting advances in heat pump technology because of the potential to cut carbon emissions through increased adoption. To that end, the DOE announced $250 million in federal funding opportunity to incentivize the domestic heat pump manufacturing in the U.S.
“Electric heat pumps offer a cheaper, more reliable option for heating and cooling that isn’t prone to dramatic price swings and helps to strengthen the nation’s energy independence,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm.
The DOE launched the residential Cold-Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge to stimulate domestic development of cold-climate heat pumps (CCHP), which can help reduce energy costs and move the United State further along the path to achieving the nation’s goal of a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. The Challenge has two categories: CCHPs that are efficient at 5 F and below; CCHPs optimized for -15 F. Several manufacturers heeded the call to advance their technology, with many of the CCHPs now on the market.
Midea, a manufacturer of appliance and HVAC equipment, enlisted Atomik Research to survey homeowners and contractors about their awareness of heat pumps technology. The results show a lack of awareness about the potential of heat pumps among homeowners as well as contractors.
While most of the homeowners (80%) surveyed say they know what a heat pump is, just over half are unsure of what they do, particularly the ability to provide both heating and cooling. There is also a misconception about the ability of heat pumps to work in the cold, with just 4% of homeowners saying that they know that heat pumps can work in temperatures as low as -4 degrees F.
Nearly half of homeowners and a full 70% of contractors indicate that the main reason they would be hesitant to switch to a heat pump is because they don’t know enough about it. Once the contractors learned more about heat pumps, however, 87% of them said they’d consider switching to this technology for their own homes.
The survey also asked about federal tax credits, with 53% of the homeowners saying they weren’t aware that installing an advanced heat pump system would qualify them for credits. Two-thirds of homeowner respondents said that they are more likely to consider a heat pump now that they know about federal and regional tax incentives.
“As the next generation of ultra-efficient heat pumps become widely available next year, it’s crucial that consumers understand the performance, benefits and incentives available to them,” said David Rames, senior product manager, Midea America.
Atomik Research conducted the study, which surveyed 1,002 contractors throughout the United States. The sample of contractors consists of an even split between general contractors, home builders, home or property restorers and HVAC specialists. The research group conducted another survey of 2,004 homeowners in a sample that is statistically representative of the U.S. population based on the national census data regarding gender, age, and geographical regions.
