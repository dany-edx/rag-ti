The developer alleges that the town’s current land zoning regulations are excessively restrictive, jeopardizing five of their proposed projects. In a recent move, the town made an effort to have the lawsuit dismissed.
At the heart of the lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts Land Court under the landowner’s name, W.D. Cowls Inc, is the state law M.G.L. 0.40A,§3. The relevant relevant provision of this law states:
No zoning ordinance or by-law shall prohibit or unreasonably regulate the installation of solar energy systems or the building of structures that facilitate the collection of solar energy, except where necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare.

Drawing from a prior legal case where the above legislation was referenced, Tracer Lane II Realty, LLC v. City of Waltham, the presiding judge declared, “An outright ban of large-scale solar energy systems in all but one to two percent of a municipality’s land area, however, restricts rather than promotes the legislative goal of promoting solar energy.” Based on this, the court found the local township’s zoning regulations to be in violation of M.G.L. 0.40A,§3.
PureSky’s filing contends that seven regulations, when combined, render the development of large-scale ground solar projects within the township unfeasible. The company argues that these regulations are inconsistent with the Tracer Lane ruling. Earlier in 2023, Schutesbury indicated that they would amend their zoning laws to align them with the Tracer Lane decision.
W.D. Cowls presented a table in the filing that highlights how the town did not make substantial modifications to its key zoning provisions. Despite the presented evidence, the town subsequently declined W.D. Cowl’s solar projects.

Shutesbury’s bylaws notably restrict solar power plants to under 15 acres, equivalent to 3 to 4 MWdc of solar, and place further limitations on solar arrays exceeding 1.5 acres. Construction vehicles must use paved roads only, a stipulation made challenging by the fact that, as the filing notes, “only 26% of the roadways within the Town are paved.” Additionally, the regulations require the solar developer to designate a protected area four times the size of any deforestation caused by the installation. The protected area must exist on the same parcel of land.
The suit pertains to the development of five solar facilities under development:
The proposed solar facilities, spanning 190 acres with a total capacity of 20 MWac/45 MWdc and situated on lots totalling 1,882 acres, would generate $450,000 in annual taxes.

A local organization opposed to clear-cutting forest land, Smart Solar Amherst, posted the plans for one of these facilities on its website. The coalition, consisting of Amherst residents, supports the development of renewable energy sources while emphasizing the protection of forests, native habitats, water, and biodiversity. 
Highlighting the need for better siting of large solar facilities, they point out that the site is situated among various wetlands and streams. While the facility is thoughtfully designed to skirt the wetland areas, clearing the surrounding forests could alter the site’s water retention characteristics.
M.G.L. c. 40A, § 3. has been pivotal in Massachusetts approving 800 MWh of energy storage. Then-Attorney General Muara Healey, now the state’s Governor, cited it to challenge the City of Carter’s moratorium on solar and battery projects. She argued they unjustly constrained solar initiatives without valid public interest reasons, thus breaching the law. She also stressed that such restrictions impeded the state’s solar energy policy, suggesting the city’s justification for further impact studies did not sufficiently justify their actions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/09/boston-mayor-bans-fossil-fuel-use-in-municipal-buildings/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 9, 2023",Boston mayor bans fossil fuel use in municipal buildings,"As part of the city’s push to become carbon emissions neutral by 2050, Boston mayor Michelle Wu signed an executive order to ban the use of fossil fuels in new and renovated buildings.
The order calls for a ban of energy sources like heating oil and natural gas, modernizing public buildings in one of the nation’s oldest cities. With over 16 million square feet of property owned by the City of Boston, the order makes strides toward the city’s goals of decarbonization and electrification.
Buildings account for more than 70% of Boston’s total carbon emissions, with municipal buildings representing a 2.3% share. The city has already set aside over $130 million in its capital plan to revitalize older structures and add decarbonization and efficiency measures.
The fossil fuel ban applies to existing city buildings that undergo extensive renovations that cover over 75% of the building’s square footage. It also applies to renovations to HVAC systems, hot water or cooking equipment.
While public buildings are a small portion of the overall building footprint in Boston, private-sector market participants said the progress towards 100% electrification in public buildings will serve as a case study for decarbonization.
“The lab sector is particularly difficult to get to 100% electric,” said Tamara Small, chief executive officer, NAIOP Massachusetts. “So seeing how the city — with perhaps some additional public sector resources — could get there, will be helpful for us.”
Boston also opted in to a new state-specialized code that requires new construction to be wired for future all-electric use. These regulations take effect Jan 1, 2024.
“I think it will cost the city more money, but in the long run, I think it’s a good investment,” said Larry DiCara, a former Boston city councilor and real estate attorney.
While electrification may incur new costs for Boston buildings, it paves the way for operating on 100% emissions-free power. As the nation transitions away from fossil fuels toward low-cost, reliable sources like solar and wind, cost advantages will follow.
Today, solar energy remains the lowest-cost option for adding new generation to the electric grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/09/clearway-to-procure-2-gw-of-solar-trackers-from-nextracker/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 9, 2023",Clearway to procure 2 GW of solar trackers from Nextracker,"Clearway Energy Group announced a volume commitment agreement (VCA) of 2 GW of solar trackers from California-based Nextracker, to be delivered over the next three years. The U.S.-made trackers will supply a portion of Clearway’s solar development pipeline across 17 states.  
Clearway, also based in California, owns and manages more than 6.9 GW of operating wind, solar, and energy storage assets. The company recently announced that it closed financing on two utility-scale solar and storage projects located on U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land in California. The Victory Pass and Arica solar projects will generate 463 MW of combined clean energy capacity and 186 MW of battery storage, or enough electricity to power roughly 132,000 homes annually.  
The tracker announcement was made during a ceremony celebrating Nextracker’s new dedicated manufacturing line with Asteelflash, which will produce several electronic components for its NX Horizon utility-scale solar trackers and other products. Asteelflash has expanded its manufacturing capabilities at its 197,000 square foot facility in Fremont, California in a multi-million-dollar joint investment.
“This commitment with Nextracker marks an important step forward in Clearway’s broader domestic content strategy and in our industry’s progress on providing reliable, resilient energy,” said Craig Cornelius, CEO of Clearway. “With Nextracker’s precise control over tracker row angles and rapid stowing capabilities in extreme weather conditions, our growing fleet will set new standards of module protection and help ensure the reliability and resilience of the solar industry.” 
Nextracker reports that it has delivered more than 75 GW of its NX Horizon smart solar tracking systems. By adding the TrueCapture smart control systems, energy production has been found to increase up to 6%. Further advantages include the ability to handle varied site terrain and changing weather conditions, which Nextracker reports is the result of its independent-row architecture and optimization in response to data collected from thousands of sensors across its built-in wireless network.
“We’re pleased to be extending our partnership with Clearway Energy Group with this two-gigawatt VCA,” said Dan Shugar, Nextracker founder and CEO. “Clearway is a long-time esteemed customer and we’re appreciative that they recognize the value of our high performing NX Horizon solar tracker platform and TrueCapture software that optimizes energy yield while helping to protect the system.  Volume agreements like this help us further establish our national supply chain footprint with US-made components.” 
Nextracker posted $1.5 billion in revenues in 2022, delivering 16 GW of trackers globally. The company has shipped over 75 GW of trackers across more than 800 projects. It has over 200 active customers, and reports that 86% return for repeat business. The company estimates it offsets over 104 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/09/one-of-the-largest-u-s-solar-projects-secures-779-million-financing/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ILLINOIS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 9, 2023",One of the largest U.S. solar projects secures $779 million financing,"Swift Current Energy announced it has secured project financing for the 800 MWdc / 593 MWac Double Black Diamond solar project. Once operational, it will be the second largest solar project in the U.S. and the largest in the MISO regional transmission operation.
Over $779 million in project financing was closed for this project, making it among the largest solar project financings in U.S. history.
Located 30 miles west of Springfield, Illinois, the project is currently under construction and expected to reach commercial operations in 2024. The project is expected to produce enough electricity to provide the equivalent of 100,000 homes and will offset an estimated 1 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Approximately 450 construction workers are employed at the site, and McCarthy Building Companies is operating as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. First Solar modules, the majority of which are manufactured in the U.S., and U.S.-made Nextracker solar trackers were selected for the project.
“Double Black Diamond Solar is a transformative project, not only for our team, but also the American workers it is employing, the massive amount of emissions-free energy it will produce, and the stable revenue it will provide for the communities in Sangamon and Morgan counties,” said Eric Lammers, chief executive officer and co-founder, Swift Current Energy.
Over the life of its operations, the project is expected to provide $100 million in tax revenue to Sangamon and Morgan counties in central Illinois.
The financing includes $695 million in construction and tax equity bridge loans and an $84 million letter of credit facility. ING acted as the Green Loan Structuring Agent and Wilmington Trust acted as the collateral agent and depositary agent. Swift Current Energy is the project developer and will be the long-term owner and operator.
“Double Black Diamond will meaningfully advance the energy transition at the local, state and national level, while bringing tangible economic benefits to the local community and U.S. workers,” said Jamie Cemm, chief executive officer of BAES Infrastructure, majority owner of Swift Current Energy.
Illinois utility Constellation will purchase a portion of the electricity and renewable energy credits produced at the site. The City of Chicago will source renewable energy produced by the project to power several energy-intensive facilities, including Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport. Additionally, Cook County Illinois, CVS Health, Loyola University of Chicago, PPG, State Farm, and TransUnion have power purchase agreements via Constellation.
Vinson & Elkins LLP and Husch Blackwell LLP represented Swift Current in the transaction. Paul Hastings LLP advised MUFG, Societe Generale, Truist, and the other lenders party to the financing agreements.
