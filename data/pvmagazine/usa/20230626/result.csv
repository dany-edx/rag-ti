The project, located in Ohio, is under development  by Leeward Renewable Energy.
Construction on the 1,500 acre solar project has been underway since August 2022, with initial plans by the developer calling for 400 construction jobs during peak construction of the Madison County, Ohio solar facility.
Now, a portion of the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) work will serve a training program. Local companies have been invited to participate in Clark State’s Solar Training Electric Design and Installation, a “train-the-trainer” program in partnership with SEI.
“Train-the-trainer is an opportunity to train instructors or subject-matter experts to prepare them to train others,” said Crystal Jones, vice president of marketing, diversity, and community impact at Clark State.
Big Plain Solar project participants can learn skills in carpentry, construction, and electrical programs, supporting career growth options for local employees.
“Clark State strives to provide training for the jobs of the future and this partnership with Big Plain Solar demonstrates our commitment to the industry,” said Dr. Jo Alice Blondin, president of Clark State College.
Clark State’s solar training course is an introductory-level course. Students learn solar fundamentals and gain an understanding of various components, system architectures, and applications. The course focuses on grid-connected solar projects, but also covers material critical to understanding various other solar project types.
On-site training includes site analysis, system sizing, array configuration, and performance estimation and electrical design characteristics such as wiring, overcurrent protection, and grounding.
Students will be provided with a detailed look at module and inverter configurations, specifications and characteristics; mounting methods for various roof structures and ground-mounts; and an introduction to safely and effectively commissioning grid-scale solar.
Internships
Clark State also partnered with the Bright Future Program, an internship opportunity to onboard solar professionals who can learn more about the solar industry through SOLV Energy, a solar engineering, procurement and construction company.
The solar internship program features include:
“We are honored to provide an opportunity for students to take solar training,” said Jones. “Ohio instructors can learn how to incorporate solar components into their current programming and create awareness on the solar industry by partnering with BFP.”
In addition to employing a local workforce, Big Plain Solar will be installed using U.S.-made First Solar thin-film solar modules. The project site will incorporate a soil health monitoring program and curate a 70-acre pollinator habitat.
Upon completion, Verizon will purchase the power from the Big Plain project under a long-term power purchase agreement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/26/solar-module-recycling-facility-coming-to-coachella-valley-california/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 26, 2023","Solar module recycling facility coming to Coachella Valley, California","By 2030, retired solar panels are estimated to cover an area equivalent to about 3,000 football fields as panels that end their life enter landfills. In the United States, there are no federal regulations to mandate PV recycling, and according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), less than 10% of the country’s decommissioned panels are recycled.
In mid-2022, Rystad Energy pegged the solar module recycling market to be worth $80 billion in the next three decades.
A Coachella Valley, California solar developer has formed a module recycling facility that plans to serve as a magnet for California and Arizona end-of-life solar panels.
Renova Energy, a residential and commercial solar installer of SunPower panels and party to the new recycling venture, Mycrogrid Materials Recycling (MMR), is on track to become one of the largest module recycling operators in the Southwest. Upon opening, anticipated in the coming years, MMR will be among the first solar recycling facilities in the nation developed in cooperation with a solar installation company, which is also expected to be its largest contributor of end-of-life modules.
MMR is a cooperative venture of Renova Energy, based in Palm Desert, Calif., and will provide recycling services for solar materials to battery systems in residential and commercial installations. Located in the eastern Coachella Valley in Southern California, the state with the highest solar penetration and dense with solar material, MMR will recycle photovoltaic modules, racking and railing, as well as battery storage equipment.
The MMR facility will break down solar essential materials for reuse in new products to ensure that solar energy remains a truly sustainable solution. With about 95% of a typical photovoltaic module made of recyclable materials, disassembling them, and recovering glass, silver and silicon is extremely difficult, making a recycling venture even more important as the rate of solar installations increases throughout the western U.S.
“As someone who is passionate about sustainability, the solar energy revolution isn’t really realized until we complete the circle with recycling the panels that have come to the end of their useful lifespan and the materials are used to create more panels and other products,” said Vincent Battaglia, chief executive officer of Renova Energy and a board member of MMR.
Research by NREL found that by 2040, for key materials, recycling can meet 25% to 30% of domestic solar manufacturing needs in the U.S. NREL also assumed that the U.S. will have 1.75 TW of cumulative PV installed capacity by 2050, providing great pickings for the module recycling market in the coming decades. With California projected to install a modest 22.6 GW of solar in just the next five years alone, cites the Solar Energy Industries Association, there should be no shortage of module intake at the MMR and other key recycling hubs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/26/rondo-announces-90-gwh-heat-battery-factory/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 26, 2023",Rondo announces 90 GWh heat battery factory,"Rondo Energy, developer of the Rondo Heat Battery, announced it has partnered with Siam Cement Group to expand its factory to a 90 GWh capacity. The Thailand facility currently produces 2.4 GWh of industrial heat storage material for its batteries and is planned to be expanded to the largest battery factory in the world.
The Bill Gates-backed company developed its heat battery as a way to decarbonize the industrial sector. Rondo’s battery, called the “brick toaster,” is made of readily available materials like oxygen, silicon, aluminum, and iron. The battery stores electric power as heat in refractory brick, a technology that has been used in industrial heat storage for centuries.
The heat batteries transform intermittent wind and solar power into the continuous high-temperature and low-cost heat that industry demands. This planned production expansion is expected support a wide range of industries, from mining and metals to fuels to food production, at facilities around the world.
“Electric thermal energy storage can play a useful role in addressing the needs of the industrial sector, which has been slow to decarbonize. And, from an energy security standpoint, it is worth noting that this technology avoids the use of scarce and expensive materials,” said Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst, Raymond James.
The batteries store and dispatch heat without the use of combustibles, critical minerals, toxics or liquids. With a Rondo Heat battery, solar and wind can deliver continuous zero-carbon industrial heat at lower cost than fossil fuels, said the company.
The batteries can store more than 1 MWh per square meter, a high level of density that preserves area use at industrial facilities. Rondo said the batteries can be integrated into existing process heating equipment, allowing for significant emissions reductions without the need for a factory overhaul. The batteries are expected to operate for 40 years or more with no performance degradation.
 
Heavy industrial processes have proven to be one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize and accounts for about 24% of global emissions, according to Our World in Data. The 90 GWh of planned capacity is expected to result in 12 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions abatement annually, equivalent to removing over 4 million gas-powered vehicles from the road each year.

Rondo said its batteries offer continuous power with a 95% annual capacity while operating on input power as low as 15% capacity factor, or four hours of dispatchable power generation per day.
“Our studies of customer facilities are showing 50% to 90% reductions in emissions and reductions in operating costs of 30% or more,” said Jeremey Keller, senior vice president of Rondo Energy.
In early 2022, Rondo Energy announced the closing of a $22 million Series A funding round to support its technology, a renewable energy heat battery aimed at reducing the carbon impact of industrial processes. The funding round was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.
“Over the last few years we’ve seen validation of our founding vision,” said John O’Donnell, chief executive officer, Rondo Energy. “Decarbonizing industrial heat is a trillion-dollar market requiring far more storage than the electric grid. The technology is here now. The demand is here now. This planned expansion means that the capacity is here now as well.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/26/how-your-state-can-fix-interconnection-of-distributed-solar-and-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 26, 2023",How your state can fix interconnection of distributed solar and storage,"The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and Vote Solar have graded each state on its policy governing interconnection of distributed solar and storage, and only one state, New Mexico, earned an A.
The two groups recommended specific ways that each individual state—even New Mexico—could improve, in report cards published in an online report, Freeing the Grid.
States have the ability to drive clean energy deployment not just through statewide goals for adoption, the report says, but also with policies that enable faster and lower-cost interconnection of distributed resources. Such policies are approved by state public utilities commissions.
“A majority of states have significant room for improvement to ensure that their interconnection policies do not present a barrier to clean energy market growth,” said IREC in a statement.
Thirty-seven states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have statewide procedures for interconnection of distributed resources. Of those, one earned a grade of A, six earned a B, 15 earned a C, and 17 earned a D. The other 13 states without statewide procedures received a grade of F.
IREC and Vote Solar graded each state using 56 interconnection criteria that “represent best practices and model provisions” drawn from IREC’s report “Model Interconnection Procedures” and IREC’s BATRIES project, which focuses on interconnection of energy storage and solar-plus-storage systems to the distribution grid.
States could also earn up to three badges in the evaluation for instituting “noteworthy best practices.”
A transparency badge was awarded to states that require pre-application reports, detailed screening and study results, itemized estimates for upgrade costs, and at least monthly public queue reporting.
An energy storage badge was earned by states that have included energy storage as an eligible technology in their interconnection rules, incorporated the concept of export capacity, and identified acceptable “export control” methods. Export control, or the ability of energy storage to control when rooftop solar exports energy to the grid, enables the grid to host more rooftop solar, IREC found—in some cases doubling a distribution circuit’s hosting capacity.
An IEEE 1547-2018 badge was given to states that have incorporated the IEEE 1547-2018 standard for smart inverters and identified or referenced performance categories as well as voltage and frequency settings for smart inverters.
The state report cards are based on 56 interconnection criteria that capture a state’s interconnection progress for distributed resources across ten categories:
The grades on the report cards focus on state procedures and do not take into account utility practices or public utility commission orders not adopted in state rules.
Looking ahead, Vote Solar expects to grade the states on compensation policies for distributed energy resources, in a report that is also expected to include findings on the racial and class equity of statewide interconnection procedures.
IREC is hosting a webinar on the findings of the Freeing the Grid project on July 12.
Between 2007 and 2017, IREC and Vote Solar released ten reports that graded the states on both interconnection and net metering policies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/26/increasing-restrictions-on-siting-solar-in-the-u-s/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ALASKA,ARIZONA,MISSISSIPPI,UNITED STATES,VIRGINIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 26, 2023",Increasing restrictions on siting solar in the U.S.,"Columbia Law School of New York has released its third annual round up of anti-renewable energy legislation filed across the U.S. The report, Opposition to Renewable Energy in the United States – May 2023 Edition, aims to document local and state restrictions on, and opposition to, the siting of renewable energy projects from 1995 to May 2023.
The authors contend that “local opposition to renewable energy facilities is widespread and growing, and represents a potentially significant impediment to achievement of climate goals.”
The report highlights several particularly challenging situations including:
In the most recent version of the report, the researchers at Columbia identified no fewer than 228 local restrictions across 35 states. They also highlighted nine state-level restrictions that are so stringent they could block a renewable energy project, the authors say. Moreover, the team listed 293 renewable projects that have faced substantial opposition in 45 states.
The only states without significant restrictions or controversies, according to the authors’ criteria, were Alaska, Arizona, and Mississippi. For example, Yuma, Arizona, considered one of the sunniest cities in the U.S., has a long history of its power companies stifling the development of solar projects.
Most of the state-level restrictions targeted wind power, with only a few directly affecting solar. Two of these restrictions involved state bodies in Connecticut and Maryland needing to approve relatively small solar projects. In New York, the state government controls the approval of larger solar projects.
Before March 2022, the group had identified 169 unique local renewable energy restrictions. Since then, an additional 59 restrictions have been enacted, marking a 35% increase. Furthermore, throughout the year, 82 projects encountered contentious paths during their respective zoning processes.
This period saw a 39% surge in the number of projects facing ‘serious organized opposition’.
Concurrent with the strong rise of laws limiting renewables, is the fact that solar deployed a record 6.1 GW of capacity in Q1 2023 is set to deploy a record 30 GW of capacity in 2023. And while it is true that tens of projects have been rejected, thousands have been turned on.
