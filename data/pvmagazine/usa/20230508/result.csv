According to the Solar Means Business 2022 report by the Solar Energy Industries Association, on-site commercial solar has averaged a steady 3% growth over the last five years. Target, Walmart, Amazon and real estate firm, Prologis, make up the top 4 companies for solar installed on site. Lineage Logistics was named as number five, and it caught our eye because it had more on-site solar installations since 2020 than any other company on the list, with 87.2 MW installed and more on the way.
Lineage Logistics got its start as a cold storage company back in 2009, when it had just one warehouse location. Now it is the world’s largest temperature-controlled industrial real estate investment trust and logistics solutions provider. It has a global network of over 430 facilities totaling over 2 billion cubic feet of capacity, which spans 20 countries across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. With an eye on the future, the company has a plan for a net-zero carbon future by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement.
As a cold storage company, Lineage Logistics is a big consumer of energy, and the company feels a responsibility to lead by example. pv magazine USA spoke with Chris Thurston, director of energy and sustainability at Lineage Logistics who explained that rather than buying carbon offsets or buying into other projects, Lineage decided to look at where the company’s emissions were coming from: fuel for its transportation and electricity to keep its facilities cold.
Linear generators
In addition to solar, Lineage is using linear generators from Mainspring Energy. These generators use a low-temperature reaction of fuel and air to create electricity. Thurston said Lineage had chosen Mainspring linear generator technologies over batteries because the linear generators provide continuous power. The goal for these units is for them to work in conjunction with solar arrays to ensure reliability and optimal use of the sun’s energy at all times, the reducing the facility’s dependence on the grid and protecting its customers’ products in the event that the grid goes down.
“We believe that the best starting point was to generate as much clean power on site, and solar seems to be the best way to do that,” Thurston said.
He said the company had been looking at various technologies and they liked Mainspring Energy’s linear generators for several reasons. One is that it ramps up and ramps down with solar, so as to not export, which he said is a requirement by the utilities.
“Most other generators are either on or off the set the ability to ramp up and ramp down to handle those swing periods when the solar stops generating overnight”, Thurston said.
The second thing Lineage liked about it was that it is fuel agnostic and could easily be swapped out with zero emission fuels like hydrogen and ammonia. Thurston said they also liked the fact that the generators could continuously generate overnight.
“It’s currently still using natural gas, but we’ve had a lot of breakthroughs in green hydrogen and other fuels over time. We’re confident that within the next decade or so that those clean fuels will be readily available in our site. “
In the U.S. alone, Lineage has more than 108 MW of on-site solar installations across its network with its on-site solar installation producing enough energy to fulfill about 40% of the facilities energy needs. Thurston said they have had a lot of success with solar, beginning with a regional approach, tackling market by market, “and it’s accumulated into something pretty great”.
Colton solar install
Lineage’s Colton, Calif. facility is an example of the combined use of solar and linear generators. The company reports that it was the first facility of its kind to pair a linear generator with solar panels, and also the first to install two linear generators.
The Colton facility is 100% powered by 8,426 Hanwha and JA Solar 385 Watt solar modules, which were installed on PanelClaw racking on its rooftop by PowerFlex.

Looking to the future, Lineage has plans to add solar to even more of its facilities around the world. The company also plans to expand its use of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure to be used on site, as well as by its customers.
Thurston sees clean energy as great optics for the company’s customers, “They’re continuously asking us to do more from a sustainability perspective, they want clean buildings, they want to be doing more for the environment, and they want to see meaningful steps on our behalf, you know, in that direction. “
Lineage continues to push the envelope on these issues, Thurston noted. “We view ourselves as innovators in the industry to show folks that clean energy can work and is reliable.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/08/the-income-graduated-fixed-charges-in-california-will-harm-customers-with-low-electric-bills/,"MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"MAY 8, 2023",The income graduated fixed charges in California will harm customers with low electric bills,"In California, many customers have low monthly bills for electricity. For example, a single person living in an apartment, a couple living in a small, single family home, or a family living in a very energy efficient home. These customers have bills that are in the $100 a month range.
California has millions of such customers for demographic reasons and also because the state has been a national leader in energy efficiency, through a combination of energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings that are exercised through the Title 20 and 24 codes administered by the California Energy Commission (CEC) and rebates and other financial incentives offered by utilities, which add up to $1.5 billion. The results can be seen in the Rosenfeld Curve, named after the late Professor Art Rosenfeld who also served as a commissioner at the CEC.

Customers with solar panels also have low bills, typically in the $50-75 a month range. California has the largest number of solar customers in the US. The number is estimated to be around 1.5 million customers, representing more than 4.29 million people, a number larger than the population of 22 states. The utilities are using an invitation for radical rate design as a means to make the state’s electricity more affordable to further undermine the financial viability of rooftop solar so as to keep control of the energy system evolution.

These customers were motivated to install solar panels, in order to improve the environment and lower their bills, which kept on rising with the state’s electricity rates. More recently, due to increasing power outages, more customers have been motivated to pair solar with batteries. Today, California’s rates are more than twice the national average and proposals by Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric would accelerate this divergence over the next decade.
In the NEM 3.0 (Net Energy Metering) proceedings in 2021 and 2022, a proposed decision was issued in December 2021 calling for the imposition of a grid access charge (GAC) of $8/kW-month on new solar customers and making it retroactive on existing solar customers 15 years after the customer’s system was put into operation. Under pressure from the citizens of the state, the CPUC withdrew both features in the final decision, but other draconian changes persisted. The Net Billing Tariff adopted for NEM 3.0 is now effective as of April 15 of this year.
Under AB 205, a large omnibus package of energy legislation passed in the budget and enacted in 2022, the three investor-owned utilities were authorized to implement income graduated fixed charges (IGFC) for residential customers. This has no parallel anywhere else in the U.S. It will have several unintended consequences, as discussed below.
Historically, fixed charges in California have been capped at $10 per month. Whenever the utilities have tried to increase the fixed charge (either via legislative or regulatory mechanisms) the principles of energy conservation have stopped momentum for higher fixed charges.
The AB 205 legislation did not specify the magnitudes of the new fixed charges. The magnitude of the fixed charges that the utilities have proposed will not only cripple the economics of rooftop solar panels for customers. It will also cripple the economics of energy efficiency investments and cause customers to lose interest in demand response programs.
The implementation of the IGFC will entail the creation of an onerous, intrusive, and expensive verification system to collect, verify and update customer income data and to police these large charges.
The three investor-owned utilities have proposed the IGFC’s shown in the table.

To put these proposed charges in perspective, it’s worth noting that two of the three utilities don’t have any fixed charges today. The third has a nominal fixed charge of less than a dollar per month. All that the three utilities have today is a minimum bill requirement of ten dollars.
What do fixed charges look like in the rest of the country? The national median of fixed charges is just over $10, as measured across 173 investor owned utilities. Using data from EQ Research, I have generated this distribution of fixed charges across the country. The highest is $37. Most of them are under $20 a month. Not only are they lower than the charges in the proposal put forward by the three California utilities, none of the fixed charges in the US depend on a customer’s income.

The three utilities’ proposal has generated more buzz in the media than any other rate design proposal in recent memory. Websites like Rstreet, San Diego Union Tribune, LA Times, and many others can are some examples of the uproar.
It has also generated a volley of editorials and angry letters to the editor of the major newspapers in the state.
Impact on customer bills
While these charges are intended to apply to all customers, what will be the impact on solar customers?
Unlike the grid access charge which was proposed and rejected in the NEM 3.0 proceedings, the IGFC will apply immediately to existing solar customers once it’s approved and rolled out.
Under IGFC, if a NEM 2.0 customer in the PG&E service area has installed 8 kW of solar and falls in the fourth income bracket, he or she will pay $92 a month while being given a 35% reduction in energy costs, which on average will drop from 34 cents/kWh to 22 cents/kWh for PG&E.
This redistribution of charges will significantly erode the customer’s bill savings, as shown in the figure below.

 
Focusing initially on customers in the fourth income bracket, i.e., upper middle income, if their current bill is $100 a month, it will rise by nearly under $60 a month. If their current bill is $50 a month, it will rise by nearly $75 a month. The impacts will be lessened for lower middle income customers in the third income bracket but will still be significant, especially for customers whose bills are lower than $50.
To date, it is higher income and middle income customers that have installed solar and replaced some of their existing inefficient energy consuming devices, like space heaters and water heaters, central air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines and clothes dryers, and dishwashers.  It is not low income customers, who typically have other pressing expenses, like food, clothing, housing and transportation, and most often are not in control of energy saving investments because they rent.
The savings from IGFC for low-income consumers will not be sufficient to persuade them to replace inefficient appliances or to electrify by replacing natural gas-fired stoves and heaters or to replace gasoline cars with EVs, in large part because they are most often renters.
Moreover, increased electricity costs for middle and higher income customers will give them less discretionary capital to spend. Indeed, lower kWh charges for all customers than in alternative rate designs seem likely to incrementally increase electricity demand from existing air conditioners, lights and appliances, especially on sweltering, hot summer days. This will happen at an inopportune time, when the state has been focused on meeting increased reliability concerns with existing peak demand. The rate reduction is so untargeted that it is difficult to envision how much of an incentive it will provide to electrify current gas uses.
Essentially, the IGFC will lengthen the payback period for existing solar customers. Their investment in solar will suddenly look a lot less than attractive than it was when they made their decision, in good faith and abiding by the rules at the time, to invest in solar panels. Many would not have invested in solar if the IGFC had been in place. The CPUC should not adopt a change that punishes people for choosing to do the right thing when we asked them to do so.
The IGFC, which is being held out as an example of forward-looking rate making, will definitely have a deleterious effect on the monthly budgets of all solar customers. It will also harm non-solar customers who are frugal in their use of energy either because they are single, or live in small homes or apartments, or made investments in very energy efficient homes. Those customers who have electric bills under $200 a month in the fourth income bracket or with bills under $100 in the third income bracket would see bill increases.
But they would not be hit as hard financially as solar customers since they would have not have made as large of aa major capital investment spent the same amount of money to lower their bills.
Ironically, utilities are quick to say that they love solar but only if the price is right. Having failed to institute a grid access charge on new solar customers, they have now found a way to hit all solar customers, new or old, with something even worse, the IGFC, leading some to say that this is their “second bite at the apple.”
Professor Bruce Mountain from Australia’s Victoria University had this to say:
“Looking at this development from Australia, this is all rather weird to watch. In Australia there is now a growing consensus that the best place to put solar is on roofs (we have about 27 GW on our roofs). The transmission expansion stuff associated with large scale ground-mounted solar is becoming a nightmare. Surely that will be the case in California as well.”
The IGFC maneuver is cleverly disguised as a plan to promote equitable electrification. Whether or not it will do that won’t be known for years, since in any given year only 5-10% of customers are in the market for an air or geothermal heat pump or an EV. In the meantime, the utilities would have shored up their declining fortunes.
Recommendations
The CPUC should carefully think through the implications of the IGFC. There is no need to rush to a decision. There is general agreement across most parties that fixed charges should be introduced into rate design. But they should be based on cost of service studies, not simply backed out as a residual by arbitrarily lowering the volumetric rates. In the end, they should be no higher than $25 a month. One California municipal utility considered among the most innovative, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, charges $23.50 per month.
The members of the state legislature ’s assembly members should rethink the income graduation clause in AB 205. No where else in the US is that being done on the scale that the utilities are proposing, and for good reason. Income data is confidential and should remain so. Further, determining the “income” for a household can be quite complex in a world of varied relationships.
Through the CARE program, California already offers a 35% discount on electric bills for low income customers. This discount is among the highest in the country and the CARE program certainly has the largest number of customers on it, approaching a third of households.
Low-income customers are also eligible for energy efficiency rebates and other forms of financial assistance. The CPUC might consider approving additional funds for such programs, as well as incentives to help low-income customers afford the high upfront costs of EVs and heat pumps. The legislature should also consider providing them incentives through the tax code, perhaps by creating energy stamps.
Any new fixed charges that are introduced by the utilities ostensibly to encourage electrification should be introduced gradually and not suddenly. They should be optional for customers interested in buying heat pumps and EVs who agree to use a time-of-use rate with low-off-peak rates, not mandated for all customers. Only 5-10 percent of the customers in any year are in the market for heat pumps of EVs. Why impose these rates on all customers when there is no empirical evidence that they will induce electrification?
Furthermore, the CPUC should ask the utilities to conduct pilots with such rates that include higher fixed charges rates before making them a part of the default rate. The state conducted pilots for two decades with TOU rates before making them the default rate. That precedent should be honored.
Finally, the CPUC should also consider other options that have been proposed such as providing energy allowances priced as a steep discount for replacing gas appliances and gasoline cars with electric ones. This approach would directly induce the electrification that is the stated intent of the IGFC.

The portfolio combines for 15 MW of solar capacity and 8 MWh of battery energy storage with four-hour duration.
All five CCA projects are now fully subscribed and are planned to finish construction by Q1 2024. Once operational, the projects will power 3,300 northern California households, nearly half of which will be located in disadvantaged communities. The project designs include plans to preserve the area’s agricultural land use and will also benefit surrounding land by creating pollinator-friendly habitats within a five-mile radius.
The projects are intended to help the four CCAs move more quickly toward their state-mandated resource adequacy (RA) requirements.
“We are excited to be working with Renewable America to help us meet our RA obligation as a Load Serving Entity. This community-scale project is on track to be completed in under two years, unlike larger utility-scale projects that can take many years to develop,” said Matthew Marshall, executive director of Redwood Coast Energy Authority. 
In light of recent marketplace limitations of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) territory, Renewable America said it took an unconventional approach to developing the projects, bypassing the traditional cluster study route. The company took on greater development risk than typical capacity market projects, managing everything in-house, from scouting new project sites, interconnection, engineering, permitting to executing power purchase agreements.
Following the 2001 California energy crisis, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) required that every load serving entity, including CCAs, are able to allocate enough resource capacity for their load to ensure energy resiliency. Every year, CAISO opens a new window for applications for cluster studies, which are performed to ensure that system reliability and standards are met.
In March 2021, Cluster Study 14 received an unprecedented three times more applications than in previous years, earning it the nickname “The Super Cluster.” Due to the overwhelming level of applications to the study, it has been delayed by over two years, and CAISO is still in the process of finishing it. Renewable America’s approach to development will bypass the Super Cluster, bringing much needed resilience capacity close to the communities it serves.
“With the increase of power outages and Public Safety Power Shutoffs in California, distributed generation local solar projects are more essential than ever to ensure energy resiliency while also mitigating climate change,” said Ardi Arian, chief executive officer, Renewable America. “We are pleased to be able to provide high quality, local solutions in less time for CCAs throughout California who are seeking alternative options to meet capacity needs.”
CCAs, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are programs that allow local governments to procure electricity on behalf of their residents, businesses, and municipal accounts from an alternative supplier while still receiving grid services from their utility. 
These entities help communities exercise control over their electricity sources, demand more clean energy, and negotiate lower electricity prices. Demand aggregation gives communities greater leverage when conducting these negotiations.
Renewable America carries over 15 years of experience in development, engineering, procurement and construction throughout Europe and North America. The company’s end-to-end development process aims to maximize quality and efficiency, while minimizing lasting environmental impact on site. Based in Santa Clara, California, Renewable America has over 320 MW of solar and 680 MWh of energy storage projects under development across its home state.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/08/texas-senate-approves-tight-permit-restrictions-on-solar-and-wind/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 8, 2023",Texas Senate approves tight permit restrictions on solar and wind,"The Senate of the state of Texas voted 21-9 in favor of SB 624, a bill that would place significant permitting restrictions and fines on solar and wind energy projects in the state. A companion bill now heads to the House for approval.
Texas is the nation’s leader in wind energy development and is soon to take over as the number one state for solar, leapfrogging California. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) expects the state to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, building on the 16 GW that is active to date, and making it the nation’s sterling example of harnessing the sun’s energy.
This boom in growth occurs just as the $369 billion spending package within the Inflation Reduction Act is implemented and rolled out, a law that is further catalyzing the energy transition toward carbon-free power generation.
The Advanced Power Alliance projects that in 2024, renewable generation in ERCOT will deliver $6 billion in net system operating cost savings and more than 18,000 MW of reliable capacity contributions.
However, state legislators have taken aim at the industry, despite the economic boom that has come with it. Texas lawmakers showed their support for SB 624 in late April.
The law singles out solar and wind facilities, requiring them to obtain a permit from the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of Texas, while leaving out fossil fuels from the requirement. Gov. Abbott, who has long shown an affinity for fossil fuels, has appointed all the PUC members, who now would act as gatekeepers for any renewable energy project.
Additionally, SB 624 assigns a new yearly fee to be paid by renewable energy developers. It would also require developers to pull a permit any time significant changes need to be made to existing projects. Under the law, each new project would be required to undergo a new environmental impact study.
The law would also require that developers provide an affidavit that lists the names and addresses of the persons who may be affected by the project. Developers would also be required to give notice of the project application to any property owner within 25 miles of the boundary of the facility. This opens the door for “not in my back yard” arguments, even for individuals living many miles away.
Furthermore, the bill states that the commission “on its own motion or after reasonable notice and hearing” can require permit holders to conform to “new or additional conditions.” The commission can require renewable energy projects to be at least 500 feet away from any property line and at least 1000 feet away from any habitable structure. Developers would have to provide a signed waiver from the neighboring property owners to be able to proceed with a project.
The law places existing renewable energy projects at risk by retroactively applying permit requirements to these sites. It vests the Commission with the power to enter project sites and remove installed clean energy capacity if it does not meet the newly-established tightened permits.
“The onerous proposal would violate private property rights of Texans and reduce the value of properties who are denied their ability to develop the energy resources on their land,” said the Advanced Power Alliance in a statement. “The bill will drive up the cost of energy for every Texan and would place every power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with corporate customers at risk.”

The RFQ process is for projects in the 100 kW to 400 kW range, while the logistics facility operator is looking for qualified installers for projects under a three-year timeframe in order to retain California net energy metering (NEM) 2.0 status.  
California’s utility commission in December voted to cut the export rate from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, effecting new solar residential and commercial projects installed on or after April 15, 2023. Customers who have systems installed and approved for grid interconnection before the effective date in April will be grandfathered in to NEM 2.0 rates.
Of the 116 new Prologis solar facilities, about 26 to 32 MW of new solar capacity is sited where interconnections are already submitted, according to Station A. 
The RFQ closes at 11:59 p.m. PT on May 15 by third-party marketplace Station A. Interested developers are encouraged to submit quotes via Station A, an online project submission database and software for clean energy buyers and developers. 
Based in San Francisco, Prologis has a $117.9 billion market capitalization. In 2022, the company committed to net zero emissions across its value chain by 2040. In addition to a goal of having 1 GW of California solar installations by 2025, the logistics company plans to also be carbon-neutral from a construction standpoint by 2025. 
In November 2022, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in its Solar Means Business report ranked Prologis second in the U.S. among corporations deploying on-site solar generation. 
With over 1.2 billion square feet of warehouse and logistics space worldwide, Prologis had 378 MW of solar generation capacity across tis global operations, including 217 MW in the U.S. through September 2022.  
“With solar from Prologis roofs, our customers reduce their emissions in an economical way,” said Susan Uthayakumar, chief energy and sustainability officer, Prologis. “Communities also benefit from gaining access to renewable energy and improved grid resilience.” 
In a February pv magazine USA webinar with solar data, surveillance and drone specialist Zeitview, the service provider revealed four of its top 10 rated rooftop solar projects were owned by Prologis. In operations for 11 to 15 years, the California logistics properties range from 1.4 MW to 13.5 MW in power capacity and utilize crystalline modules. Zeitview issues a triple-letter asset rating after providing drone surveillance and monitoring solutions for utility and large commercial and industrial projects.  
Station A’s Clean Energy Marketplace has originated 19 MW of onsite renewable projects to date, representing $40 million of projects. The platform enables the collection of competitive project bids from contractors and EPCs in a transparent and digital format. 
San Francisco-based Station A is a technology start-up company formed in 2018 as a spin-off from NRG Energy. The company has about 20 employees and raised $4 million in seed funding in July 2020 from Southern Company, SE Ventures, Powerhouse Ventures and Howard Wenger, president of Nextracker.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/08/the-world-can-manufacture-enough-solar-to-decarbonize/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 8, 2023",The world can manufacture enough solar to reach decarbonization goals,"Over 100 countries have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050, according to the United Nations. A recent study conducted by researchers at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that to totally decarbonize global electrical systems using solar in the 2050 to 2060 decade, the world would need to install 63.4 TW of PV. The findings of the study are published in “Photovoltaic Deployment Scenarios Toward Global Decarbonization: Role of Disruptive Technologies,” which appears in the journal Solar RRL.
The researchers modeled viable trajectories to supply > 60 TW of installed solar capacity to meet the goal of global decarbonization and studied the effect of a disruptive technology on deployment cost and market opportunity. They concluded that it is possible for production to scale up to the 2.9 TW to 3.7 TW needed per year within 10 to 15 years, a goal that will cost from $600 billion to $660 billion. The model includes using existing technology as well as mature technologies using silicon and CdTe. The study estimates that disruptive technologies offer a $1 to $2 trillion market opportunity and that the potential for cost savings could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.
The disruptive technologies include cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based PV, perovskites and tandem technologies. CdTe, which is the technology used by solar manufacturers First Solar and Toledo Solar, among others, currently represents about 16% of the U.S. solar market, NREL reports. Perovskites have challenges with long-term durability, but they offer advantages in manufacturing because they can be printed quickly and relatively inexpensively in a roll-to-roll method. Tandems pair technologies, such as perovskite on silicon, and several companies are beginning to manufacture tandems including TandemPV, CubicPV and OxfordPV.
According to NREL, tandem devices and minimodules are seeing efficiencies of as much as 31.25%. And while the efficiencies are promising, and other tandems continue to be developed, R&D is still needed in order for these devices to be manufactured at the scale needed to achieve terawatt capacities.
“There are economically viable trajectories that get to the needed manufacturing capacity to produce the amount of PV needed to completely decarbonize the world’s energy economy,” said Jao van de Lagemaat, director of the Chemistry and Nanoscience Center at the U.S. Department of Energy’s NREL. “Emerging technologies could potentially lower the cost of this deployment significantly if they get commercialized in time.”
To provide enough solar over the next two decades to decarbonize the global electrical system will require an “unprecedented ramp-up of production capacity”, but it is achievable, according to the NREL analysis.
The estimated target of 63.4 TW needed between 2050 and 2060 is a 60-fold increase in the amount of installed PV worldwide today. When the researchers say this is possible, it is under the assumption that investors protect their investments by avoiding stranded production assets. The model demonstrates that a sustainable ramp-up of manufacturing is possible, and that disruptive technologies will play a role in lowering capital costs.
Another assumption is that the lifespan of a PV module will increase considerably, possibly from an average of 30 years in 2020 to 50 years by 2040.
Looking beyond the 2050 to 2060 decade, van de Lagemaat, noted that module retirement and population growth will be the drivers of a “relatively modest demand” after global decarbonization is reached.
In addition to van de Lagemaat, the other authors are Michael Woodhouse from NREL and Billy Stanbery from Colorado School of Mines. NREL’s internal Laboratory Directed Research and Development program funded the research.

As the new capacity of polysilicon increased into early 2023, the price began to fall in mid-March, with cost pressure on silicon easing as well.
The price of modules is less than 26 cents per watt, and Longi said the return rates of solar power projects are attractive for developers, which will stimulate the solar demand further this year. 
2023 Outlook 
Longi sees annual growth bringing the company to production of more than 160 billion yuan ($23.15 billion) of 2023 revenue. For 2023, the company projects shipments of 130 GW of wafers and 85 GW of modules/cells this year, in addition to production of 190 GW of wafers and 130 GW of modules.
Shanghai Stock Exchange-listed Longi traded at the equivalent of $4.85 per share today, down year over year from $7.16 per share on May 9, 2022. The company has a $36.37 billion market capitalization with more than 5,000 customers in more than 150 countries/
In January, Longi said it will invest approximately $6.6 billion to more than double its PV wafer and cell capacity. It plans to build new wafer and cell factories. Construction of the new facilities in Xixian New District, Shaanxi province should take no longer than 18 months and will be handled in multiple phases, with no phase lasting longer than six months. In March Longi Solar and Invenergy announced plans to construct a 5 GW manufacturing facility in Pataskala, Ohio, via a newly founded company, Illuminate USA.
Longi expects its new factories to be commissioned by 2025, creating more than 15,000 jobs.
