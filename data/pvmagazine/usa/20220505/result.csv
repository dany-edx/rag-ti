“The vitality and growth of our region is underpinned by low-cost, reliable and clean energy. Over the past five years, TVA has worked with state and local partners to deliver about 350,000 jobs and $45.9 billion in capital investments,” wrote president and CEO Jeff Lyash in opening remarks on the report.
Lyash stated goals of targeting up to 10 GW of solar by 2035, and more than 200,000 EVs on TVA roadways by 2028. Operating and contracted solar capacity grew 77% in FY 2021, and the first TVA-built utility-scale solar and battery projects are underway and expected to be online by 2024-2025. The utility expects to have about 2.8 GW of solar in TVA operation by 2024.
However, the sustainability report disclosures reveal that TVA owns 1 MW of operable solar capacity and reports no ownership of wind energy assets, as of the FY 2021 report. This is largely due to the fact that TVA is unable to access the federal investment tax credit dedicated to solar projects. To secure the best rate for solar in its territory, TVA instead has developers play the role of owner-operator, so that the incentive can be utilized and customer rates can remain low. A company spokesperson told pv magazine as of February 1, TVA has 642 MW operating solar.
Renewable energy capacity owned and in operation by TVA has decreased slightly each year since 2019, according to the report. Currently, TVA has 5,386 MW of renewable energy capacity, nearly all of which is hydropower. In addition to the hydropower production, TVA reports it purchased 7,269 MW of renewable energy from outside sources in FY 2021.
“We have a plan to achieve a 70% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and a path to about 80% by 2035. We aspire to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050,” wrote Revecca Tolene, TVA’s chief sustainability officer.
TVA has already reduced emissions by 57% since 2005. Much of that has come from the retirement of coal plants and the activation of more nuclear power, which grew from a 26% share to 41%. Coal shrank from 57% of operations to 16% over that period. Solar and wind energy were not meaningfully represented in the 2005 figures, and now hold just 3% of the energy mix.
Solar investment programs
The utility said it has committed nearly $3 billion in solar investments through its Green Invest program since 2018. A large driver of growth in this program is through contracts with large corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook), and others.
The federally owned utility contracted for 1,178 MW of utility-scale solar generation by the end of FY 2020. It also implemented the Green Connect program in FY21, creating a qualified solar contractor network. The program has achieved 19 qualified installers, over 1000 customers registered, about 200 installations submitted, 65 installations verified, and over $7.5M of customer spending on systems within the Green Connect network.
TVA runs another program called Green Switch, which provides customers with 100% renewable energy at a small premium. The utility said contracts can be signed for as low as $2 per month, and customers can match some or all their current electricity use with a mix of solar, wind and biomass generation sources located in the Valley. In FY 2021, the mix was approximately 70% solar, 20% wind and 10% biomass sources.
The utility said it has invested over $2 billion in transmission system improvements through 2025, perhaps paving the way for the interconnection of 10 GW of solar by 2035.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/05/d-c-is-outpacing-its-own-solar-goals-for-now/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,WASHINGTON, D.C.",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 5, 2022","D.C. is outpacing its own solar goals, for now","The Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia (Commission) has released its Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) Report for Compliance Year 2021, an annually required report which highlights the progress that the city is making on its RPS initiatives, with data current through the end of 2021.
According to the report, 2021 saw a significant expansion of RPS-certified solar facilities, despite challenges stemming from the pandemic and other market fluctuations, with a total of 2,337 new solar energy systems approved for the RPS program. D.C.’s RPS electricity suppliers must buy 100% of their power from renewable sources by 2032, with 5% coming from local solar power, meaning systems in the D.C. area.
Of the 2,337 new solar energy systems approved for the RPS program in 2021, 2,077 were located within D.C., with 82 of those systems being community solar installations. Since the RPS system certification program began, regulators have certified 10,013 solar energy systems in D.C., representing 154.7 MW of capacity. Of all systems, 219 are certified community solar installations, up from just 9 in 2018. These community solar facilities contribute 26.5 total MW of capacity.
The report notes a total of 12,955 solar energy systems certified for RPS, amounting to a total capacity of 191.8 MW. With 191.8 MW of certified systems to date, D.C. is actually outpacing the solar procurement requirement outlined in the RPS, which required the city to source 2.5% of its electricity from solar by the end of 2021. According to estimates, that would mean roughly 182 MW of solar would need to be installed by that date, a figure which was surpassed by nearly 10 MW.
A more solar future?
D.C. is home to one of the most aggressive RPS mandates in the country. Utilities operating in the district are required to source 100% of their electricity from renewable energy by 2032, with at least 5% of that power coming from solar energy. Thus 5% figure could grow, however, thanks to some interesting language as to how the solar carve-out operates:
If the solar energy achieved in a given year exceeds the solar energy standard in that year, the solar energy standard of the subsequent year shall increase by one plus the percentage difference between the solar industry standard in that year and the actual percentage of solar achieved for that year, multiplied by the subsequent year’s solar energy standard, provided that the solar energy standard shall not exceed a percentage to equates to a total installed capacity of 1.68 GW.
Noting the hardships that solar faced in 2021, the commission’s report also outlines that growth in solar energy facilities certified for the RPS program continued in the first quarter of 2022, with 720 new systems added, including 42 community solar installations. The report does not project out beyond Q1, 2022, so it is entirely unclear as of yet how the Department of Commerce’s (DOC) investigation into solar cell and module manufacturers in four southeast Asian Countries will factor into 2022 installation totals.
While the DOC investigation has been described as a utility-scale sector killer, the ripples and lack of module availability will be felt throughout the entire industry. As of the Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA) most recent data, the majority of solar companies in D.C. have been reporting delayed or canceled module shipments, with these same companies expecting the investigation to have a severe or devastating impact on their company and ability to do business.
While the full scope is unknown, it is unlikely that 2022 will be the same year for solar RPS progress that 2021 was.
Solar For All
According to the report, one avenue that the commission is looking to use to expand the construction of solar systems throughout the District, is through D.C.’s Solar For All program, a portfolio of projects helping the city reach its 100% renewable energy target by 2032 and cutting utility bills in half for 100,000 low- and moderate-income households.
The program also includes a job training initiative, run by GRIDAlternatives, targeted at preparing the city’s low-income youth for careers in solar. Such social equity goals, while not primary program drivers, are an essential part of Solar For All, according to Tommy Wells, director of the Department of Energy & Environment, as are a focus on innovation and sharing lessons learned on what does and doesn’t work.

Group14 plans to use the funding to build its second commercial-scale Battery Active Materials (BAM) factory in the Washington to provide materials to manufacturers of high-performing batteries.
One of those manufacturers is Porsche subsidiary Cellforce Group, which plans to produce high-performance lithium-silicon battery cells in South Germany beginning in 2024 to be installed in Porsche electric vehicles. Group14 reports that its next-generation materials help lithium-silicon batteries deliver 50% higher performance than traditional lithium-ion batteries, which could help stimulate EV sales by eliminating range and charge anxiety for EV customers. Lithium–silicon batteries are a type of lithium-ion battery technology that uses a silicon-based anode and lithium ions as the charge carriers.
“The battery cells are the combustion chamber of the future. We are investing in the development of new high-performance cells with Cellforce and in the production of battery modules,” said Lutz Meschke, deputy chairman and member of the executive board of Finance and IT at Porsche AG. “As a result, Porsche has decided to partner with Group14 Technologies.”
Group14 currently operates a commercial-scale Battery Active Materials factory in Washington state with two forthcoming factories: one in South Korea as part of a joint venture with SK Group, expected to come online this year, and a second US factory, due to come online next year. Group14 also plans to accelerate delivery of its technology SCC55, which the company reports can turn a gigafactory into a 1.5 GW facility overnight.
“Group14 is well-positioned to elevate all batteries by enabling the transformational performance of silicon in today’s lithium-ion and tomorrow’s solid-state applications. We have been laser-focused on scaling our factories to deliver commercial quantities to customers in a mission to eradicate charge anxiety as fast as possible, said Rick Luebe, Group14 co-founder & CEO. “With incredible support from a consortium of strategic and institutional investors led by Porsche that believe in our vision and roadmap, we can continue to advance the batteries that breathe life into the electrification of everything.”
To date, Group14 has raised $441 million in financing from Porsche AG, OMERS Capital Markets, Decarbonization Partners, Riverstone Holdings LLC, Vsquared Ventures, Moore Strategic Ventures, Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), BASF, Cabot Corporation, Showa Denko, OVP Venture Partners and SK materials.

Under the agreement, AES will partially match the load of Microsoft’s California Data Centers with electricity generated from a portfolio of 110 MW of solar projects and 55 MW/220MWh storage projects, all set to be constructed in California.
This deal builds on a previous supply agreement that AES made with Microsoft, a 15-year supply agreement, signed in November 2021, under which AES will use both existing and to be developed renewable energy projects to supply renewable energy to Microsoft’s Virginia data centers. For this agreement, AES will source the energy from a portfolio of 576 MW of contracted renewable assets, including wind, solar, as well as battery energy storage projects in PJM.
“Microsoft continues to be a leader in the clean energy transition,” said Andrés Gluski, AES president and CEO. “Working in tandem with Microsoft, we co-created a scalable 24/7 carbon-free solution to power its data centers in Virginia, and we are now proud to move forward on another innovative renewable energy supply structure in California.”
Connecting data centers to renewable energy supplies is a bit of a specialty for AES, as the company has also signed an agreement to supply Google’s Virginia-based data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy under a 10-year supply contract. According to AES, the transaction will result in construction of around 500 MW of renewable energy and storage projects to ensure Google’s Virginia-based data centers will be 90% carbon-free when measured on an hourly basis.
AES put together the 500 MW portfolio from a combination of the company’s own renewable projects and those of third party developers, which were selected, sized and contracted to meet Google’s energy needs. The portfolio is expected to require $600 million in investment and generate 1,200 jobs, both permanent and construction, in the host communities.
As for Microsoft, the company signed two significant non-AES supply deals in July of 2021. On July 15, the company announced it reached an agreement with Volt Energy for the supply of 250 MW of utility scale solar energy. In addition, Volt Energy and Microsoft will invest a portion of the revenue from the power purchase agreement in community impact funding initiatives. Those initiatives will support programs that bring the benefits of renewable energy closer to communities that have not had equitable inclusion in the wave of clean energy initiatives undertaken by the private and public sectors.
On July 20, Sun Streams 2, a 200 MW solar project in Maricopa County, Arizona, near Phoenix entered service, a project which has a 20-year revenue agreement with Microsoft for the project’s energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity, which will support its new datacenter region known as West US 3.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/05/predictive-proactive-whole-home-energy-management-system-sunpower-one-unveiled/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 5, 2022","Predictive, proactive, whole home energy management system SunPower One unveiled","Maxeon Solar Technologies announced it has released a holistic energy management system designed to interface with home solar arrays, battery energy storage systems, as well as the full set of energy loads in the home, including heating and cooling, appliances, lighting, and more.
The platform takes a step beyond monitoring the system, proactively advising homeowners on ways to optimize their energy usage. It is capable of recognizing patterns of electricity consumption and suggests further actions for energy bill savings.
One example is the SunPower One system recognizing “always on” devices in the home that would benefit from switching off during periods of peak demand and high electricity prices. It can also identify malfunctioning appliances that may need repair or replacement based on abnormal electricity signals.
With compatible products, the system enables smart use cases that increase self-consumption of solar PV production, scheduling electric vehicle charging times for when excess solar is produced or stored, or running heating and cooling systems at cost and energy-optimal times.
“We expect the SunPower One solution will reimagine and revolutionize the consumer experience Beyond the Panel, keeping homeowners informed with actionable energy insights within their household, helping make their homes more efficient and more sustainable.” Jeff Waters, Maxeon Solar Technologies CEO
Maxeon’s SunPower One will be packaged with the company’s SunPower Reserve home battery. The company said its group of integrated products will continue to grow over the course of the year, adding products like electric vehicle charging, and will unlock additional software capabilities for value-added services for the customer.
The system will also assist installers by reporting opportunities identified by the homeowner’s energy usage behaviors, making suggestions for more products and services for increased energy savings. The SunPower One tool also provides an installer-specific digital sales, design, and quoting platform.
“We have the freedom to think outside the box and leverage next-generation technologies to leapfrog the traditional offerings on the market today. Our customers are our north star, and we will continue to prioritize solving their pain points,” said Ralf Elias, chief product officer at Maxeon Solar Technologies.
Maxeon’s SunPower One platform will launch in Australia in Q3 2022 and will roll out to other markets globally throughout 2022. The US and Canada will not be part of the 2022 launch. A demonstration of SunPower One will take place at Intersolar Europe on May 11-13.
Industry leading warranties and US expansion 
Maxeon made waves in the solar industry when it announced its Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) panel line is now supported by a 40-year warranty in its main distributed solar markets. The IBC cells feature back contact energy conversion, allowing the entire front of the cell to absorb sunlight without any shading from metal ribbons like the ones found in conventional solar cells.

According to Maxeon, these panels have a minimum warranted output of 98% during their first year of operation, followed by a maximum annual degradation of 0.25% for the next 39 years. The result is an 88.3% warranted power level at the end of 40 years.
In November 2021, pv magazine spoke with Mark Babcock, chief revenue officer of Maxeon, who indicated that Maxeon was considering manufacturing in the US, but he said that in order for that to happen a few federal policy changes would be needed.
Babcock said a 3 GW cell manufacturing facility in the US is waiting on an Energy Polict Act of 2005-established Title XVII loan from the US Department of Energy; it also may depend on the success of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. Such adoption would make US expansion a more attractive prospect to Maxeon, likely drawing in other industry players, as well, according to Babcock.

Working from that theory, researchers from the University of Oklahoma, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the University of North Texas examined techniques to test how conventional solar cells perform in space. They aimed to discover whether the same process would be appropriate for putting perovskite devices through their paces.
Not only did they discover the testing processes used for non-perovskite devices would not hold up with the alternative technology, they also found, in the words of one of the academics, that “the community in general is not testing them properly.”
In developing a set of perovskite-specific testing protocols for space use – published in the April 11 issue of Joule – the researchers found the perovskite cells lived up to their expectation of being able to withstand the sort of fierce radiation exposure they would face outside Earth’s atmosphere. “But not for the reasons many believed,” according to University of Oklahoma physicist Ian Sellers, a co-author of the paper.
Rather than exposing the devices to high-energy particles, Sellers and his colleagues used lower-energy protons, which are prevalent in space and which could be halted in different parts of the perovskite cells.
The academics found perovskite devices are indeed “radiation hard” because they are soft and not very dense. While the radiation particles caused the cells to become disordered and damaged, the devices “will also very quickly settle, or heal, and go back to normal,” according to Sellers, who compared the process to water which has been disturbed returning to a still state.
The protocols developed by the academics, reported on EurekAlert this week, could pave the way for perovskite solar devices to be used in permanent installations on the moon, or even to be manufactured there. In addition, they could be deployed in intense radiation environments, such as Jupiter, and to power satellites in high-radiation polar orbits.
The research was led by Joseph Luther, senior scientist for chemical materials and nanoscience at NREL, in cooperation with former University of Oklahoma post-doctoral researcher Brandon Durant, now of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. They worked with NREL postdoc Ahmad Kirmani, NASA Glenn Research Center engineer Lyndsey McMillon-Brown, and Bibhudutta Rout, an associate professor in the department of physics at the University of North Texas at Denton.

Solarcycle, based in Northern California, was founded this year by industry experts from leading institutions such as Solaria, NEXTracker, Sierra Club, and the University of New South Wales. The company offers solar asset owners a process for recycling retiring solar panels and technologies and repurposing them for new uses.
Solarcycle’s first partner, Sunrun, is a home solar, battery storage and energy services provider. According to Suvi Sharma, CEO of Solarcycle, Sunrun has >4GW under management and already has several megawatts of end of life panels.  Recycling and repurposing used panels from Sunrun will pave the way for a scalable solution that will be available to the entire industry by year’s end, Solarcycle reports.  
Solar is expected to grow exponentially in the United States, thus increasing the number of solar panels that are ready to be retired at end of use. Needless to say, a lot of people–including 7-year old Neil— are concerned about what will happen to solar panels at the end of their life. That concern is real and growing and is the subject of much study around the world. For example, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Lab have studied how to recycle and re-use solar panels and published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry. The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. At that price, a profitable and sustainable solar panel recycling industry could establish itself by 2032.
“As Sunrun deploys PV systems at the scale needed to confront the climate crisis, we’ve embraced the responsibility and opportunity of managing the full lifecycle of our hardware,” said Mary Powell, CEO, Sunrun.  “We are committed to sustainable end-of-life processes and excited to partner with an innovative company that shares our vision and is dedicated to creating a circular supply chain for the solar industry.”
Solarcycle has designed a recycling solution that the company says can recover more than 95% of vital materials that can be re-used. “By vertically integrating our operations into a factory that can process gigawatts of solar annually, we can radically reduce costs and the climate impacts of the recycling process,” said Pablo Dias, co-founder and CTO of Solarcycle.
