In a new report titled “Boom Time: what the Inflation Reduction Act means for U.S. renewables manufacturers,” Wood Mackenzie provides an initial assessment of how the IRA will greatly support the expansion of U.S. renewable energy equipment manufacturing capacity.
“The IRA will completely reshape the renewables supply chain in the U.S., incentivizing the reopening of shuttered facilities as well as provide opportunities to build entire equipment supply chains from scratch,” said Daniel Liu, head of asset commercial performance at Wood Mackenzie.
Two key provisions of the IRA are likely to be game changing for equipment manufacturers. The first, the advanced manufacturing production credits (AMPC), for US-made renewable equipment. The second provision is the incentivization of developers of U.S. renewable energy projects to purchase domestically sourced equipment with an additional tax credit if they meet domestic content requirement or DCR thresholds. To qualify, 40% of all equipment must be American made for projects installed before 2025, and 20% American-made for offshore wind projects. This requirement rises to 55% beginning in 2027 for the offshore wind market, the report notes.
“It’s high stakes for U.S. equipment sales, as the IRA provides incentives that cut the manufacturing cost of solar panels, storage equipment and wind towers in the U.S. by anywhere from 4% to 30%,” Liu said. “This, along with tariffs on some imports, potentially puts domestic manufacturing on a cost-competitive footing with imported equipment.”

Utility solar remains foggy 
The U.S. currently has just a small domestic capacity to support manufacturing of utility-scale solar panels, juxtaposed against substantial forecasted growth in solar additions.  Meeting U.S. solar market expansion activity as forecast by various agencies, including Wood Mackenzie, proves that the U.S. supply of solar panels to the utility market remains a foggy proposition, Liu states.
PV panel manufacturers face considerable challenges when it comes to developing a self-sufficient domestic manufacturing capability, with costs between 16% and 33% higher than imported PV equipment, though the AMPC credit could start to close this gap.
Tax code digestion
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will provide eligibility requirement guidance on how to access support in the form of tax credits, which will be a critical factor for investment decisions by the manufacturing community.
“The decision to invest in equipment manufacturing capacity expansion depends on the interplay of three factors. First, the cost of manufacturing equipment in the U.S. compared with imports, taking into account the benefits the AMPC provides,” Liu said.  “Second, the expected supply/demand imbalance for renewables equipment, and finally, specific guidance from the IRS on what constitutes ‘domestically produced equipment’,” he added.
Wind market benefits from AMPC
The AMPC credit from the IRA will  help original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) reverse declining equipment sales margins in the short term and incentivize investment in manufacturing capacity for the U.S. onshore wind power market.
The U.S. has enough manufacturing capacity to supply most domestic demand for turbine equipment through 2031, though the industry faces a near-term shortage of American-made equipment. This creates an opportune pricing environment for manufacturers, as not all developers will be able to meet DCR thresholds within the Act.
Developers should be able to meet pre-2025 DCR thresholds with American-made turbine components, such as domestic foundations, towers, and balance-of-plant equipment. Turbine blades will help developers reach the 55% threshold after 2026.
Despite the nascency of the U.S. offshore wind market, the country is one of the most attractive markets for offshore wind suppliers due to its ambitious targets, lack of existing supply chain, and focus on local content in tenders and its consolidated client base.
“We expect manufacturers to capture the full value of the AMPC given the limited capacity of U.S. manufacturing, the natural cost advantages versus imports and the need to invest in domestic manufacturing capacity,” Liu said.
Silver lining
Despite the IRA’s potential to be a major driver for U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, the industry’s path forward is not so clear-cut. Additional factors that will have a significant impact on renewables capacity expansion include:

The Republican governor first publicly commented on the decision during his State of the Commonwealth annual address on January 11th. Local reporting from the Richmond Times-Dispatch suggested the governor made the decision even after being told the two companies had decided on the Virginia site.
During the speech, he called on Virginia’s General Assembly to send him a bill that would “prohibit dangerous foreign entities tied to the Chinese Communist Party from purchasing Virginia’s farmland.” In the Washington Post, Youngkin’s chief legal counsel Richard Cullen was quoted saying, “They (CATL) were looking for land and incentives to build something and I think that was the nucleus of the evolving concern about farmland.”

Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis recently made statements that China was attempting to purchase land in his own state, and that they should be wary of those actions.
After the speech, many news sources reported that the Virginia governor said, “We felt that the right thing to do was to not recruit Ford as a front for China to America.”
A spokesperson for the Governor told the Detroit News, “While Ford is an iconic American company, it became clear that this proposal would serve as a front for the Chinese Communist Party, which could compromise our economic security and Virginians’ personal privacy.”
Ford was also considering building the facility in Michigan.

A U.S. Department of Energy map from November 2022 highlights 55 individual battery factory announcements in the United States. The capacity will take the nation from 55 GWh of manufacturing space in 2021 to more than 1,000 GWh by 2030. The estimated capacity will be able to support the manufacturing of 10 to 13 million vehicles per year.
Michigan is one of the states leading these battery manufacturing announcements. Of the 55 projects noted by the Department of Energy, 11 of the facilities were from Michigan. Facilities n Georgia and Kentucky also top the list of planned manufacturing volumes. All three of the states have already announced between 97 and 136 GWh of manufacturing capacity.
In December, Bloomberg reported on the facility and suggested that CATL may be uncertain about moving to the U.S. due to the political complexities of the relationship between the two countries, specifically considering Taiwan.

In a review process initiated by Hanwha Solutions, the parent of Hanwha Q Cells, the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board declared on Dec. 9 that all contested claims of REC Solar’s U.S. patent No. 10,749,060 (Patent 060) are not patentable. It determined that the challenged REC Solar patent claims are directed to a well-known arrangement of solar components within a solar module, and fail to satisfy the requirements of patentability.
REC challenged Hanwha Solutions in a patent infringement lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in 2020. The court’s judges suspended the dispute for the duration of the inter partes review procedure. In early January, the deadline was extended again.
Q Cells said in a statement that the U.S. decision follows similar rulings in relation to REC Solar’s global patents. Last year, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court and European Patent Office issued favorable rulings for Hanwha Solutions over a Chinese patent, 201480038577.X, and a European patent, EP3017520. The two patents are related to REC Solar’s 060 patent. However, REC Solar declined to comment when contacted by pv magazine.
In March 2019, Hanwha Q Cells filed patent infringement complaints in Germany against Jinko Solar and REC Group, and followed this with a similar lawsuit against Longi Solar. The complaints claimed that the companies had unlawfully included Q Cells’ patented passivation technology in their own products. In June 2020, the Düsseldorf regional court determined that the three defendants had infringed upon the German part of the patent. The appeal process is still ongoing.
Hanwha Q Cells has also filed patent-related complaints in France, the Netherlands, and the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals has determined that the complaint over the disputed patent was invalid. The European Patent Office, meanwhile, confirmed the validity of the passivation tech patent in June 2020, with only minor changes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/19/duke-acquires-175-mw-colorado-municipal-utility-solar-project/,"ACQUISITIONS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,COLORADO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 19, 2023",Duke acquires 175 MW Colorado municipal utility solar project,"Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions, acquired Pike Solar, a 175 MW development-stage utility solar power plant being built for municipal utility Colorado Springs Utilities (CSU).
The non-regulated commercial arm of utility Duke Energy acquired the project from EPC contractor Juwi Inc., which initially had plans to be coupled with a four-hour lithium-ion battery energy storage system. A Duke Energy spokeswoman told pv magazine that Pike Solar will no longer be installed with an energy storage system, but declined to elaborate on the change.
Both Duke Energy and Juwi will provide operations and maintenance services for the solar facility, which has a 17-year PPA with the utility.
The solar facility is under construction and is scheduled to achieve commercial operation in late 2023, when it will become the largest solar project on CSU’s grid. The facility is located on 1,310 acres in El Paso County, Colorado, and will use more than 414,000 solar panels, providing enough clean power for 55,000 homes per year.  The facility will employ 350 construction workers during peak construction.
“The realization of the Pike Solar project marks another milestone in our company’s history,” said Stephan Hansen, chief operating officer at Juwi.  “Pike Solar is our company’s largest single project worldwide. We are pleased to work with Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions, Colorado Springs Utilities Board and El Paso County’s local officials to add additional clean and cost-effective generation in Colorado, our home base in the U.S.”
Following the deal, Duke Energy’s commercial business will operate three Colorado solar projects with 248 MW of output.  The utility’s U.S. portfolio consists of  more than 10.5 GW of solar and wind energy assets.
Pike Solar marks the second solar collaboration between Juwi and Colorado Springs Utilities, the first being the 60MW Palmer Solar project, which is currently the largest solar project on Colorado Springs Utilities’ system, although it will be overtaken once Pike is complete.
Lightsource bp operates the largest solar project in Colorado, the 300MW Bighorn Solar project in Pueblo, Colorado.  Bighorn Solar provides power to Evraz’s Rocky Mountain Steel plant via a 20-year power purchase agreement with Xcel Energy, the utility that serves the plant.
CSU generates 27% of its electricity from renewable energy resources. On September 1, 2022, the utility shut down the Martin Drake Power Plant, a 207.3 MW coal generation facility.
Initial capacity from the shuttering of its coal generator was filled by six natural gas peaker which are expected to enter commercial operations by March, comprising 43% of the utility’s 2030 generation portfolio. The remainder of its portfolio will consist of solar (12%), wind (9%), and distributed energy resources (28%), including 100 MW of energy storage development.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the Rocky Mountain State ranks 13th in the U.S. for solar development, with 2.3 GW of installed capacity through September 30, 2022, with about 6.2% of electricity in the state generated from solar panels. The state also ranks 13th for its modest 3.6 GW growth pipeline of installations forecasted for the next five years.
With about 23 electric cooperatives providing electricity to its residents, Colorado prides itself as a hotbed for community solar these days. Since the Colorado Energy Office launched its first community solar project in 2015, about $1.2 million in financial awards were given to GRID Alternatives to implement the Low-Income Community Solar Demonstration Project platform.  Since its inception, the low-income community solar program has seen 400 low-income households benefit from $120,000 in bill credits from procuring solar energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/19/three-groups-appeal-to-cpuc-to-reconsider-nem-3-0/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 19, 2023",Three groups appeal to CPUC to reconsider NEM 3.0,"The Center for Biological Diversity, Protect Our Communities Foundation and the Environmental Working Group appealed the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) decision to slash compensation to rooftop solar customers. The appeal is based on the groups’ belief that commission’s decision will harm the ability of environmental justice communities to benefit from solar energy.
In December the CPUC voted unanimously to approve Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM), slashing payments by 75% for excess solar production sent to the grid.  CPUC voted to cut the average export rate in California from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, making the cuts effective on April 15, 2023. During the vote, the Commission said the balancing of costs and benefits continue to be “quite generous” under the decision.
“California is drowning in climate-driven deluges, and we have to make it easier for communities to embrace rooftop solar to survive the climate emergency,” said Roger Lin, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “By slashing the net metering program, state regulators made it even harder for environmental justice communities to get solar. We’re appealing because this flies in the face of the commission’s mandate to ensure that rooftop solar is accessible to low-income Californians.”
The groups believe the decision threatens the growing rooftop solar market and puts affordable and resilient renewable energy out of reach for most communities.
“California’s private utilities have been relentless opponents of rooftop solar for many years, because it undercuts the golden goose — new high-profit transmission line construction. They have convinced regulators of the alchemy that they are protecting the interests of lower-income customers — and not shareholder interests — by devaluing rooftop solar,” said Bill Powers, an expert witness in the proceeding and a board member of the Protect Our Communities Foundation.
The appeal says the commission should redo its analysis because regulators devalued rooftop solar based on flawed modeling that ignored net metering’s benefits to environmental justice communities. Those benefits include decreasing the state’s dependence on fossil fuels and providing local economic benefits, including new jobs. The commission also failed to analyze non-solar customer bills and ignored or underestimated harms from fossil fuel energy, particularly to low-income communities and communities of color.
“By making residential solar economically untenable for millions of working families, the CPUC has sidelined the only competition the big utilities face. It will allow PG&E and the other power companies to keep wasting ratepayer money on misguided, high-cost infrastructure investments,” said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group Ken Cook. “The CPUC needs a reset to fit an emerging new world of electric power. We now have strong competition for utilities from distributed solar, battery storage and microgrids, a technological and economic transformation the likes of which we haven’t seen in more than 100 years.”
The groups noted that the commission also abandoned a $600 million equity fund aimed at getting more clean renewables to low-income communities. Regulators claimed the state’s battery storage fund would achieve the same result, but Gov. Gavin Newsom recently cut that fund by 30%.
Opposition to the commission’s decision is widespread. More than 125 California and national climate and equity groups representing millions of people previously called on the governor’s office to reject the commission’s flawed analysis and maintain the state’s solar credit to grow rooftop solar in environmental justice communities. Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director, California Solar and Storage Association called the NEM 3.0 decision a “step backwards”. “It is a dark day in California when the utility regulators try to block out the sun,” Del Chiaro said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/19/southern-environmental-law-center-calls-for-new-tva-board-to-pause-tvas-gas-plans/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TENNESSEE",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 19, 2023",Southern Environmental Law Center calls for new TVA board to pause TVA’s gas plans,"TVA, a utility owned by the federal government that generates about 4% of its power from solar and wind, and about 48% from fossil-fired units, has proposed nearly 5 GW of gas units since mid-2021, according to a lawsuit filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC).
An executive order from President Biden directs the federal government to “lead by example” to achieve clean electricity by 2035, yet TVA’s proposed gas plants would “continue to emit greenhouse gases long past that deadline,” SELC said in a statement.
That disconnect could be on the agenda for TVA’s next board meeting, set for February 16, when Biden’s six new TVA board appointees will take their seats and constitute a majority of the nine-person board.
Board powers
TVA’s board “must not allow these reckless gas plans to go unchecked, and should push TVA to invest in cleaner and cheaper power options,” said SELC Tennessee Office Director Amanda Garcia. “TVA’s gas plans will threaten local communities, worsen climate change, and force customers to pay higher monthly power bills to account for rising fossil fuel prices.”
Board responsibilities under the TVA Act, said an SELC spokesperson, include ensuring that TVA is following the law and acting in the best interests of ratepayers. To meet those responsibilities, the spokesperson said, the current TVA board must revoke the TVA CEO’s power to make decisions regarding the gas buildout, a power that the board granted to the CEO in 2021.
Once that power is revoked, the spokesperson said, the board will have approval power over TVA’s decisions, and board members can vote not to fund or approve projects.
Three gas projects
A number of citizens’ groups, as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have challenged TVA’s plans for three gas generation projects.
SELC’s lawsuit challenges a proposed 550 MW of gas units at TVA’s Johnsonville site in Tennessee, claiming that TVA failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Sierra Club and other organizations had shown, the lawsuit says, that solar, storage and demand response could provide “the same reliable, cost-effective energy” as the gas units. The federal lawsuit asks the court to enjoin further construction and operation of the project until TVA has met the NEPA requirements.
A proposed 1450 MW gas unit to replace one of two coal units at TVA’s Cumberland coal plant in Tennessee, greenlighted earlier this month by TVA CEO Jeff Lyash, still depends on approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a proposed 32-mile gas pipeline that would deliver fuel to the site.
The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) has asked FERC to evaluate whether that pipeline is needed, by using current data to evaluate whether solar, wind, energy efficiency and storage would be a better option for replacing the existing coal plant. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, SACE reported, similarly recommended in its comments to FERC that TVA “transparently disclose its modeling methodologies and assumptions to better enable a comparison between the alternatives.”
SELC calls for TVA’s board to stop plans for the Cumberland gas project until TVA fulfills its legal requirements under NEPA, including giving fair consideration to clean energy alternatives, said a spokesperson.
TVA had not yet begun planning to solicit construction proposals for the Cumberland gas project as of last week, according to reporting by Dave Flessner for the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
The Center for Biological Diversity is tracking another proposed 1450 MW gas plant at TVA’s Kingston site in Tennessee, that is “following the same trajectory” as the Cumberland project, and would require a 117-mile pipeline, said Gabriela Sarri-Tobar, an energy justice campaigner with the organization. TVA has not yet released a draft environmental review for the Kingston project.
TVA announced 1500 MW of new gas capacity in 2021 to replace retiring gas units at sites in Alabama and Kentucky, Sarri-Tobar said. TVA issued a “carbon-free” RFP for up to 5,000 MW of generating capacity last July, she added.
Concerns over TVA’s planned gas additions date back at least to 2019, when SACE contested TVA’s modeling for its most recent resource plan that used high projected costs for solar and low costs for methane gas, and capped modeled solar installations at 500 MW per year.
Looking ahead
Last June, the Center for Biological Diversity, anticipating new Biden appointees to TVA’s board, published a “roadmap” showing how board members could “drive the nation’s largest public power provider to 100% renewable energy.” Beyond retiring coal plants and ceasing development of gas plants, the report advises immediately launching TVA’s next resource planning process, and partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to expand renewable and distributed energy resources.
TVA’s next board meeting on February 16 is expected to be open to public attendance and live-streamed as well, said Sarri-Tobar with the Center. For recent meetings, the TVA board has held an in-person listening session at a location in TVA’s service area shortly prior to the board meeting.
TVA provides electricity for 153 local power companies serving 10 million people in Tennessee and parts of six surrounding states, as well as directly to 58 large industrial customers and federal installations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/19/50-states-of-solar-incentives-michigan/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,MICHIGAN,MICHIGAN",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 19, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Michigan,"The pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives last stop was Texas, and now jumps north to Michigan.
Michigan, the Great Lakes State, is located in the upper Midwest and ranks 10th largest by population and 11th by area. It is known as the center of U.S. automotive manufacturing, with three major automobile companies headquartered in the Detroit area.
Last Spring, Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, which proposes that the state gets to 60% renewable energy resources and build infrastructure to accommodate millions of electric vehicles by 2030. The plan has been under development since 2020 when the Governor committed Michigan to achieving economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. This included interim reductions of 28% by 2025, 52% by 2030, and maintaining net negative greenhouse gas emissions after 2050.
The Governor has begun taking steps outlined in the plan. She committed to powering all state facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and attracted battery and electric vehicle manufacturing investments from automakers, who have added 21,600 jobs in the state.
While the roadmap put the state near the top in renewable expectations, it is currently planted squarely in the middle as far as how much solar is installed. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), in 2022 Michigan ranked 25th with just under 1 GW installed, or enough to power 153,000 homes. SEIA projects that the state will install another 2.4 GW over the next five years.

Incentives
Michigan’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) states that 15% of the state’s energy consumption must be from renewable sources.
Net metering ended in the state in 2018, replaced by the “Distributed Generation Program.” This program is similar to net metering because solar users get credit for all the excess energy they send to the grid—but only during the day. The credits vary by utility and are used to offset the power supply portion of their electric bills.
“Michigan EIBC and our member companies have been working for years to address the challenges facing customer-sited distributed energy resources, like rooftop solar and storage, as well as community solar projects in Michigan,” said  Dr. Laura Sherman, president of the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council. “For rooftop solar, one of the biggest challenges is the limit on how much solar can be installed by homeowners and businesses and the limit on how big those solar projects can be.”
Such a limit creates a challenge to any customer thinking about going solar, because they can’t be sure they’ll be able to benefit from net metering. It also presents an obstacle to solar installers who, because of the uncertainty, are cautious about hiring new employees or expanding their businesses.
“We’re working with the legislature to reintroduce bills to eliminate the limits on rooftop solar and ensure that customers are fairly compensated for benefits they provide to the grid,” said Sherman.
Consumers Energy, an investor-owned utility serving over 6 million customers in Michigan, had set a cap of 2% total distributed generation in its territory, which was one of the most restrictive distributed energy ratemaking rules in the nation and had come under fire from solar advocates and environmentalists. In December the utility filed a settlement agreement with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) in its 2022 rate case, agreeing to double the cap from 2% to 4%. The utility now awaits MPSC’s approval on the settlement agreement.
Community solar
Community solar enables those who cannot afford solar on their own homes, or whose homes are not amenable to solar, to benefit from renewable energy. Unfortunately Michigan does not have any community solar legislation in place.
Last year House Bills 4715 and 4716 were presented to the legislature, which—if passed—would allow for the creation and financing of community solar facilities and for subscribers to receive credit for solar produced. The bills would also include mechanisms to ensure that low-income households or service organizations could subscribe to community solar and called for the development of financing options, financial incentives, education and outreach programs. The bills never reached a vote in the last session, but will be reintroduced in the new legislative session in the House and Senate in the coming weeks.
“Here at CCSA, our goal is to pass the legislation, cut red tape, and enable the creation of a community solar program that will give access to customers across Michigan,” said Carlo Cavallaro, Midwest Regional Director of the Coalition of Community Solar Access. “Without legislation passing, customers will not be able to access community solar.”
Michigan EIBC also sees the value in community solar. “It’s important that these projects are driven by communities and generate the greatest benefit to those communities,” said Sherman. “Michigan EIBC is working with partners to reintroduce legislation that would create a legal structure for community solar projects and ensure all Michiganders are able to access the benefits of renewable energy.”
Solar loans
Michigan Saves is a non-profit green bank that offers low-interest loans to homeowners or businesses that want to go solar or go all electric. The program has set a goal to provide $1 billion in clean energy finance by the end of this year, and that includes supporting low- to middle-income individuals.
Cutting rate increase
Last February, Michigan electric utility DTE Energy proposed to implement new charges for future residential solar customers that dissuade people from going solar. But in a win for rooftop solar, the Michigan Public Service Commission announced that it had rejected the plan. This came as part of a November 2022 ruling that rejected the utility’s proposal for a $388 million rate increase, instead approving a $30.5 million increase. The full ruling can be found here.
Landmark installations
The Assembly solar project is the largest solar installation to date in the state of Michigan. Built in three phases, the third and final phase came online early last year. The 346.9 MWdc solar installation spans a total of 1,200 acres in Shiawassee County. It includes 800,000 Longi bifacial solar modules on Nextracker trackers. The project was developed by Ranger Power, a Chicago-based utility-scale solar developer, in partnership with D.E. Shaw Renewable Investment.
The impressive Assembly plant will soon be supplanted as the largest in the state. Ford Motor Company announced through MIGreenPower, a clean energy program run by DTE, that it will add 650 MW of new solar at its headquarters. The company said that by 2025 all of its Michigan-made vehicles will be assembled with the equivalent of 100% carbon-free electricity.
