Because this process is so arduous and forward-looking in nature, the results are not always perfect. Seemingly small oversights can have big financial implications. Different development software and data analysis models recognize this challenge and have been created to make life easier for developers by automating some of the processes.
One such software, developed by Sunfig, a company within Gibraltar’s Renewable Energy Group, the Sunfig Instant Feasibility Tool (SIFT), allows users to determine the optimum design for their projects. It promises 5-to-15% increases in returns for utility-scale solar projects.
The tool was developed to address the seemingly innocuous problems that Sunfig Founder and CEO, Ashton Vandemark, a solar industry veteran, noticed had major implications, including row spacing and optimal tilt angles.
Through years in project development, Vandemark has gained experience in financial and performance modeling, design, and product or technology applications, he told pv magazine. “I was in a unique position to see what was missing in the early stages of the project cycle and connect the dots to help other developers.”
What Vandemark and Sunfig developed is a tool that can accurately process hundreds of layouts, site conditions, performance goals, and financial models in seconds using a cloud-based architecture. The tool operates in a web browser, and, according to Vandemark, has been designed to be as accessible as it is effective.
Within the tool, users can load data regarding what hardware their project is looking to use. This includes everything from modules (bifacial or mono) to the inverter and racking system. Users can then enter their project’s geographic location to get data on expected weather conditions and system output, as well as a look at the terrain and project layout. There’s also an area to include project financial details.
Once these variables are plugged in, the tool delivers hundreds of potential site models, which can be filtered for specific developer interests, such as highest rate of return, lowest levelized cost of energy, or maximum net present value.
The real value that Vandemark sees in SIFT is in how project specifics can be rapidly changed, generating new optimized configurations in seconds.
Vandemark said that SIFT’s approach to site optimization is similar to the difference between answering a question and building on a question that’s already been answered. Whereas other software focuses on supporting developers once they have a design basis, SIFT creates a roadmap to build an understanding of what a project’s possibilities may be at an even earlier stage of the process.
He said a significant amount of engineering exists between a SIFT output and an executed project, but it is available at the very front of the cycle and helps developers make data-driven decisions. “Instead of guessing, executing, and praying, you’re creating a roadmap and identifying the best possible path,” Vandemark said.
Vandemark said that he’d like to see additional upstream capabilities added to SIFT, such as flood zones or other potentially hazardous environmental variables. He also wants to work on the tool’s layout and presentation, specifically in terms of the reports that are generated. He said such changes would be more aesthetic improvements, rather than an overhaul.
When asked about whether or not he’ll add energy storage to the tool, Vandemark said that he has created a storage model, but wants to perfect and simplify it before moving to add that functionality.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/12/answering-your-questions-the-importance-of-soiling-monitoring-mitigation/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 12, 2021",Answering YOUR questions: The importance of soiling monitoring & mitigation,"In June, pv magazine hosted a webinar taking a deep dive into environmental monitoring, SCADA integration, and solar panel cleaning using robotics and automation to increase awareness of soiling losses and emphasize the importance of long-term considerations during development. Featured speakers included Damon Nitzel of OTT HydroMet, Troy Morlan of Nor-Cal Controls, and Carla Dawson of Relysm.
The goal of a pv magazine webinar is to spark interest and conversation with our audience.  Occasionally, it’s just not possible to contain that discussion to a single one-hour webinar timeframe.
Recognizing this, we collected some of the questions that went unanswered in the initial webinar and collaborated with Nitzel, Morlan, and Dawson to conduct an interview, with questions and content entirely sourced by you and your fellow attendees.
If you didn’t attend the webinar when it aired live, fret not. The full replay and presentations are available by following this link. Any entries italicized below denote questions that pertain to a slide or graphic within the presentation.
Q: What irradiance values are considered for the calculation of the Soiling Ratio? Greater than 50 or 100 Watts per square meter?
A: The DustIQ uses an internal LED to generate the measured signal and collect soiling data, which is not influenced by irradiance, so irradiance values were not considered as part of this presentation. This also means the DustIQ provides data day and night as long as the surface of the sensor is dry. The soiling data presented were daily measurement at 1400, so it’s presumed the irradiance was greater than 100 W m-2 for all measurement times, and also that the sensor is dry at this time of day with few exceptions.
Q: Does DustIQ measure uneven soiling in utility scale sites?
A: DustIQ assumes there is uniform soiling. Installing multiple DustIQ gives a plant profile which can account for uneven soiling.
Q: What is the optimal number of soiling stations per area to ensure accuracy?
A: IEC 61724-1:2021 Class A sites require a minimum number of soiling sensors per MW (see table below). We recommend using this as a starting guideline to determine the quantity of sensors needed in order for the soiling measurements to be representative of the soiling across the arrays. Inter- and Intra-site variability (farm activity, maintenance roads, atmospheric dust, car exhaust, and so on), as well as cleaning zones are all factors to consider where additional soiling measurements might be needed to represent a unique area of soiling within a large site or amongst a portfolio of smaller sites.

Q: Question regarding the number. I think I’m confused because it seems that the cost to clean about $1.2M over 10 years. And the savings over 30 years is about $3.6M. This would appear to be a net wash of $0. Is this accurate?
A: The cleaning cost was included in the total savings calculation. Revenue loss is expected revenue, minus actual revenue. Actual revenue is energy sold, minus cleaning costs. When no action is taken, there are no cleaning costs, but also less production. When cleaning costs are higher than recovered production, this results in a net less (manual cleaning example). When cleaning costs are optimized, cleaning costs are less than recovered production and this results “savings” relative to taking no action (semi-automated examples).
Q: How is manual cleaning giving higher percentage in revenue loss than no cleaning?
A: In this case study, manual cleaning resulted in a higher revenue loss because the cost of manual cleaning was higher than the cost to wait for rain to do the cleaning. This does assume that the major rain event (the 2nd event after the manual cleaning, seen in the blue line in the presentation) does completely clean the panels from a more heavily soiled state than they were in the actual data, so there may be a small (1-2%) error introduced by this assumption.
Regions with lower labor rates may not pencil out the same, and manual cleaning will save revenue. In some cases, manual cleaning rates will be more effective than semi-automated tractor rates, such as in Pakistan where manual cleaning was reported as $200/MW.
Q: How often should we collect soiling data? Is daily sufficient, or as high as per minute?
A: One measurement per minute, with the intent to have one correct daily value. There are situations, like sand storms, where real-time data may give earlier warning of maintenance needs, but most sites per day will rarely use intra-day data. An exception would be higher soiling rate locations that are using fully automated solutions.
Q: How long does it take to clean? Are you considering that the cleaning is performed in one day?
A: For this case study, only for simplicity, we did assume that the entire 100 MW site was cleaned in a single day. In reality, 1-2 weeks would be a more realistic cleaning time frame. However, given consistent soiling rates present in this data, we do not believe there would be significant differences in the outcomes if we accounted for 1/12th cleaning per day.
Q: Do you consider in your model potentially non-linear losses associated to inhomogeneous soiling (mismatch, hot spots, and so on)?
A: For this case study, we assumed that the soiling measurements were 100% representative of the soiling on the panels. A single sensor at a 100 MW site is unlikely to match this assumption, but increasing the soiling data density with multiple sensors will bring the soiling data closer to 100% representation of actual soiling on the panels.
We expect intra-site variability and suggest installing soiling monitoring equipment in zones that are representative of unique circumstances. It’s quite possible partial site cleaning for more heavily soiled zones will be the most effective approach, or recover the most soiling loss, compared to cleaning a whole site averaged and treated as a whole.
Q: For automatic robot cleaning, what is the cleaning cycle considered? One cycle per day or less frequent?
A: Typically, automated solutions are expected to clean at least once per day. But, why limit yourself to a set schedule? Pairing automation and soiling data will save power and lifetime of the automation equipment and solar panel surface by only cleaning when it is necessary to optimize production, whether that is multiple times a day or skipping days.
Q: In a scenario where robotic-non-water cleaning is the intended long-term solution, is there no negative impact on soiling expected?
A: Cleaning with water has to be done at some point in time. Dry cleaning is great for day to day soiling issue but eventually you have to clean with water because dry cleaning does not avoid cementation. Even in the driest parts of the world, there is dew and dew leads to cementation.
Q: Is the same equipment used to clean bifacial panels as mono-facial?
A: There are several ways to go about doing this:
Q: Is water used in the cleaning “recycled” through the cleaning process, or does the used water flow to the ground?
A: Water is not recycled in the current cleaning methodologies. It is wasted and there is room for improvement.
Q: Do the robotic and tractor cleaning studies take corrective and preventive maintenance estimates of those pieces of equipment in to consideration?
A: Yes. The values shown in the webinar take into consideration solar panel cleaning robot operational expenditure values and more. The financial studies took into consideration O&M for the machinery and other factors.
Q: Cleaning brush scouring is probably minimal, but soiling can be very abrasive. What is the transmission degradation rate due to scouring by abrasive soiling (creating reflective scratches in the panel glass)?
A: This is a very good thing to look into. Before you buy any cleaning machinery, you should know the abrasion levels or, better yet, check if the machinery is certified by the PV panel manufacturer. For the systems shown, we do not have the abrasion levels because we have the PV panel manufacturers’ certification.
Q: Is it possible to use air for cleaning?
A: Air cleaning is being used and it has partial efficacy. It only works in very arid areas and some kind of brush or fabric is used with air to accomplish cleaning the PV panels. Air cleaning alone does not do the job.
Q: Does the rate of soiling have any relation to module degradation over the lifetime of the site? Is weather forecasting taken into consideration for determining module soiling loss over the lifetime of the site?
A: To my knowledge, there is no news of soiling-related degradation, but there could be, as soiled areas usually get hotter. It can make sense to take weather forecasting into account to determine soiling loss over the lifetime. Rain is considered a cleaning mechanism for soiling.
Q: Has any data been published comparing DustIQ soiling measurements vs a two panel setup (clean module / dirty module) vs IV curve measurements in the field?
A: As far as I know there was work done in Spain and Morocco and an approach in Saudi Arabia. A publication about Morocco is in preparation, but it has been underway for a while and progress has been slow. The Morocco publication focuses more on the incidence angle effect and not on real soiling values.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/12/solar-at-a-utah-landfill-joins-a-growing-number-of-projects-on-brownfield-sites/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MASSACHUSETTS,TEXAS,UNITED STATES,UTAH",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 12, 2021",Solar at a Utah landfill joins a growing number of projects on brownfield sites,"A 4.7 MW community solar project enters service this summer on a landfill in Spanish Fork, Utah, just south of Provo. The project was designed and installed by Prometheus Power, and Solar FlexRack provided the mounting system. The 27-acre project is expected to provide enough power for 3,000 homes, said Solar FlexRack.
Landfills are increasingly playing host to solar facilities, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reporting an 80% rise in such projects across the U.S. over the last five years.
While the projects work well to make use of otherwise compromised land, installing on a landfill comes with its own set of challenges. One big hurdle is that installers typically cannot penetrate the landfill’s surface, which means that mounting hardware and foundational structures must be adaptable and lighter.
Solar FlexRack said it used its Series B Cast-in-place (CIP) mounting technology, which offered customizable blocks and a two-support system that reduced block thickness. The mounting system’s lighter ballasts and array profile flexibility can translate to lower project costs, said FlexRack. The mounting system benefits from internal bracing and fewer components, making it faster and easier to install.
The EPA tracks solar landfill-topping installations as part of its RE-Powering America’s Land initiative. Nearly 60% of all the projects tracked by the initiative sit on landfills, and more than 90% of those are solar PV. Massachusetts leads the field with 30% of the country’s landfill projects installed there.

As of October 2020, the EPA had identified 417 renewable energy installations on 390 contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites, with a cumulative installed capacity of 1.85 GW. Nearly 70% of those projects were systems of 1 MW or more.
One of the largest is near Houston, where the 50 MW Sunnyside solar facility is planned for a 240-acre landfill. It is expected to reach operation by the end of 2022.

And earlier in 2021, Source Renewables, a New York clean energy developer, said it planned to use a landfill in South Buffalo as the host site for two community solar arrays totaling 10 MW. According to the company, the project would consist of two 5 MW solar arrays expected to produce enough electricity to power more than 2,500 households per year.
EPA said that a favorable policy climate is important when it comes to supporting RE-Powering sites. It said that Massachusetts’ SMART Program offers enhanced incentives for landfill and brownfield development, and a fast-track project approval process. New Jersey and Illinois have also made strides in policy and utility involvement, said the EPA.
A majority of the sites tracked by EPA are either municipally or privately owned, with around 1.5 GW of the 1.8 GW installed capacity falling under that ownership structure. Two-thirds of the projects sell power back to the grid, and 22% are community solar projects like the one in Spanish Fork.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/12/sunrise-brief-convalt-energy-wins-approval-for-a-700-mw-solar-module-production-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 12, 2021",Sunrise brief: Convalt Energy wins approval for a 700 MW solar module production plant,"Local officials in upstate New York approved a development proposal that moves Convalt Energy one step closer to building a facility to produce around 700 MW of solar modules each year.
Convalt is developing a factory in Watertown, New York, that could open in 2022 using solar manufacturing lines it acquired earlier this year from SunPower.
In January, PV module manufacturer Sunpower said it was closing its module plant in Hillsboro, Oregon. Sunpower started production of its P-series modules at the facility in February 2019, but decided to shift from PV manufacturing to providing rooftop PV arrays and storage systems.
In early July, industrial development officials in Jefferson County, New York, approved a plan for Convalt to build a 300,000-square-foot module manufacturing facility. The plant is expected to employ 300 people at the start, an increase from the roughly 170 people who were laid off when Sunpower closed its Oregon operations.
Convalt reportedly is working to line up construction financing as well as government incentives before it moves ahead on the project. Convalt was founded in 2011 and is a portfolio company of ACO Investment Group. To date, it has developed renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia and Africa.
In June, First Solar said it would invest $680 million to expand its domestic U.S. photovoltaic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually, representing an implied capital expenditure of around $0.20 per watt. The new facility in Ohio is expected to start operations in the first half of 2023, and reach full nameplate capacity in 2025.
Canadian Solar said it was awarded the first utility-scale battery storage project in Colombia of 45 MW / 45 MWh.
The project award came through a public tender launched by Colombia’s Ministry of Energy and Mines via its affiliate UPME, the Mining and Energy Planning Unit. Located in the city of Barranquilla in northern Colombia, the project will consist of a 45 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system, and is expected to reach commercial operation by June 2023. The project has a 15-year revenue structure with the Colombian government and is indexed to the country’s inflation or producer price index.
The Barranquilla project is expected to strengthen the electricity transmission network in the Atlántico Department in northern Colombia, support government efforts to prevent future supply deficits, and enable greater penetration of renewable energy.
A report from Environment California Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group advocates for installing more rooftop solar in California as a way to increase renewable electricity generation while also protecting the state’s open spaces.
Laura Deehan, state director at Environment California Research & Policy Center, said that panels are quick to install and “don’t use up precious open space.” She said that the state should be doing “everything in its power” to accelerate rooftop solar.

The report said that for the state to reach its renewable energy goals, it will need to add 28.5 GW of rooftop solar, nearly quadrupling its current rooftop solar capacity. Adding that much rooftop solar capacity would enable California to maintain existing land uses on more than 148,000 acres of land, an area about half the size of Los Angeles.
The report also said that new rooftop solar projects typically are completed within three months, meaning that they can begin producing power faster than conventional resources. Rooftop solar also helps with water conservation efforts, since it requires no water for installation or cooling.
The report noted that the California Public Utilities Commission is currently considering changes to the state’s net metering program, which pays solar owners for the excess electricity that they sell back to the grid.
“The utility proposal to wipe out net metering would stall the growth of rooftop solar in the Golden State,” said Deehan.
Babcock & Wilcox and the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory signed an Intellectual Property Option Agreement that gives B&W field-limited exclusive rights to negotiate a licensing agreement that would allow it to market an advanced, particle-based thermal energy storage technology currently in development.
B&W is part of NREL’s Duration Addition to electricitY Storage (DAYS) Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) team, which is developing an innovative electric particle heater, pressurized fluidized-bed heat exchanger, a long-term thermal energy storage system that stores energy up to 100 hours, and other technologies to allow power producers to store
solar or wind energy to generate continuous, reliable, grid-scale power.
B&W said its fluidized-bed heat exchanger will be able to generate up to 135 MW of power for up to 100 hours from stored thermal energy with zero CO2 emissions. By facilitating long-term storage, the technology is expected to enable power producers to deliver power to the grid 24-hours a day, including during periods of peak demand, or when solar or wind are not optimal conditions.”
