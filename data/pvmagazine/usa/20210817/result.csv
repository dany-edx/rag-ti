Large-scale decarbonization of the electricity sector could move solar from 3% of generation today to over 40% by 2035.
An issue brief released by the Department of Energy (DOE) said that billions of dollars in investment will need to be made through 2050 across clean energy generation, energy storage, electricity delivery, and operations and maintenance. Such investment could result in anywhere from 500,000–1,500,000 people working in solar by 2035.
The brief said that despite the impact of the pandemic on the economy, the U.S. installed nearly 20 GWdc of solar PV in 2020, the largest yearly total ever. It said that according to recent Energy Information Administration figures, 15 GWac of utility-scale PV projects are currently under construction, 7 GWac have received regulatory approval, and 20 GWac are planned. At the end of 2020, more than 450 GW of solar and solar plus storage projects had applied for interconnection to the bulk power system, or 54% of all active projects.
The brief said that achieving an electricity cost of $0.05/kWh translates to an installed cost of about $1.40 per watt. That is roughly $8,400 for a typical 6 kW residential system. The cost target is lower than the current national average of $3.80/watt, and represents a potential cost savings of $14,000.
The employment projections come despite what the DOE brief described as “relatively flat growth” in jobs over the past several years. Data showed that solar employment peaked in 2016 at around 260,000 jobs and fell to 231,ooo in 2020. The report said that the decline is due to an increase of labor productivity in both residential and utility-scale solar deployment since 2010. It also noted that the industry was hit by the economic shutdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as the number of workers who spend at least half of their time on solar-related work dropped 6.7% in 2020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/17/first-solar-breaks-ground-on-3-3-gwdc-production-facility/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,OHIO",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 17, 2021",First Solar breaks ground on 3.3 GWdc production facility,"First Solar broke ground August 17 on its third manufacturing facility in Ohio. The ceremony was attended by U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, among others.
The new 3.3 GWdc facility is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2023 and represents a $680 million investment. When fully operational, the facility is expected to scale the company’s Northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GWdc.
The facility is forecast to create over 700 permanent jobs in addition to the over 1,600 people that First Solar currently employs in Ohio. Founded in 1999, First Solar has had a manufacturing presence in the state since it began commercial production at its original Perrysburg factory in 2002, when it produced 1.5 MWdc of modules and employed 150 people. Since then the company has invested over $2 billion in expanding its Ohio manufacturing presence, making the state home to one of the largest photovoltaic solar manufacturing footprints in the Western Hemisphere when it commissioned its second factory in 2019.
The new facility will enable First Solar to produce an anticipated average of one module roughly every 2.75 seconds across its three-factory Ohio footprint once it achieves its full production capacity. The facility will include machine-to-machine communication, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things connectivity.
The 1.8 million-square-foot facility is expected to produce an enhanced thin film PV module for the utility-scale solar market in the U.S., and is anticipated to have a higher efficiency and wattage in a larger form factor.
The new facility will be built by Rudolph Libbe, Inc., and is expected to create 500 construction jobs over the next 18 months.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/17/perovskite-silicon-tandems-could-rapidly-scale-solar/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 17, 2021",Perovskite-silicon tandems could rapidly scale solar,"Researchers at Oxford PV, an Oxford University spin-off working in the field of perovskites have been working on an efficiency solution that they said can help scale-up solar more rapidly.
The group is using perovskites to squeeze more power out of a solar cell, pushing past the 26% efficiency barrier presently achieved by silicon-only cells, and working to press against the “Shockley-Queisser” limit observed in photovoltaic materials.
Perovskites fulfill all the optoelectronic requirements for a PV cell, and can be manufactured using existing processes. Perovskites can be layered onto a conventional cell in tandem with silicon. These features, said the developers, make perovskites ideal plug-and-play materials to integrate with silicon technology.
Metal halide perovskites have been targeted by the research community for their properties, and have been under research and development for over a decade.
Perovskites are, in many ways, a foil to silicon, said the researchers. While silicon is a weakly absorbing material that requires hundreds of micrometers of thickness to fully absorb sunlight due to its indirect bandgap, perovskites are strongly absorbing, direct bandgap semiconductors. As such, they need less than a micrometer of material thickness.
Oxford PV
Silicon requires energy-intensive fabrication processes to create high-purity single crystals necessary for low-defect densities, where perovskites are inherently defect tolerant and can be processed at low-temperatures into polycrystalline cells. 
While the two materials behave quite differently, the end result is two high-quality materials that can deliver power conversion efficiencies around 26% using low-cost fabrication routes.
The increase in efficiency created by perovskite-tandem cells can help offset some of the carbon emissions needed to produce high-purity silicon used for conventional solar PV cells, said Oxford PV.
Combining the perovskites in tandem with silicon rather than rebuilding a process for pure-perovskite or other material combination cell bypasses industry disruptions, allowing for a faster and less costly scale-up of manufacturing improved technologies. Furthermore, existing supply chains already contain the physical elements that comprise perovskite materials, paving a clear path to scale-up the technology rapidly.
Higher-efficiency cells do exist, like the III-V multi-junction devices built by Spectrolab and Azur Space. However, these are typically used in outer space, where cost is less critical than minimizing wafer area. These cells can operate at 40% efficiencies, but are expensive, and currently cannot compete with the conventional silicon market in a way that tandem cells could.
Oxford PV has been researching tandem cells for seven years, and the group said it is now close to starting mass commercial production in a factory in Brandenburg, Germany. The International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics forecasts the entry of tandem cells into the market after 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/17/solar-modules-are-being-detained-by-customs-agents-reports-suggest/,"LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 17, 2021","Solar modules are being detained by customs agents, reports suggest","Solar module shipments to the U.S. appear to have been detained by Customs and Border Protection agents as part of an enforcement action aimed at banning the import of solar equipment containing components provided by a Chinese company suspected of using forced labor.
Roth Capital Partners said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. The analyst said that Jinko may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
Canadian Solar also was said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar may have had six testing samples detained in July.
Action taken on June 24 by the Biden administration included a “Withhold Release Order” by the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) against Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Withhold Release Order instructs personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
(Read “Border action ordered for solar components made by Chinese manufacturer.”)
The CBP acted in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labor being in the solar supply chain in the Xinjiang region of China. The report that modules actually were being detained was among the first indication that enforcement action may be under way.
A spokesperson for JinkoSolar said the company would not comment on the report. Requests by pv magazine USA for comment from Canadian Solar and Trina Solar were not immediately returned.
Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said that “almost any module coming to the U.S. cannot yet prove it does not have Hoshine silicon metal.” He said that traceability protocols do not yet go far enough up the supply chain. In addition, it may take 6-12 months to develop the traceability capability up through silicon metal or quartz. Shen said that solar cells may be manufactured in Southeast Asia, Europe or the U.S., “but the challenge is that 95-99% of the world’s wafers come from China.”
In a related move, a group called the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed petitions requesting that the Department of Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The group said in a trio of petitions totaling more than 600 pages that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
Timothy Brightbill, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Wiley Rein, declined to identify the companies that joined in filing the petitions. In an email, he said that “Given the Chinese control of the entire solar supply chain, retaliation is likely if their identities are revealed.” He said that in such situations, the companies who make up the coalition “are allowed under U.S. law to remain confidential.”
The organization said that while Chinese companies “now almost exclusively” export to the United States from Southeast Asia, “the vast majority” of manufacturing, research and development, and capital investment remain in China. The group called for duties on Chinese solar products to be extended to what it said were “circumventing entities.”
The group asked the Commerce Department to investigate the following companies:
Malaysia: Jinko Solar Technology Sdn. Bhd.; LONGi (Kuching) Sdn. Bhd. and its affiliate Vina Cell Technology Company Limited and Vina Solar Technology Company Limited; JA Solar (Malaysia) Co., Ltd. or JA Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.
Thailand: Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Trina Solar Science & Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Talesun Solar Technologies Thailand or Talesun Technologies (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Astroenergy Solar Thailand Co., Ltd

Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, has acquired a 270 MW, construction-ready solar project, dubbed Project Parker, from OCI Solar Power.
When construction is commenced later this year, Project Parker will be built on adjacent properties in Falls County, Texas, just south of Waco and will be comprised of more than 2,900 solar panels. Other hardware specifications, like the choice of mounting systems or inverters, have not yet been made public.
Prior to the project’s acquisition, OCI Solar secured site control and completed all permitting and electrical interconnection agreements. Buckeye plans to start project design and construction later this year with the goal of bringing the project online in first quarter 2023.
Buckeye, which is now owned by IFM Investors, an Australian financial company, is in the process of transitioning itself as a company, having historically operated as network for the transportation, sale, and processing of liquid petroleum products. The company operates a “tank field” to store petroleum products within Falls County.
In a statement, Buckeye President and CEO Clark Smith said of the acquisition:
“As we continue to evolve into a more diversified energy company, acquisitions like Project Parker represent an opportunity to invest in growth that aligns with our business and ESG priorities, and leverages our existing expertise and capabilities.”

Soltech Energy, a Swedish PV system integrator and solar product supplier, is building several PV facades in its home market. It recently installed a 646.6 kW solar facade on a newly built garage with 300 EV–charging posts in Gothenburg, Sweden, by adopting a special design it has developed for buildings with particular airflow patterns.
The flow of air in the garage is important because of exhaust from the vehicles. The facade is open so the air exchange does not need to be measured, as it is far beyond the required levels for garages, according to the company. It also claims that the air flow is beneficial for the temperature of the panels.
“The facade is being built with semi-transparent modules that requires a certain tilt angle and, at the same time, it is placed on a building wall that needs a high exchange of airflow between its inner and outer parts,” the company’s chief innovation officer, Anna Svensson, told pv magazine.
“For these reasons, we decided to use a prefabricated, 11-meter hot-dipped galvanized steel construction built by our unit Fasadsystem, which allows the deployment of the panels with the required tilt angle before the structure is attached to the wall, and also the necessary air passages for the garage walls through interstices present between the horizontal rows of panels.“

This structure and module configuration, according to Svensson, facilitate easy, high-quality, fast installations, as it only took about a month and a half to install and put the garage project into operation. It also ensures that, from approximately 2 meters away, only the color of the solar panels is visible, although thin black lines are also visible from close up.
“The glass is not chromatic and the thin black lines are the solar substrate but you only see them standing at a distance lower than two meters and if you are further away you only see one color on the entire panel,” Svensson explained. “The technique to create the visual impact is very old for normal patterns and is called ‘raster graphics’.”
Svensson said that the client, Swedish property company Wallenstam, wanted the area to be inspired by patterns and colors of Swedish designer Viola Gråsten, who helped popularize brightly colored rya pile carpets in the 1950s. Raster graphics are digital images created with tiny rectangular pixels arranged in a grid formation. They are usually built with chromatic gradations, different lines and shapes, and complex compositions.

The grid-connected solar facade supplies electricity for the garage, which features approximately 300 charging boxes for electric cars. The system includes 1,096 semi-transparent glass-glass frameless panels with 40% transparency and a power output of 54 kW.
Chinese manufacturer Advanced Solar Power supplied the modules. The modules measure 1,200 mm x 600 mm x 6.8 mm and weigh 11.8 kg, with a total surface of 0.72 square meters. The thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panels are available in red, blue, orange, and green. 
Svensson said the PV facade concept can be compared to any decor facade.
“You can have it at a garage as an open facade, but you can also have it on a building as a decor facade and then add a closed facade behind,” she said.

Chinese PV module maker JinkoSolar began work on a $500 million ingot and wafer manufacturing facility in the coastal economic zone of Vietnam’s Quang Ninh province in the second quarter of this year.
The facility is expected to begin manufacturing activities within six months and to serve the company’s cell and module assembly factories in Malaysia, as well as the module assembly facility in the United States.
The manufacturer said planning on the 7 GW factory started in late 2020, with the Vietnamese government giving the approval for the project in March 2021.
“The investment decision was made in the second half of last year, prior to the ongoing trade issue with the United States,” it told pv magazine. Vietnamese media claim the new factory is being built to diversify the company’s supply chain away from China and as an answer to new requirements from western countries and suppliers.
The trade issue referred to by JinkoSolar relates to the alleged use of forced labor in China’s Xinjiang province. The U.S. government announced it wants to ban products from four Xinjiang-based solar manufacturers over those allegations in late June. JinkoSolar was not among the companies named at the time.
The module manufacturer also stressed that the new factory is part of its plan to diversify its production globally.
“While overseas supply chains are often associated with slightly higher costs, this investment is expected to assuage concerns by developers and off-takers about the security of supply – an invaluable asset for one of the largest solar module manufacturers in the world,” it said.

In its second quarter earnings statement, the company said it had revenues of $4.3 million. That was up 57% from the same quarter in 2020. Year-to-date revenue was $11.6 million, up 71% from the same time a year earlier.
The company reported a gross profit of a negative $0.6 million compared to breakeven during the second quarter in the prior year. Year-to-date gross profit was a negative $0.5 million compared to $0.3 million during the same period in 2020. It said the  declines were due to issues related to the pandemic, specifically labor shortages and industry-wide increases in material and component prices.
Total backlog reached $77 million at end of second quarter, versus $61 million and $26 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2020 and second quarter 2020, respectively. The company said awards in the quarter were driven by several projects in new markets. Management said it expects to realize revenue on nearly all its current backlog over the next 12-18 months.
Looking ahead, the company said it created a new division to focus on the residential and small commercial market. Its iSun Residential unit will consolidate multiple existing residential and commercial solar installers. The company aims to  build a portfolio of 7,500 customers generating 75 MW of power at a run rate of $75 million by the end of 2022.
