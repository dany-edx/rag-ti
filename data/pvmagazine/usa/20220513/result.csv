The electric grid’s functional collapse during the storm was an example of the Texas ERCOT grid’s failure of achieving those mandated goals. By some estimates, the storm caused $130 billion in near-term economic damages, and the long-term consequences have not yet been fully assessed.
The sudden spike in unplanned-for energy demand caused by extreme weather led to wholesale market spot prices skyrocketing up to $9,000/MW, and that price held for over three days. Historically, the price cap is only hit momentarily, and pressures are relieved quickly, but this storm was described as a “tail event” that caused unusual levels of strain on the grid.
This was caused by a combination of nonfunctioning natural gas equipment, and congestion on the grid from intense localized energy demand, that caused substations to cut power to stabilize the grid. A study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found 87% of the outages were caused by issues with natural gas supply as uninsulated stations failed to function.
However, was winter storm Uri really a “tail event?”
Commenting on the concept at the RE+ conference in San Antonio, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said, “The past as a model for the future is not true anymore. One hundred-year storms occur every five years. What is normal? What is baseline?”
The panel Hopper led at RE+ on the ERCOT grid shared that 40,000 power outage events occurred in the US last year. That is a 50% year-over-year increase over 2020.
The figures highlight two problems. First, the centralized grid is failing the people who rely on it. Second, the climate is adding more pressures that will need to be dealt with to keep these systems running adequately.
Two key modes of thinking related to climate response are mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation is fighting the source of climate change itself, which for the energy sector means phasing out fossil fuels and increasing the use of non-emitting energy sources. Adaptation relates to adjusting the way we operate to recognize changes on the Earth and better prepare for those changes. Solar and batteries can help with both.
Mitigation
A lot of climate talk is centered around mitigation. At the RE+ conference, the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) shared that 70% of utilities have a 100% clean energy goal. The White House has also set goals for 100% carbon-free energy by 2035. The less carbon emitted, the more we can stave off the worst effects of climate change. 
This is one of the main reasons we see the ERCOT project queues full of solar projects. PV projects with signed interconnection agreements with expected commercial operations dates through 2024 total over 9.1 GW in capacity. 
Adaptation
The other element of climate response, adaptation, is coming increasingly under focus as the international community fails to coherently cooperate on mitigation efforts.
This is where energy storage comes into play, and where intelligent planning of the grid is critical. At RE+ San Antonio, residential installer Sunrun shared that its home battery systems provided 234,000 hours of backup power following winter storm Uri. Interest in batteries skyrocketed, with hits on Sunrun’s battery-related website pages increasing 350% in the direct aftermath. This backup was about more than just comfort, but also about safety. Uri took an estimated 246 lives of Texans.
The financial costs of such events are massive, too, and retail energy providers who did not properly hedge against the risks of the volatile ERCOT wholesale market were hit with fees so sharp they went out of business overnight. Homeowners in predatory contracts were also exposed directly to the wholesale market, and many were faced with multi-thousand-dollar utility bills.
As explained above, congestion on the grid was a key cause of the problem. Delivering power from generation centers in remote places across long distances to load centers in large cities often runs into bottlenecks, leading to curtailment and scheduled blackouts.
Unfortunately, this congestion problem might worsen due to the way that solar and wind energy are being deployed across Texas’ ERCOT grid.
A vast bulk of the large-scale solar projects are in the western, sunnier part of Texas, and are delivered to population centers in the east. The issue can be looked at as a microcosm of the entire United States, where legislators are suggesting building a transmission superhighway from the west to the eastern seaboard.
Congestion rents, or the cost of transmission services, are expected to worsen in many areas across ERCOT, despite hundreds of millions of dollars planned to build transmission to alleviate the congestion.
Solar and batteries to the rescue
Solar and batteries can serve a critical role in alleviating this congestion, reducing renewables curtailment, smoothing the curve of wholesale market demand spikes, and providing critical backup power in times of crisis.
When located closer to load centers, or the location of energy demand, batteries can readily dispatch backup power. By locating the batteries as “nodes” further down the grid, pressure is taken off key bottlenecks like substations, which shut down in times of extreme peak demand, and are extremely expensive to upgrade.
Batteries can also serve as peak-demand shavers, avoiding those massive spikes in wholesale market volatility. This is the main way they are currently deployed in ERCOT, and peak demand shaving represents a massive market opportunity. At RE+ utility-scale solar and storage developer 8-minute energy shared that 95% of the revenue generated by a two-hour duration battery is earned in the first hour of dispatch. 8minute said the market opportunities for batteries could be improved, if “predefined revenue streams” are created, like in the capacity-based, forward looking market of California’s CAISO grid.
Ali Chowdhury, vice president of transmission and interconnection at 8minute shared that there is a lot of uncertainty in the planning of transmission buildout, which has been hampering the buildout of solar. He said transmission can take at least five to ten years to build, and ERCOT is at a standstill in the financial planning process. 
Meanwhile, distributed battery energy storage can be dispatched quite quickly. Considering the mounting pressures on the Texas grid, and of the United States at large, a strategy of deploying distributed solar and battery energy storage may be the best strategy at hand for both climate mitigation and adaptation.

Long duration energy storage can increase local control of the power system, build resilience for communities, minimize power grid disruptions, and help reach the USgoal of 100% clean electricity by 2035.
“The ability to move cheaper, cleaner electricity where and when it is needed most is the linchpin to a reliable energy grid and critical to meeting President Biden’s clean energy goals,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “The Long Duration Energy Storage for Everyone, Everywhere initiative leverages the expertise of the Department, National Labs, and industry to drive next-generation energy storage — making solar power available when the sun isn’t shining and keeping wind energy on tap when there’s no breeze.”
Shorter duration storage is currently being installed to support the renewable energy generation and electrification being added to the grid in record numbers. With help from investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, more grid-connected renewables will be deployed and building and vehicle electrification will continue to rise. Cheaper and more efficient systems that can store energy for more than 10 hours at a time would support a low-cost, reliable, carbon-free electric grid.
The initiative, administered through DOE’s new Office of Clean Energy Demonstratons will invest approximately $505 million over four years to validate grid-scale long duration energy storage technologies and enhance the capabilities of customers and communities to integrate grid storage more effectively.
The DOE will implement three energy storage demonstration programs:
The DOE is also collaborating with the US Department of Defense for long duration storage demonstrations on government facilities.
Long Duration Storage Shot
DOE’s Long Duration Storage Shot, launched in July 2021, set a target of achieving a levelized cost of energy storage of $0.05/kWh, a 90% reduction from a 2020 baseline costs by 2030. Achieving this cost target will make dispatchable clean energy available through long duration energy storage the most cost-effective choice for electricity customers. To meet this target, a wide range of energy storage technologies, including electrochemical, mechanical, thermal, flexible generation, flexible buildings, and power electronics, will need to be considered, well beyond the traditional lithium-ion batteries.
In March, DOE’s Energy Storage for Social Equity Initiative selected 14 communities to receive technical assistance to leverage energy storage as a means of increasing resilience and long-term affordability. Consistent with the Justice40 Initiative, this initiative supports the goal that 40% of the benefits from climate investments flow to disadvantaged communities.
The RFI seeks public input to help inform DOE’s implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The RFI seeks input on:
Comments must be received by 5:00 PM EDT on June 16, 2022, and can be submitted by mailing EnergyStorage41001RFI@ee.doe.gov. A public webinarwill be held to provide additional information.

To increase community engagement with the developers and educate on the benefits of community solar, the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy, a non-profit grassroots environmental organization in Norway, will educate the community and bring subscribers to the project.
The Norway installation is one project in a 12-project, 38 MW portfolio that UGE is developing in Maine. In total, the company has developed more than 700 projects with a combined capacity over 500 MW.
In addition to saving on energy costs, the Town of Norway will earn long-term lease revenue on the land where the project will be built.
“The new community solar farm will provide financial support for our town and for local businesses for decades to come,” said Dennis Lajoie, town manager of Norway. “We hope to serve as an example for other small towns, encouraging them to turn underutilized land into sources of clean energy and revenue that can be re-invested in their communities.”
The Norway project will all  but certainly operate under Maine’s NEB program, which allows customers to benefit from clean energy savings by offsetting their electrical bills with either owned or shared energy projects, like community solar, which, in turn, spurs further development of these assets within the state. The NEB program has become critical in establishing a healthy and growing community solar market in Maine.

BlueWave will continue to operate under the same name and with its team in place.
Axium is committed to integrating Environmental Social Governance (ESG) throughout its project development and management process, which aligns well with BlueWave’s mission to transform access to renewable energy through a responsible development philosophy.
BlueWave is known for its community solar, agrivoltaics, and floatovoltaic projects. Its 150 MW portfolio collectively generates enough solar energy to avoid more than 144,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually. The company recently announced the spin-off of Perch Energy, which will focus on community solar installations. An example agrivoltaic project of BlueWave’s was developed in Maine along with Navisun. The project, which is owned by Navisun, combines solar with blueberries by positioning solar panels above the existing wild blueberry farm field.
While Axium has other asset-based investments in the renewable energy sector, this will be Axium’s first renewable energy development company acquisition. The acquisition will enable BlueWave to build, own and manage projects within its development portfolio. The company will begin by building a team to transition to long-term asset ownership and to focus on company growth.
“This acquisition marks a pivotal new period in BlueWave’s history. It was crucial for us to find a like-minded owner who shares in our mission to revolutionize renewable energy and to help us scale, and that partner is unequivocally Axium” said Trevor Hardy, CEO of BlueWave. “Axium’s ownership will enable tremendous growth opportunities as we look to own and operate our development assets and continue pioneering in dual-use solar development, storage development and accessibility of renewable energy for low- to middle income communities.”
“BlueWave is thrilled to join forces with such a deeply committed, mission-driven, ESG investor. Axium and BlueWave share common values and purpose and are united in a vision for achieving significant growth, innovation, and impact in the climate battle. It’s a wonderful match, and with the talent and resources Axium adds to the equation, I have every confidence we will achieve that vision,” said John DeVillars, Co-Founder and Chairman of BlueWave.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/13/commonbond-banks-on-residential-solar-financing-success/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 13, 2022",CommonBond banks on residential solar financing success,"Financing provider CommonBond has recognized the boom in residential solar has just begun, announcing it has pivoted its business to focus exclusively on solar financing.
Its solar financing product was soft launched in 2021, and rapidly grew to be the company’s largest business. The company said there’s a lot of room to run yet, as only 3 to 4% of US households are topped with PV.
CommonBond will be stepping away from its student loan origination business on June 15. Current student loan customers will be serviced by Firstmark Services. Current CommonBond customers will also get preferential access to solar financing options, as will the company’s corporate partners, said the company.
The company expressed interest in entering other “green lending” markets. Consumer desires are becoming increasingly focused on sustainable solutions, and businesses are adopting environmental, social, and governance goals readily, opening opportunities for CommonBond to serve.
“We are excited by the impact we’re having in the residential solar market,” said David Klein, ceo and co-founder of CommonBond. “Every day, we hear the stories of our customers saving money on their electricity bill and reducing their annual coal consumption by tons – literally, tons – because of the solar adoption we are enabling. It’s incredibly rewarding.”
“This is a giant step forward,” said Brian Hirsch, Managing Director at Tribeca Venture Partners and CommonBond board member. “We are still very early in the consumer adoption cycle of renewable energy, and there needs to be enablers of mass adoption. Digitally native financing is one of those enablers, and that is one of CommonBond’s core strengths.”
CommonBond’s solar financing product was fully launched in February 2022. At launch, the company projected it was on pace to perform $1 billion in residential solar project originations this year.
Solar financing is a common path to owning a PV system. SolarReviews said secured loans such as HELOC run between 3 to 8.5% APR, depending on credit score. The rate of PACE loans tends to be higher, with APRs between 6.5 to 8.5%. Unsecured loans have higher APRs, and generally vary widely in their APRs. In general, they range 6 to 30%, and having a good credit score helps keep rates low.
Many solar loans are zero-down, but where down payments are required, they typically range between $0 to $3000. You can find a solar loan as short as three years or as long as 30, but typically they range from 10 to 20 years, said SolarReviews.
A Zillow study found solar raises a home’s property value by 4.1% on average. On a $500,000 home, that is an increase of $21,500 in value.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/13/dnv-aims-to-achieve-fpv-specific-reference-standards-for-floating-solar-pv/,"QUALITY,NORWAY,WORLD",EDGAR MEZA,"MAY 13, 2022",DNV aims to achieve FPV-specific reference standards for floating solar PV,"Norwegian classification society DNV is aiming to develop the world’s first recommended practice on the design, development, and operation of floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) systems.
The independent energy expert and assurance provider estimates that the potential global capacity for deploying FPV power is currently around 4 TW and expects installed capacity to reach 10 GW worldwide by 2025.
The group points out, however, that standards applicable to FPV are still largely lacking, which could result in project delays and obstacles in permitting and authorization of utility-scale projects.
“FPV players are at best relying on inconsistent and diverse procedures and adjacent codes adopted from other sectors, which may hinder the industry’s capacity to rapidly scale up,” DNV notes.
In an effort to provide comprehensive guidance to FPV operators, DNV has taken the lead on two new joint industry projects (JIPs) to achieve FPV-specific reference standards. DNV previously spearheaded a JIP involving 24 of the sector’s leaders to develop the world’s first recommended practice (RP) on the design, development, and operation of FPV systems — DNV-RP-0584 — which was introduced in 2021 as the first step towards FPV standards and certification. FPV-specific reference standards will further enable companies to manage risks and facilitate the shift to renewables, according to DNV.
The first new JIP is to share and improve the best practices for the design of FPV-specific anchoring and mooring structures. Based on a selection of floating solar concepts, the project will address a variety of anticipated challenges when deploying installations in larger islands with shallow drafts. The second JIP would draw from DNV’s expertise and network to create “an adequate unified FPV-specific floats design, testing and qualification standard that will introduce clearer, faster and cheaper performance-based procedures that are layout-neutral and failure-mode-specific.”
Many water bodies remain largely available for power generation – making the business case for FPV extremely attractive. After a slow start, the FPV market grew to 2 GW of globally installed capacity in 2020. DNV foresees a total of 7 to 11 GW to be installed by 2025 with a major increase from 2023 onwards.
“The use of industry standards will ultimately lead to higher quality, lower failure rates and more adequate access to data-driven digital solutions and assurance services like verification and certification,” said Juan Carlos Arévalo, executive vice president at GPM&S, a DNV company. “This can only be achieved through joint efforts and continuous knowledge sharing. This will not lead to the convergence of floating solar photovoltaic technology into a dominant concept, but rather establish a common approach to analysis and simulation that allows players to consistently improve on one another’s best practices and lay out industry-wide testing and quality assurance procedures.”
Dana Olson, global segment lead for solar power, Energy Systems at DNV, added, “FPV structures present unique challenges to the solar industry due to specific hydrodynamic loads, risks of corrosion and specific components, such as floats, anchors and mooring lines.
“Several large customers in the solar community have requested that we develop new, tailored standards to guide them in the development of resilient FPV projects,” Olson added. “In particular, our input on the determination of design environmental loading will provide crucial guidance to the whole field, and we’re eager to engage directly with customers across the industry at this crucial step of FPV project development.”
