The legislation aims to decarbonize the country and establish a national 100% clean electricity standard (CES), among other proposals.
The legislation would authorize $565 billion over 10 years to achieve its goals. The bill sponsors said the legislation includes “significant updates” to a draft released in January 2020, reflecting comments from stakeholders, expert testimony received in committee hearings, and the enactment of several previous provisions into law through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.
The CLEAN Future Act would mandate net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions no later than 2050, with an interim target of reducing GHG emissions 50% from 2005 levels no later than 2030. The targets come from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) called climate change “one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime.” He said the bill, which was introduced March 2, would create millions of “homegrown jobs” while ensuring the federal government does not “watch from the sidelines as the climate crisis wreaks havoc on Americans’ health and homes.”

Pallone, considered one of the gatekeepers of the Biden administration’s energy agenda, introduced the bill with Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko (D-NY) and Energy Subcommittee Chairman Bobby L. Rush (D-IL).
According to a summary from the sponsors, the CLEAN Future Act proposes new policies aimed at cutting GHG pollution in areas within the House committee’s jurisdiction.
Power sector: The CLEAN Future Act includes a nationwide CES requiring all retail electricity suppliers to obtain 100% clean electricity by 2035, in line with President Joe Biden’s call to action for the power sector. The CES would mandate that all retail electricity suppliers provide an increasing supply of clean electricity to consumers starting in 2023, rising to 80% by 2030 and then 100% by 2035. The bill would invest in clean energy, distributed energy resources, grid infrastructure, and microgrids to help build resiliency and cut pollution. In addition, it would empower the federal government to expedite building out the transmission system to achieve clean energy goals.
Building sector: The bill aims to improve the efficiency of new and existing buildings, as well as the equipment and appliances that operate within them. It would establish national energy savings targets for continued improvement of model building energy codes, leading to a requirement of zero-energy-ready buildings by 2030. The bill also would set energy and water savings targets for federal buildings and provide funding for schools, homes, and municipal buildings to improve efficiency.

Transportation sector: The bill targets transportation emissions, the largest source of GHG pollution, by building  infrastructure to support a clean transportation system. The bill includes investments in transportation electrification, including grants and rebates to deploy electric vehicles and charging stations, zero-emissions school buses. It also would formally authorize a Clean Cities Coalition Program. The bill also would update financing programs to expand domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technologies. It would establish a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant program to decarbonize and electrify ports around the country, reducing air pollution that affect nearby communities.
Industrial sector: The bill would establish a Buy Clean Program that sets performance targets to reduce emissions from construction materials and products used in projects that receive federal funding. The bill incorporates new Climate Star labeling and provisions to ensure that performance targets adequately consider the complexities of manufacturing and procuring carbon-intensive products. With the majority of U.S. construction projects funded by government dollars, the program would aim to transform and strengthen the competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing sector, while reducing emissions by promoting low-carbon materials and expanding the market for cleaner products.
A national climate target for federal agencies: In line with Biden’s government-wide approach to fight climate change, the bill would direct all federal agencies to use existing authorities to put the country on a path toward a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels by no later than 2030, and to net zero no later than 2050. To ensure federal agencies’ efforts remain on track, the legislation would direct the EPA to evaluate each agency’s plans, make recommendations and report on progress each year, and establish a Clean Economy Federal Advisory Committee to review the plans.

State climate plans: The bill would empower states to complete the transition to a net-zero economy based on the federalism model in the existing Clean Air Act. States would have flexibility to develop plans to meet the 2050 and interim targets based on their own policy preferences, priorities, and circumstances. Each state would submit a climate plan to the EPA for its review and approval. To ensure that states have ample guidance and expertise at their disposal, the bill would direct the EPA to develop a set of model GHG control strategies states can choose to incorporate into their plans. The bill would authorize $200 million to help states prepare their plans.
Accelerator program: The bill would establish a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator–modeled after the Green Bank model deployed across the U.S.–to help states, cities, communities, and companies transition to a clean economy. Capitalized with $100 billion in funding, the accelerator program would mobilize public and private investments to provide financing for low- and zero-emissions energy technologies, climate resiliency projects, building efficiency and electrification, industrial decarbonization, grid modernization, agriculture projects, clean transportation, and the development of state and local Green Banks where they do not yet exist. The bill would require that the program prioritize investments in communities that are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change and includes labor protections.
Worker transition: The bill would establish an interagency framework to ensure workers and communities have federal-level support and resources during the nation’s transition to net-zero climate pollution. It would create an Office of Energy and Economic Transition in the Executive Office of the President, responsible for managing a task force and stakeholder advisory committee to coordinate programs and activities that support impacted workers and communities. The bill also would create new programs to support dislocated workers and provide financial assistance to local governments, including by replacing lost revenue due to the closure of a major employer.
Environmental justice: The bill includes provisions designed to make environmental justice part of the mission of all federal agencies and to incorporate environmental justice considerations into laws. It includes investments to protect the health and safety of environmental justice communities, including lead service water line replacement, brownfield cleanups, and superfund cleanups. It further protects these groups by implementing new coal ash disposal requirements and repealing oil and gas production exemptions from landmark environmental laws.
The CLEAN Future Act also features a suite of related policies, including proposals to reduce waste, remove barriers to clean energy, and reduce pollutants like methane. The legislation is the result of 27 hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee on climate change over the last two years. Its introduction marks the beginning of the legislative process; hearings on the CLEAN Future Act will continue in the months ahead.

The 4.8 MW Healdsburg Floating Solar Project was installed on ponds at the City of Healdsburg’s wastewater treatment plant. It  will deliver energy to the city under under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
The project site and floating PV approach, a largely underutilized technology, were chosen to help reduce evaporation and algae growth at the ponds, benefitting nearby vineyards that use the water for irrigation.
The solar-generated electricity will cover around 8% of the city’s total energy demand, moving it toward a goal of 60% renewable energy usage before 2030.
Noria Energy co-developed the project with White Pine and provided installation services. The behind-the-meter project’s entire installation, from procurement to commissioning, was completed in less than six months.
The Healdsburg Floating Solar Project apparently can claim the title as largest floating solar project in the country. The previous claimant was the 4.4. MW floating array in Sayreville, New Jersey, installed by Ciel & Terre USA. That project, just outside of New York City, is also sited on a pond at the city’s water treatment facility and offsets the power use at the facility, as well as a handful of other government facilities.
Floating solar has been pegged by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL) as a “rapidly emerging technology.” A report outlined the technology’s potential to produce just under 10% of current electricity generation.
The technology also offers generally higher energy production, due to the cooling effects of water and wind. Even so, the floating solar has not reached widespread adoption, due in part to higher overall costs than traditional PV plants.
However, according to Stetson Tchividjian, director of business development at D3Energy, a floating PV developer, this could change as floating solar reaches price parity with land-based PV. Tchividjian also points out that floating solar has lower operation and management costs and no land costs.

The meeting builds on an Executive Order President Joe Biden signed in late February directing a review of the supply chain shortages that have hampered parts of American industry, including advanced batteries, like those used in EVs.
The order also launches a year-long review of the industry basis for six parts of the American economy.  The reviews are intended to identify policy goals to fortify domestic supply chains and start implementing those recommendations.
During the March 2 meeting, McCarthy focused on the administration’s goals to make the right investments to strengthen domestic supply chains, bolster U.S. manufacturing, create union jobs in sectors that support vehicle electrification, and deploy more than 500,000 EV chargers nationwide.
According to a White House readout of the meeting, the CEOs agreed that collaboration across government, the automotive industry, and other EV-involved sectors will be critical if the U.S. is to lead the world in the clean energy revolution.
Outside of Federal intervention, companies and associations across the cleantech space have called on the need for a resilient American supply chain, although their efforts have been as focused on a stand against forced labor as on supply chain disruptions and resiliency.

The company, which recently opened an office in Richmond, Virginia, said it plans to maintain its focus on nonprofits and municipalities with wastewater treatment plants.
According to Keystone, wastewater treatment plants are prime sites for solar projects because they offer solid credit, high electricity usage, and ease of installation. The company has several such projects already in operation, with another two awaiting permission to operate, and another project signed for construction later this year.
Keystone has already completed mid- to large-scale solar projects in the Carolinas, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey. In addition to municipalities and nonprofits, customers include schools, universities, and large public corporations.
Keystone previously worked with the City of Freeport, Illinois, to build a 1.16 MW project at its municipal plant. The project was financed through a long-term power purchase agreement with Keystone, and the energy cost savings are projected to be just under $1 million over the lifetime of the deal.
Keystone said it remains positioned to finance a range of projects. Its investment fund, KPH Solar Farms Fund I, provides financing for eligible solar projects from 250 kW to 10 MW, removing up-front investment costs for clients. Launched with $35 million in 2017, the fund provides 100% of the initial debt, equity/tax equity, and construction financing for Keystone’s projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/03/solar-module-prices-rose-by-up-to-15-in-china-jinkos-vice-president-says/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 3, 2021","Solar module prices rose by up to 15% in China, Jinko’s vice president says","From pv magazine Global
The Chinese PV market saw PV module prices increase by up to 15% in the last few weeks, according to Dany Qian, the vice president of China-based solar module manufacturer JinkoSolar.
“The results of some key tenders which were announced recently, show a price increase of between 10 and 15% and an even higher increase is being considered for the upcoming ones,” she told pv magazine. “[The] China market has a crucial role as a solar PV price indicator as it brings to the forefront the raw material shortage.”
Qian cited a recent 30 MW tender linked to agricultural production and held by Chinese energy company Guangdong Energy Group Co Ltd. “According to the bidding analysis, the highest quotation of dual-glass modules is RMB1.79/watt ($0.27),” Qian explained. “Therefore the market still sees the trend of increased prices.”
According to her, this hike in prices depends on the shortage of supply of module frames and raw materials such as polysilicon, glass, and silver, as well as the lack of manufacturing capacity to meet current strong demand. Qian also cited a recent report from the China Silicon Association which revealed that the price range of monocrystalline is currently between RMB102,000 and 107,000 ($15,800-16,600) per ton, and the average transaction price is RMB103,400 RMB/ton, up 11.78% month-over-month.
“Since March, the monocrystalline wafer price of Longi has been comprehensively raised; [the] G1, M6 (170μm) monocrystalline silicon wafer quotation[s are] RMB3.55/piece ($0.55) [and] RMB3.65/piece, with an increase [of] up to 9%,” the vice president said. “Based on this, 175μm has increased by RMB0.05/piece ($0.01). The price rise is as high as 9.6%.” She also explained that raw materials such as iron and steel and aluminum have also seen a sharp price increase recently.
Qian also stated that, although glass and polysilicon producers are seeking to increase their capacity–as well as other raw material suppliers–setting up more factories and production lines will require time. “When combined with the U.S. dollar’s continuous depreciation–following stimulus measures to ease public hardship during the pandemic–a further increase in PV panel prices can be expected in no time,” she added. “The rushing demand cannot stop prices from rising at least for [the] next six months or longer, until sufficient capacity ramps up.”
The current shortage, according to her, has left panel manufacturers unable to cope with the rising cost transferred from upstream that occurred since the second quarter of last year.

The expansion was made possible through partnerships with community solar developer BlueWave Solar and project finance company Summit Ridge Energy (SRE).
The expansion marks the eighth state that Arcadia operates in, plus the District of Columbia. The company is one of the largest managers of residential community solar subscriptions in the country, with 20 community solar projects online and another 40 projects in development.
The company said that it plans to add 89 new projects in Maryland, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Illinois, Colorado, New York, D.C., and Maine in 2021.
Arcadia said its business model requires no credit check and no long-term contract. Credit checks and income verification policies have been identified by Vote Solar’s Access & Equity Advisory Committee as one of the biggest barriers to implementing low- and middle-income community solar programs, because they reduce the overall equity of a move to renewable energy.
Arcadia’s offering also integrates with utility billing systems, so that customers may pay one, typically lower, energy bill each month. Customers also may cancel their subscription at any time with no termination fee.
Arcadia said this policy benefits  subscribers who live in apartments or other rental properties. Having the ability to cancel at any time encourages renters to subscribe, as they are under no obligation to transfer their commitment to the next tenant.

The report said that 2,156 MWh of storage entered service, a jump of 182% from the third quarter.
Overall, 2020 was the first year that advanced energy storage deployments surpassed gigawatt scale, the report said.
Falling prices along with eroding barriers to deployment are driving front-of-the-meter (FTM) storage adoption in the U.S. , the report said. Four out of every five megawatts deployed during the quarter was FTM storage. The segment contributed 529 MW out of the total 651 MW of storage that was deployed.
Residential storage projects totaled 90.1 MW, and made up 14% of the megawatt total during the quarter, driven in large part by homeowner interest in California. Expectations are that Texas will be a big growth market in 2021 in the aftermath of extended power outages across the state as a result of a mid-February winter storm.
Massachusetts led the non-residential segment, which is growing more slowly than the other two storage segments; deployments totaled 76.5 MWh during the quarter.
For 2020 overall, 1,464 MW / 3,487 MWh of new storage came online in the U.S. In megawatt terms, 179% more storage was added in 2020 than in 2019.
The U.S. installed 3,115 MWh of storage from 2013 through 2019, the report said, a total that 2020 beat in a single year.
In February, IHS Markit said that global utility-scale energy storage installations this year are set to exceed 10 GW for the first time. That’s more than double the 4.5 GW installed in 2020. IHS said the U.S. will account for 50% of that total.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/03/creating-an-alternative-pv-supply-chain-is-no-cakewalk/,"BUSINESS,GUEST POST,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 3, 2021",Creating an alternative PV supply chain is no cakewalk,"The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in December launched a campaign against forced labor, announced the development of a supply chain traceability protocol for materials used to produce solar modules, and said it was “strongly encouraging” member companies to move their supply chains out of the Xinjiang region of China.
In early February, SEIA and 175 member companies signed a pledge opposing forced labor in the solar supply chain. In an interview with pv magazine USA, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper announced a goal for companies to readjust their supply chains by June.
Global solar wafer production is almost completely in Chinese hands, but mostly not located in Xinjiang (with the notable exception of one major vertically integrated manufacturer).
What will likely happen is this: Wafer manufacturers, who usually blend polysilicon volumes from different suppliers, will exclude feedstock from Xinjiang from the mix for part of their production in order to offer “Xinjiang-free” wafers. Those can then be used for solar cells and modules destined for export to the U.S.; European customers will probably demand products untainted by forced labor as well.
Service providers, such as Clean Energy Associates, will conduct supply chain audits that ensure the necessary evidence at customs.
In terms of volumes, this shift in wafer production will not pose a major challenge. PV installations in the U.S. and Europe together made up roughly 30% of the global market in 2020.
In contrast, around 45% of the global solar-grade polysilicon output in 2020 came from the four Xinjiang-based manufacturers: Daqo, Xinte, Xinjiang GCL and East Hope. Conversely, this means that 55% was produced outside Xinjiang (35% in other Chinese regions and 20% outside China).
That’s more than enough to supply the PV markets in the U.S. and Europe. Should international project developers jump on the anti-forced-labor bandwagon, however, the PV supply chain could experience major friction.
Michael Parr, executive director of the western Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance, has now suggested that excess polysilicon production capacities in the U.S. and Europe could support the shift of supply chains away from Xinjiang. Such a contribution – if realistic at all – would be very small, though.
Apart from a tiny 1,600-ton facility in Germany, it is not clear where Parr sees dormant polysilicon factories in Europe. In the U.S., REC Silicon’s mothballed plant in Moses Lake, Washington, and decommissioned reactors at Hemlock Semiconductor might provide an additional capacity of 40,000 metric tons. Compare this to a capacity of 330,000 tons which the four players in Xinjiang are aiming to achieve by the end of this year.
Even if an additional 40,000 tons was available in the U.S., a wafer production capacity of 14 GW outside China would be required to process these volumes. This magnitude is not yet in sight.
Creating an alternative supply chain will be no cakewalk – it is a monumental task.
