Their work revealed that a liquid-like motion in perovskites may explain how they efficiently produce electric currents.
The scientists explained that when light hits a photovoltaic material, it excites electrons, prompting them to “pop out” of their atoms and move through the material, conducting electricity. One problem is that the excited electrons can recombine with the atoms instead of traveling through the material. This can cut the amount of electricity produced relative to the amount of sunlight that hits the material.
Perovskites do well at preventing this recombination, the scientists said. Their work aimed to uncover what mechanism causes this and how more efficient solar cells can be developed.
Duke University led the effort that included scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
The team studied one of the simplest perovskites, a compound of cesium, lead and bromine (CsPbBr3). They then used X-ray scattering capabilities at Argonne’s Magnetic Materials group’s beamline.
The team captured the average positions of the atoms in a perovskite crystal at different temperatures. They found that each lead atom and its surrounding cage of bromine atoms formed rigid units that behaved like molecules. In particular, the units oscillated in a liquid-like manner.
One theory to explain how perovskites resist recombination is that these distortions in the lattice, or crystal structure, followed the free electrons as they traversed the material. The electrons might deform the lattice, causing the liquid-like disturbances, which prevented them from falling back into their host atoms. The researchers said this theory may offer new insights into how to design optimal perovskite materials for solar cells.

The data also indicated that molecules in the material oscillated within two-dimensional planes, with no motion across planes. This two-dimensional nature could also help explain how the perovskite can prevent electron recombination, contributing to the materials’ efficiency.
To investigate the motion of the atoms directly, the team used neutron scattering capabilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Neutron scattering confirmed the pattern seen in the X-ray scattering experiment. It also showed that it took almost no energy for the molecules to oscillate in two dimensions. The researchers said this helps to explain why the excited electrons could deform the lattice so easily.
A paper on the study, “Two-dimensional overdamped fluctuations of the soft perovskite lattice in CsPbBr3,” was published in Nature Materials in March. Computational studies to support the experiment were performed at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Berkeley National Laboratory. The research was funded by DOE’s Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering division.

Facebook will use 110 MW to support its data center operations in Gallatin, Tennessee, and the broader Tennessee Valley. Under Green Invest, Facebook has signed agreements for 475 MW of new solar to be built in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. Since 2018, Facebook has agreed to buy a total of 852 MW of power generated by multiple solar farms linked to the TVA electric grid.
The Shelby County project will create more than 150 construction jobs, with employment for up to four full-time operations and maintenance staff. The facility is expected to come online in late 2023, pending environmental reviews.
In April, Facebook said it had reached its previously announced goals of supporting all of its operations with 100% renewable energy, while also reaching net-zero emissions, as of the end of 2020. All renewable energy commitments since then have been to achieve the company’s next goal of reaching net zero emissions for its entire value chain by 2030.
Worldwide, Facebook has contracts in place with 63 renewable energy installations, totaling more than 6 GW of wind and solar energy across 18 states and five countries.

The two companies will look at integrating Malta’s 100 MW, 10-hour pumped heat energy storage system into existing infrastructure at a Duke Energy coal plant in North Carolina.
Malta’s system stores electricity either directly from a power plant or from the grid. It does this by converting electricity into thermal energy (heat and cold). The heat is stored in molten salt, a proven method of storing thermal energy, and the cold is stored in an antifreeze-like solution with components and subsystems derived from the liquefied natural gas industry.
In practice, the system operates like a conventional power plant. When electricity is needed, the thermal energy powers a heat engine to energy. Because the system leverages well-understood concepts in a novel energy storage application, the companies said they are confident in safe and resilient operations, while hoping for an approach that eventually can become a viable commercial storage solution.
Malta said that its system can be configured to store up to 200 hours of energy; the study will focus on the energy industry’s current need for 10-12 hours of storage.
The Department of Energy announced the grant in March, and the team is currently identifying which of Duke Energy’s six coal plants in North Carolina is best suited to serve as the test site. Once a site is finalized and the study is complete, the team will deliver a list of findings, including an engineering conceptual study, a technology maturation plan, and a socioeconomic report on potential benefits.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/19/solar-101-the-basics-of-net-metering-for-your-solar-project/,"FINANCE,LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 19, 2021",Solar 101: The basics of net metering for your solar project,"As you’re learning in our Solar 101 series, solar power is a combination of construction, hardware… and money.
The money side of things is determined by more than just the cost of construction and hardware. It’s also influenced by the local price of electricity, as well the legal policies governing the power grid. In the United States, these laws vary in every state and are regulated by public utility/service commissions after they’ve been put in place by state legislatures.
One legal structure that gets extensive coverage here in pv magazine USA is  “net metering.” It is important to be familiar with net metering because it affects how long your solar project takes to pay for itself, and how you and your contractor need to design your project.
The first thing to know is that net metering is a tool to count and – importantly – assign a value to the excess electricity that a solar project is expected to export to the grid. When the sun is out and your electricity use is low, your rooftop solar will probably produce more energy that you are consuming. That excess power can be routed to the broader electric grid and help reduce the need for large-scale power plants, many of which burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.
Because of net metering, most solar power systems are designed to generate enough electricity in the daytime so that they can offset 24 hours of electricity use. And in order to generate enough electricity to offset use at midnight, a solar system must overproduce at high noon.
So, the electricity utility – following the rules put in place by the PUCs – “meters” (a technical term that describes counting) both your electricity generation and your use. Once the net electricity value has been found, calculations unique to each state determine the dollar value of the net metered electricity; in other words, your system’s net benefit to the grid for which you can be compensated.

One indispensable resource for learning your state’s net metering rules is the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center’s Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE for short).
In their net metering law page, you will find links describing policy in 50 states and four territories. DSIRE also provides the summary maps like the one above, providing a cursory view of net metering policies across the U.S.
Again, the laws vary by state. For instance, Florida has a very straightforward law (that the electricity utilities are attacking): all net metered electricity is credited to your electricity bill at the same price that electricity costs to buy. In Utah, the electric utilities successfully lobbied the PUC to lower the rate net metered electricity is paid to well below what homeowners pay. And Hawaii, because it has so much solar power, does not allow homeowners to export electricity to the power grid at all.
Some states, like Texas, have no state-level rules for net metering, despite several utilities that have implemented their own rules.
The nation’s leader in solar power, California, is currently debating what is called “Net Metering 3.0,” a reference to the state’s third major update to its policy. One nuance in California’s current energy policy (NEM 2.0) is that solar system owners are charged for electricity based on “time of use,” while those who do not own solar pay a simple flat rate. That means solar owners pay more for electricity in the evening than in the daytime. This is typically more common in commercial and industrial electricity use cases than in residential.
It also means that residential solar owners in California are paid less for electricity that they produce in the daytime than for electricity they produce in the evening. These policies are intended to motivate consumers to install batteries that store low-cost daytime electricity, to be used or exported during the more expensive peak-demand hours, around 5 PM to 9 PM.
With all that in mind, let’s review the effect net metering has on revenue. Let’s consider two hypothetical cities which have matching electricity rates of 12¢/kWh. In City 1, net metered electricity is paid at a rate matching the cost of electricity – 12¢/kWH. Meanwhile, City 2 pays half of that net metered rate. It looks like this:

As you can see in this example, 50% of our electricity is used instantly inside the home. This offsets the full City 1 local electricity rate of 12¢/kWh. The second 50% is net metered, covering the rest of the City 1 house’s needs during non-sunlight hours.
Meanwhile, City 2’s net metered electricity earns 50% of City 1’s, and, when added to the electricity used instantly, means the project earns 25% less revenue ($360 a year) overall.
In a later article, we will show how net metering laws fit into your project’s economic calculations, and how to calculate your solar power project’s return on investment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/19/sunrise-brief-tenaska-and-arevon-plan-200-mw-solar-project-in-missouri/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 19, 2021",Sunrise brief: Tenaska and Arevon plan 200 MW solar project in Missouri,"Tenaska and Arevon plan to develop a 200 MW, $175 million solar array in Scott County, Missouri, in the southeastern part of the state.
The Kelso Solar Project is planned for roughly 2,000 acres along Interstate 55 near the town of Blodgett. Land for the solar field is being leased from local landowners. Pending necessary approvals, construction could start in 2022 or 2023. Once complete, the solar field will be operational for 35 years and employ around 10 people full-time.
Developers said the project’s scale could grow to 350 MW. The project is in early stages of development and no equipment suppliers have been named.
Arevon is a unit of Capital Dynamics, a private asset management firm. In late 2018, Capital’s Clean Energy Infrastructure business signed a deal with independent power producer Tenaska to develop 14 solar projects with around 2,000 MW of capacity in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator market. Projects were planned in Michigan, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Minnesota.
Bloom Energy will work with the Energy Department’s Idaho National Laboratory to test using nuclear energy to create hydrogen using Bloom Energy’s solid oxide, high-temperature electrolyzer.
Hydrogen would be obtained through electrolysis powered by nuclear generation. The idea is that rather than ramping down power generation when the grid is filled with renewable energy, electricity generated by nuclear plants can be used to produce hydrogen.
Steam supplied to the electrolyzers can also be generated by the power plant’s thermal energy, bolstering the overall efficiency of hydrogen production. INL will test Bloom Energy’s electrolyzers at its Dynamic Energy Testing and Integration Laboratory. Researchers can simulate steam and load following conditions as if the technology were already integrated with a nuclear power station.
Sandia National Laboratory, also a DOE lab, developed a tool called Quest that can be used by energy researchers to evaluate  energy storage scenarios.
The open-source software enables users to do their own energy storage analysis. It has two main tools: a behind-the-meter analysis tool for businesses or civil infrastructure, and a market-analysis tool to help utilities assess how much revenue an energy storage system would generate.

The user first inputs her location and the rate structure she pays. The user can also input the kind of renewable power system she has or wants to install.
The market-analysis tool looks at the other side of the equation. It was designed to provide small utility companies with an idea of how much revenue an energy storage system would generate by providing services to enhance the grid stability and reliability. The tool has historical data for the seven energy markets in North America, including the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and the California Independent System Operator, each with different market conditions.
A device developed at DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory can prevent dangerous conditions from developing in outdoor battery energy storage cabinets.
IntelliVent is designed to be installed in cabinet-style battery enclosures. It responds to smoke, heat, or gas alarms in the battery enclosure and automatically opens cabinet doors to prevent buildup of flammable gases. The technology reduces the risk of explosions at battery installations, which can damage property or endanger lives.
Recent fires at battery storage facilities in Arizona and England highlighted the dangers these kinds of fires can present. The April 2019 incident in Arizona at an energy storage facility left four firefighters injured, two seriously. In September 2020, fire crews in Liverpool, England, were called to a 20 MW battery storage plant after an explosion had occurred and found a large grid battery system container on fire.
Bobby Ruiz, fire chief in Peoria, Arizona, whose firefighters were injured in the Arizona incident, said that “getting all doors open early before gas buildup will make the incident safer.” He said doing so will also increase situational awareness by enabling responders to see if the batteries are smoking or are on fire.
The Snohomish County Public Utility District’s new Arlington Microgrid and Clean Energy Center in Everett, Washington, will be the first to install the technology when it retrofits a 1.2 MW battery.
Intellivent designers developed the system to work with a variety of sensors. It is intended to reduce the risk of explosion, but due to limitations of the product standard, is not designed to NFPA-69 (Standard on Explosion Prevention Systems). IntelliVent is available for low-cost, nonexclusive licensing from PNNL.
