The product exchanges a traditional solar module configuration for buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), devices that blend their visual aesthetics with existing structures.
The project is expected to save the McRae family nearly $70,000 in energy costs and offset 350 tons of emissions over its 30-year warrantied lifetime. The roof is comprised of 291 Tesla SR60T1 solar modules with a total capacity of 17.46kW, and two Tesla PowerWall home batteries are attached. Aerial imagery and 3D modeling is used to fit the designs to the roof’s layout.
The system can be controlled with remote mobile monitoring. The Tesla Solar Inverter, which comes in 3.8 kW and 7.6 kW designs, hosts built-in Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and cellular connectivity for updates through the Tesla app.
Gulf Coast region-serving Solar Alternatives is an engineering, consultation, and construction services firm with commercial, industrial, utility, and residential clients.
The McRae family’s solar journey began with a 3.5kW system with Solar Alternatives to meet the demand for their electric vehicle. Now, the system is expected to supply enough power for their entire home, while also exporting excess energy to the grid during times of high energy demand for net metering credits.
An effort for energy independence
The PowerWall batteries provide backup power in the case of a grid outage. Late last summer, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana, knocking out power for up to 1.2 million electricity customers. Investor-owned utility Entergy estimates the hurricane damaged 30,000 utility poles, nearly double that of Hurricane Katrina (17,000). As more climate-onset extreme weather is expected for the region, many families are looking to incorporate home energy storage for resilience.
In his recent popular book about grid modernization, Freeing Energy, venture capitalist Bill Nussey said he sees billion-dollar opportunities for distributed solar and energy storage innovators. Nussey’s vision of an evolved grid features projects like the McRae family’s solar array, which feature local energy production and storage.
Nussey said an aging grid and lower-cost alternatives to large scale transmission would make “local energy” the best way to provide most residential and commercial energy for the 70% of Americans who live in suburbs and rural areas. Nussey outlines 18 benefits localized solar provides, including grid benefits, reliability and resiliency, and ratepayer energy bill savings. Another benefit is a reduction of 1400 to 2100 pounds of carbon dioxide per month for a typical home’s rooftop solar system. If coal power is displaced, that rooftop system also prevents the creation of 185 pounds of coal ash per month, said Nussey.

The project, called South Street solar, has a power purchase agreement in place with nearby Middlebury College, with the college contracting for 100% of the electricity generated by the installation. According to Greenbacker, Green Mountain Power, the project’s offtaker, plans to add onsite energy storage to the installation, though the capacity of that planned addition has not yet been shared.
South Street is expected to meet 30% of Middlebury College’s annual energy demand, part of the school’s plan to is run on 100% renewable energy by 2028, while the state of Vermont has a goal of obtaining 90% of its power from renewable energy by 2050. Middlebury has been carbon neutral since 2016.
Alongside the solar and storage, there are plans to plant the land amid the solar arrays with pasture mix for local livestock to graze and pollinator-friendly vegetation that supports native bee and butterfly populations.
South Street is the largest project that Greenbacker has acquired in Vermont. The project broke ground with a ceremony in October 2021 and is expected to reach commercial operation in the second half of 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/28/dsd-renewables-and-t-mobile-partner-on-community-solar-portfolio/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 28, 2022",DSD Renewables and T-Mobile partner on community solar portfolio,"DSD Renewables and T-Mobile entered into a partnership to develop and construct three community solar projects, as the cell carrier works to make progress toward its RE100 commitment to power its entire business with 100% renewable electricity.
The projects, which total 17MW and are all located in New York, will be built in the towns of Richland (2.63MW), Aldrich (6.95MW) and Silver Creek (7.5MW). The Richland site is operational, with the two other sites expected to be operational in Q1 2022.
The partnership between DSD and T-Mobile arose via the issuance of a T-Mobile request for proposals (RFP). NRG served as the RFP consultant for T-Mobile, which selected DSD on the strength of its community solar portfolio. DSD will be the long-term owner of the projects. The partnership between DSD and T-Mobile is expected to continue, with plans for T-Mobile to serve as an offtaker for additional projects currently under development with DSD.
What has not yet been shared is who the other offtakers of these community solar projects will be. If the projects are receiving funding under the New York State Research and Development Authority’s NY-Sun program for community solar projects, they have to reserve a portion of their capacity to serve low- and moderate income New Yorkers.
Community solar represents more than 90% of New York’s 2.7 GW two-year pipeline of projects under development that have been awarded NY-Sun incentives, comprising more than 800 projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/28/two-large-scale-solar-plants-to-begin-construction-in-louisiana/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,LOUISIANA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 28, 2022",Two large-scale solar plants to begin construction in Louisiana,"A 98MW solar installation was recently approved to be built in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, a state ranked 38th in solar installations, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Bayou Galion Solar Project LLC is planned to build the Morehouse Parish solar plant or enough to power approximately 20,000 homes. Located on 1,080 acres near Mer Rouge, the plant will employ an estimated 300 people during the peak period of construction. Construction is expected to begin soon with operation to start in 2023.
The Bayou Galion firm is part of Recurrent Energy Development Holdings, a North American solar-power and energy-storage developer, which was chosen by the 1803 Electric Cooperative to be part of its portfolio of energy-supply projects to satisfy the next 20 years of demand from five Louisiana rural electric co-ops. Other energy options chosen to be part of the 1803 collection include solar plants in central and south Louisiana, a gas-fired power plant to be built in Iberville Parish and a power-supply component by the Exelon Corp.
“Our commission staff took several months to review this plan,” said Commissioner Foster Campbell, North Louisiana representative on the LPSC. “I am confident that it will provide reliable and inexpensive power to these Louisiana co-ops for years to come.”
Another large-scale solar plant under construction in Morehouse Parish is the Ventress Solar project, which, at 345MWdc, will be the largest in the state. That project alone more than doubles the amount of solar in the state, which currently amounts to just over 200MW, according to SEIA.

The energy generated by the Ventress Solar facility will be sold to McDonald’s Corporation and eBay under long-term, virtual power purchase agreements. The project is scheduled for completion in late 2023. LPL Solar is working closely within the local parishes to fill the many jobs needed for project construction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/28/big-solar-headed-for-big-texas-oil-operation/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 28, 2022",Big solar headed for big Texas oil operation,"Black & Veatch announced it was selected as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm for the 270MW Parker solar project in central Texas. Houston’s own Buckeye Partners, which stores, pipes, and ships crude oil and petroleum products commissioned the project.
The 500,000-panel project is planned to be located on two neighboring sites near Waco, Texas. Construction is expected to be completed early next year. Buckeye announced its initial investment in the project last August.
“Our strategy is squarely focused on energy diversity and lower-carbon solutions,” said Buckeye executive Todd J. Russo. “Project Parker will further expand Buckeye’s growing renewable portfolio.”
Black & Veatch has a long history with solar, developing and implementing both land-based and floating PV since 1973. The EPC firm is 100% owned by its employees, and 2020 revenues exceeded $3 billion.
Buckeye Partners has been increasing its stake in renewable energy as it furthers its environmental, social, and governance plan. In a 2020 year’s end report the petroleum piper said it was actively developing eight solar projects with a total capacity of 570MW in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and the Bahamas.
Black & Veatch also recently released a new eBook, Grid Modernization 2022: Reliability and Resilience. The book offers a practical guide to grid modernization. Black & Veatch said that in 2020, the U.S. Department of Energy recorded 383 power outages, more than double the total from three years earlier. Not only do the outages cause human suffering, said B&V, but they also cost the US economy between $28 billion and $169 billion annually.
“Megatrends like digitization and decarbonization coupled with the increasing impacts of climate change and cybersecurity risks means that the industry’s core product of providing always-on, dependable electricity services is under serious threat,” said Kevin Ludwig, Grid Solutions Leader, Black & Veatch. “The good news is that our grids can be engineered to handle a wide range of severe conditions and threats as long as grid operators can assess, plan for, and reliably predict the risks.”
The US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, passed in November, sets aside $550 billion in spending to rebuild roads and bridges, water infrastructure, resilience, internet, and more, and grid modernization is set to be a key feature of the Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/28/puerto-rico-legislator-calls-on-us-congress-to-prevent-an-illegal-tax-on-puerto-rico-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUERTO RICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 28, 2022",Puerto Rico legislator calls on US Congress to prevent an “illegal tax” on Puerto Rico solar,"Puerto Rico legislator Héctor Ferrer has called on the US Congress to prevent an “illegal tax on private rooftop solar generation” in Puerto Rico.
Ferrer said a proposed per-kWh charge on rooftop solar generation would violate not only Puerto Rico law, but also federal clean energy policies, and possibly the Constitution as well, in a January 24 letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
Ferrer noted that the Puerto Rico House and Senate passed a joint resolution last November expressing “the wholehearted rejection” of a proposed Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) that includes the solar tax.
The RSA is a proposal to settle with the owners of $9 billion in face value of bonds issued by the Puerto Rico utility PREPA. The RSA would add a “transition charge” on PREPA customers’ bills of at least 2.8¢/kWh, rising through 2044 to 4.6¢/kWh, “gravely impacting” all electricity consumers, Ferrer said.
Ferrer highlighted the RSA’s provision that consumers who produce any of their own electricity from a new PV system would be required to pay the new charge not only on power purchased from the grid, but also on their own self-generated power. PV systems that were installed by September 2020 would be exempted, but could lose the exemption under certain conditions.
The RSA’s “solar tax-centric approach is illegal,” said Ferrer, quoting Section 3.4 of the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act (Act 17-2019): “no direct or indirect charge shall be imposed on the generation of renewable energy by consumers.” Ferrer said the proposed RSA also “intrudes upon” the exclusive rate setting jurisdiction of Puerto Rico’s independent energy sector regulator, the Energy Bureau.
The Constitutionality of such solar charges “is also questionable,” Ferrer said, as the RSA would “seek to federally impose a new tax on energy generated by privately owned solar power systems within private property.”
Ferrer said the Puerto Rico Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB) announced that it will file the RSA proposal by March 2022 for review by US District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who was appointed under the federal PROMESA law to oversee Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy proceedings. The FOMB was also created by PROMESA.
Earlier this month, Judge Swain certified a settlement plan that reduced the Puerto Rican government’s debt from $22 billion of bonds down to $7.4 billion, according to Bloomberg News.
In testimony for the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA-PR) at a Puerto Rico Senate Committee hearing this month, SESA-PR Chief Policy Officer Javier Rúa-Jovet said that the “illegal charges” proposed in the RSA “would seriously impact the people of Puerto Rico, particularly those PREPA customers who seek to self-generate all or part of their energy through solar.”
In his letter, Ferrer called on Congress to use its oversight authority over the FOMB, its board members and its executive direction “to ensure that PREPA debt restructuring is aligned with federal, as well as Commonwealth energy policies.”
“As we’ve experienced during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria,” Ferrer said, “access to resilient energy is a matter of life or death for the Puerto Rican people.”
Three days after Ferrer’s letter, on January 27, a reporter asked FOMB’s Executive Director Natalie Jaresko at an FOMB public board meeting about the Puero Rico legislature “passing PREPA’s restructuring bill.” SESA-PR President PJ Wilson later explained in an interview that the reporter was referring to enabling legislation that would repeal Law 17-2019’s prohibition against solar taxes, and make other legislative changes needed for the proposed RSA to move forward. In response to the reporter’s question, Jaresko said, “we look forward to getting that legislative answer in this first half of this calendar year.”
SESA-PR has been advocating against the “solar tax” proposal since 2019, when it partnered with the national solar association SEIA to jointly file a “friend of the court” brief making several legal arguments against the proposal.
