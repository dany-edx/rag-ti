Under the partnership, the Sunverge real-time Distributed Energy Resource (DER) platform will be expanded to control both EV charging and the EV batteries as energy assets, allowing utilities to harness fleet Vehicle-to-Home to enhance distributed energy resource control and real-time dynamic, flexible load management.
The inclusion of EV batteries in this new DER platform will provide utilities with more cohesive EV, DER and demand-side management programs through expanded multi-asset and multi-service aggregation, while also supporting grid services for integrated base and peak load management services. In short, having wider functionality across more assets will make it easier to deliver reliable and flexible power.
Sunverge, Nissan and Wallbox said they will be using the pilot as an opportunity to jointly study the capabilities of V2G, such as frequency regulation and response. As of now, the new platform is offered solely in Australia, but the pilot may inform expansion into other countries.
Earlier in the summer, Sunverge and Wallbox came to a separate agreement, wherein SunPower customers could opt to install a Wallbox EV charger at the same time as their solar and/or storage installation, and in that announcement the companies outlined that they were exploring the potential of backup power solutions incorporating the EV charger’s bi-directional technology into the solar and storage system.

About 92% of new power sources added this year were solar or wind energy.
Coal was overcome as a generation source as renewables produced 2.2% more electricity January through June, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Renewables now move into second place for both capacity and actual power generation, according to FERC.
Solar and wind had a nearly equal share, with 5,279 MW and 5,617 MW added, respectively. In June, solar and wind were the only sources of new capacity additions, according to FERC.

Renewables have now crossed the 25% threshold of total U.S. available installed generating capacity. A year ago, renewable resources represented 23% of the total.
Utility-scale solar is just shy of 5% of the nation’s available capacity, though this figure does not include distributed solar such as rooftop systems. Wind energy now stands at 10.4% of total capacity.
EIA reported a 25.3% growth in solar, including distributed solar, compared to the first six months of 2020. Wind grew by 10% over the same period.
Actual power provided by solar and wind in first-half 2021 landed at 13.7%, which represents a 14.1% bump from last year’s figure, said EIA.
FERC data suggested renewables are on a path to increase over the next three years. Capacity additions marked as “high probability,” minus anticipated plant retirements, project a net increase of more than 44,000 MW of solar and 21,000 MW of wind. By comparison, natural gas is expected to grow by around 13,200 MW.
If these numbers hold, by June 2024 the U.S. will have nearly 30% of its power sourced from renewables, said FERC.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/25/watch-gravity-based-renewable-energy-storage-tower-for-grid-scale-operations/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 25, 2021",Watch: Gravity-based renewable energy storage tower for grid-scale operations,"Energy Vault, maker of the EVx gravitational energy storage tower, has secured $100 million in series C funding. The investment was led by Prime Movers Lab, with additional participation from SoftBank, Saudi Aramco, Helena, and Idealab X.
The company said capital raised will support plans to ramp up deployments of the EVx platform for customers in the U.S., Middle East, Europe, and Australia. The first U.S. deployments are slated to begin fourth quarter 2021, with a broader global ramp-up throughout 2022, said Energy Vault.
The EVx platform is a six-arm crane tower designed to be charged by grid-scale renewable energy. It lifts large bricks using electric motors, thereby creating gravitational energy. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the bricks are lowered, harvesting the potential gravitational energy.
There is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the raised composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time, said Energy Vault.


Energy Vault said the composite blocks are made of local soils, as well as materials otherwise destined for landfills or incinerators, including recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and wind turbine blades.
In 2020, Energy Vault had the first commercial scale deployment of its energy storage system, and launched the new EVx platform this past April.
The company said the EVx tower features 80-85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.

The company said its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from 2 to 4 hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from 5 to 24 hours or more.
With global lithium supply considered a constraint, and, according to the Biden administration, a national security issue, alternative measures are being taken to find ways to store solar and wind energy.
For example, Form Energy of Somerville, Massachusetts, has secured $240 million in series D funding for its iron-air batteries, which use iron pellets. The pellets are exposed to oxygen to create rust. The oxygen then is removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the batteries to be charged and discharged.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/25/whos-behind-a-solar-tariff-push-nextera-wants-to-know/,"BUSINESS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 25, 2021",Who’s behind a solar tariff push? NextEra wants to know,"NextEra Energy reportedly has asked the U.S. Commerce Department either to force an anonymous group of U.S. solar companies to identify its members or throw out their requests to extend tariffs on imported panels.
The Bloomberg news agency reported that in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, NextEra challenged applications filed by the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention.
NextEra wants the department either to toss out the applications or require the petitioners to re-file and name its members. NextEra questioned retribution claims and said that company names don’t meet the standard for proprietary treatment.
The unnamed companies asked the Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The group filed three petitions in mid-August through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
The Commerce Department has 45 days to initiate an investigation based on the petitions, said Timothy Brightbill, a partner in the Wiley Rein law firm. He spoke to pv magazine shortly after the petitions were filed. He said that a preliminary determination could be issued in 180 days with a final determination in around a year’s time. Any duties would be retroactive to the start of the investigation.
Brightbill said that “Given the Chinese control of the entire solar supply chain, retaliation is likely if their identities are revealed.” In such situations, the companies who make up the coalition “are allowed under U.S. law to remain confidential,” he said.

According to Relectrify Vice President of Strategy and Business Development, Zezan Tam, the company will be using the investment capital to expand the commercialisation team, particularly in key markets in the US, EU and Asia, as well as committing some funding to the continual research and development process.
Tam explained that, because of the company’s Australian roots, global expansion and entry into worldwide markets has always been a foremost consideration at Relectrify. Bolstered by the strength of the company’s technology, Tam sees this expansion towards greater commercialization as an opportunity to prove that the Relectrify’s BMS+Inverter technology is applicable in any market, with any battery system.
“Our technology is a fundamental innovation on battery control,” explained Tam. “Typically in a battery, you have a number of cells in series, and those cells are controlled as a chain, so either the system is on or off, there’s no fine control. Our innovation is that we put power electronics on each and every cell, which means that we can turn cells on and off and control them and manage them individually.”
Tam went onto explain that the finer level of control leads to longer battery lifetimes and allows for the creation of inversion, allowing the product to act as an inverter as well. According to the company, the solution results in up to 30% increased battery lifetime at 30% lower cost of electronics.
What’s more is that, because the innovation is in battery control, rather than battery chemistry, the solution is chemistry and cell agnostic, and applicable to both novel and well established battery chemistries.
Right now, Tam shares that the company’s sweet spot is with large-residential and commercial and industrial projects, ranging from 15 kWh to a few MWh in capacity.
One such project is the company’s 60 kWh second-life battery storage system, run as a pilot in collaboration with utility American Electric Power and Nissan North America. This system combines repurposed batteries from Nissan Leaf vehicles with Relectrify’s BMS+Inverter technology.

Relectrify’s utility second-life battery pilot“In this pilot, we took a set of batteries that had come out of the equivalent of 4.5 electric vehicles, no testing, no sorting, put them straight into the unit, plugged our electronics in and our electronics unlocked the full capacity,” Relectrify cofounder and CEO, Valentin Muenzel, told pv magazine.
The system has undergone 500 charge and discharge cycles into and out of the grid, the majority at over 20 kW continuous power, for a total energy throughput in excess of 25 MWh. Over the course of testing, the pilot system achieved a round-cycle efficiency averaging approximately 88% AC-to-AC, including charge and discharge conversion.
The system is trending toward an expected lifespan of 3,000 cycles, surpassing the 2,000 that the Relectrify team predicted at the onset of the pilot. Muenzel also pointed out that the 3,000 cycle estimation is still a conservative one and that the actual figure could be higher still.
While the final funding figure has not yet been publicized, the funding round was led by venture firm Energy Innovation Capital, and brought in a host of new investors; including Japan’s Energy & Environment Investment; utility Energias de Portugal; and GS Futures, the corporate venture arm of South Korean conglomerate GS Group.
The round also included all existing investors, including Clean Energy Finance Corporation, as well as energy and mobility investors Peter Los and John Clifford, who also chairs Relectrify’s board of directors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/25/terabase-acquires-first-solars-plantpredict-performance-monitoring-software/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 25, 2021",Terabase acquires First Solar’s “PlantPredict” performance monitoring software,"Solar digital solutions provider Terabase Energy  signed a definitive agreement to acquire First Solar’s PlantPredict, a predictive solar modeling tool. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
PlantPredict was developed by First Solar for utility-scale PV modeling, and is aimed at reducing delivery uncertainty by producing field-verified energy forecasts.
PlantPredict has more than a decade of history and has been used to help finance many gigawatts of solar capacity.
The First Solar PlantPredict team will join forces with Terabase after the acquisition is complete, which is expected to occur in October. This is Terabase’s second major acquisition this year, following its integration of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) provider REPlantSolutions.
Terabase CEO Matt Campbell said in an interview with pv magazine that he sees a future of performance modeling characterized by tighter integration with software-based design, cost estimating, and financial modeling. The PlantPredict tool builds on to Terabase’s software applications for utility-scale solar development and management.
Terabase was founded in late 2018 by SunPower alums, who built on some of the foundational digital tools and concepts created for large-scale projects. In addition to providing digital software, Terabase is developing tools for physical construction and operations automation.
Cloud-based architecture and process automation are two areas that Terabase is targeting to drive down costs, leading to more rapid deployment and decarbonization. The company eyes a target of driving solar power prices below $0.01 per kWh by 2025.
Campbell said some headwinds exist in this pursuit, as material costs have risen in polysilicon, glass, and steel; as U.S.-Chinese exchange rates have shifted; and as shipping costs are on the rise. Despite this, he said the one-cent figure is achievable. As proof, he pointed to a Terabase-provided optimization and engineering solution for an 800 MW project in Qatar that priced at $0.015 per kWh, a world record.
Module costs have fallen sharply, but balance-of-system (BOS) costs have remained relatively stagnant over the last 10 years, said Campbell, and project soft costs have become more painful. That pain point opens the door for digitization and automation to help drive cost improvements, he said.
Many utility-scale solar projects still use CAD layouts, spreadsheets, clipboards, and other analog tools for engineering and construction. Terabase is working to replace that with an all-in-one engineering platform.
Some of the elements of the Terabase tool are in beta, and more details will be released later this year, said Campbell, who offered pv magazine a demo of the tool in use.
The Terabase platform begins with 3D GIS-enabled site surveying, topographic, soil, and watershed analysis. It allows users to create automated design and engineering models, and show locations and arrangements of panels, combiner boxes, inverters, trackers, and more.
An earlier beta demonstration of the Terabase utility-scale software platform.
Next, the tool generates performance models, and creates cost estimates for the project, down to all system components, including  module count and cost, wire gauge and length, as well as other system components.
Then, the platform provides a construction simulation, which Campbell likens to the “Sim City” video game. The simulation includes live truck-rolls, cost estimates for transportation costs, construction infrastructure needs, and so on.
Finally, the First Solar-developed SCADA controls system and digital twins are integrated into the system for what the company said is greater visibility into the plant’s operation.
While the company is not ready to disclose what is under development by the way of physical automation of construction and management, Campbell said the company has received some awards from the U.S. Department of Energy for its work in this space. More announcements are expected later this year, he said.
(Read: “Drones, robots, and AI are changing the face of solar and wind farm inspections, literally“)
Campbell said he sees room for improvement in the realm of automation of utility-scale solar construction. Modern module factories are high-tech, with robots, software, and automation, he said. “That’s why modules are so good and so cheap now.” But, as once the module leaves the factory, “you go backwards in time 50 years.”
