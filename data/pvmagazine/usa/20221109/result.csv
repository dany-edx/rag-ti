The facility, which is to planned provide back-up power to the Viejas Casino and Resort, is located on the lands of the Viejas Band.  The energy storage contract is valued at $13.5 million, while the solar component to the microgrid is worth $15 million. Upon completion, the microgrid will be the first such facility owned by a tribal association.
Eos is supplying a 35 MWh zinc-based battery to the project while Invinity is supplying a 10 MWh vanadium redox flow battery. The flow battery is expected to be the largest of its type in the United States. The remaining 15 MWh power capacity will come from an on-site solar array.
The energy storage project will have discharge duration of up to 10 hours. It is being funded by a California Energy Commission grant under the Long-Duration Energy Storage Program. Indian Energy’s award is the first project awarded under the CEC’s $140 million Long-Duration Energy Storage Program, part of governor Gavin Newsom’s historic $54 billion climate pledge to reduce global warming and increase grid resiliency.
Eos, Invinity and Indian Energy are expected to sign a long-term development agreement for the project construction in the coming weeks.
On November 3, Indian Energy received $31 million in grant funding from the CEC to develop microgrid projects using solar and battery storage systems, for which Eos Energy is the supplier of storage systems.
“Indian Energy’s mission is to support Indian Country on their journey toward energy sovereignty while creating a sustainable future for our seventh generation,” said Allen Cadreau, Indian Energy’s founder and CEO.
The Viejas Band is one of 12 bands of the Kumeyaay Indian Nation which resides on a 1,600-acre reservation in the Viejas Valley, near the town of Alpine in San Diego County. The Band is recognized as a sovereign government by the United States.
Indian Energy operates a multi-year development pipeline that consists of 4 GW of solar and wind projects, and 6 GWh of energy storage projects. The project development company has partnered with the Department of Defense, Community Choice Aggregators and  Tribal Utility Authorities.
To date more than 4 GW of energy storage projects have been installed in the California Independent System Operator territory. The state’s project development pipeline includes 48 GW of battery storage and 4 GW of long-duration storage projects through 2045.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/09/agrivoltaic-solar-tracker-uses-cables-instead-of-buried-steel/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",Agrivoltaic solar tracker uses cables instead of buried steel,"Rute Foundation Systems, founded in Oregon in 2015, specializes in modular foundations for renewable energy. But in 2021 it focused its sites above ground, designing the patent-pending Suntracker for high-clearance solar installations like agrivoltaics.
Agrivoltaics, the practice of co-locating solar energy production with agriculture, has been gaining traction around the world as prime solar land becomes more scarce and the benefits of pairing solar with farmland become more obvious. For example, researchers at the University of Arizona have found that solar arrays improve crop yield in dry environments by providing shade. Furthermore, grazing sheep among solar panels has been used to manage grasses at the site, performing an agricultural form of O&M. An agrivoltaic array is typically raised above 8 feet to allow agriculture to continue underneath, and that’s where the Suntracker design comes in.
“Despite being beneficial for the landowner, agrivoltaics has historically been a difficult sell for the developer,” said Doug Krause, resident, Rute Foundation Systems. “Now that we have a system with attractive economics to all stakeholders, we expect dual-use utility scale agrivoltaics to grow exponentially”

The Suntracker system is suspended by cables, rather than mounted on steel driven into the ground, providing what the company says is the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for high-clearance solar. Rute reports that by using cables rather than steel foundations, steel use is reduced by as much as 30%. Another advantage of the cable system is that the land does not have to be disturbed in order to install the system, which is a benefit in the agricultural industry. It also enables the land to be returned to its original condition in the event that the solar installation were to be removed.
Rute compares its Suntracker installation to a cable suspension bridge. The cables not only hold the system in place, just as in a suspension bridge, but they also use the cables to rotate the panels to track the sun,. The tracking systems provides up to 28% more electricity than fixed panels, the company reports. With its lower cost and the additional revenue from tracking, Rute says its Suntracker is the first agrivoltaic system to achieve a levelized LCOE competitive with conventional solar.
Rute received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy and Business Oregon to build a pilot, and the company is now building its proving ground at the manufacturing innovation center in Scappoose, Oregon.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/09/solar-tracker-provider-array-technologies-reports-q3-earnings-surprise-chosen-for-750-mw-project/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022","Solar tracker provider Array Technologies reports Q3 earnings surprise, chosen for 750 MW project","Array Technologies announced that its DuraTrack solar trackers were selected for a 750 MW solar project in Ohio. The project, among the largest in the United States, will cover 4,500 acres, mounting 1.4 million panels on 13,000 tracker rows.
Tracker deliveries are expected to begin January 2023, while the commercial operations date is planned for 2024. The project is expected to provide enough power for 116,000 average Ohio homes each year. The project is under development by EDF North America. Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) will be operated by Blattner Energy of Quanta Services.
“This project is a win-win-win for the county in Ohio,” said Kevin Hosteler, CEO of Array Technologies. The project will deliver clean energy to the local power grid, provide hundreds of new construction jobs, and generate revenue streams from lease agreements and tax revenues. The facility will also serve as a STEM resource for students involved in science, sustainability, and environmental learning, said Hosteler.
The DuraTrack features a single-bolt module clamp with forgiving tolerances and flexible linked architecture. The company said it uses fewer components and a custom wind design to make DuraTrack ready for the conditions faced by utility-scale solar projects.
Earnings
Array Technologies (NYSE:ARRY) beat estimates, up over 14% in trading session at the time of writing following the Q3 earnings call. Quarterly earnings of $0.18 per share beat the consensus estimate of $0.12 per share. This compares to a loss of $0.07 per share a year ago.
The company posted revenues of $515 million, compared to last year’s in-quarter revenues of $192 million. The consensus earnings per share estimate is $0.11 on $350.65 million in revenues for Q4 2022 and $0.30 per share on $1.48 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Gross margin for the quarter was 15.6%, representing Array’s fourth consecutive quarter of growth.
Hosteler said on the earnings call that there is much excitement for the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), but implementation may take time.  “It is important for us to remind everyone that this act, one that is certainly not small and easy to implement, is only 3 months old. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done by the various governmental agencies tasked with rolling it out to define and clarify critical aspects of the bill before the industry can wholesale shift to the new paradigm,” he said.
Array is actively engaged with key trade association groups, governmental agencies, and legislators to ensure an effective rollout of the IRA. Hosteler said Array is focused specifically on three outcomes:
“First, we are having daily conversations with customers around building out the framework for pricing agreements under the IRA. These have progressed as far as discussing reserved capacity agreements and revisiting pricing for certain orders under varying levels of domestic content. Second, we have engaged with our suppliers on the domestic manufacturing credits to begin to crack the parameters under which these will be shared in the value chain. I can appreciate that everyone would like us to provide our view of those splits but it is too early to give that definitive of an answer and we will also avoid having these negotiations in public. Lastly, we are evaluating our own manufacturing footprint along with our key supplier relationships to ensure that we are maximizing the benefit to array while ensuring we continue to maintain our key strategic relationships.” Kevin Hosteler, CEO Array Technologies.

The updated Voyager clamp series uses FTC’s patented Slide and Glide method as well as First Solar’s SpeedSlot mounting feature, creating a clamp that requires no traditional hardware.  The Slide and Glide method uses a mechanical fastener to secure and ground the module frame to the clamp’s rail.
The company reports that the improved clamp enables the rapid installation of solar modules, suitable for ground-mounted applications such as utility and community solar development supporting framed mono, poly and bifacial modules in a double module portrait orientation.
The Voyager can be configured in a 1,500V string architecture of 4 strings per row and up to 30 modules per string, or 1,000V architecture with 6 strings per row and up to 20 modules per string.
The clamp has undergone rigorous wind tunnel testing by an independent engineering firm to assure structural and torsional stability in wind conditions up to 120 mph.
Founded in 2017, FTC Solar is based in Austin, Texas and provides its tracker systems around the world.
Q3 earnings recap
FTC Solar reported Q3 earnings results before the markets opened, posting lower revenue of $16.5 million, down from $52.9 million in Q3 21 based on lower U.S. demand in the utility solar market. This occurred as customers struggle to navigate the regulatory environment and get line of sight of module orders.  Its lower financial results widened to negative $0.25 earnings per share compared to negative $0.24 per share in Q3 21, driven by lower volumes and partly offset by higher average selling prices for its products.
FTC Solar’s common shares traded at $1.93 before the market opened, down from $8.25 per share a year ago, while the company traded for a $196.4 million market capitalization.

Renewable energy, including solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal, has reached new heights, now accounting for 27% of all generating capacity in the United States.
FERC tracks queued projects. Those that have progressed to a level of development that they are likely to be completed are considered “high probability additions.” Through 2025, FERC forecasts solar to carry the banner for U.S. energy buildout.
Solar has 72 GW of high probability additions queued through 2025. This will add to the 77 GW of active solar capacity on the grid today, effectively doubling solar in three short years.
The 77 GW expected from solar is the lion’s share of the 110 GW of high probability additions, with wind following, adding 18 GW, and gas with 17 GW expected.
There is a whopping 206 GW of projects in the queues in total, but some projects will be speculative, and others may run into interconnection approval issues or be delayed beyond 2025.
In terms of deployment, solar led the way with 6.51 GW added January through September, though it trailed last year’s deployment of 9.5 GW through nine months. Wind followed with 6.3 GW added, outpacing natural gas, which added 6 GW through nine months this year. 
As a portion of the grid’s total capacity, wind now represents 11.23%, hydropower 8.05%, solar 6.14% biomass 1.22%, and geothermal 0.32%. The group contributes 27% of all capacity, nearly double its representation from ten years ago, when it supplied under 15% of the grid’s generative capacity. Natural gas is still the dominant source of electricity generation, with the carbon-emitting source being burned to supply 44% of the U.S. grid capacity.  
Capacity retirements have been led by the fossil fuel category. Of the 41 GW retired this year, 19 GW was coal, and 17.5 GW was natural gas. Solar represented the only technology to not report any utility-scale capacity retirements this year. 
FERC highlighted a few landmark project activations this year, including:

And soon it may be one of the most environmentally friendly.
Back in 2011 the Zoo installed a 1.56 MW solar array over its main parking lot, and now it’s preparing the installation of a microgrid with a 28 MW solar array with battery storage. The zoo is on track to meet its goal to being the first zoo in the U.S. with net-zero energy, waste and water status.
The 28 MW solar array will be erected at the zoo’s Bowyer Farm and will move the Zoo from net zero to net positive. The project was initially developed by Melink Solar Development and Soltage, LLC and is owned by Harrison Street, an investment management firms exclusively focused on alternative real assets. Inovateus Solar, headquartered in South Bend, Indiana, was awarded the EPC contract.

“The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden has been working behind the scenes for over a decade to be able to leverage a portion of our farm property for a significant solar array. We are excited to finally see this dream come to fruition, furthering our commitment to clean, renewable energy. This project is a win for our community, our partners, and our environment,” said Mark Fisher, vice president at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden.
The project will use 52,000 VSUN 540W bifacial panels, Solectria inverters, and FTC tracking systems. It is expected to bring 100 jobs to the area during the 12 to 14-month construction timeframe.
“The Cincinnati Zoo project, like our projects at the University of Illinois and Michigan State University, fits nicely into our strategic objective to help cities and universities transition to sustainable power,” said Timothy Sutherland, the executive chairman of Inovateus Solar. “The Cincinnati Zoo touches so many young people and provides a fantastic opportunity to integrate the message of protecting animal habitats and our greater habituate for humanity.”
