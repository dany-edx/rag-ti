Wood Mackenzie forecasts that newly installed PV capacity will reach approximately 270 GW throughout the world this year. This projected growth, if confirmed by final figures, will indicate a substantial 33% increase from 2022.
The research firm predicts a 1% year-on-year expansion in the global solar market for 2024, followed by a 5% increase in 2025. However, a potential decline of 1% is anticipated in 2026. Notably, the Asia-Pacific region, including China, is poised to dominate PV deployment until 2032.

Wood Mackenzie said that the remarkable escalation in China’s manufacturing capacity is driving new solar installations to unprecedented heights.
“Massive expansion of manufacturing capacity in China is pushing solar installations to record levels,” WoodMackenzie said. “Developers are taking advantage of plummeting polysilicon prices to rapidly expand utility-scale solar plants despite increased curtailment risks.”
The report notes China’s significant influence in the PV manufacturing landscape, and suggests that the nation might transition from exporting modules to focusing on upstream cells and wafers. The research notes that policy incentives for local PV manufacturing in the United States, Europe, and India are unlikely to significantly erode China’s market share in the near future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/03/sma-america-debuts-home-energy-storage-solution/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 3, 2023",SMA America debuts home energy storage solution,"SMA America, a division of the German company SMA Solar Technology AG, has introduced its Home Energy Solution to the U.S. market. This new system includes ahybrid inverter, energy meter, optional Backup Secure, an app for monitoring, and more.
The Sunny Boy Smart Energy hybrid inverter is at the heart of the energy storage solution and it can be equipped with Backup Secure (previously known as Secure Power Supply) to control the home’s energy, sending it to chosen appliances when needed. The battery inverter uses multistring technology, which offers the ability to connect up to three high-voltage batteries for a total of 2000 W of power. For whole home backup, the Automatic Backup Unit is required.
The Home Energy Solution can be installed incrementally, depending on a homeowner’s needs and budget. The DC-coupled battery in the energy storage system can offer 200% DC-to-AC oversizing capabilities. The system uses maximum power point tracking (MPPT), which matches the solar output with the battery storage.
While the inverter does not currently include a battery, an SMA spokesperson told pv magazine USA that the inverter will be compatible with the BYD HVL and LG Energy Solutions batteries at launch. SMA launched its first residential battery product, the SMA Home Storage, at Intersolar Munich. While this battery is not currently available in the U.S. market, the company reports that it is actively developing an SMA battery for the U.S. market, which is expected to be released in 2024.
SMA reports that the system can easily be expanded because it only requires adding solar sizing to the main service panel. Installation is simplified, the company says, because the batteries do not impact AC breaker size, which reduces the need to upgrade the electrical panel.
The Integrated System Manager, which is included, allows management and monitoring of up to four inverters, energy meter and batteries. SMA ShadeFix is also included with the Sunny Boy inverter, which optimizes PV system energy production in varying array designs as well as when solar panels are shaded.
The SMA 360° app helps solar installers plan, commission, monitor and service systems, SMA reports. Installers can a QR code at installation to help simplify commissioning.
Dimensions are 19.7 x 23.1 x 9.3 inches and the system weighs 38.6 pounds. Operating temperature range is −13 F to +140 F.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/03/radiation-hardened-solar-blankets-to-power-orbital-logistics-vehicle/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ARIZONA,COLORADO,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 3, 2023",Radiation-hardened solar blankets to power orbital logistics vehicle,"Solestial, a space-based solar technology provider based in Tempe, Arizona, and Atomos Space, an in-space logistics company, announced the two have entered a partnership in which Solestial will supply its ultra-thin PV blankets for Atomos’ solar-electric orbital transfer vehicles (OTV).
The deal calls for at least 20 kW of ultra-thin, low mass, radiation-hardened solar blankets to power the craft for several upcoming missions in 2024. The company said its 20-micron thick cells demonstrate over 20% efficiency.
Atomos’ OTVs provide a variety of transportation services for satellite operators. The craft use high-powered electric propulsion systems, making use of PV as a steady supply of power in space. Following an initial demonstration, the blanket shipsets from Solestial will power two OTVs providing deployment services to constellation operators in low Earth orbit and relocation services to operators in other orbits.
“It was clear that traditional space solar was too expensive and too supply-constrained to support our high-power OTV design,” said Vanessa Clark, Atomos co-founder and chief executive officer. “We were attracted to Solestial’s solution as they provided the best combination of solar array specific mass performance, radiation hardness, and affordability available on the market today.”
The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) independently validated the ability of Solestial’s ultrathin silicon solar cells to effectively anneal radiation damage under sunlight at 90 C (194 F). This means the cells essentially self-heal under radiation damage.
Solestial’s silicon solar cells open circuit voltage dropped by only 4% and maintained 96% of initial value after being exposed to radiation equivalent to 10 years in low Earth orbit.
“Annealing of radiation damage in silicon is straightforward at high temperatures, for example, above 200-250°C, but this is not useful for applications in space as these temperatures are rarely, if ever, experienced in situ,” said Romain Cariou, space silicon solar applications expert, CEA. “The differentiation factor here is that Solestial’s cells can cure radiation damage at normal operating temperatures for solar panels in space.”
The Tempe, Arizona-based company has been developing its technology for over a decade, beginning its life in Arizona State University. It underwent a $10 million seed funding round in October 2022.
Solestial targets a 2025 launch of a manufacturing facility capable of producing 10 MW per year of solar blankets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/03/the-economics-of-solar-grazing/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 3, 2023",The economics of solar grazing,"Solar grazing, the practice of grazing livestock (typically sheep) on land with solar arrays, is gaining traction in the U.S. A survey found that the most common initial purchases for starting this business are a pickup truck and sheep. These farmers typically oversee the grazing of an average of 55 acres of field per season, using 125 sheep for each operation. They spend an average of 14.75 hours in the field supervising on-site labor, 8.17 hours traveling, and 5.67 hours on business administration.
In addition to this valuable data, the researchers highlighted resources that could enable a grazing entrepreneur to launch a solar grazing business.

The Bock Agricultural Law & Policy Program at the University of Illinois conducted the survey during the first half of 2023, circulating it via the American Solar Grazing Association. The goal was to build on existing literature about the costs and revenues of grazing sheep at solar power facilities.
The survey’s findings, detailed in the report The Economics of Solar Grazing, were enriched with data from several reliable sources to define the costs of running a solar grazing business.
The survey found that 75% of those who signed contracts to graze their sheep on solar sites also agreed to take on vegetation management responsibilities, necessitating the purchase of lawn mowers and edge trimmers. While sheep cover large volumes of area well, they do not always meet the technical standards required by solar asset owners.

The Bock group pointed to research in New York that revealed vegetation management contracts between sheep farmers and solar power plant operators result in an annual income of $300 to $500 per acre of solar site. Prices are generally higher in New York and lower elsewhere on the East Coast. The New York report also included a comprehensive income statement for grazing 56 sheep on 22 acres of land.
Another insightful document was the Mount Morris Agrivoltaic Study, which outlined in incredible economic detail the solar grazing and beekeeping business plans in conjunction with EDF Renewables’ 177 MW, 1,000-acre solar facility in Livingston County, NY.
In related coverage by pv magazine USA, from the perspective of an asset owner, BayWa r.e. has begun optimizing its sheep count while experimenting with shepherd partnership business models. The large-scale solar asset owner found that at one particularly rocky site in Texas, grazing with sheep led to increased electricity generation and savings of $413,774 compared to the cost of mowing. Although the sheep appeared to have damaged two solar modules, this was minimal compared to the 1,035 panels damaged by projectiles.
Prior research suggests that integrating agriculture into solar facilities increased respondents’ likelihood of supporting a solar facility to greater than 80%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/03/audubon-calls-for-collaboration-in-rapid-transmission-line-expansion/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"AUGUST 3, 2023",Audubon calls for collaboration in rapid transmission line expansion,"Generating a carbon-free power sector by 2035 will require rapid and expansive investment into alternative energy sources. Experts and leaders increasingly emphasize the importance of planning socially and environmentally conscious projects that won’t leave more destruction in their wake. 
The National Audubon Society’s (Audubon) most recent report – “Birds and Transmission: Building the Grid Birds Need” – hopes to address that. As more states move toward upgrading their transmission line capacity to better cater to wind and solar infrastructure, researchers like Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at Audubon, suggest stakeholders collaborate to build and renovate transmission lines with environmental science in mind. 
Transmission capacity is the amount of power able to move from where electricity is generated to where it’s consumed. Johnson says that domestic transmission capacity will have to triple to connect the new renewables required to reach net-zero emissions safely.
Refurbishing existing infrastructure corridors and being mindful of any negative impacts on birds wildlife and people while constructing new ones, is key to successfully scaling The Biden Administration’s Build Back Better agenda. 
The large size and high voltage of new transmission lines pose different threats to birds and their habitat than residential versions. Johnson says these power cables have over 60kV higher voltage than neighborhood lines, sit on taller poles and are spaced farther apart. 
Such a scenario poses threats for birds in two ways: direct and indirect disturbances. 
Direct disturbances involve birds killed from flying into overhead wires. Audubon suggests accidents like these account for 8 to 57 million bird deaths yearly. 
Even so, scientists are now publishing guidelines on how developers can best avoid crashes by building transmission lines that cater to different species’ vision flight and behavior.

Indirect disturbances mostly come in the form of habitat destruction. Projects of this scale need more land and easy access to it. This can lead to the degradation of natural spaces to better accommodate the heavy machinery that will construct new transmission lines or refurbish old ones. 
Bird species like grouse are particularly affected: this medium to large herbivore only lives in healthy sagebrush areas. Sagebrush is a nurse plant that creates conditions for other critical native plants (like grass) to grow. This greenery feeds wildlife and farm animals including cattle or sheep, which many Northwestern and Western communities rely on for food or to generate income through meat and dairy products.

Audubon suggests implementing proactive and reactive solutions to help streamline the construction process. Johnson says the first should be used throughout pre-construction to stop negative impacts or minimize those that can’t be avoided. The latter should respond to the remaining challenges that come up through construction. 
Examples include using advanced conductors or new tower designs to refurbish old transmission lines, reducing the risk of habitat destruction from building new power cables. Audubon suggests upgrading existing lines or expanding within current ROWs could meet almost half of all additional transmission needs. Removing the highest and thinnest shield wires is an example of reactive solutions to decreasing bird collisions.

New technique to recover lead in end-of-life solar panels  A research group at Arizona State has developed a process to recover lead in its metallic form so that it can be reused in the PV industry. The process relies on a leaching solution based on a combination of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which the researchers said leaches the lead ‘in a matter of minutes.’
