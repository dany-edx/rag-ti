Kelowna, British Columbia-based Enertopia Corp. said its technology would enable it to create a closed system loop where only solar energy is used to extract lithium from source rock at its Nevada mine.
The technology takes excess heat from solar panels and uses it to heat a brine solution to 122°F to 140°F during a typical three- to four-hour hour processing cycle.
The company said that as it moved toward creating a low-carbon lithium extraction pilot plant, it realized that inefficiencies associated with PV panels could be used to its advantage. In particular, it found that the PV panels are subject to heat stress as temperatures rise. Manufacturers generally rate PV panels at a temperature of 77F. But field work in the Nevada desert showed temperatures on the back of solar panels regularly exceeding 140F, potentially damaging the panels and reducing output.
The company said that its provisional patent addresses this heat issue.
According to Enertopia, if a panel is rated to have a temperature coefficient of -0.50% per 1.8°F above 77 °F, then that panel’s output power will fall by half of a percent for every 1.8F degrees the temperature rises above 77 °F. It said that a solar array in the Nevada desert operating 60F into the heat stress zone would experience a decrease of 15% or more on the solar array output.
The technology is designed to be retrofitted onto existing PV panels. An unnamed third party with a 3 MW solar array has agreed to do real-time comparative testing on their PV sub-arrays. The goal will be to increase PV production while simultaneously removing the heat stress.
In December, Enertopia acquired USPTO patent #6,024,086, “Solar energy collector having oval absorption tubes.” At the time it said it believed the patent could provide a “novel approach to using waste heat from various sources.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/26/a-cliff-hanger-as-illinois-edges-closer-to-passing-desperately-needed-energy-legislation/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ILLINOIS",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 26, 2021",A cliff-hanger as Illinois edges closer to passing desperately needed energy legislation,"With the Illinois legislative session coming to a close at the end of this month, the state stands at the precipice of passing desperately needed clean energy legislation.
All eyes are on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Consumers and Climate First Act, the most recent legislation introduced, and the bill widely viewed as the most likely to pass.
The bill calls for the phasing out of both coal- and gas-fired power, with coal set to be gone by 2030 and natural gas by 2045. Within these phase-out targets, the bill also includes plant-specific declining caps on emissions that would lead to plant closures and a carbon tax starting at $8/ton and escalating 3% each year.
Pritzker’s bill is a compromise of sorts, with targets that are less ambitious than the Clean Energy Jobs Act, which calls for decarbonizing the power sector by 2030, but more ambitious than the proposed Path to 100, which calls for 40% renewables by 2030 and does not include a firm date for moving to 100% renewable energy.
Compromise or not, the consensus in Illinois is that a clean energy and emissions bill needs to be passed this session, especially considering the state of the state’s distributed solar industry.
Last December, the final incentives from the state’s 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act were awarded, marking the end of a development boom that had put the state on track to meet its 2008 RPS goal of requiring utilities to source 25% of their electricity from renewables by 2025.
Companies and organizations that had previously thrown their support behind the Clean Energy Jobs Act or the Path to 100 now back Pritzker’s bill. They recognize that if no energy legislation passes the current session, then the state’s solar industry will suffer what many fear will be a significant and irreparable decline.
One area where the Pritzker bill finds is similar to other proposed legislation is through workforce training and equity components. The Clean Energy Jobs Act included job creation goals for communities of color and places where coal-fired electricity plants operate. Likewise, Pritzker’s bill includes provisions for the development of clean jobs training hubs, scholarships, and other supports for families of workers displaced by the move away from coal, as well as expansions to the Illinois Solar for All program.
Under Pritzker’s bill, the Illinois Solar for All program would require companies that close coal mines or coal-fired power plants to provide detailed information on their workforce to help the state ease their transition to new work, and to provide two years’ notice of mass layoff or relocation plans.
Pritzker’s bill also proposes to lift the cap on how customers’ monthly bills can be charged to fund renewable energy development. It also includes some significant utility reform measures pertaining with accountability, transparency, and how rates are formulated.

The latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) “Electric Power Monthly” report shows that for the first quarter of 2021, solar and wind increased by 24.3% and 10.5% respectively. The figures included the growth of distributed rooftop systems.
The growth by solar and wind proved to be necessary down to the last kilowatt, as output by hydropower was down by 7.5% in the month, biomass was down 3.6%, and geothermal was down 1.5%. Non-hydro renewable generation rose by 11.2% during the first three months of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. Generation by all renewables, including hydropower, grew by 4.4% compared to the previous year. Renewables’ share of the nation’s electrical generation in Q1 was 21.6%, up from 21.2% a year earlier.
While renewables expanded, electric generation by natural gas during the quarter fell by 10.5%, and by 14.8% in March alone. The fuel’s share of the nation’s electrical generation during the first quarter of 2021 was 34.3%, down from the 39.2% mark achieved a year ago. Higher prices led some power generators to favor lower-cost coal-fired generation over natural gas.
Electrical output by nuclear also fell in Q1, this time by 2.8%. Collectively, renewables outpaced nuclear power during both the first quarter of 2021 and the month of March alone by 8.7% and 26.2% respectively.
Coal-fired generation grew 34.8% in Q1 2021, compared to Q1 2020, as economics favored coal. Electrical generation by coal during the first quarter exceeded that of all renewable sources combined by 7.4%. However, by March, renewables had bounced back and eclipsed coal’s output for the month by 29.6%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/26/sunrise-brief-lg-energy-solution-to-replace-problem-li-ion-energy-storage-batteries/,"BATTERY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 26, 2021",Sunrise brief: LG Energy Solution to replace problem li-ion energy storage batteries,"LG Energy Solution said it would replace, at its own cost, lithium-ion battery cells used for certain energy storage products that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program comes after overheating incidents were reported.
The company said in a statement that it determined that there were issues in the early production processes for electrodes used in potentially affected  batteries. Reports said the batteries were produced at the company’s Nanjing factory in China. The replacement program could cost around $350 million.
New batteries will incorporate manufacturing process improvements. The company said it also will implement remote modifications to reduce the potential for overheating while owners wait for their replacement units. LG Energy Solution also will update its battery diagnostic and control software. And it said that field inspections will also be undertaken to monitor and minimize the potential for further incidents.
The company said it “will continue to take preemptive action to ensure that customer safety remains its highest priority.”
News reports said that Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy set up a joint public-private committee in 2019 to investigate the fires and found that some cells had manufacturing defects such as poor cutting, plate folding, and poor material coating. Last December, LG Energy Solution launched a voluntary recall in the U.S. of “RESU” batteries sold from 2017 to March 2019.
In an April 2019 accident involving one of the company’s utility-scale lithium-ion battery arrays at an Arizona Public Service location, a thermal runaway event in a lithium-ion cell triggered a chain of events that led to an accumulation of gases in the container that housed the batteries. Those gases exploded when first responders opened an access door to investigate reports of smoke coming from the container. Two firefighters were seriously injured in the explosion.
In a report released in late July, the utility and its third-party investigator said that evidence pointed to the failure of a single lithium-ion cell as triggering the events. LG Chem challenged that finding, saying that the utility’s report missed a number of details about the accident. Those details indicated, LG Chem said, that the cell thermal runaway began due to “intense heating” caused by a heat source “such as external electrical arcing” on one of the battery racks.
In March, LG Energy Solution said that it planned to invest more than $4.5 billion over the next four years to expand its battery production capacity in the U.S. by 70 GWh. The expansion would give the company a total production capacity of more than 110 GWh in the U.S. In April, Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of LG Energy Solution and General Motors, announced a more than $2.3 billion investment to build a battery cell manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to serve a nearby GM production line.
Duke Energy has started work on the 22.6-MW Speedway Solar power plant in Cabarrus County, northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina.
The project will be owned and operated by Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions, a recently announced commercial brand that includes Duke Energy Renewables. The power plant will use about 77,000 Jinko bifacial modules with single-axis tracking. The plant is slated to enter commercial service by the end of 2021.
The facility’s design, procurement of inverters, balance of plant systems and construction of the project will be performed by Swinerton. The solar power generated by Speedway Solar will be delivered through a 20-year power purchase agreement.
Connecticut’s Senate passed a bill that would deploy 1,000 MW of energy storage by the end of 2030.
Senate Bill 952 establishes goals, program requirements, and authority to procure energy storage. It also directs the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to report back to the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee annually on progress toward achieving the goals.
Targets aim for 300 MW by the end of 2024 and 650 MW by the end of 2027. The state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority would be required to open a proceeding by the first of next year to develop and implement programs and funding mechanisms for storage connected to the electric distribution grid.
Energy storage would be included at residential, commercial and industrial (C&I), and front-of-meter locations.
Guzman Energy signed a power purchase agreement with Primergy Solar for energy from a proposed 155 MW Hesperus Solar Project in LaPlata County on Colorado’s western slope. Energy from the array, which would be built on 1,500 acres, would serve customers in western Colorado and New Mexico. The project is slated to enter service by the end of 2023.
