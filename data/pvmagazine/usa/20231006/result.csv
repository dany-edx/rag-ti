The company further contends that its batteries are well-suited to address the decreased productivity of offshore wind during winter lulls, effectively adding 14.4 GW of offshore wind capacity and helping phase out 15.4 GW of fossil fuel dependence.
The product is touted for its cost benefits, delivering capacity at an approximate $20/kWh – a stark contrast to the $176/kWh of a 6-hour lithium-ion solution (one of many storage products the document modeled). This value proposition is detailed in their recent white paper, “Clean, Reliable, Affordable: The Value of Multi-Day Storage in New England.”

According to Form Energy’s modeling, by harnessing solar energy more judiciously, New England could realize savings of around $115 billion. An additional $80 billion in savings is projected on the lithium-ion storage front, totaling an estimated $190 billion.
As New England contemplates a transition to a ‘fossil-free by 2050’ framework, the elimination of fossil fuels would pivot their energy dependence to renewables. Current cost modeling suggests that overbuilding renewables and curtailing as needed is more affordable than installing standard 4 and 6-hour lithium-ion backups when it comes to covering the three day winter time wind power lulls that must be considered.
By design, overbuilding renewables results in significant curtailment. In the heavily oversized model, a mere 79% of New England’s offshore wind and 43% of its solar potential are exploited. With Form Energy’s approach, these figures could catapult to 95% and 84% respectively, slashing curtailment by 83%.
While roughly $190 billion in hardware is saved, the system requires the installation of $92 billion of other equipment – including Form Energy’s own technology. The expansion of offshore wind facilities would require an added $29.1 billion (at $2,021/kW), medium-range storage is estimated at $16.1 billion (at $3,232 per kW), and Form Energy’s 23.4 GW/2.34 TWh setup would cost around $46.8 billion (at $2,150 per kW).
It’s worth noting that although Form Energy’s product does greatly increase system efficiency, its round-trip efficiency is under 50%, in contrast to lithium-ion’s 85%.

Factoring in these expenses, net hardware savings hover around the $100 billion mark. Moreover, the company notes that offsetting 111 GW of solar could conserve nearly 300,000 acres of New England’s land.
On the other hand, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources suggests that the energy produced by those 300,000 acres of solar could be matched in capacity by the deployment of as much as 152 GW of “highly suitable” rooftop solar in Massachusetts alone.
Beyond the $100 billion in projected savings, a crucial takeaway is Form Energy’s adherence to a “No Fossil Fuel” system. Presently, New England is without a unified regional policy, with only some progressive states like Massachusetts targeting a “Net Zero” status by 2050.
A prevailing concern for New England’s wind energy is its unpredictability. Despite offshore wind resources in New England demonstrating an impressive winter capacity factor of 60%, there are stretches with virtually zero production, sometimes lasting several days.

To address this, Form Energy analyzed two decades of offshore wind data from ISO New England, the regional power grid manager. The data suggests that pairing every MW of offshore wind with 0.56 MW and 30-34 MWh of energy storage would capably handle offshore wind interruptions, even those at the 90th to 95th severity percentile.
Numerous energy storage alternatives could fit this bill, but Form Energy’s solution stands out. It’s projected to be nearly 80% more affordable than lithium-ion counterparts, carries a minimal fire risk, and boasts over double the longevity, making it an attractive proposition for the region’s energy future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/06/novel-thin-film-anti-soiling-coating-increases-solar-module-yield-by-over-3/,"RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 6, 2023",Novel thin-film anti-soiling coating increases solar module yield by over 3%,"From pv magazine global
Scientists from the Madison Area Technical College in the Wisconsin have tested superhydrophobic self-cleaning, anti-soiling coatings that, if applied to photovoltaic modules, can purportedly increase the panels’ yield by over 3%.
The coatings are based on nanoparticle oxide suspensions developed by US-based Microporous Oxides Science and Technology, LLC (MOST), which specializes in the preparation of stable suspensions of nanoparticulate oxides for use as coatings on several substrates to produce self-assembled porous thin-films for a wide variety of applications.
The researchers tested, in particular, anti-soiling coatings created via spray deposition and sol-gel synthesis, a wet-chemical technique commonly utilized for the production of both glassy and ceramic materials. The coatings were made with a nanoparticulate suspension containing a mixture of titania, titanium oxide (TiO2), silica, silicon dioxide (SiO2) and metal oxides.
The advantage of using sol-gel synthesis is not using heat to make the coating adhere to the underlying glass cover of the PV module, which allows the films to consolidate, cure, bond, and harden upon exposure to sunlight in the field.
“Metal oxide thin films containing nanoparticulate photoactive materials such as titania are capable of sintering upon excitation from ultraviolet radiation,” the scientists explained. “This sunlight-induced UV sintering process serves to chemically bond the nanoparticles to one another, and to the solar PV module’s glazing surface, rendering a durable thin film that is resistant to wear and dissolution.”
The research team coated the solar modules in an automotive collision repair spray booth with two different spray guns and nozzles. “After spraying, the modules were allowed to air dry in the spray booths, which were maintained at 15% relative humidity,” the scientists explained.
They then tested the coating on a PV system relying on eight 370 W south-oriented coated bifacial modules mounted with a tile angle of 10 degrees provided by Jordan-based Philadelphia Solar. Their performance was compared with that of eight uncoated reference panels of the same kind.
The field tests showed that soiling residues on the coated modules were thinner than those in the uncoated panels.
“Coated and uncoated solar modules also demonstrated significantly different wetting behavior in the field that was easily visible to the naked eye,” the research group said in the report. “Rain deposited on the uncoated panels tended to bead up, forming raised droplets on the surface. By comparison, rain on the coated panels tended to sheet, wetting a much larger portion of the panel’s surface.”
The analysis showed that the coated panels achieved an annual power production of 1,097 kWh/kW, while the uncoated modules achieved a yield of 1,058 kWh/kW. “While a 3 to 3.5% energy gain may appear modest, improvements of this magnitude would be of significant financial importance to the industry,” the researchers said.
They also specified that the cost of thin film coating materials is approximately $80 per liter and estimated the cost per panel at about $2.6, which would represent an increase of about 1.4% in the total cost of the panel. “It appears clear that the MOST coatings tested in this study have strong potential to be a commercially viable product for solar manufacturing.”
The novel anti-soiling coating was presented in the study “Field tests of a self-sintering, anti-soiling, self-cleaning, nanoporous metal oxide, transparent thin film coating for solar photovoltaic modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
“As of August 2023, we have successfully coated modules from several different manufacturers, including Adani, Axitec, Crossroads, REC, Silfab, Trina and Yingli,” the scientists said referring to the future direction of their work. “We hope to report on field tests using those coated modules in the next year or two.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/06/u-s-utility-scale-solar-to-more-than-double-installations-year-over-year/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 6, 2023",U.S. utility-scale solar to more than double installations year-over-year,"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LNBL) released its 2023 utility-scale solar report, reflecting on data collected through 2022. The report noted that utility-scale solar had a “strong” 2022 despite numerous challenges, installing 10.4 GW across the nation. This lagged the record 12.5 GW installed in 2021.
Cumulative utility-scale solar reached 61.7 GW nationwide by the end of 2022, said LNBL. Texas added the most last year, with 2.5 GW brought online, followed by California (2.1 GW), Virginia (0.6 GW), and Georgia (0.5 GW).
Single-axis tracking remained the most common configuration for the sector in 2022, with 94% of all new capacity added in 2022 using that mounting type. The remainder was mounted on a fixed tilt.
Installed costs of projects continued to fall in 2022, with median installed costs $1.32 per Wac. This occurred despite inflationary pressures throughout the year. Costs have now fallen by 78%, averaging about 10% per year, since 2010.
Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) also fell in 2022, reaching an average of $39 per MWh. LNBL said average LCOE has fallen about 84%, averaging 14% annually since 2010. This has been driven by lower capital costs and improving project capacity factors, among other factors, said LNBL.
Power purchase agreement (PPA) prices averaged $25 per MWh in 2022. Prices have largely followed the decline in LCOE over time, though prices stagnated and even increased in 2019.

Rising wholesale electricity prices have boosted the utility-scale solar national average market value by 40% in 2022, reaching $71 per MWh. Solar’s average market value in 2022 was lowest in CAISO ($51 per MWh) and highest in Duke Energy Florida’s service territory ($108 per MWh), said LNBL.
Hybrid projects that include battery energy storage are on the rise as well. In 2022, 35 projects totaling 3.6 GW of PV and 1.8 GW / 5.4 GWh of battery storage achieved commercial operations.
Looking ahead, massive amounts of utility-scale solar is queued up and waiting for interconnection approval across the United States. At least 947 GW of capacity was waiting in queues at the end of 2022. Almost half, about 457 GW, is paired with a battery.
While the Inflation Reduction Act has generated much excitement in the industry, the benefits have yet to be realized in this 2022 summary report, said LNBL.
“Nonetheless, 2023 is shaping up to be the strongest year on record for utility-scale solar, as the first eight months have already yielded 8.6 GW of capacity additions, which is 30% more than the prior record pace through August set in 2021,” said the report. “Based on EIA projections of capacity additions for September through December, total new utility-scale solar capacity added in 2023 could surpass 24 GW by the end of the year.”
The report’s authors will host a webinar to summarize key findings on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. PT/1:00 p.m. ET. Registration link here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/06/california-solar-installation-complete-and-ready-for-sheep-grazing/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"OCTOBER 6, 2023",California solar installation complete and ready for sheep grazing,"Renewable America (RNA) announced the mechanical completion of its Fallon Two Rock Road Solar Farm (Fallon). The company develops small utility-scale solar storage and multi-customer community microgrid projects in California. 
Fallon is located in the Petaluma region of Marin County, Calif. It will join Marin Clean Energy’s (MCE) service area portfolio, producing an estimated 2.3 GW/h annually. Fallon uses bifacial solar modules on fixed tilt trackers with 1.45 MWdc capacity. According to RNA, the site is expected to power 300 homes and save about 19,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions throughout its 35-year lifetime. 
RNA obtained a California Environmental Quality Act category three exemption permitting the facility’s construction. This is because the land area where the project sits has previous developments underway, which are listed on The City of Petaluma Official City Website. Furthermore, the proposed facility allows continued sheep grazing between solar arrays per the Williamson Act, which is a program that allows for specific parcels of land to be restricted to agricultural use in exchange for reduced property taxes. RNA says the project is five acres and will occupy only 3.6% of the parcel’s total acreage and retain the natural state of the remainder.  
Sunwest Bank has been financing the project through a sale-leaseback structure, allowing RNA to sell Fallon to Sunwest Bank and then lease it back from them. “This deal marks the inception of fruitful partnerships with Sunwest Bank and MCE,” said Ardi Arian, president and CEO of Renewable America.  
MCE is a renewable electricity provider that started serving Northern California in 2010. The organization buys and builds “cleaner” energy, which is then delivered and managed by the Pacific Gas and Electric company. Customers can sign up for MCE’s Light Green Deep Green or Local Sol service, which varies between 60% and 100% of renewable energy. 
MCE states that they have removed 700,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Furthermore, its standard Light Green service is working toward becoming 95% greenhouse gas-free by the end of this year, up from 60% in 2017. Finally, 48 MW of renewable projects have been built in MCE’s service area. 
The RNA, MCE and Sunwest Bank partnership pushes California toward meeting the goals outlined in the state’s renewable energy portfolio. According to the California Energy Commission, that includes ensuring that utilities procure 60% of retail sales from renewable sources by 2030. The state has also committed to achieving 100% clean energy by 2045. 
RNA also closed a $150 million financing partnership with Excelsior Energy Capital in March last year. The company is an independent North American renewable energy investor. The terms of the deal grant Excelsior all the rights to RNA’s entire project portfolio for 30 months in exchange for financing the development and construction of 100 MW of new solar and storage distributed energy resources.
