Policy changes, like net energy metering (NEM) 3.0 in California, are further putting stress on the value proposition to rooftop solar customers, crushing demand in recent months.  
Major publicly traded solar stocks are down over 75% over the past year, and demand in major markets like California has peeled back 40% to 80%, with the damage from NEM 3.0 not fully evaluated yet. 
While California has long served as a model for solar success, that may no longer hold true. In its Roundtables US 2023 live event, pv magazine USA invited a panel of four distributed solar and energy storage experts to offer their view of how the market is responding to policy changes and offered some lessons from California’s recent struggles. 
We were joined by Carina Brockl, chief revenue officer, Aurora Solar, a solar sales and design platform provider; Blake Richetta, chairman and chief executive officer, Sonnen, a battery energy storage provider; Walker Wright, vice president of public policy, Sunrun, a leading residential solar and storage installer; and Bernadette del Chiaro, California Solar & Storage Association (CALSSA) executive director. 
Wright began the conversation acknowledging that net metering was instrumental in kickstarting the market in California, which represents roughly 50% of the United States rooftop solar market. It, along with federal policy and California state incentives, was what made rooftop solar such a strong customer value proposition. 
“The largest renewable energy market in California is distributed [solar],” said del Chiaro. “And yet what we have just done is not just a seismic shift… we are looking at an 80% drop in sales under the new NBT tariff. The months ahead are looking dimmer, not brighter.” 
While residential solar is currently being hammered by headwinds, there are some forces that could counteract the market retraction. Brockl said though inflation has increased steadily, electricity prices have increased even more, and in some cases at double the rate of inflation. This makes the customer proposition to rooftop solar customers slightly more appealing as a hedge to rising utility rates, even if day one savings are razor-thin or even in the negative. 
Richetta, representing energy storage provider Sonnen, expressed more optimism than his fellow panelists. Sonnen has its roots in Germany, which experienced a similar market contraction in rooftop solar when it phased out its feed-in tariff policy that supported the creation of the market. Since then, the market has recovered, and Germany has among the highest rooftop solar penetration rates in the world. 
“There was a market need to harness solar and harmonize it with grid operations… and to transform an intermittent form of generation to something that is firm and dispatchable,” said Richetta. 
Energy storage is expected to play the role of transforming solar into a highly dispatchable energy source. Programs like battery aggregation and virtual power plants are expected to improve the captured value and grid benefits of solar. 
While NEM 3.0 was pitched as a means to support more storage on the grid, it has thus far not created that end result. Del Chiaro said the rulemaking “pushed California [residential solar]  off a cliff with no parachute.” 
What’s more, there has been a rising interest in grid defection in California. Customers who are offered a poor deal from the utility company may decide to “cut the cord” and rely wholly on their own solar and energy storage systems. 
The panelists all agreed that this is not a desirable outcome. A grid with intelligently linked solar and batteries dispatching energy and smoothing out demand system-wide is far more efficient than one made of broken connections and islanded customers.  
Furthermore, coordinated distributed resources can form microgrids, keeping critical resources powered when the larger grid is not performing. In an era of increased extreme weather events and aging grid infrastructure, distributed solar and storage can help ensure the lights stay on. 
“We need to move in the direction of grid-integrated distributed energy resources… if we mess up, and miss this opportunity to transition to that future, I think grid defection is absolutely on the table for everybody, not just the wealthy,” warned del Chiaro. “This is something that California policymakers should care about.” 
As for lessons for other state policymakers from California’s struggles, del Chiaro said, “I’ve never said this in 20-plus years of renewable energy advocacy in California, but sadly I would say do not follow our lead. If you want to move us in a direction towards greater grid integration and greater grid services, think like a consumer. Provide a pathway, provide real value, and make it something that can be scalable at speed.” 
The panel discussion, which also included mention of other emergent California policies, hot markets in other states for residential solar, and the role for distributed energy storage, can be viewed in full below.

ReVision Energy, reportedly the largest employee-owned solar installer in the country, has 20 years experience in the renewable energy industry and serves Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts customers. The company has offices in South Portland and Montville, Maine; Brentwood and Enfield, New Hampshire; and North Andover, Massachusetts. With over 400 employee co-owners, 15,000 installations, ReVision is a Certified B Corp and member of Amicus Solar Cooperative.
The Amicus Solar Cooperative comprises 75 member companies ranging in size from 10 to 420 employees. Combined, Amicus members reportedly employ over 4,000 solar energy and storage professionals across 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and western Canada. Amicus facilitates collaboration among its members, enabling veteran solar companies to share knowledge with smaller companies, with a goal of furthering the industry overall. They share insights on topics such as safety, marketing, sales, installation best practices, understanding policy changes and they also pool their purchasing needs in supplier partnerships.
With the acquisition of Sunbug Solar, also an Amicus member, ReVision increases its footprint in the state of Massachusetts. The state has a target of doubling solar installations and quadrupling energy storage deployment by 2030 as well as putting one million electric vehicles on the road in the same timeframe.
According to a recent state study, more than 10 times the current amount of solar will need to be installed to generate the 27 to 34 GW necessary for Massachusetts to reach its decarbonization goals.

Sunbug Solar and ReVision Energy executives said by working together, they can install more solar, advocate more effectively for clean energy regulation and provide a comprehensive range of solar energy solutions.
“If we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean and renewable energy. This goal cannot be achieved alone or done in a way that leaves out vulnerable communities,” said Fortunat Mueller, CEO and president of ReVision Energy.
The brand transition is expected to be complete in mid-2024, at which time Sunbug Solar’s offices in Woburn and Westfield will unite with ReVision Energy’s North Andover office and will all operate under the ReVision Energy brand, serving Sunbug Solar’s 3,000 existing clients as well as new customers. Sunbug’s 60 employees will join ReVision Energy’s team of 400 employee co-owners and become eligible to become employee-owners as well.
Sunbug Solar CEO Janice DiPietro will transition to a leadership role at ReVision Energy.
“The alignment between our two companies is extremely strong,” said DiPietro. “We share common values, processes, and an unwavering commitment to do right by our employees, customers, and the communities we serve.”
ReVision Energy established its Massachusetts branch in North Andover in 2017. Collectively, the two organizations have completed more than 4,000 installations in Massachusetts and 18,000 across New England.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/09/solar-decathlon-announces-105-teams-for-2024-design-challenge/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",Solar Decathlon announces 105 teams for 2024 Design Challenge,"The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is an international collegiate competition that for more than two decades has challenged more than 25,000 students to create efficient, affordable buildings powered by renewable energy, while promoting student innovation, cross-disciplinary education, and real-world training for a variety of careers.
The first Solar Decathlon competition was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in the fall of 2002. Fourteen teams designed, built, transported, and showcased zero-energy houses powered entirely by renewable energy—a feat relatively unheard of at the time. During the 21-day inaugural event, more than 100,000 people visited the first-ever Solar Decathlon.
After the initial U.S. events, the Solar Decathlon expanded to  Europe, China, Latin America, Africa, India, and the Middle East and it has grown to include both residential and commercial buildings through Design and Build Challenges.
Students competing in the Solar Decathlon Design Challenge work in interdisciplinary teams to create high-performance building designs that aim to solve problems related to climate change, affordability and environmental justice.
Teams spend one or two academic semesters collaborating on a residential or commercial design project that they enter in the competition event held in April. The event offers the teams an opportunity to present designs to expert jurors, network and build connections with industry professionals.
The winner of the 2022 Design Challenge, residential category, was Georgia Institute of Technology’s retrofit design for a single-family home. The home is located in a diverse neighborhood, and the team focused the retrofit  on environmental sustainability, social equity and economic efficiency. The 102-year old house was in bad shape, so the team redesigned the existing layout to make it more flexible and they improved the roof, windows and designed for cross ventilation in the summer and heat gain in the winter.
The design included an HVAC system that included an energy recovery ventilator and ducted mini-split heat pumps, with electricity provided by a rooftop PV system. The result was efficient daylighting, reduced maintenance, appliance efficiency, privacy and security, in addition to overall energy savings.

“Creating affordable, energy-efficient solutions for buildings nationwide is key to the United States meeting its decarbonization goals,” said Holly Jamesen Carr, director of the Solar Decathlon. “Hundreds of students from around the world are set to meet this challenge head-on this year as they participate in DOE’s longest-running collegiate competition.”
See the list of 105 teams from 93 collegiate institutions. This year’s teams represent 18 countries and 29 U.S. states, with 26 new collegiate institutions and 67 returning institutions.
As part of the Design Challenge, students will create designs for new or existing buildings in one of four categories: single-family housing, attached housing, multifamily building, or education building.
Winning teams are recognized with awards on an international stage and winning design projects are shared through Solar Decathlon and U.S. Department of Energy channels. The students gain marketable design skills as a result of their participation and industry partners and sponsors gain recognition while supporting the next generation of clean energy design professionals. Read more about sponsorship opportunities here.
The teams selected to participate in the 2024 competition have until February 2024 to come up with a design to be entered in the semifinal competition. Those that move to the next stage participate in the final competition held April 19 through 24, 2024 hosted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, with virtual participation options available.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/09/shoals-posts-48-year-over-year-growth-in-record-quarter/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,TENNESSEE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",Shoals posts 48% year-over-year growth in record quarter,"Shoals Technologies Group, a provider of electrical balance of system (EBOS) solutions, announced its Q3 2023 earnings, posting a record quarter with $132.2 million in revenue. This represents a year-over-year growth of 48% for Q3. The revenue total came in slightly below Wall Street expectations.
Backlog and newly awarded orders reached $633.3 million, growing 34% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 81% year-over-year to $48 million. Shoals said its growth was primarily driven by domestic demand for solar EBOS.
Shoals provides big lead assemblies, interconnection components, combiner boxes, transition boxes, service and design and more for solar projects.
Despite the record quarter, wire insulation shrinkback expenses led to lowered gross margins and a net loss of $9.8 million. Its stock share price is down roughly 15% in trading sessions following the report.
“While the domestic utility scale solar market is currently experiencing slower growth, we believe our strong value proposition and the emerging strength from our international business will continue to drive order growth,” said Brandon Moss, chief executive officer, Shoals. “We are pleased that international now represents more than 10% of our backlog and awarded orders.”
Shoal’s balance sheet showed total assets of $840.1 million, with current assets at $214.2 million. The company’s total liabilities totaled $315.5 million, while stockholders’ equity was $524.6 million.
The company noted the complete ramp-up of its third Tennessee manufacturing facility. The Tennessee facilities have added 15 GW of manufacturing capacity to its 2022 year-end total of 20 GW. Shoals said its total manufacturing capacity is now 35 GW, with the ability to expand to 42 GW at existing sites. At current capacities, Shoals can serve demand well into 2025, said the company.
The company had $50.2 million in wire insulation shrinkback expenses. Shoals said it was able to offset some of the cost impact with lower raw materials costs, increased leverage on fixed costs, and operational efficiencies.
In-quarter, Shoals filed a lawsuit against Prysmian Cables and Systems USA, seeking damages for the wire shrinkback issue.
Shoals is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, recovery of all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the identification, repair and replacement of the defective wire, and other legal and equitable relief. The outcome of this case and potential impact on financial results remains uncertain.
For full-year 2023, Shoals Technologies Group posted the following guidance:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/09/strategies-to-deploying-solar-in-underserved-communities/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",Strategies to deploying solar in underserved communities ,"The recent report  Energize Your Impact by Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA), assesses eight approaches domestic foundations like the Bezos Earth Fund and the Couillard Solar Foundation are following to support the development of solar and solar-plus-storage projects in low- and medium-income communities. Ventures are primarily focused on providing community-serving institutions with access to solar and storage systems. Examples include multifamily affordable housing buildings, community centers, schools and senior care facilities. 
“The report does not claim a single optimal intervention model,” said Vero Bourg-Meyer, the report’s lead author and a CESA project director. “It will require a mix of these strategies to deploy solar and solar-plus-storage at scale in LMI communities successfully.”
The report lists eight approaches that can be categorized into three groups. 
Group one encapsulates approaches that reduce the costs of solar and solar-plus-storage installations (think grants and donations of solar panels). Group two involves approaches that provide project developers with access to financing. Funding solutions in this group also support the growth of private businesses and establish rules for crisis intervention and commercial activity of buildings with solar and storage systems. Examples of financing applicable to this category include loans, loan guarantees and equity investments. Group three covers strategies that help community organizations prepare to install solar and storage systems. Funding options include technical assistance funds and capacity-building programs. 
In 2020, Clean Energy Group surveyed a network of community-based organizations, municipalities, affordable housing developers, and technical service providers planning and developing solar-plus-storage projects or having reported recently completing them. They found that the lack of financing options was a leading limitation to installing solar and storage systems, “62% of respondents stated they had encountered or expected to encounter financing issues,” the survey reports. 
Technical issues were also a significant blocker, with 42% of community organizations surveyed stating they expected to encounter or encountered problems accessing building energy usage data. Clean Energy Group suggests this may be because community organizations – particularly those new to installing solar and storage systems – may lack the training and monetary resources necessary to identify and remedy challenges like limited viable roof space for solar panels or isolation of critical loads for a resilient system before and during the development process. 
Interconnection and permitting delays also played a role, with 80% of affordable housing developers and nearly 60% of community organizations surveyed stating they encountered permitting and interconnection issues while trying to develop solar projects. Clean Energy Group attributes this to the scale of systems necessary to power larger properties as they are “more likely to trigger interconnection study requirements and other costly delays than smaller-scale installations,” the survey reports. 
Solar Energy Industries Association’s 2023 Q3 report finds that community solar installations decreased by 16% compared to Q2 of 2022 and have stayed the same since Q2 of 2023. They list interconnection, growing market penetration, siting and permitting as the primary cause of solar and storage system stagnation in several states. 
CESA says its report’s primary goal is to help foundations explore new investment models that will bring clean energy and its accompanying benefits to communities in need of solar and storage infrastructure.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/09/new-ira-rules-expand-access-to-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",New IRA rules expand access to community solar,"Solar is surging one year after President Biden signed the most significant climate bill in U.S. history into law. This is particularly true for community solar, which the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) effectively enshrined in federal tax policy for the first time.
As a result of the IRA, unprecedented incentives mean a flood of new projects are likely to get off the ground in states that have a regulatory structure in place. But more importantly, the law and the rules for implementing it are opening the door to new business models that will dramatically accelerate the development of community solar and the benefits it provides to consumers, while also simplifying the process.
New partnerships between tech companies and solar developers will help drive new national subscription models that prioritize direct community investments and benefit low-and-moderate income (LMI) households. In addition to helping technology companies meet their clean energy goals, these new pairings will accelerate clean energy deployment in a way that delivers utility bill savings to low-income households who disproportionately suffer from high energy burdens.
While this is just one example of the innovative new partnerships that we expect to see take off because of the IRA, cross-industry collaborations are the future of the industry and will play a vital role in the continued expansion of community solar.
The result of these collaborations will be a leaner, more efficient, and more impactful industry that is poised for major growth for a variety of reasons.
For one, because these partnerships don’t require each state to authorize a community solar program through legislative action, they allow community solar access in jurisdictions across the entire country.
Because community solar projects are relatively small, and the IRA caps the project size at 5 MW, they can be built more quickly than utility-scale projects.
The process is also streamlined. Because the final IRA rules sync up with the processes that are already widely in use – including income verification rules, savings calculation methodologies and subscriber allocation processes — it will be easier for households to see savings in an immediate, easy-to-understand process that is simple to administer.
Additionally, reducing bureaucratic red tape and expediting project timelines will give developers the certainty they need to invest.
By incentivizing smaller-scale projects, we can circumvent the obstacles that have historically bogged down large renewable energy projects. This will help enable distributed generation systems, which are smaller-scale facilities located near the point of use compared to more traditional power plants and can be deployed much faster, to be a solution to the bottlenecks, and longer wait times and backlogs for clean energy project developers and that jeopardize clean energy targets.
Using distributed generation also shores up grid reliability and avoids the need for new transmission lines, which are similarly facing lengthy approval delays.
The result will be a stronger, more resilient and cleaner electrical grid that will help meet the nation’s renewable energy goals.
Next year is poised to be bright for the industry. Following a sluggish 2022, community solar installations are scheduled to gain momentum for the rest of the year and grow at a steady pace in the years ahead.
This growth also comes at a time when the Biden administration is seeking to expand awareness of the solar opportunities made available as part of this landmark legislation.
As we are seeing with just this first example, new federal rules and opportunities for new partnerships will only further turbocharge our industry. Innovative partnerships and new business models will continue to simplify what has historically been a complicated process and provide the framework for liftoff, offering new opportunities that allow our industry to continue to enter uncharted new heights.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/09/agilitas-energy-building-4-8-mw-storage-project-in-con-edison-footprint/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",Agilitas Energy building 4.8 MW storage project in Con Edison footprint,"Renewables and energy storage company Agilitas Energy has constructed a 4.8 MW/23.7 MWh standalone, non-wires solution energy storage project in Con Edison’s service territory. 
The lithium-ion battery project is located in Long Island City, Queens, and is meant to help the utility meet peak loads in its footprint. Agilitas has entered into a ten-year contract with Con Edison to discharge as much as four hours of stored energy during its peak demand period, running from May 1 through September 30. During this time, the utility can request power daily with some advance notice. 
The energy storage project is expected to come online in 2024. It will boost Con Edison’s grid reliability and resiliency, according to Agilitas. The company says the batteries can charge during off-peak hours, when the grid is less strained and electricity is priced lower, and then discharge to customers when power demand increases.
In addition, the project will participate in New York’s Value of Distributed Energy Resources value stack tariff, Zac Osgood, vice president, EPC, Agilitas Energy, told pv magazine USA. The value stack is a mechanism that compensates distributed energy projects as they provide electricity back to the grid. 
The Long Island project provides Con Edison and local ratepayers with a more cost-effective solution to providing critical, dispatchable demand relief to support ongoing load growth in the area, Osgood said. 
Along with other non-wires projects in the area, it will help alleviate deficiencies identified in the existing local electrical infrastructure – meaning it will help support that load growth without having to perform costly upgrades and substation transformer replacements that would have otherwise been required, Osgood added. 
Last year, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul unveiled a plan for the state to hit 6 GW of energy storage by 2030 – roughly 20% of its peak electricity load. The roadmap would include storage deployments estimated to reduce future electric system costs in New York by nearly $2 billion. 
More broadly, energy storage has a key role to play in ensuring reliability as the share of renewables on the grid continues to grow. In addition to discharging power when demand is high and the grid is under stress, energy storage can also serve as an aide during extreme weather events, Osgood said, acting as a back-up power source during outages and ensuring power is delivered at critical times of peak demand. 
“Energy storage has emerged as essential for keeping the grid running during extreme weather events, following our recent summer of record-breaking heat and power demand,” he said. 
New York City is arguably the most complicated and challenging urban area to build an energy storage project with its  regulatory hurdles and zoning restrictions, Barrett Bilotta, president, CEO and co-founder of Agilitas Energy, said.
“This energy storage system will serve as a huge win for consumers as our project will enhance reliability, support the transition to a clean energy future and help defer the costs of building more infrastructure,” Bilotta added. 
Last June, Agilitas Energy announced it had raised $350 million of equity from funds managed by CarVal Investors L.P, expected to support the company’s project pipeline of more than 500 MW.
