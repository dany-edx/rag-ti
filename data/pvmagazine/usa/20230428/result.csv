The investment from TGC is expected to fuel CleanChoice’s solar business across the value chain, from owning solar generation assets to selling renewable energy. TGC said it will maintain the CleanChoice brand and team, and will invest an additional $100 million in acquiring, owning, and operating solar projects. 
CleanChoice currently has a development portfolio of 300 MW of solar projects in various stages of development. The company said it is actively pursuing acquisition and co-development opportunities across the ISO-New England, NYISO, and PJM markets. 
“We continue to believe that the combination of green customers with solar power development and asset ownership will be paramount in the clean energy transition regime we operate,” said Panos Ninios, managing partner and co-founder of TGC. “In CleanChoice, we have found a best-in-class management team with a unique multi-year track record in combining solar power development with a proprietary customer acquisition and management platform.” 
TGC said CleanChoice’s business model demonstrates the attractiveness of a largely untapped opportunity to pair owned renewable generation with renewable retail supply. The investment is expected to scale its retail business by securing long term access to power, capacity, and renewable energy credits (RECs) and by reducing exposure to wholesale commodity markets.

“It was important for us to find a mission-aligned buyer who shares our commitment to empowering customers and building a greener future,” said Tom Matzzie, chief executive officer, CleanChoice. “We have found that in TGC, and we look forward to rapidly expanding our farm-to-table clean energy offerings.”
The transaction is expected to close in 60 to 90 days. CIBC Capital Markets served as financial advisor to TGC and DLA Piper served as counsel to the investor. Guggenheim Securities served as financial advisor and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP served as counsel to CleanChoice.
Founded in 2012, CleanChoice is a certified B-Corporation that describes itself as the first 100% green “gentailer.” The company pairs renewable energy generation with direct-to-consumer retail offerings in deregulated states that allow retail energy.
TGC, based in Westport, Conn., has raised four private equity funds since forming in 2011 with over $1 billion in equity capital. This includes the May 2022 closing of the investor’s fourth fund with over $660 million of capital to be deployed over the next four years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/28/house-votes-to-resume-solar-tariffs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 28, 2023",House votes to resume solar tariffs,"Passing by a 221-202 vote, the U.S. House of Representatives moved to repeal the two-year pause on solar import tariffs goods from four Southeast Asian countries responsible for about 80% of the U.S. solar panel supply chain.
The moratorium on tariffs, passed in June 2022 by President Joe Biden, halted tariffs on goods shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia. Goods found in violation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws would be assessed with tariffs ranging between 50% to 250% of their shipped value.
The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024, or modules installed on project sites before December 2024. Biden’s two-year moratorium is meant to act as a supply bridge while U.S. domestic solar manufacturing ramps up.
Solar industry trade groups and major developers have voiced strong opposition to lifting the moratorium.
“The legislation will impose $1 billion in retroactive tariffs and cause 30,000 Americans to lose their jobs this year,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
Ross Hopper added that the U.S. does not have enough production to meet demand, and the remaining 14 months of the moratorium are needed to “close the gap.” “We are urging senators to see through this political charade and examine the facts at hand,” she added. 
The legislation was kicked off by a small bipartisan group in January via the Congressional Review Act.
“We cannot allow foreign solar manufacturers to violate trade law, especially when it comes at the expense of American workers and businesses,” said Congressman Dan Kildee (D-MI). “The Biden administration found in its own investigation that China is evading U.S. tariffs on solar imports, but has paused action on this matter, which is unacceptable.”
Prior to Biden’s 2022 moratorium, looming threat of tariffs created supply issues and high levels of risk that led to cancelled and delayed projects. The effect was so stark that pre-moratorium, SEIA cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year. About 20% of utility-scale solar capacity was delayed or cancelled in the first half of 2022 due to supply problems and uncertainty. 
“Political attempts to undermine the President’s agenda threaten to undercut America’s strength in solar deployment,” said George Hershman, chief executive officer, SOLV Energy. “I urge members of the Senate to vote against this harmful resolution.”
“Many of the nation’s largest trade unions have joined clean energy companies in opposing this legislation, which would result in American projects being delayed or cancelled, leading to bankruptcies, job loss, and increased energy costs,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer, American Clean Power Association.
The tariff resolution next heads to the senate for a vote. However, it is unlikely to make it past President Biden’s desk, as his administration made it clear he will maintain the tariff pause with a veto. 
“The Administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 39, which would disapprove a rule issued by the Department of Commerce that temporarily suspends the collection of certain duties on imports of solar cells and modules,” the White House said in a press release. 
The Department of Commerce made a preliminary ruling in December that some suppliers from the four countries are guilty of violating anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. The investigation is expected to conclude with Commerce’s ruling, scheduled for May 2, 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/28/first-solar-q1-2023-revenue-down-with-investments-in-u-s-facilities-taking-precedent/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,ALABAMA,INDIA,OHIO,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 28, 2023","First Solar Q1 2023 revenue down, with investments in U.S. facilities taking precedent","First Solar, a manufacturer of U.S.-made solar panels, posted $548 million in Q1 2023 revenue, about 26% lower than the market consensus of $743 million for its first quarter.
During Q1 2023, First Solar executed 9.9 GW of contracts and recognized 1.9 GW of volume sold, resulting in a total backlog of 69.4 GW, with an aggregate value sold of $20.4 billion, which implies approximately $0.293 per watt, an increase of approximately half a penny per watt from Q4 2022.
During the quarter, First Solar produced 2.36 GW of Series 6 panels, whose average watts per module was 467 W.
Production of Series 7 modules began in January 2023 with 170 MW of modules produced. The company said it recently demonstrated high-volume manufacturing production capable of up to 10,000 modules per day at its third Ohio facility, which houses Series 7 module production.  The demo rate is 60% of nameplate throughput capacity, with panels achieving top bin production at 535 W.
Shipments of Series 7 modules, which used all-U.S. glass and steel components, are on track to begin as early as June 2023, Widmer said in prepared remarks.  Outside of the U.S., First Solar is also expected to begin production in Chennai, India at a 3.54 GW nameplate facility in the second half of 2023 as well.
The company’s Cadmium-telluride (CadTel) technology certified a new record in Q1 2023 with a conversion efficiency of 22.3%.
First Solar’s common stock traded at $176.80 per share this morning, down about 11.5% after the company missed market estimates for Q1 sales. The company has a $19.5 billion market capitalization and has long-term total bookings opportunities of 113 GW for modules.
Guidance
First Solar’s guidance is unchanged from prior quarters, with an expectation of generating $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion in revenue this year, a $1 billion increase over the $2.6 billion of annual sales for 2022. The company’s production guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion gross margin also factors in a $110 million to $130 million boost from the Series 7 module ramp up activity and some benefits from the Section 45X tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Financial guidance includes a huge contribution of $660 million to $710 million from Section 45X tax benefits factored into the company’s operating income expectation of $745 million to $870 million.
Section 45X, the advanced manufacturing production tax credit, is a per-unit tax credit for each clean energy component domestically produced and sold by a manufacturer and is claimed on federal corporate income taxes. The credit varies by eligible component and is multiplied by the number of units produced by the company sold that year. In First Solar’s case, its U.S.-made solar modules can receive a credit of $0.07 per watt.
“We anticipate our earnings profile will be higher in 2H 2023 due to contractual delivery schedules, timing of first sales of our Series 7 products and the timing of recognition of Section 45X benefits, driven by both the timing of volumes sold as well as the inventory lag where our product sold in the early part of 2023 may have been manufactured in 2022,” Widmer said.
“From a Section 45X perspective, based on the aforementioned factors, we expect to recognize approximately 25% of our full year guidance in the first half of the year and approximately 75% in the second half,” he added.
During the earnings call, Widmer said the company continues to await guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department related to the domestic content bonus provision of the Inflation Reduction Act.
At the end of Q1 2023, First Solar had a cash balance of $922 million.
Production ramp
In Alabama, First Solar’s fourth U.S. factory received environmental permits, with the foundation of early factory construction underway. Tooling equipment has been ordered and the facility remains on schedule for completion by the end of 2024, with commercial operations ramping through 2025, Widmer said in prepared remarks.
When Alabama becomes fully operational, facility expansions in Ohio and Alabama are expected to increase First Solar’s annual nameplate capacity in the U.S. to over 10 GW.
New booking
First Solar kicked off Q2 2023 by separately announcing a 2 GW, two-year order from utility solar developer Leeward Renewable Energy, bringing the developer’s total orders to date of First Solar modules to 6 GW for projects to be developed through 2028.
Deliveries for the modules will take place in 2026 and 2027 for the Dallas, Texas-based developer.
Leeward, a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, a Canadian investment firm, is a renewable energy development company that owns and operates 25 projects across nine U.S. states with about 2.7 GW of generating capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/28/multi-family-housing-developer-looks-to-mass-and-illinois-for-growth/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,ILLINOIS,MARYLAND,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW ENGLAND",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 28, 2023",Multi-family housing developer looks to Mass. and Illinois for growth,"High Impact Solar Solutions, an Irvine, Calif.-based solar developer for multi-family housing communities, sees Massachusetts and Illinois as solid new markets where it is undertaking expansion efforts, John B. Wood, founder and chief executive officer, tells pv magazine USA.
Wood said High Impact is looking to participate in community solar project development for low- and-moderate income (LMI) housing communities, which is an extension of its core competency for developing rooftop solar and car canopy projects for senior center communities, LMI housing customers and other residential groups primarily in southern California.
High Impact is currently planning on submitting applications for more than 65 projects for the anticipated Q3 2023 low-and-moderate income (LMI) communities adder, Wood said, even though the developer has yet to see the application yet based on the newness of the federal Inflation Reduction Act protocol.  About 40 of the 65 projects are within California LMI communities, and the remainder are in new markets like the Northeast, Maryland and Illinois, he added.
To date, the company has utilized the resources of about 70 regional sub-contractors and engineers to install rooftop and car canopies in its first market of California, and continues to use engineering, procurement and construction contractors in new markets as well, Wood said.
The company is working with Sunrun, SunPower and Grid Alternatives on construction of current and future projects, Wood said.
High Impact has contributed projects in LMI communities that qualify for statewide incentives from California’s Multifamily Affordable Housing (MASH) and Solar for Multifamily Affordable Housing (SOMAH) programs, Wood said. These programs date back to 2008 and 2017, respectively, and provide rebates for low-income solar projects to the tune of $1.10 per watt to $2.70/W if the system generates more than half the customer’s load. Under SOMAH, the state has awarded additional $100 million of rebates annually for solar systems deployed on multi-family affordable housing buildings, which amounts to a credit of $3.20 per watt (ac) on system installations.
High Impact Solar Solutions LLC
Wood was quick to point out that the company is grandfathered into the net energy metering or NEM 2.0 standards in California.  For another nine years the company will not be subject to changes from the state’s changing rooftop solar framework imparted by the December 2022 NEM 3.0 decision by the California Public Utilities Commission to reduce the value of solar energy exported from rooftops.
The Inflation Reduction Act’s 30% solar investment tax credit combined with 20% of added credit for designated low-income community deployments of clean energy projects creates a tailwind for the project developer, and should facilitate High Impact’s expansion efforts in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic markets, Wood said.
Case study
High Impact is working with the Retirement Housing Foundation, a Long Beach, Calif., non-profit group that owns over 200 senior center assisted living and affordable housing units across the U.S., to deploy rooftop solar arrays, the solar executive said.
In 2022, the developer installed 20 solar systems for RHF, and this year the company expects to deploy about 30 new systems for the nonprofit housing group, Wood said.
High Impact is actively engaged in state markets with active climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, where Wood said the turnkey developer saves building owners up to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on energy consumption.
Project deployments range from 200 kW and smaller per rooftop array, and with multi-building customers can be deployed as much as 2 MW aggregate systems, he said.
High Impact’s development team uses its own proprietary internal review method for finding prospective project sites, but also uses Aurora’s HelioScope commercial PV software platform and Energy Toolbase for proposal generation, Wood said.
The company has identified a few hundred buildings out of its 1,000 building portfolio as candidates for Level 2 electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which Wood says the company expects to rollout this year as well.
To date High Impact has been largely self-funded, though project financing has been offset by tax equity arranged by various New York banking institutions active in the distributed energy market, Wood said.  The BQuest Foundation, a San Diego, Calif.-based nonprofit foundation formed by GoFundMe founder Andy Ballester, has recently provided development equity financing for High Impact’s LMI portfolio, he said.
Prior to forming High Impact Solar, Wood was a managing partner at One Planet Caribbean, which sold over 100 MW of Caribbean utility solar portfolio to several investors, including GCL New Energy Holdings.
