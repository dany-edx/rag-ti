The satellite, GOES-U, is the fourth and final satellite in the GOES-R series. GOES-R is a collaboration with NASA and NOAA in which NASA builds and launches the satellite and NOAA operates it for weather event surveillance.
The satellites provide critical data for weather forecasts and warnings, detecting and monitoring environmental hazards like fire, smoke, fog, volcanic ash, and dust, and monitoring solar activity and space weather.
Lockheed Martin developed the solar array, a five-panel structure that carries 5 kW of capacity. This is equivalent to the power needed to run a home’s central air conditioning system. Each panel measures about 13 feet tall by 4.5 wide and weighs about 45 pounds.
At launch, the panels are folded together to protect them and ensure beneficial aerodynamics to reach orbit. Once in orbit, the panels will fold out on a single array wing that will rotate once per day, continuously pointing the solar cells toward the sun. During the test, engineers unfurled the five panels on railing that simulated a zero-gravity environment.
The PV cells are designed to convert enough sunlight into electricity to power the entire craft, including measurement instruments, computers, data processors, and telecommunications equipment.
The panels were manufactured at Lockheed Martin’s Littleton, Colorado facility, where the satellite was also constructed. GOES-U is scheduled for launch in April 2024.
Below is an artist concept video of a GOES-R satellite in action.
 
Solar in space
NASA has long used solar to power its spacecraft and satellites, and continues to use it for new missions today. In August 2022, NASA launched a tennis-court sized spacecraft, sending it on a 1.5-billion-mile journey to the asteroid Psyche, which the craft shares its name with. The Psyche craft is winged with two large cross-shaped solar arrays, which will power the craft’s measurement devices as well as its propulsion system.
Each array is 37.1 feet long and 24 feet wide when fully deployed. About an hour after launch, the arrays will deploy sequentially, first with the center column unfolding, and then the two cross-panels unfurling and latching into place. One wing at a time, the total deployment takes about seven and a half minutes.
This is the largest solar array deployed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said NASA. So large, in fact, that the entire craft could not be unfolded during the test at Arizona State University’s lab in Tempe, Ariz. ASU  partnered with NASA on this mission, which will observe the suspected unusually high amount of metals in the thickest band of the asteroid.
NASA launched the Webb Space Telescope on Christmas Day 2021, and thirty minutes later Webb’s fold-out solar array deployed and activated. The world’s most powerful telescope, set to study phenomena like the formation of planets, and the age and extent of the universe, uses less power than one might think. In fact, only one kilowatt, equivalent to the power use of microwaving your lunch, is needed to power the device.
Webb will stay energy-efficient more than 1 million miles from Earth, said NASA. The 20-foot solar array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the ‘powerhouse’ for the telescope, supplying energy to all its scientific instruments, communications, and propulsion systems. Though the telescope only needs 1 kW to perform, the array generates twice that much to factor in the degradation caused by the harsh conditions of space.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/05/solar-plus-storage-microgrids-to-be-deployed-in-four-bay-area-cities/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,SOFTWARE,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 5, 2023",Solar-plus-storage microgrids to be deployed in four Bay Area cities,"Gridscape Solutions, a Fremont, Calif.-based microgrid and EV charging station developer, was selected by community choice aggregator East Bay Community Energy to deploy 30 microgrids with 3.1 MW of solar and 6.2 MWh of battery systems in four Bay Area, California cities.
The microgrid portfolio will provide energy resilience during power outage events in northern California and reduce electric bills to EBCE’s customers as part of its Resilient Municipal Critical Facilities program. The municipal platform is designed to bundle distributed community energy projects into a larger portfolio.
Vipul Gore, founder and chief executive officer of Gridscape, said the ECBE microgrid portfolio will take about 18 months to complete, with main factors effecting timing including permitting, interconnection delays, and supply chain constraints.
The four-city portfolio represents the largest microgrid project deployment under a single third-party financed power purchase agreement, the company said.  To support critical service power in Hayward and Fremont, Calif., the program received a $2 million federal grant to fund the microgrid portfolio.
Gridscape’s microgrid systems are deployed using the company’s EnergyScope Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) controller, which allows the site owner to directly control the distribution of battery power discharge on daily intervals.  The control system provides real-time system updates and monitors fault detection, alarm monitoring, performance management and remote diagnostics.
The company’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery system is contained in an IP55-rated hardware shell, designed to protect against dust that could impede normal operations, and fully protect from water jet streams by a nozzle source. Additional features include fire suppression, off-gassing, a security camera and energy meters to measure grid power and critical load components.
To date, the company’s microgrid projects and EV charging systems have been deployed for various California municipalities, their fire departments, universities and tribal authorities such as the San Pasqual Band of Mission Indians.
In June 2022, Gridscape partnered with the San Pasqual Band to deploy a community solar-plus-storage microgrid for the tribal group’s administrative building, schools, police station and fire department facilities in Valley Center, Calif.  The microgrid is partially funded by a Department of Energy grant.
The tribal energy system consists of a 156.8 kW solar carport array paired with an existing 24 kW solar array on the tribe’s schools, plus 480 kWh battery systems projected to save $78,286 in annual energy costs. Additional equipment added to the microgrid includes six EV charging stations and a 150 kW liquid propane fueled generator, according to Gridscape.
The company’s EV charging solutions involve Level 2 and DC fast charging stations in which stations are interconnected with onsite solar and storage systems. In one case study, Gridscape deployed 110 DC fast charging ports into a microgrid system with 9.13 MW of solar and 14.3 MWh of battery resources.
East Bay Community Energy (EBCE) is a California nonprofit agency that procures renewable energy via utility Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E) lines as a “community choice energy service.” In May 2021, ECBE was awarded a $300,000 grant by the Environmental Protection Agency to develop an inventory of brownfield sites throughout its service area that could be a good fit for redevelopment as EV charging hubs for light, medium, and heavy-duty electric vehicles.
Gridscape was formed in 2013 as a solar, battery and EV charging systems integrator for municipal, education facilities, retail and tribal authorities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/05/nem-3-0-sparks-the-growing-potential-of-virtual-power-plants/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"MAY 5, 2023",NEM 3.0 sparks the growing potential of virtual power plants,"California has recently introduced a new net metering policy known as NEM 3.0. This policy is designed to help the state achieve its 2045 goal of a 100% clean energy grid by encouraging the installation of solar panels and energy storage systems in homes and businesses. One of the key features of NEM 3.0 is the inclusion of batteries in the net metering program, which means that homeowners can now store excess solar energy during the day and use it at night when the sun is no longer shining. 
This is a significant development, as it allows for the creation of virtual power plants (VPPs). A VPP is a network of decentralized energy sources, such as solar panels and batteries, which are connected and managed through a central control system. There are several types of VPPs, including those owned and operated by utilities and those owned and operated by third-party aggregators. 
VPPs in use and the benefits 
The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which includes incentives for electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and home batteries, has energy experts anticipating that VPPs will see significant growth in the United States soon. An example already in operation is the Tesla VPP in California. Currently operating in select communities, this particular VPP aggregates residential solar panels and battery storage systems to form a distributed energy resource (DER) network that can provide grid services such as frequency regulation and capacity.  
Working with local utility Pacific Gas and Electric, Tesla launched another new program that pays eligible Powerwall owners to provide extra electricity to the grid when it’s vulnerable to blackouts. The Tesla VPP is one of several networks developed by technology companies and is expected to play a vital role in California’s transition to a more flexible and renewable energy grid. 
The benefits of using VPPs as part of a clean energy grid include:  
Leaving lithium-ion batteries behind 
Despite the many advantages of VPPs, placing battery systems into millions of homes could have unintended consequences. While lithium-ion batteries are used in most current energy storage systems, they come with high costs and safety concerns. If they get too hot or experience an internal short, lithium-ion batteries can begin a process called thermal runaway. The batteries can vent toxic gases such as hydrogen fluoride and even catch fire. These fires can be difficult to extinguish and are a growing cause of structure fires in cities such as New York and Mumbai.
Hundreds of thousands of home storage systems will have to be installed for VPPs to make a meaningful contribution to tomorrow’s grid. Still, the fear of fires could stop any momentum before it has a chance to build.  
A clean grid future 
Scientists and startups worldwide are creating new battery technologies that are safer and more reliable than traditional lithium-ion batteries. Several innovators are working hard on lower-cost, non-lithium battery options for utility-scale, long-duration storage, keeping non-flammable and non-toxic solutions at the forefront. 
Implementing NEM 3.0 and including batteries in the net metering program represent a significant step toward achieving California’s clean energy grid goal. Creating VPPs using decentralized energy sources will revolutionize how society produces and consumes energy. But finding alternative battery technologies with fewer risks and at a lower cost than lithium-ion is imperative, and the success or failure of VPPs will likely depend on convincing homeowners and businesses that there are alternatives.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/05/machine-learning-method-to-identify-residential-pv-adopters-reduce-soft-costs/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 5, 2023","Machine learning method to identify residential PV adopters, reduce soft costs","From pv magazine global
An international research team has utilized a machine learning algorithm known as XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to predict PV adoption among homeowners. This algorithm consists of a distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library that can help accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models.
“We further dive into the modeling detail of XGBoost and decompose its enhanced prediction performance over logistic regression into two factors: variable interaction and nonlinearity,” the scientists said. “We last show the potential of XGBoost in reducing customer acquisition costs, and then the ability to identify new market opportunities for PV companies.”
According to them, this new methodology could help solar companies lower customer acquisition costs and other soft costs associated with the residential PV business.
They compared the performance of the proposed algorithm with the logistic regression approach, which the researchers described as the most commonly used method to analyze differences between PV adopters and non-adopters. “Our logistic regression model with nine original and highly visible household features successfully predicts 71% of out-of-sample PV adoption statuses,” they further explained. “The model correctly identified 66% of adopters and 75% of non-adopters.”
The adapted algorithm, according to the research group, was able to offer better results than the logistic regression in predictive performance. “The predictive model correctly predicted 87% of the two PV adoption statuses, compared to 71% for logistic regression,” they added. “The correct adopter rate increased from 66 to 87% and the correct non-adopter rate increased from 75 to 88%.”
They attributed the superior performance of the machine learning-based approach to the fact that it integrates complex nonlinearity and variable interaction and considers factors such as summer bills, household income, and homeowner’s age, among others.
“The advantage of using these variables is that they are highly accessible so that PV companies can collect data on them with little cost,” they also note. “Another reason to explain the improved performance of XGBoost is that it can potentially recover key latent information embedded in the data. “For example, including geographical information such as the state or county of the respondent increases the prediction accuracy of logistic regression to some extent.”
The research group estimated that the novel methodology can help PV companies reduce customer acquisition costs by about 15% or $0.07/Watt. It also explained that data mining and machine learning could also help reduce soft costs for contract cancellation, supply chain management, labor assignment, and permitting and inspection issues.
It described the new methodology in the study “Machine learning reduces soft costs for residential solar photovoltaics,” published in scientific reports. The research group is formed by scientists coming from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Florida State University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Renmin University of China.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/05/new-jersey-warehouse-owner-deploys-556-kw-rooftop-solar-using-local-workforce/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW JERSEY",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 5, 2023",New Jersey warehouse owner deploys 556 kW rooftop solar using local workforce,"With the state of New Jersey’s pilot community solar program not to be signed into law for another few months, momentum from the Inflation Reduction Act and energy justice initiatives has kept solar developments moving quickly to meet the Garden State’s goal of generating 100% clean energy by 2035.
Solar Landscape, a New Jersey-based solar developer, has completed work on a 556 kW warehouse rooftop solar array in Secaucus, N.J. for Principal Asset Management. The project’s development used locally trained workers from the STEP-UP (Solar Training and Education Partnership for Underserved Populations) group.
The STEP-UP program is run by career development firm Edison Job Corps with the participation of GAF Energy and Trinity Solar. To date, 29 New Jersey residents from low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities have been trained to become solar installers at a training center in Edison, N.J.
Solar energy provided by the installation on the Secaucus rooftop will provide enough clean energy for 90 nearby homes, saving those residents $20,000 per year on electricity bills and avoiding 478 tons of carbon emissions from conventional power resources.
“Financial inclusion and environmental impact are fundamental aspects of our commitment to sustainability,” said Jennifer McConkey, managing director of ESG, Principal Asset Management. “Together with Solar Landscape and its training partners, the program is introducing community members to entirely new careers in clean energy. In addition, this program addresses critical sustainability and social goals to be a good neighbor to our communities and a clean energy model for the rest of the country.”
Principal Asset Management is an affiliate of Principal Financial Group, a public Des Moines, Iowa-based asset manager with $501.5 billion of global holdings. The investment firm’s 2022 ESG report highlighted the firm’s use of renewable energy to power 58% of its U.S. facility operations, or a total of 41.65 GWh of clean energy. The firm is also installing rooftop solar in northern California at commercial office buildings with DSD Renewables.
The 556 kW Secaucus project is just the latest warehouse rooftop project Solar Landscape has constructed with offtake power made available to local residents, including LMI communities, under New Jersey’s pilot community solar program.
Last month pv magazine USA toured a 1.1 MW rooftop facility project of the developer in Avenel, N.J. After first powering its Edison, N.J. headquarters with 100% clean energy from a 500 kW rooftop solar array, building owner RPM Warehousing opted to utilize the remainder of three New Jersey warehouse rooftops to provide 4.3 MW of solar energy to some 700 local households in Perth Amboy and Edison, N.J.
Solar Landscape installer John Bruno pointed out the rooftop arrays use of U.S.-made QCells solar modules shipped from Georgia, in addition to SolarEdge inverters.
N.J. community solar
After an April 24 public stakeholder meeting for input on New Jersey’s community solar program, stakeholders have a May 15 deadline to send feedback to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for or against the program framework.  Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the program into law later this year.
According to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the state’s community solar pilot program saw seven projects come online in 2022, bringing the total installations to 21 community projects. The projects now provide bill credits to more than 5,500 New Jersey residents, saving more than $1 million on energy costs in the second year of the community solar program.
The state’s regulator anticipates another 100 community solar projects energizing in 2023, bringing over 150 MW of renewable energy to additional subscribers, half of which must be low- or moderate-income.
In 2022 the Garden State saw a near-record of 800 new commercial solar installations with 267 MW of generating capacity. The state hopped into eighth place (from 10th a year ago) among the Solar Energy Industries Association’s top-ranked U.S. solar states, with 4.41 GW of cumulative solar deployments.
“The record-setting pace at which New Jerseyans are installing solar panels shows that people across the Garden State increasingly recognize the benefits that come from using clean energy,” said Joseph Fiordaliso, president of the NJBPU.

The program offers an occupational skills award, two certificates and an associates degree. Also offered is an internship with local industry partners.
The financial support from OCI Solar is intended to help the school increase its offerings from one to two solar-specific associates degrees and from two to six solar certifications. The students no longer have to travel to Austin or El Paso to test for certifications, but can test right in San Antonio. The funding for SolarJobs SA provides scholarships, stipends for instructors, classroom supplies and equipment, textbooks, tools, testing fees and more. Eight students are currently enrolled in the program.
As part of the SolarJobs SA collaboration, Project Quest, a nationally recognized non-profit, helps students with support services like housing and utility assistance, online connectivity and childcare. It will also develop a job bank with solar-related opportunities and will assist students with resumes and interviewing skills in order for them to secure a career in the solar industry.
“Project Quest is honored to be a part of the SolarJobs SA initiative and bring our 30 years of experience to help ensure the success of the students, ” said Molly Biglari, president and CEO of Project Quest.
The new solar training programs come at a time when Texas is seeing unprecedented growth in renewable energy and is expected to soon lead the nation in installed solar capacity. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects as much as 36 GW of solar capacity will be installed in the next five years, adding on to the 16 GW installed thus far.
OCI Solar Power is a subsidiary of OCI Company Ltd., a South Korean firm that has a portfolio of products and solutions for a broad spectrum of industries in the renewable energy sector, including making polysilicon. OCI Company established OCI Enterprises Inc. in 1990, which is its U.S. holding company that is the parent of OCI Solar Power, established in 2012, and Mission Solar Energy, established in 2014.
