https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/01/us-august-irradiance-sunshine-before-the-storm-in-the-south/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",U.S. August irradiance: Sunshine before the storm in the South,"From pv magazine Global
Despite Hurricane Idalia at the end of the month, reduced onshore winds in the southern US enabled above-average sunshine during August. Further west, cloud associated with Tropical Storm Hilary decreased irradiance below monthly averages across southern California and the Rockies, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.
During August, the Deep South saw a 20% increase in its Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) relative to the historical monthly average. This was accompanied by temperatures averaging 3 C above the typical for the season. The driver for these changes was reduced onshore winds compared to normal, reducing humidity and cloud cover.
In the final days of the month, the southern sunshine abruptly gave way to thick cloud, as Hurricane Idalia moved over the region. This animation shows the hurricane’s progression during August 29 and 30, bringing thick cloud from Louisiana to North Carolina.

Further west, Tropical Storm Hillary and its associated cloud systems led to significantly lower irradiance than usual for August, in a broad area from Baja, through Southern California, and along the Rockies to British Columbia.
Despite only lasting a few days, the effect of the cloud cover from Tropical Storm Hilary was significant, contributing to the reduced monthly irradiance on the west coast.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/01/doe-supports-retooling-american-automotive-factories-for-electric-vehicle-revolution/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",DOE supports retooling of U.S. automotive factories for electric vehicle revolution,"The Biden Administration set a goal of electric vehicles making up half the vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030. And while automakers around the world have announced investments approaching $1 trillion through 2030, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) aims to help move U.S. automakers away from manufacturing gas-powered vehicles with a $15.5 billion package that intends to retool existing factories.
Part of the Investing in America agenda, the package includes $2 billion in grants and up to $10 billion in loans to support automotive manufacturing conversion projects, with a major emphasis on retaining jobs.
Electric vehicles (EV) are forecast to take over as the leading transportation technology. To assist in the transition, the IRA includes $10 billion in tax credits for a variety of manufacturing facilities, including EV and battery manufacturing facilities. In total, between both laws there is at least $145 billion of funding for which EV charging projects could be eligible, according to a report by Atlas EV Hub.
With the recently announced package, the Domestic Conversion Grant Program emphasizes jobs, earning higher scores will be projects that are likely to retain collective bargaining agreements and/or those that have an existing high-quality, high-wage hourly production workforce.
The DOE also announced a Notice of Intent to make available $3.5 billion in funding to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and the nation’s grid, as well for battery materials and components currently imported from other countries. A focus here is not only on growing a domestic industry, but also on supporting a growing domestic industry and promoting equity and environmental justice.
Round II of the funding will support growing the domestic industry, while supporting existing manufacturing workers, and promoting equity and environmental justice.  To do that, the program will support communities that have a history of automaking and that have experienced auto workers, and it will prioritize applicant companies that have strong workforce practices and that plant to create high-quality jobs.
“President Biden is investing in the workforce and factories that made our country a global manufacturing powerhouse,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Today’s announcements show that President Biden understands that building the cars of the future also necessitates helping the communities challenged by the transition away from the internal combustion engine.”
Depending on their capital needs, manufacturers can apply to receive assistance via financial grants through DOE’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) or preferable debt financing through DOE’s Loan Program Office.
To apply for a grant, concept papers are due October 2, 2023, and the deadline for full applications is December 7, 2023. Learn more about this funding opportunity.
DOE is also making up to $10 billion in loan authority available for applications under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program for automotive manufacturing conversion projects that retain high-quality jobs in communities that currently host manufacturing facilities.
Interested applicants can learn more about how to apply for these projects here.
Support for battery manufacturing
The DOE also announced an investment of approximately $3.5 billion to boost battery and battery materials production in the U.S. This is the second round of funding made possible through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and its intention is to support the creation of new, retrofitted, and expanded domestic commercial facilities for battery materials, battery components, and cell manufacturing.
Both the conversion grant funding opportunity and battery manufacturing notice of intent will be administered by the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC). Conversion Project loans are made available by the Advanced Technologies Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM), administered by the Loan Programs Office.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/01/non-lithium-long-duration-battery-to-join-salt-river-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,ARIZONA",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",Non-lithium long-duration battery to join Salt River Project,"Salt River Project (SRP), a not-for-profit energy company serving more than 1.1 million people in the Phoenix area of central Arizona and CMBlu Energy, a designer and manufacturer of long-duration Organic SolidFlow energy storage systems, announced plans for a pilot project to deploy long-duration energy storage (LDES).
The 5 MW, 10-hour-duration Desert Blume project will use CMBlu’s non-lithium technology. CMBlue will build, own and operate the batteries on behalf of SRP at its Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center in Florence, Arizona.
CMBlu said its Organic SolidFlow battery technology is based on fully recyclable organic materials. It uses aqueous electrolyte solutions that are non-flammable. The company said the batteries are characterized by free scalability between power and capacity because the system separates the electrolyte from the actual energy converter, self-discharge is avoided. Furthermore, by replacing individual components, original performance can be restored.
CMBlu expects its battery system to cost-effectively store and deliver energy for two to three times longer per cycle than traditional lithium-ion technology, which typically targets a four-hour duration.
While the battery installations are a pilot, SRP is depended on to provide water to about half of the Valley’s residents, delivering more than 244 billion gallons of water each year, and it manages a 13,000-square-mile watershed that includes an extensive system of reservoirs, wells, canals and irrigation laterals. The battery project is designed to store energy for SRP’s customers during daytime periods, largely from solar generation, and return that energy to the grid throughout the night. It will store enough energy to power about 1,125 average homes for 10 hours.
In 2022 a fire broke out at the Salt River Project when a lithium-ion battery began smoldering. Area businesses were evacuated out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazards caused by off-gassing. As an alternative to lithium-ion, the project is implementing the Organic SolidFlow batteries in the pilot project. This is the first U.S. utility implementation of CMBlu’s batteries at this scale. SRP selected CMBlu after issuing a request for long-duration storage project proposals from emerging energy storage companies. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) will monitor the pilot project and help validate the performance of the technology in Arizona’s hot and dry climate.
This pilot is part of the third phase of development at SRP’s Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center. The first phase will add two flexible natural gas turbines with a total output of less than 100 MW, and the second phase will add a utility-scale solar generation facility capable of generating up to 55 MW of solar energy. Construction of the third phase is slated to begin in early 2025, and the pilot is expected to be operational in December 2025.
CMBlu’s technology will also be deployed in other pilot projects including one in Burgenland Energie in Austria, and another pilot in Milwaukee, Wisc. with WEC Energy.
CMBlu was founded in Germany in 2014 by biotech entrepreneur Peter Geigle and a group of German energy and automotive executives. Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, CMBlu has entered the U.S. market.
“Compared to Germany and the rest of Europe, the U.S. is clearly marching ahead in the development and application of large-scale storage solutions,” said Peter Geigle, founder and CEO. He added that once the company’s products gain acceptance, the company is “fully committed to a U.S. manufacturing presence”.
