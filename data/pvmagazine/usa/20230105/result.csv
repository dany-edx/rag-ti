The utility-scale solar and storage developer capped off $775 million raised over the last year with $1 billion in total funding to be used for construction of its contracted pipeline, new project development, entering new state markets, hiring efforts, as well as new strategic partnerships and acquisitions, Matt Beasley, chief commercial officer, told pv magazine USA.
Additional funding will support the operations and maintenance of its growing operating portfolio consisting of 150 solar projects with 2.3 GW of generation capacity in 15 states, and accelerate its growth strategy with the development of new projects to meet customer needs in markets across the country.  The company is on track to double its operational portfolio by late 2025, Beasley said.
The developer’s latest $375 million round was led by existing shareholders which include Manulife Investment Management, TD Greystone Infrastructure Fund, a unit of TD Asset Management, and Mountain Group Partners. The company spokesman said the company’s $225 million round will come from existing shareholders, but declined to mention which investors will fund its last fund raise of the 2022 fiscal year.
“Silicon Ranch has an important role to play in the energy transition, but what makes the work we do so rewarding is to witness the positive impact of our significant investments in communities all across this country,” said Reagan Farr, co-founder and chief executive officer of Silicon Ranch.
For 2023, the developer is nearing completion on two near-term solar facilities for social media giant Meta, the 125 MWAC DeSoto I Solar Farm in Lee County, Georgia, and the 70 MWAC McKellar Solar Farm in Madison County, Tennessee.
Meta is partnered with Silicon Ranch on 16 solar projects in Georgia and Tennessee with total generating capacity of 1.5 GWAC. Eight of the projects are operational generating 630 MWAC of power. Each of the Meta projects uses Silicon Ranch’s Regenerative Energy agrivoltaics model of land management, a solar design and construction approach that co-locates renewable energy production with regenerative agriculture practices.
Silicon Ranch said its agrivoltaic business model is combined with Clearloop, which allows customers to reclaim their carbon footprint in various applications such as farming, commercial or industrial use.
In 2022, despite global supply constraint headwinds affecting the U.S. utility-scale solar market’s importing of solar panels, the company circumnavigated global constraints by signing supply agreements for U.S.-made components from First Solar, Nextracker and SOLARCYCLE.
Silicon Ranch is procuring 4.7 GW of First Solar thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) modules as well as 1.5 GW of Nextracker solar trackers for the next few years.  In September, the company also partnered with SOLARCYCLE as the Oakland, California-based solar module recycling company’s first utility-scale customer.
“While Silicon Ranch’s long-term strategy was already projecting significant growth in the years ahead, the passage of the IRA should present additional opportunities in the decade to come,” said Beasley.  “For example, the extension of the investment tax credit does provide a longer runway and more long-term visibility into the ITC, and Silicon Ranch recognizes opportunities to build a meaningful pipeline– through both greenfield development and acquisitions– over the next few years with an eye toward delivery well beyond 2025,” he said.
Silicon Ranch was formed in 2011 by former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen and Matt Kisber, now the company’s chairman. To date the company has raised $1.55 billion from equity investors including TD, Manulife and Shell New Energies, its majority shareholder from a January 2018 acquisition of a 43.83% stake in the company.
The company partners with utilities and regional cooperatives such as Mississippi Power, the United Power Cooperative, Walton Electric Membership Corporation and the Tennessee Valley Authority, with Silicon Ranch typically owning the assets on its balance sheet upon completion.  Corporate PPA offtakers of the company include Meta, Nike, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Volkswagen, and Green Power EMC

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/05/three-off-grid-solar-generators-on-display-at-ces/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,NEVADA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 5, 2023",Three off-grid solar generators on display at CES,"Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is among the largest tech events in the world, drawing over 3,000 exhibitors, 173 countries represented, and 323 of the Fortune 500 companies in attendance. This year featured many advancements in cleantech, and solar generators were no exception.
Below are three solar generators that caught the eye of pv magazine USA. 
Growatt VITA 550 
Growatt unveiled two portable battery banks with LiFePO4 chemistry for off-grid adventures. The Vita 550 is the most portable option, featuring a 538 Wh battery capacity, 600 W AC output, and 11 outlets of various configurations that allow users to power most devices. 
The device has a 1.6-hour AC charging speed and supports up to 800 W of solar input. It can be fully charged on solar in 2.5 hours. It has customizable features like adjustable lighting and optional fast and slow charging. The Watt+ feature allows the bank to extend beyond its 600 W limit and power devices up to 1050 W. 
Growatt said the Vita 550 can power a light bulb for 15 hours or run a 70 W fan for 6.5 hours. The company said the device is durable through 3,000 charge cycles. 
Jackery Solar Generator 3000 Pro 
For a larger, yet still portable battery bank, the Jackery Solar Generator 3000 Pro offers several features for off-grid flexibility. The device can be charged with six SolarSaga 200 W panels, charging in three to four hours on solar and about two and a half hours with AC input.  The solar cells are built with Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) technology that boosts production on cloudy days, early mornings, and late evenings.
The battery houses 3,024 Wh of power and offers 3,000 W AC output. It can produce a maximum of 8,500 Wh per day. The battery can operate in rugged conditions, discharging at temperatures as low as -4 degrees F.
The 3000 Pro has an updated cooling system controlled by high-precision chips and nine sensors, which Jackery said improved heat dissipation efficiency by 30%. The battery bank operates quietly below 30 decibels when charging in silent mode. The bank is also equipped with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to communicate with and be controlled by mobile devices. 
Geneverse HomePower PRO Plus 
Geneverse introduced the HomePower PRO Plus, a portable solar generator that can be converted to an on-grid generator system for home backup. The device can be controlled through an app to perform grid services like peak demand shaving, running appliances at costly times on the grid to avoid steep utility charges. 
The battery comes with a 4838 Wh capacity, 4400 W of rated power, and a surge power of 8800 W. The surge outlet supports up to 30 A, offering a useful alternative power source for contractors, RV travelers, and other uses beyond the home. 
The PRO Plus is housed in a motorized “cart” for easy of portability and contains 18 outlets hidden beneath sliding panels. The system is comprised of two modular Geneverse batteries that can be removed for flexible use. The product will be available in early Q2 2023. 
The battery can charge by the AC wall outlet in under two hours, or by solar in two to four hours. Geneverse also offers a Solar Pergola, an eight-foot-tall fold-out canopy that provides shade and powers the battery bank.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/05/nrg-systems-provides-monitoring-solution-for-largest-pv-plant-in-canada/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 5, 2023",NRG Systems provides monitoring solution for largest PV plant in Canada,"NRG Systems, Inc., a Vermont-based specialist in smart technologies, will provide Solar Resource Monitoring (SRM) systems to the Travers Solar Project, a 465 MW solar plant that is said to be the largest in Canada.
The Travers Solar Project was developed by Greengate Power and financed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The project had a total expected capital cost of approximately $516 million. Located on about 3,300 acres in Vulcan County, Alberta, approximately 500 full-time jobs were created during construction.
The facility is expected to produce enough clean energy to power more than 150,000 homes once operational. In 2021, it was announced that Amazon had signed a corporate power purchase agreement to offtake up to 400 MWac from the project.
The solar facility consists of approximately 1.3 million Jinko Solar bifacial solar modules on single-axis trackers in a north-south orientation. Construction began in Q4 2020 and the plant was fully operational in Q4 2022.
Solar project operators need to continuously monitor and optimize the energy output from a solar power plant to keep it running at optimal levels. The NRG SRM solution surveys a variety of meteorological and other parameters to form a critical subset of plant-level monitoring and the denominator in the critical Performance Ratio (PR) metric (energy produced / energy available).
Inefficiencies at the module, string, and system-wide levels can be detected by tracking electrical output side-by-side with accurate measurements of the site’s solar irradiance, temperature, and wind conditions. This information can be used to trigger real-time maintenance and to build optimal long-term preventative maintenance and cleaning programs specific to each site.

At the Travers site, the NRG monitoring system is intended to capture parameters including solar irradiance, module temperature, and soiling conditions, as well as albedo. Because the plant is using bifacial solar modules, albedo is an important piece in determining the solar energy potential available to the backside of the plant’s bifacial solar modules.
Fargo-based Ulteig is overseeing SCADA engineering and integration, and ultimately chose NRG as the monitoring solution because of its previous experience with NRG’s solar resource solutions.
“Their systems offer a unique combination of flexibility and repeatability, allowing for project-specific customization within a framework that is easily replicated across a single plant or multiple plants,” said Mike Crawford, senior market development manager-renewables at Ulteig. “This has been an especially important feature for the Travers project, given the project had strict requirements and contains more than one-million PV modules across the 3,300 acres.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/05/four-global-trends-in-solar-and-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 5, 2023",Four global trends in solar and storage,"Each year, IHS Markit, an S&P Global Company, offers 10 trends in cleantech for the year. This year, solar and energy storage-related stories dominated the list. Below are four top trends in solar and storage in 2022.
Distributed generation 45% of new additions
Distributed generation (DG), defined by IHS Markit as PV systems below 5 MW, was estimated to grow by 20% in 2022. The segment continues to demonstrate strong resilience through the pandemic and a challenging high-cost environment.
While many projects at the utility-scale were delayed or cancelled over the last two years, distributed generation did not lose traction. “This difference reflects both the DG policy push of individual markets and many consumers’ concerns over high electricity prices and the climate footprint,” said IHS Markit.
About 60% of the DG growth occurred in China and Germany, where both markets are pursuing policies to make DG a central part of renewables targets. Brazil is another high-profile DG market, as net-metering systems installed through 2023 remain exempt from grid charges. Conversely, the segment may recede considerably this year in the United States, as net metering is stripped from many major state markets.
“Even at higher capex levels, DG systems generate electricity that remains competitive with retail electricity prices across many markets, meaning the DG segment is less price sensitive than utility-scale PV,” said IHS Markit.
Renewables grow despite capex increases
Despite higher-than-expected capital expenditures in 2022, a new paradigm of renewables growth emerged. Renewables are already the cheapest source of new power generation globally, and cost declines due to technology evolutions and policy advancements have triggered further capacity additions and price drops.
In solar, investors have come to expect continuously lower capital expenditures, but as the technology has matured, capex is declining at a slower rate. This combined with supply chain hurdles and rising shipping and materials costs led to a higher-than-expected capex of solar projects this year.
As the penetration of renewables increases, the focus is not so much on the cost, but on the value provided to the system. IHS Markit said, “In a moment of high volatility, the predictability in operating renewables is valued.”
Investors also value investments in renewables as a measure to meet climate commitments and de-risk portfolios. IHS Markit said consolidation in renewables banking alongside a strong push for green financing has brought down the cost of capital for renewable power projects. Recent volatility and spikes in electricity prices have improved the captured prices for renewables.
“These perceived values counterbalance the industry’s higher-than-expected capex and underpin the continued build-out of new renewables capacity,” said IHS Markit.
Manufacturing closer to end market
Supply chain woes, trade barriers, and geopolitics have been driving PV manufacturing capacity closer to the end-user. IHS Markit said supply chain tightness may persist for some time, but there are some positive developments easing this, including: 
Announcements of new ingot, wafer, cell, and module capacity in India, the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asian countries will continue in 2023 as the supply chain continues growing and adapting to the new international trade environment.
Energy storage system costs rise 
Lithium-ion batteries have reversed their trend of lowering in cost, rising about 15% in late 2021. A surge of raw materials prices across the board pushed prices higher in 2022. Cost increases are primarily for lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries, which is favored for the grid-scale storage segment and is in-demand for the EV segment as well.
Price declines may not resume until 2024, said IHS Markit, and this is subject to LFP manufacturers quickly scaling up and energy storage integrators securing supply agreements with a wider range of providers not captured by EV demand.
“Nonetheless, battery energy storage costs remain competitive with the alternative technologies. The bigger threat to growth is the ability of system integrators to procure the required volumes of batteries,” said IHS Markit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/05/cow-carbon-credits-announced-at-ces-2023/,"SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 5, 2023",Cow carbon credits announced at CES 2023,"This week at CES 2023, taking place in Las Vegas, start-up company Melliens announced its cow carbon platform that monitors the carbon footprint of cattle and trades the credits in carbon markets. Carbon credits are tradable certificates that are intended to offset the amount of carbon emitted by the purchaser.
Melliens is a South Korean-based startup, formed in 2021, with an U.S. office in Kirkland, Washington. Melliens was founded by professors from South Korea’s Jeonbuk National University, and after 10 years of research and development, they formed the LINC3.0 Project Group for the purpose of commercializing the technology.
The company said it is committed to continually cutting the carbon footprint of beef by half of the world average by 2030. In October of 2022, the company joined the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, an organization made up of some of the world’s largest meat producers with the goal of improving the sustainability of the global beef supply chain.
Melliens developed a Livestock Carbon Monitoring & Carbon Credit Sharing Platform that is intended to enable beef producers to generate and sell carbon credits for practicing less carbon intensive agriculture than the current industry standard.
“The cow carbon platform reliably generates carbon credits based upon inputs. We are proud to present a technology promoting a cleaner environment and healthier earth” said Dr. Lee Hakkyo, Melliens founder and professor of Joenbuk National University in South Korea.
Melliens is the first climate technology company to monitor the carbon footprints of beef cattle and trade accumulated carbon credits in carbon markets. According to the company, carbon emissions from cattle make up 10% of overall agricultural emissions, and that could grow to 40% by 2050. The company developed the cow carbon platform in response to this potential growth in carbon emissions.
The platform is intended to quantify and verify the reduced carbon emissions, while generating carbon credits in real time. The cow carbon credits will soon be available for purchase by anyone, and profits will be shared with beef suppliers, according to Mellien.
“Melliens is building a connection between beef farmers and the tech world to share benefits by trading accumulated carbon credits in voluntary carbon markets,” said Salim Dada, managing director and CEO at Concord Ventures, a venture capital firm.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/05/north-american-ev-battery-production-forecast-to-reach-1-twh-annually-by-2030/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,ALABAMA,CALIFORNIA,CANADA,GEORGIA,ILLINOIS,INDIANA,MEXICO,MICHIGAN,MICHIGAN,MISSOURI,MISSOURI,NORTH AMERICA,OHIO,TENNESSEE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 5, 2023",North American EV battery production forecast to reach 1 TWh annually by 2030,"Electric vehicle battery manufacturing capacity in North America is projected to increase to 1,000 GWh/year by 2030, representing a 20 times increase from 55 GWh/year of manufacturing capacity in 2021, thanks primarily to stimulus funding from the Inflation Reduction Act.
The majority of new EV battery plants are scheduled to begin production between 2025 and 2030. By then, production capacity will be capable of supporting the manufacture of roughly 10 to 13 million fully electric vehicles per year.
In a report by the Department of Energy in conjunction with Argonne National Laboratory, planned battery capacity production is seeing the highest penetration rate in the Midwest and Southeast, with historic Rust Belt states across the Midwest having facilities devoted to battery production.  To optimize supply chain logistics, many battery facilities will be co-located within existing automotive plants.
Michigan, Kentucky and Georgia have the highest estimated battery production capacity through 2030, at 97 GW per year to 136 GW/y, followed by Ohio, Kansas, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and California, with 46 GW/y to 97 GW/y of estimated battery production.
By existing vehicle production locations, the Midwest has a good number of existing facilities for battery use, at 25 facilities, while surprisingly Ontario has nine facilities and Mexico has 30 facilities that are flagged for planned EV battery capacity.

 
In addition to vehicle facility co-locations for EV battery production, the concentration of 2030 battery plant announcements broadly correlates to states in the same region seeing the highest rate of new EV registrations. Southeast states like Georgia and Florida, which tallied 128,000 new EV registrations, are seeing a manufacturing uptick across the historic manufacturing hub of Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. West Coast states of California (878,000) and Washington  (91,000) seeing a high EV registration are broadly seeing production capacity coming online in the next few years in California, Arizona and Nevada.
A few states with existing vehicle assembly plants such as Illinois, Missouri, and Mississippi, have not telegraphed plans for additional 2030 goal EV battery production capacity, despite having five existing vehicle assembly locations.
Since the landmark Inflation Reduction Act passed in August, auto makers and battery companies have announced $11 billion in new investments into the North American EV battery supply chain. Panasonic opened a $4 billion factory in Kansas and is now eyeing Oklahoma,  Toyota increased its commitment to a North Carolina battery production facility from $1.3 billion to $3.8 billion, and Statevolt intends to spend $4 billion on a factory in California.
 
Through late 2021, 2.3 million vehicles or just over 4% of North American vehicles on the road were EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs, with 630,000 EVs sold in 2021 alone, representing sales growth of 92% compared to 457,000 of sales in 2020.
Since 2010, 65% of EVs sold in the U.S. have been assembled here, and over 110 GWh of lithium-ion batteries have been installed in those vehicles to date.  The average range for EVs reached 290 miles in 2021, with 2.5 billion gallons of gasoline cumulatively saved since 2010, reducing consumer fuel costs by $1.3 billion in 2021. EVs drove 19.1 billion miles in 2021 using 6,100 GWh of electricity, saving 700 million gallons of gasoline.
As of December 2021, Tesla (42.9%), General Motors (11.6%), Toyota (8%), Ford (6.8%) and Nissan (7.1%) generated more than 75% of total EV sales in North America, with four Tesla models, the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt/Volt, Ford Fusion Energi and Toyota Prius making up some of the 14 most popular EV models by sales of over 30,000 units apiece in 2021.
California, Washington D.C., Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Vermont and Colorado all have total EV shares above 1% relative to total cars on the road, with California holding more than 3% ratio of EVs to conventional vehicles on the road for late 2021, with Hawaii and West Coast states to Colorado following the Sunshine State.
The rate of electric vehicle adoption will likely increase substantially in coming years as states issue EV mandates.
Additional data and reports can be accessed from the DOE here. The research report was authored by Argonne’s David Gohlke, Yan Zhou, Xinyi Wu and Calista Courtney.
