The portable panels come with a battery housed in a case, specially designed for cold and harsh environments. The technology was recently awarded nearly $40,000 in tax incentives from the government of Canada.
While most batteries don’t perform well in permafrost areas, SEI found a manufacturer of military grade cases used for transporting and storing missiles, which the company uses for its batteries. The cases house the batteries as well as heaters to keep them warm.
SEI uses lithium-ion batteries with a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heater. When the temperature outside drops, more of the power from the panels goes to the heater that warms the batteries, SEI reports.

The foldable module design of the solar panels was developed so that the off-grid solution could be easily transported and set up anywhere. According to SEI, technical challenges included how small and light the structure could become without compromising sturdiness and performance, and how to reduce the number of components without leaving panels vulnerable to high winds. After extensive experimentation, the designers realized that once new custom-designed hinges were used, bulky gas springs were no longer required, and that if they increased the panels’ proximity to the ground, they performed exactly the same in wind tunnel testing.

Canada has committed to reducing carbon emissions while safeguarding an economy that depends greatly on natural resources. The country recently released 2022 Fall Economic Statement,  which introduced investment tax credits (ITC) for clean technologies and clean hydrogen that will help spur the transition to net-zero energy and make Canada more competitive with the United States. The clean-tech tax credits will be offered to those who invest in net-zero technologies, battery storage and clean hydrogen. The new 30% Canadian tax credit will apply to investments in renewable energy generation and storage, as well as in as low-carbon heating and zero-emission industrial vehicles. The Canadian government also plans a tax credit for hydrogen production, the design of which has yet to be determined.
“While the IRA will undoubtedly accelerate the ongoing transition to a net-zero North American economy, it also offers enormous financial supports to firms that locate their production in the United States – from electric vehicle battery production, to hydrogen, to biofuels, and beyond,” the government said in the economic update. “Without new measures to keep pace with the IRA, Canada risks being left behind.”
One of the primary sources of investment that the Government of Canada gives to businesses and organizations operating in this sector is the Scientific Research & Experimental Development (SR&ED) program. This tax incentive for innovation allows businesses to claim back expenses incurred on research and development (R&D) activity. This is made up of a combination of federal and provincial funding. Not every cost associated with R&D can be included in a claim, however, the main qualifying expenses include staff costs, salaries, materials, as well as payments to contractors and third parties. Catax Canada, a specialist in tax incentives for scientific research and experimental development, helped secure the funding.
“When you’re faced with overcoming challenges as great as these are, having access to this kind of funding is invaluable. Knowing we can rely on SR&ED has completely energized our whole approach to innovation. The benefits it brings mean we’re investing more in R&D than ever before,” said Eric Little, founder and CEO of SEI Logistics.
This article was amended on December 14, 2022 to note that Catax Canada helped secure the funding.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/01/u-s-customs-releases-uflpa-detained-solar-panels-said-roth-note/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 1, 2022","U.S. Customs releases UFLPA detained solar panels, said ROTH note","An industry note from Philip Shen, managing director, ROTH Capital Partners, said industry contacts have informed the firm that the first potentially meaningful supply of solar panels detained by Customs Border Patrol under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) has been released to the U.S. market.
The note said JinkoSolar modules made with Wacker polysilicon were released. “We believe this could result in a ramp up of volume and imports. The company likely has a substantial amount of Hoshine WRO & UFLPA backlog to get through,” wrote Shen.
The UFLPA places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the Xinjiang region of China, home to roughly 50% of the global polysilicon supply chain, are made with forced labor. The act places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever.
To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at a facility, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that over 1,000 shipments of solar energy components, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, have been blocked in U.S. ports under enforcement of UFLPA. ROTH said in August that as much as 3 GW had been held in Customs since the law was enacted. As much as 9 GW to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering U.S. markets by the end of the year, said Shen.
The module release is expected to have a meaningfully positive effect on the U.S. utility-scale solar sector, said ROTH.
The note warned that Customs Border Patrol may now turn its attention beyond the top solar component importers. “We could end up being in a two steps forward, one step back situation,” said ROTH.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/01/rallies-underway-in-10-california-cities-to-combat-anti-rooftop-solar-policy/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 1, 2022",Rallies underway in 10 California cities to combat anti-rooftop solar policy,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is expected to vote on the proposed Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 in mid-December. The proposed decision lowers the value of net metering by as much as 76%, a change that has been heavily criticized by the solar industry.
Net metering is the process by which utilities pay rooftop solar owners for exporting electricity back to the grid, and it has been a key part of launching California’s bustling rooftop solar industry, which represents roughly 50% of the U.S. market.
Currently, average net metering rates range from $0.23 per kWh to $0.35 per kWh, and the new proposed decision cuts those rates to an average of $0.05 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh.
The proposed decision comes after a year of rulemaking battles waged between investor-owned utilities and rooftop solar advocates, including environmentalists, employment and labor groups, small businesses, and concerned citizens. This June, a similar rally was held to strike down a proposed fixed charge to solar customers, a policy that was maligned as “a tax on the sun.” The provision was successfully removed, but the revised proposal still contains provisions that are significantly damaging to the value of local, clean energy.
“We urge Governor Newsom and the CPUC to make further adjustments to help more middle- and working-class consumers as well as schools and farms access affordable, reliable, clean energy,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA).
Rallies are to be held in 10 cities across California to call for more supportive rooftop solar policy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/01/rfp-alert-doe-transmission-facilitation-program-seeks-capacity-contracts/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 1, 2022",RFP Alert: DOE Transmission Facilitation Program seeks capacity contracts,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Transmission Facilitation Program has issued a request for proposals (RFP) for capacity contracts whereby DOE will buy up to 50% of a new or expanded transmission line’s capacity for up to 40 years, and later sell that capacity contract to recover its costs.
The revolving fund program has $2.5 billion in revolving fund borrowing authority, and expects to issue subsequent RFPs to support transmission through public-private partnerships, loans and possibly additional capacity contracts.
Any entity developing a transmission project may apply, said Jeff Dennis, deputy director for transmission development for DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, in a webinar that drew more than 300 participants. Another round of capacity contracts may also be offered, he added.
Two categories of transmission lines are eligible for DOE support: a new or replacement transmission line of at least 1000 MW, or a new or upgraded transmission line of at least 500 MW in an existing transmission, transportation or telecommunications infrastructure corridor. Proposed transmission projects must meet project readiness criteria, and must be ready to commence construction by December 31, 2027.
DOE requires project information that would enable it to certify that the transmission project is in the public interest, and is unlikely to be built in a timely manner, or with as much transmission capacity, in the absence of DOE support. Applicants must provide modeling demonstrating sufficient demand for transmission capacity to support the project’s financial viability, such that DOE has a reasonable expectation that it can recover its costs.
DOE will credit, under one evaluation factor, a transmission project that will contribute to national or subnational goals to lower electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions, Dennis said. This would favor transmission that delivers renewable power, or perhaps that eases congestion on other lines that do so.
Other evaluation criteria include improving grid resilience and reliability; using technology to achieve those goals or to enhance capacity or efficiency; facilitating interregional transfer capacity; and meeting policy priorities around community engagement, jobs, and ensuring that project benefits are distributed to disadvantaged communities.
DOE will confer with regional transmission organizations as it evaluates which transmission projects to support.
DOE’s Transmission Facilitation Program is one of several programs run by DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, said Maria Robinson, director of the office, on the webinar. The office was created, she said, thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.
 Further information on the request for proposals is available from the program’s web page.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/01/inside-the-ira-how-does-prevailing-wage-affect-my-solar-tax-credit/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 1, 2022",Inside the IRA: How does prevailing wage affect my solar tax credit?,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) added a requirement that all projects larger than one megawatt alternating current (1 MWac) must pay its workers a prevailing wage and institute an apprenticeship program, if the project wants to claim the full 30% investment tax credit IiTC) or the 2.6¢/kWh production tax credit (PTC). Residential projects, and commercial projects smaller than 1 MWac do not have to meet these requirements.
On November 30th, the U.S. Department of Treasury began to release guidance for the interpretation of these laws.
Prevailing wage
The IRA requires that all laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or their subcontractors must be paid the local prevailing wage labor rate.
The Wage Determination page on SAM.gov provides information on the actual hourly wage that must be paid to specific laborer and mechanic job titles. The Treasury notes that contractors are responsible for keeping records that verify that the correct wages have been paid. Additionally, any work done on a project in the ten years following construction must also be paid the prevailing wage.
Importantly, the Treasury’s guidance states that any projects whose installation begins on or after January 30, 2023 is required to pay the full prevailing wage to employees. The Treasury notes that a project can prove that construction is underway by qualifying for the Five Percent Safe Harbour Rule or the Physical Work Test.
If prevailing wages aren’t paid, then the ITC will provide a 6% credit in place of the 30% credit, and the PTC’s based value before inflation adjustment will be 0.3¢/kWh versus the base 1.5¢/kWh.
Apprenticeship
The IRA also put in place another requirement for projects greater than 1 MWac: contractors employing four or more individuals to build a project must also employ at least one apprentice. This ratio of workers to apprentices is based on requirements set by the Department of Labor or state labor boards.
For all of 2023, the Treasury says projects must offer 10% of the hours to apprenticeships. This value increases to 12.5% for 2024, and 15% in 2025.
The Treasury notes that if a contractor requests apprentices from local boards providing these individuals, and they’re not available, then the contractor can still claim the full ITC or PTC requirements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/01/solar-and-storage-prices-soared-as-a-result-of-market-disruptions-nrel-reports/,"COST AND PRICES,COVID-19,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 1, 2022","Solar and storage prices soared as a result of market disruptions, NREL reports","The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has published a report every year since 2010 on photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage costs. The most recent report, U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmarks, With Minimum Sustainable Price Analysis: Q1 2022 covers installed costs for PV and storage systems as of the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, and takes into account complications caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, industry specific events, and trade policy debacles.
Findings show that prices soared throughout the U.S. economy between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022, and especially for the PV and energy storage markets. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic caused supply chain constraints, and industry-specific events and trade policies drove up PV and battery prices. Reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that while developers had planned to install 17.8 GW in the first half of 2022, only 4.2 GW was installed and brought online—pointing to module supply challenges, which led to cancellations and delays.
As Kristyn Melvin and Matt Bonovich wrote in an OpEd in pv magazine USA in March 2022, “Covid-19 had a serious effect on all supply chains, but because of the level of module (and other) imports depended upon for the U.S. solar industry, the solar supply chain suffered from shortages, high costs of shipping, a spike in the demand for steel, increased gas prices, and rising costs of materials and components.”
Other challenges included the Antidumping and Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD) Anti-Circumvention petition filed by Auxin Solar, the Section 201 Tariffs, and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.
With multiple challenges affecting the U.S. solar industry in the past year, NREL took a different tack on its annual report. Because the data is used to track long-term technology and soft cost trends to help focus R&D activities, instead of compling one set of data, NREL used two types of benchmarks—one showing short-term market distortions and the other showing impacts from longer-term technology trends.
The two types of benchmarks in the new report are the minimum sustainable price (MSP) and the modeled market price (MMP). MSP is a theoretical national-average cash price under long-term market conditions. The MSP report excludes short-term cost distortions that affected the market in Q1 2022. In contrast, the report’s MMP is an estimate of the national-average cash sales price under market conditions occurring in Q1 2022, consistent with NREL’s previous benchmarks.
“NREL’s addition of the MSP benchmark in 2022 reflects our primary goal of clarifying long-term PV technology and soft cost trends to inform research and development investments,” said Vignesh Ramasamy, lead author of the report. “It is imperative to understand what goes into the cost categories that add up to the final system costs for both benchmark types.”
For more context on the benchmark types, the chart below provides a concrete example comparing MSP and MMP for a residential PV system. Differences between the two benchmarks stem from different input parameters. Taking each of the component costs in turn: For the PV module, MSP is based on an NREL MSP model and excludes tariffs and short-term supply/demand dynamics, whereas the module MMP, based on third-party analyst data, includes costs from tariffs and supply/demand market dynamics. The inverter MSP is based on an average cost trend (excluding distorted 2022 costs) and no tariff impacts, whereas the inverter MMP is based on 2022 costs with tariff impacts. Similarly, the balance of system (BOS) MSP is based on an average cost trend that excludes 2022 costs, and the BOS MMP is based on 2022 costs. Soft cost input parameters are the same for MSP and MMP.

NREL’s MSP and MMP benchmarks differ in both purpose and methodology. For the MSP benchmark, which is useful for long-term analysis and making research and development investment decisions, distorted input costs are removed from model calculations. For the MMP benchmark, which is useful for near-term policy and market analysis based on disaggregated system costs, reported market costs and prices of different sub-cost components are used in the calculations.
The next chart shows NREL’s MSP and MMP PV benchmarks across the residential, commercial, and utility-scale sectors. Discrepancies between benchmark types are similar for all sectors, at 13% to 15%, representing the impact of either excluding (MSP) or including (MMP) inflationary market and policy distortions. Although not shown in the chart, the differences between MSP and MMP are similar for standalone storage and PV-plus-storage systems as well.
Image: NREL
Since 2010, NREL has benchmarked the disaggregated costs of PV systems, including installation costs, for residential, commercial, and utility-scale projects. In 2022, these benchmarks compare a theoretical MSP to an MMP that estimates the national-average sales price under market conditions occurring in Q1 2022. These results show the 13% to 15% difference between MSP and MMP for standalone PV systems in Q1 2022.
Because the methods used to develop the 2022 MMP benchmarks are similar to the methods used to develop NREL’s benchmarks in 2021, many of those results can be compared across years. The Q1 2022 MMP PV, storage, and PV-plus-storage benchmarks are 2% to 12% higher than comparable Q1 2021 benchmarks in real dollars. These differences could be considered estimates of the increase in national-average system sales prices between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022.
The MSP and MMP benchmarks are both based on NREL’s ongoing collection of industry data and its bottom-up cost modeling. The data include representative PV and storage system specifications based on industry trends as well as feedback from stakeholders. This year, the authors interviewed 21 stakeholders, including third-party research organizations, PV installers and integrators, EPC developers, advocacy groups, intergovernmental organizations, and government agencies.
Bottom-up modeling accounts for all system and project development costs incurred during installation, including typical installation techniques and business operations. Hardware costs reflect the purchase price of components as well as the sales price paid to the installer, including profits. The results are broken down by cost category to illustrate which system components may be driving prices and to identify opportunities for price reductions. From these same data and modeling approaches, the MSP and MMP benchmarks are differentiated by identifying cost distortions from short-term market and policy conditions and then including or excluding distorted cost inputs, as described above.
“The MSP and MMP benchmarks are simplified tools for analyzing the complex and diverse evolution of PV and storage technologies in the United States,” said Jarett Zuboy, a report coauthor. “We will continue to refine these benchmarks in subsequent reports, and we welcome feedback on our methods and results from stakeholders.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/01/california-100-mw-solar-facility-now-generating-power-for-community-owned-electricity-providers/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 1, 2022",California 100 MW solar facility now generating power for community-owned electricity providers,"Dallas, Texas headquartered developer Leeward Renewable Energy announced it has completed construction and achieved commercial operations on the Rabbitbrush Solar Facility, located in Kern County, California, a hotbed for some of the nation’s largest solar and energy storage projects.
The project is a 100 MW solar facility with a co-located 20 MW, 50 MWh battery energy storage system. It is comprised of 415,000 thin-film PV modules and lithium-ion batteries. Construction of the project employed 380 workers at its peak.
Electricity generated by the project will be sold Central Coast Community Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy, two not-for-profit, community-owned electric providers who will purchase power via 15-year power purchase agreements.
Leeward closed construction financing and tax equity commitments in June of 2022 and closed on the tax equity funding this October. The closed funding includes $58.5 million in Green Loan construction financing and an additional $62.5 million tax equity commitments.
Leeward originally acquired the Rabbitbrush project from First Solar, as part of a $261 million deal where the module manufacturer sold Leeward its 10 GW utility-scale solar project platform.
The deal included the Rabbitbrush, Madison, Oak Trail, Horizon, and Ridgely projects, and the 30 MW Barilla Solar project, which is operational. The project pipeline includes projects in the California, Southwest, and Southeast markets. Sale of the platform is a result of a strategic review First Solar announced last year, according to CEO Mark Widmar, and is intended to enable the company to focus on scaling, developing, and selling module technology.
As part of the deal, Leeward signed on to buy 650 MW of First Solar’s Series 6 PV solar modules for its additional development opportunities. Leeward’s acquisition includes purchase orders for 888 MW of Series 6 modules for the five development projects.
The solar and storage facility is expected to meet the needs of nearly 40,000 California homes, displacing an estimated 48,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. The company has committed $150,000 to the National Audubon Society and the Kern Audobon Society to fund the study and conservation of the Swanson’s Hawk in the Antelope Valley region.
“Responsible renewable energy development and wildlife conservation go hand in hand, and LRE’s contribution to the very important Swainson’s Hawk Conservation Fund will help hawks in the Antelope Valley of California survive and thrive,” said Garry George, director of the National Audubon Society’s Clean Energy Initiative. “We are pleased to collaborate with LRE as we advance habitat conservation and clean energy in Kern and Los Angeles Counties, and we look forward to partnering with other companies in the region to ensure renewable energy facilities avoid, minimize, and mitigate the impacts on birds and other wildlife.”
Leeward is a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, an investment arm of OMERS, one of Canada’s largest benefit pension plans.
