Independent of the Osaka deal, Summit Ridge has also acquired a portfolio of three Maine community solar projects from Cianbro.
Because the Osaka deal is so recent in development, project sites have not yet been released, but has it been shared how many projects will comprise that 120 MW portfolio. CohnReznick Capital acted as the exclusive financial advisor on the transaction.
Those 120 MW are expected to provide approximately 11,000 residential and commercial ratepayers with monthly utility savings.
Totaling 19.5 MW in capacity, Summit Ridge’s newly-acquired community solar portfolio includes two projects that are currently under construction by Cianbro and are expected to reach commercial operation by the end of 2021. The third project will also be constructed by Cianbro and will go live by the end of 2022.
Once operational, the portfolio will generate clean power for approximately 3,500 Maine residents across CMP service territories

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/07/farmers-opting-for-solar-leases-over-carbon-sequestration-contracts/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 7, 2021",Farmers opting for solar leases over carbon sequestration contracts,"Purdue University released the results of its Ag Barometer, a monthly survey of farmers in the U.S., and found that farmers are adopting solar leases at double the rate of carbon sequestration contracts. 
Farmers are continuing to turn to solar as a source of income, with financial fears brewing in the agricultural sector, said Purdue. The Farm Financial Performance Index has fallen 24% in just one month, as farmers are expecting their input costs to rise much more rapidly in the year ahead than they have over the last decade. 
Increasingly, solar is being considered and adopted by farmers to balance the books. Of the 400 surveyed farmers, who run operations larger than $500,000 in annual revenue, nearly one-third are aware of solar leasing opportunities for their farmland, and 29% have engaged in discussions with solar companies about leasing their land.  
One in ten of those farmers who engaged in talks moved forward with solar, with 2.9% of total respondents saying they currently have solar lease contracts. This compares to only about one percent of farmers engaged in carbon sequestration plans. 
Solar leases currently are offering some financial relief, but the surveyed farmers have witnessed a wide range of per-acre pricing for their contracts. A third of the projects offered less than $500 per acre annually, and about 27% percent said their solar contract offering ran at $1000 per acre or more, with the rest falling in between.  
These prices dwarf the $20 per acre value of carbon sequestration plans. Though in carbon sequestration plans, the farmer will still have utility of the cropland and the value therein, they may have to change their practices to achieve the contract’s sequestration goals. Most solar fields do not support farming in the same space, but a rising trend of agrivoltaics may change that. 
Carbon sequestration plans will need to make a stronger business case to farmers already feeling pain if wider adoption is to be seen. Such carbon plans are not necessarily in a zero-sum game with solar projects, so creative ideas on this front could generate new value chains.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/07/new-jersey-is-set-to-pass-two-key-pieces-of-solar-legislation/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW JERSEY",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 7, 2021",New Jersey is set to pass two key pieces of solar legislation,"The New Jersey Legislature has passed two key pieces of legislation intended to spur solar development and investment across the state.
The first, S2605, looks to establish a successor program to the state’s solar renewable energy certificate (SREC) program under the Board of Public Utilities (BPU), providing incentives for the development of at least 3,750 MW of behind-the-meter solar facilities and 750 MW of community solar by 2026. This goal may be extended or revised by the board as necessary to conform to the State’s solar energy policies.
The bill also revises the state’s competitive solicitation process for new solar projects, with the hope that this will further incentivize the development of at least 1,500 MW of large-scale solar power facilities by 2026. As part of this revision, the BPU will be required to hold a solicitation for large-scale solar projects at least every 18 months.
The bill also revises the state’s guidelines on siting solar projects, focusing on protecting conservation and agricultural land.
Alongside S2605, the legislature has also sent S3484 to Gov. Murphy’s desk, an act which looks to establish a dual-use solar project pilot program for unpreserved farmland and would allow land used for dual-use solar project to be eligible for farmland assessment, under certain conditions.
This bill specifically directs the BPU to establish a “Dual-Use Solar Energy Pilot Program,” which authorizes up to 200 MW of solar projects on unpreserved farmland. The pilot would allow for continued agricultural production under and around the solar panels. It authorizes and encourages dual-use solar projects up to 10 MW each and lays the foundation for a permanent dual-use solar energy program.
Both bills have been lauded by renewable energy advocates, with Scott Elias, senior manager of state affairs in the mid-Atlantic for the Solar Energy Industries Association, commenting:
“These bills will help facilitate at least 3,750 megawatts of new solar power generation by 2026. Although the devil is in the details over what incentive levels the BPU ultimately determines, how the competitive solicitation is designed and whether reasonable siting criteria for solar projects prevail, these bills send a strong signal that the Garden State is committed to advancing solar energy.”
The bills are currently awaiting signature from Gov. Phil Murphy, which is considered to be all but inevitable.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/07/sunrise-brief-ohio-has-public-hearings-for-350-mw-of-solar/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,OHIO,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 7, 2021",Sunrise brief: Ohio has public hearings for 350 MW of solar,"The Ohio Power Siting Board has set public hearings for two new proposed solar farms in central the central part of the state, totaling over 350 MW in capacity.
An in-person public hearing regarding Pleasant Prairie Solar LLC’s proposed 250 megawatt solar farm in Franklin County is set for July 19. The hearing will start at 6 p.m. at the Battelle Darby Creek Metro Park Nature Center, 1415 Darby Creek Dr., Galloway, Ohio, 43119.
The public hearing for Union Ridge Solar LLC’s 107 MW solar farm in Licking County will be held at 6 p.m. Aug. 31 at the Harrison Township Trustees Office, Road Garage, 6750 Outville Rd, S.W. Pataskala, Ohio 43062.
The two projects are exceptionally large for the state, especially Pleasant Prairie. As of now, the largest project being constructed in Ohio is the Hillcrest Solar facility, developed by Innergex Renewable Energy, which Pleasant Prairie easily surpasses in size.
Solar Alliance announced its partnership with Boyd CAT, a regional caterpillar construction vehicle dealer, and will be opening an office in Louisville, Kentucky.
Under the agreement, Boyd CAT and Solar Alliance will jointly pursue solar opportunities where Boyd CAT provides sales support and solar equipment, and Solar Alliance runs the solar design, engineering, and installation services. Together, the two will pursue large utility-scale projects while also continuing their work in the commercial sector, serving agricultural, manufacturing and small business customers.
The partnership will feature the use of CAT solar panels, and will draw on the installation and engineering experience of Alliance, leading to what the company called a turnkey solar experience. Solar Alliance has a “build-own-operate” strategy, and currently is acquiring two construction-ready projects in New York.
Heliogen, a provider of AI-enabled concentrated solar power, announced their business combination with Athena Technology Acquisition Corp, a special purpose action company. The business combination will now be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The transaction implies a $2 billion value of the combined company, and is expected to advance Heliogen’s development of dispatchable concentrated solar energy as an affordable alternative to fossil fuels.
Heliogen said the proceeds are expected to be used to scale heliostat technology, support global project development, and to fund the balance sheet. The company’s closed loop, AI-enabled technology is commencing commercialization with internationally recognized customers in the industrial, mining, and energy sectors, they said.
