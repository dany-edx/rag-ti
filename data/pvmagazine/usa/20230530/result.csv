That’s progress that’s hard to erase and felt across both sides of the political divide.
Texas politicians and lobby groups came to a resolution late Sunday night, May 28, which amends recently filed legislation from SB 624 designed to set severe restrictions on the permitting of wind, solar and clean energy assets in the coming year. The resolution, however, could still throw a wrench into the progress Texas has made in vying for the top state for renewable energy development after California.
Under HB 1500, the ‘PUC Sunset’ bill, renewable energy projects will have to pay higher transmission fees and, starting in 2027, all renewable energy projects will be forced to subsidize fossil fuels through “firming’ requirements. The Public Utility Commission of Texas will also study whether to make renewables pay higher “ancillary services” costs. However, the Legislature rejected a discriminatory permitting program for wind and solar.
The firming requirement applies to power facilities signed into interconnection after January 1, 2027, and allows generators to meet the requirement within their entire portfolio by utilizing on or off-site generation, including battery energy storage (BESS) systems.
Cost allocation, as passed by the state’s senate, is now included in the amended legislation package, and conducted by the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), must be delivered to the state’s legislature no later than December 1, 2025.
Luke Metzger, executive director of advocacy group Environment Texas said, “In a legislative session that saw an unprecedented effort to hogtie the growth of wind and solar energy, we are thankful that the Legislature ultimately rejected the measures most damaging to clean energy. Renewable energy is reducing pollution, saving consumers money, and playing a critical role in powering the grid.
“The anti-renewable efforts were premised on a false claim.” In his press release declaring victory, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick claimed that “renewable energy failed to keep the lights on for millions of Texans” during Winter Storm Uri. Multiple studies have found such claims to be inaccurate, Metzger said.
“We need, and Texans want, more clean energy, not less. More wind and solar energy, more battery storage, more energy efficiency, and more interconnection with the national grid,” Metzger said. “Unfortunately, the legislature ignored these solutions to strengthen our electric grid while protecting consumers and the environment.”
The PUC Sunset bill (HB 1500) now heads to Governor Greg Abbot’s desk. Since all three branches of the state were closely engaged on this bill, it is highly unlikely that the governor would veto it, though he has a veto period through June 18.
In early May, the state’s senate voted 21-9 in favor of SB 624, a bill that would place significant permitting restrictions and fines on solar and wind energy projects in the state.
Ongoing legislation from SB 2627 and SJR 93, provides $7.2 billion in low-interest loans to support the development of up to 10,000 megawatts of new gas power plants in Texas. Gas power plants are also eligible for tax breaks under HB 5, which provides abatements on school taxes for new manufacturing facilities.
Under the current legislation, renewable energy and battery storage projects are no longer eligible for such tax breaks.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/30/energy-insecure-households-in-the-u-s-pay-27-more-for-electricity-than-others/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 30, 2023",Energy-insecure households in the U.S. pay 27% more for electricity than others,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that households that are considered energy insecure, or those that have the inability to adequately meet basic household energy costs, are paying more for electricity than their wealthier counterparts. 
On average in the United States in 2020, households were billed about $1.04 per square foot for all energy sources. For homes that did not report energy insecurity, that average was $0.98 per square foot, while homes with energy insecurity issues paid an average of $1.24 per square foot for energy. This means that U.S. residents that need the most support on their energy bills are stuck with costs 27% higher than their neighbors on square-foot-basis.
EIA said energy-insecure households have reduced or forgone basic necessities to pay energy bills, kept their houses at unsafe temperatures because of energy cost concerns, or been unable to repair heating or cooling equipment because of cost.
In 2020, households with income less than $10,000 a year were billed an average of $1.31 per square foot for energy, while households making $100,000 or more were billed an average of $0.96 per square foot, said EIA. Renters paid considerably more ($1.28 per square foot) than owners ($0.98 per square foot). There were also considerable differences between regions, ethnic groups and races, and insulation levels, as seen below.
The energy transition toward renewables like solar has offered price stability, but thus far energy-insecure communities have relatively been left behind. A recent Berkeley Lab report, Residential Solar-Adopter Income and Demographic Trends, indicates that even though the rate of solar adoption among low-income residents is increasing (from 5% in 2010 to 11% in 2021), that segment of energy consumers remains under-represented among solar adopters, relative to its share of the population.
Community solar efforts
As such, the United States is targeting communities most impacted by energy costs that have not benefitted from the transition, highlighting “Energy Communities” that are eligible for an additional 10% tax credit through funds made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Additionally, a push for community solar development is taking place nationwide to extend access to affordable solar energy to renters and other residents that aren’t able to leverage finances to invest in predictable, low-cost solar. The Biden Administration set a goal this year to sign up 5 million community solar households, achieving $1 billion in bill savings by 2025. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW by the target year. The Department of Energy estimates community solar subscribers save an average of 20% on their bills.
California this year passed AB 2316, the Community Renewable Energy Act takes aim at four acute problems in the state’s power market: reliability, rates, climate and equity. The law creates a community renewable energy program, including community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes. Community solar typically involves customers subscribing to an off-site solar facility, receiving a utility bill credit for the power it generates.
“Community renewable energy is a proven powerful tool to help close California’s clean energy gap, bringing much needed relief to millions struggling with high housing costs and utility debt,” said Alexis Sutterman, energy equity program manager at the California Environmental Justice Alliance.
The program has energy equity baked into its structure, working to make sure Californians of all income levels participate in the benefits of the energy transition. Not only does it open solar access to renters, the law ensures that at least 51% of subscribers are low-income customers, which is expected to make projects eligible for a 10% tax credit adder under the IRA.
“The money’s on the table now,” said Jeff Cramer, president and chief executive of the Coalition for Community Solar Access. “While there are groups pushing for solar access for all, and states with strong legislation, there are other pockets of interest in surprising places in the United States. For example, Louisiana has no policy for community solar or support for low-income residents going solar but the city of New Orleans has its own utility commission with a community solar program. In Nebraska, forward-looking co-operatives have created community solar projects.
Community solar markets are active in 22 states, with more expected to come online in the future. However, the market is expected to require strong community outreach efforts to foster trust and gain subscribers.
“There is a distrust of community solar initially in LMI communities as many have been burned before by retail energy false promises,” said Eric LaMora, executive director, community solar, Nautilus Solar on a panel at the Solar Energy Industries Association Finance, Tax, and Buyers seminar. “People are suspicious but there really are no hooks with community solar.”
LMI residents are leery to provide tax records or much documents at all in order to sign up for community solar, LaMora said. “We were surprised to see less of a default rate with LMI residents. We attribute this to the fact that they see significant savings on their electric bill, making it easier to pay each month,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/30/global-investment-in-clean-energy-nearly-doubles-that-of-fossil-fuels/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 30, 2023",Global investment in clean energy nearly doubles that of fossil fuels,"The global shift to clean energy is happening rapidly, with decarbonization efforts no longer a future prospect, but a reality of today.
The annual World Energy Investment report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that for every dollar invested in fossil fuels, $1.70 is invested in clean energy technologies. This marks a fast divergence from five years ago, when fossil fuels and clean energy investments were essentially even.
The torch is now being carried by solar, which is soon to overtake oil production said IEA. Almost 90% of new power generation investments are now tied to solar and other low-carbon technologies, said the report.
About $2.8 trillion is set to be invested in energy globally in 2023, $1.7 trillion of which will go to clean technologies, with PV leading the way as the largest contributor of energy generation. The remaining roughly $1 trillion is expected to be invested in fossil fuels. Annual clean energy investment is expected to rise by 24% between 2021 and 2023, driven by renewables and electric vehicles, compared with a 15% rise in fossil fuel investment over the same period.
Nearly $700 billion of investment is expected for renewable energy generation. Solar is the star performer with more than $1 billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023. IEA expects solar investment to total $380 billion for the year as a whole, edging this spending above upstream oil for the first time.
Along with wholesale move toward clean generation is a global shift toward electrification. Global heat pump sales are growing at double-digit annual growth rates since 2021, and electric vehicles are expected to leap one-third this year after already undergoing a landmark year of growth in 2021.
China is expected to continue as the global frontrunner in clean energy investment, with increased spending over $170 billion. The nation is followed by the European Union, with about $150 billion in increased investment, and the United States, adding about $100 billion in increased investment. Costs for clean energy edged higher in 2022, but pressures are easing in 2023, and mature clean technologies remain very cost-competitive in today’s fuel-price environment, said IEA.
China alone added over 100 GW of solar PV capacity in 2022, almost 70% higher than in 2021, and annual installations increased by 40% or more in Europe, India and Brazil, despite inflation and supply chain issues.
“While solar deployment has been increasing year-on-year, the project pipeline for some other technologies has been less reliable,” said the report. “Investment in wind power has varied year-on-year in key markets in response to changing policy circumstances. Nuclear investment is rising but hydropower, a key low-emission source of power market flexibility, has been on a downward trend.”
This investment is gaining momentum due to a powerful alignment of costs, climate, and energy security goals and industrial strategies. The recovery from the slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to the global energy crisis have provided a significant boost to clean energy investment, said IEA.
While clean technology investments are rising worldwide, work needs to be done, especially in developing economies, said IEA. Many nations are being held back by higher interest rates, unclear policy frameworks and market designs, weak grid infrastructure, financially strained utilities, and a high cost of capital. However, IEA notes that dynamic investments in solar in India, Brazil, and the Middle East are driving forward these markets.
To help address some of the above-listed headwinds, the IEA release a new report entitled Scaling Up Private Finance for Clean Energy in Emerging and Developing Economies on June 22.
Fossil fuel producers made record profits in 2022, though much of this cash flow has gone to dividends, share buybacks, and debt repayment, rather than reinvestment back into traditional supply. IEA said that while a shift to renewables is underway, fossil fuels are expected to continue to drive growth – with oil and gas spending expected to rise 7% this year. Coal demand still remains high in some markets, and the shift from these assets may not be occurring fast enough, as coal investment is pacing to be six times above what IEA envisions for its 2030 Net Zero Scenario.
IEA notes that clean energy among major oil and gas producers is continuing to rise, with solar and wind holding a similar share. Clean energy investment by these fossil fuels companies doubled in 2022 to about $20 billion. This investment represents about 4% of upstream capital and 0.5% of net income. European oil majors are outpacing U.S. oil majors considerably in this category, said IEA.
In the United States, demand to adopt solar is strong. In its 2023 Solar Snapshot report, Aurora Solar reported that 45% of solar professionals reported increased demand as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, with another 40% expecting to see increased demand soon, and 70% noted their business grew in size. Nearly 77% of homeowners either have solar or are interested in purchasing it, said Aurora Solar.
In its 2021 World Energy Outlook report, IEA noted that the world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs. This year, it said, “this picture is starting to change: global energy investment is picking up, and the rise in clean energy investment since 2021 is leading the way, outpacing the increase in fossil fuel investment by almost three to-one.”
“If [clean energy investment] continues to grow at the rate seen since 2021, then aggregate spending in 2030 on low-emission power, grids and storage, and end-use electrification would exceed the levels required to meet the world’s announced climate pledges. For some technologies, notably solar, [investment] would match the investment required to get on track for a 1.5°C stabilization in global average temperatures,” said IEA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/30/clearway-enel-executives-propose-three-ways-to-fix-utility-scale-interconnection/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 30, 2023","Clearway, Enel executives propose three ways to fix utility-scale interconnection","The “efficient process solution” to interconnecting large-scale renewables and storage “is a combination of the ‘connect and manage’ interconnection approach with comprehensive regional transmission planning,” said Hannah Muller, head of markets and policy at Clearway Energy Group, on a webinar hosted by Advanced Energy United.
Greg Geller, vice president and head of regulatory affairs for Enel North America, said on the webinar that he also favors both approaches, and explained their advantages.
Advanced Energy United presented the webinar as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is completing work on a rule aiming to increase the speed and reduce the costs of interconnecting utility-scale renewable and storage projects. Muller and Geller focused their recommendations on further improvements that could be instituted after FERC issues its rule.
Explaining the “connect and manage” approach, Geller said “assume you have a 200 MW project.” Some transmission system operators, he said, study projects based on how they will be dispatched “in real time. And if in real time that project would cause a constraint” if 200 MW were dispatched, a “connect and manage” approach would instead dispatch 100 MW for the time period needed.
The “connect and manage” approach focuses interconnection studies on more local upgrades, both executives noted.
Geller said the approach would bypass problems documented in a case study his firm prepared of a planned 300 MW wind farm. For that project, the grid operator’s interconnection study found that “a few megawatts were flowing onto the grid 1,000 miles away,” and as a result, the project and several others were assigned several upgrades. “We all became interdependent on one another. When one of those projects withdrew, a restudy had to happen. And this kept happening. It’s a vicious cycle.”
Texas grid operator ERCOT uses an approach similar to “connect and manage,” and is moving quickly to interconnect new renewable generation.
Geller added that comprehensive regional transmission planning is better than building transmission “piece by piece” through the interconnection process. He cited two studies by grid operator PJM Interconnection on the onshore costs of connecting offshore wind to the PJM grid. The first study, assuming new transmission was planned through interconnection studies, identified onshore costs of $6.4 billion for 15.5 GW of offshore wind, but the other found that if transmission were planned all at once, nearly five times the wind capacity (75 GW) could be interconnected with just half of the onshore costs ($3.2 billion).
Systematic transmission planning within grid regions has been conducted by midcontinent grid operator MISO and California grid operator CAISO.
Automation
Grid operators and utilities “are working hard to staff up to get interconnection studies done,” said Muller. “The studies are labor-intensive. We hear it’s hard to find qualified engineers, we hear the complaints that our industry is hiring those engineers away. That is true. We are guilty of that. It’s because this clean energy transition is in high demand.”
“We know it’s hard, and we can do it,” Muller said. “We need a little more ambition, at a number of levels.” She said staffing plus new tools and automation can help speed interconnection studies, pointing to funding from the U.S. Department of Energy for technical assistance, fellowships, and engineering school partnerships, as well as a number of automation options.
“There’s a lot of promise in automation,” said Muller, discussing a list of automation suggestions made by commenters on FERC’s draft interconnection rule. She presented a slide showing that interconnection study processes by transmission system operators could involve “automated study model construction from online data submission, automated cluster studies (with solutions to be reviewed by transmission system operators), and automated drafting of study reports.” Automation could also improve application quality and reduce customer service burdens, she said.
Xing Wang, an executive with Amazon Web Services, said last year that artificial intelligence could enable faster and more accurate modeling for interconnection studies.
Tesla said last year in comments on FERC’s proposed interconnection rule that the company could estimate a project’s interconnection costs in two weeks if it had access to grid models.
Solutions mindset
To make further progress on interconnection, “we need to convene” the utilities, developers and transmission system operators, said Geller, and “come with a solutions oriented mindset. It needs to happen really quickly.”
“Advanced Energy United is very interested in having that conversation,” said Caitlin Marquis, the group’s managing director for wholesale markets and the webinar’s moderator, “with anyone listening who would like to be a part of it.” Without “significant reform,” she said, the interconnection process “will only continue to get slower and more expensive.”
The Department of Energy’s i2X initiative, which also convenes interested parties, set a draft goal last December to reduce interconnection schedules and costs for large-scale renewable and storage projects by 50% within five years.
The solar and storage industries provided substantial input to FERC last year as the commission began developing its interconnection rule.
Research
Abe Silverman, managing director of a Columbia University program on non-technical barriers to the clean energy transition, also spoke on the webinar and described two research projects he is conducting. The first will examine why many renewables and storage projects that have completed the interconnection study process and received an interconnection agreement still drop out at that stage. His second study will address “What should FERC do next?”—that is, after FERC issues its forthcoming rule on interconnection.

A recent pv magazine USA webinar session revealed that hail risk mitigation is a common problem in the “Hail Alley,” a broad region encompassing around six states from the Dakotas to Texas, which often experience five or more days each year of catastrophic hail. Climate change has created patterns of irregularity as extreme weather increasingly crops up in regions bordering hail-prone regions.
Hail events have historically posed a considerable risk for utility solar, with weather instances creating up to $100 million in module damage at large projects located in states like Texas, where hail stones the size of baseballs can pummel skyward facing modules.
Indji Systems, a Los Angeles-based meteorological software, has just launched the Indji Watch, a hail detection software-as-a-service platform specifically for solar developers which allows end users to see and trace hail events using a predictive, real-time data framework.
The software system allows solar and utility siting stakeholders to operations and maintenance professionals to implement effective defensive measures and safeguard their investments for the long haul.
Indji Watch automatically detects early threats and delivers notifications through its dashboard. With updates on potential hail threats delivered up to the time of storm impacts, the weather watch allows companies to proactively prepare for significant events, fostering collaboration and coordinated decision-making across the enterprise. By prioritizing “early awareness,” Indji Systems can help mitigate risk by protecting solar sites.
The Indji Watch identifies storm paths and their proximity to solar asset footprints as threats become imminent, enabling customers to take defensive measures. The warning allows solar O&M and onsite operators time to “stow,” a term used to angle the solar panels away from oncoming hailstorms to lessen the direct impact and potential damage to the crystalline panels.
The system provides weather alerts within one hour of impact. Indji Watch’s customizable thresholds also allow for alerts tailored to the specific panel technology deployed at each site.
“This new release further solidifies our position as the go-to solution for effective risk mitigation, and demonstrates our commitment to delivering unparalleled value to our customers,” said Adam Hender, chief executive officer of Indji Systems.
Founded in 2004, Indji Systems is an independent software company with operations in California and Australia. The company has designed the Indji Watch and GeoSamba mapping software which helps asset owners make real-time decisions about power and infrastructure assets.
The company received its first patent for Indji Watch in October 2018 for environmental threat monitoring and alert software. This covered the company’s cloud-based service with dynamic modeling of assets and hazards from sensor networks, the algorithms for threat relationships between weather pattern and end users, and real-time monitoring alerts.
The company’s weather tracking dashboard is used by utilities Xcel Energy, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, and Southern California Edison, while the Indji Watch has been also tested at a Longroad Energy utility solar site, according to its website.

During an interview with investment bank Roth MKM, the company’s chief executive officer Gunter Erfurt suggested that its interest in domestic manufacturing had significantly increased following new guidance on the domestic content requirement.
The company said it plans to manufacture 2 GW per year of solar cells for the Goodyear, Arizona facility at the its current factory locations in Thalheim and Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany. Erfurt indicated that Meyer Burger had secured enough manufacturing space in the German “solar valley” to reach a manufacturing capacity of up to 15 GW annually.
However, following the release of the Internal Revenue Service’s domestic content guidance on May 12, the company started looking for space to manufacture solar cells near the Arizona facility. Erfurt stated that, while there are no explicit timelines, the sooner they begin production in the U.S., the better.
Phillip Shen, managing director at Roth MKM, suggested that without a domestically manufactured solar cell it would be very hard to meet the 40% requirement. When Shen asked if Meyer Burger believed the same, Erfurt suggested they did.
Meyer Burger reached out to Loan Programs Office at the Department of Energy (DOE). Erfurt noted that the DOE aims to stimulate more solar cell manufacturing and might potentially fund the construction of a solar cell facility.
The company currently manufactures about 800,000 solar cells per day, which fills approximately 6,000 solar modules. Once the company completes its 1.4 GW/year expansion, it’ll reach an output of about 10,000 modules per day.
As for funding these manufacturing facilities, Erfurt stated the company had adequate resources to achieve its 3.4 GW manufacturing capacity goal, which includes the aforementioned 2 GW of solar cell manufacturing that will be needed in the near future.
pv magazine USA has highlighted Meyer Burger’s deep financial ties with its largest solar panel customers. For instance, as part of a 3.75 GW (or larger) deal, DE Shaw Renewable Investments will make a significant annual down payment that will be used as working capital for purchasing wafers, glass, aluminum, silver, and other components.
As part of this transaction, it was also noted that the price of wafers floated, mirroring the price fluctuations of the actual modules purchased. Wafer prices have been on a downward trend in the solar industry, with Longi Solar registering a 31% price drop on May 29, 2023.
Erfurt also stated that deals with Ikea and a third, yet-to-be-named company, with whom Meyer Burger has already signed an offtake agreement, provide additional capital for the construction of their facilities.
Shen also asked Erfurt about potential contracts for the Goodyear facility’s production capacity. Erfurt clarified that the factory’s residential and small commercial panel line hadn’t yet made any agreements, because it didn’t align with how the distributors usually buy products. Shen, who also studies these groups as potential investments, proposed that residential installation firms Sunrun and Sunnova might be interested in Meyer Burger’s products, as they meet domestic content approval.
When Shen asked Erfurt if Meyer Burger was in talks with either of these residential companies about module offtake agreements, Erfurt confirmed that they were in discussions.
As a final note, Erfurt reiterated Meyer Burger’s future strategy: a complete shift to producing only glass glass solar modules. He confidently cited their laboratory tests, which show “zero degradation.”

Daikin Applied Americas, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based unit of Japan-based Daikin Industries, has released an air-to-water heat pump for new or retrofit commercial rooftop applications such as office buildings, schools, and commercial retail spaces.
“The Trailblazer HP is an air-to-water heat pump chiller that provides a reversing function that allows the chiller to switch between cooling and heating modes based on the temperature requirements of the space or process being conditioned,” Daikin said in a statement.
The device has a heating capacity of 91.2 kW and a cooling capacity of 23.58 tons. Its coefficient of performance (COP) in heating mode is 3.12 and the seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) is 3.31.
The heat pump measures 70.8 inches x 47 inches x 111.25 inches and weighs 2,010.6 pounds.
“This heat pump range is the result of careful design, aimed to optimize the energy efficiency of the unit, with the objective of bringing down operating costs and improving installation profitability, effectiveness, and economical management,” Daikin said in a data sheet. “The heat pump features high efficiency scroll compressors, large condenser coil surface area for maximum heat transfer and low discharge pressure, continuous fan speed modulation, and a brazed plate evaporator with low refrigerant pressure drops.”
Scroll compressors work in a circular motion, as opposed to up-and-down piston compressors. The compressors are connected in tandem on a single refrigerating circuit and are fitted on rubber antivibration mounts and complete with oil charge, according to Daikin.
The device uses R410A as the refrigerant, with a global warming potential (GWP) of 2,088.
Daikin Applied Americas sells products globally.

The manufacturer said the new product is based on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells, M10 wafers and high-performance hybrid passivity (HPDC) dual junction technology.
“The backside of the cell features high and low junctions, optimized film design, and advanced deposition techniques to achieve remarkable full-area passivation with minimal parasitic absorption,” the company explained. “On the front side, the cell is applied with a local low-resistance contact layer that enhances cell efficiency. Additionally, both the front and back sides incorporate upgraded antireflection and low-recombination films, as well as metallization solutions, for superior performance.”
The new product measures 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and has a weight of 31.8 kg. It features 2.0 mm dual glass, an anodized aluminum frame, and an IP68 rating. The temperature coefficient is -0.28% per C.
The new series comes in seven versions, with power outputs between 560 W and 590 W. The power conversion efficiency ranges between 21.7% and 22.8%. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 50.89 V to 51.63 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.89 A and 14.1 38.
The panels can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V. The company offers a 12-year product guarantee and 30-year power output guarantee for 88.18% of the initial yield.
“Longi’s industry-leading product life cycle standards also guarantee the reliability of Hi-MO 7. Hi-MO 7 effectively ensures its reliability throughout its life cycle with optimized designs such as high-quality monocrystalline silicon wafers, customized cell paste, optimized module encapsulation film system, SMBB high-precision interconnection, and high-reliability automatic welding of junction boxes,” the manufacturer stated.
“The application of digitalized manufacturing and quality control platforms, especially intelligent AI detection technology, further guarantees the product quality of Hi-MO 7. Therefore, Hi-MO 7 provides a linear power warranty of not more than 0.38%, bringing customers robust value and efficient returns beyond expectations,” the company added.
