https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/31/arctech-launches-skywings-a-dual-row-single-axis-solar-tracker/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 31, 2022","Arctech launches SkyWings, a dual-row single-axis solar tracker","Arctech, a global provider of tracking, racking, and buildings integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), announced it has launched its latest solar tracking solution, called SkyWings. The tracker is a dual-row tracker designed with bidirectional slew drives and a multi-point drive mechanism.
The product combines the advantages of dual row solar trackers and is compatible with undulating terrain with high rigidity enabled by a multi-point drive design. The patented bidirectional slew drives allow two rows to move in synchronicity.
The undulation tolerance of adjacent rows has increased to 15% in both East/West and North/South directions. The modular design allows flexibility in plant layout design, accommodating more PV modules than conventional trackers in the same conditions, said Arctech.
SkyWings incorporates a multi-point drive mechanism and specially designed torque tube-the patented triple D torque tube, allowing for stowing in a horizontal position with the highest stability.
The rack allows modules to be stowed flat, which prevents cracking and delamination, particularly in newer large-format modules. SkyWings only starts stowing at 22m/s, which generates up to 2% more energy yield per year, leading to a lower levelized cost of energy.
The post span can be extended by 10 meters, which the company said can bring down installation costs by up to 20% and the entire engineering, procurement, and construction expenditure by up to 2%, compared to projects utilizing traditional 1P trackers.
The trackers are controlled by second-generation AI-assisted algorithms, calculating optimum tilt in various weather conditions and topographies. Arctech said the real-time shading avoidance can boost production by 8%.
In desert environments, the SkyWing tracker can be paired with Artech’s cleaning robot, SkyWe.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/31/doe-funds-11-million-battery-research-center-at-university-of-michigan/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 31, 2022",DOE funds $11 million battery research center at University of Michigan,"The new research center will focus on the development of advanced batteries and fuel cells for electric vehicles.
The University of Michigan and eight partner institutions will explore the use of ceramic ion conductors as replacements for the traditional liquid or polymer electrolytes in common lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and in flow cells for storing renewable energy in the grid. The $10.95 million four-year grant establishes a Department of Energy research facility called the ‘Mechano-chemical Understanding of Solid Ion Conductors’ (MUSIC). University of Michigan established the program in 2009, and it is designed to “tackle the toughest scientific challenges preventing advances in energy technologies.”
“The recent discovery of ceramic ion conductors that simultaneously exhibit unprecedented performance and stability has the potential to change the electrochemical energy storage technology landscape,” said Jeff Sakamoto, professor of mechanical engineering at University of Michigan and director of the new center.
Partner institutions in MUSIC include Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas, Austin, Northwestern University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Princeton University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Purdue University.
The DOE center’s work will focus on understanding mechanical and chemical phenomena that affect advanced battery designs. Ceramic ion conductors could help advanced batteries pack more power than lithium-ion batteries of the same size. However, when these new conductors are in contact with other components, new and unusual behaviors arise from that blend of mechanical, electrical and chemical interactions.

“Our new center seeks to bridge fundamental knowledge gaps related to mechano-chemistry with a diverse group of researchers who come from disparate fields of study,” Sakamoto said.
Ceramic ion conductors represent one of those advances, and MUSIC is charged with performing the basic science needed to explore their potential impact on a variety of technologies. Those include long-duration energy storage and hydrogen fuel cells.
“We have decades of fundamental research into ion conduction in ceramics to work with, and we’re applying that knowledge towards emerging applications such as batteries and fuel cells,” said Neil Dasgupta, MUSIC’s deputy director and an associate professor of mechanical engineering at University of Michigan.
“However, critical barriers remain before widespread commercialization can be realized—many of which center around the unique mechanical properties that emerge at solid-solid interfaces in electrochemical cells. An overarching goal of MUSIC is to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of how mechanical stresses and strains interact with electrochemistry, which will inform future efforts to scale-up and accelerate commercialization of next-generation energy storage technology,” he added.
While lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous, they come with safety issues as they typically use flammable liquid electrolytes to shuttle ions back and forth between the cathode and anode in a cell. In addition to greater energy density, replacing those liquid electrolytes with ceramic ion conductors has the potential for improved safety. Another focus of study is to look at manufacturing techniques with an eye toward lowering the cost of batteries. They will also examine how the introduction of ceramic ion conductors impacts degradation in lithium metal, sodium metal and other solid state configurations.
MUSIC will be the latest addition to University of Michigan’s expanding portfolio of research projects tied to the future of mobility. In July, the State of Michigan approved a budget that included $130 million for a new EV center led by Michigan Engineering. And University of Michigan is already home to the Walter E. Lay Auto Lab, Mcity autonomous vehicle testing facility, the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and is a founding partner of the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti.
“Michigan continues to be at the center of mobility, and U-M is a critical hub where all of the players—automakers, legislators, regulators, academics and researchers—interact and examine the issues at play,” said Alec D. Gallimore, the Robert J. Vlasic Dean of Engineering.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/31/california-lawmakers-pass-equitable-community-solar-bill/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 31, 2022",California lawmakers pass equitable community solar bill,"The California State Legislature passed AB 2316, the Community Renewable Energy Act, a bill that creates a community renewable energy program, including community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes. 
Across the United States, solar owners have an average income 58% higher than the median income in their county. The new program is aimed at expanding access while simultaneously strengthening California’s grid. The bill now heads to Governor Newsom’s desk, where he will have until September 30 to act on the bill. 
Community solar projects are often smaller than utility-scale facilities, and are ideally built on landfills, former industrial sites, and other brownfield locations. Customers typically subscribe to a share of energy produced by the local clean energy project, accessing lower bills and reducing their carbon footprint. 
Without the ability to purchase and install solar directly on a rented residence, community solar offers a pathway to the 45% of Californians who rent their homes, and the 70% of renters who are considered low-income. 
The Biden Administration set a goal this year to sign up 5 million community solar households, achieving $1 billion in bill savings by 2025. The Department of Energy (DOE) reports that by year’s end 2020, about 3 GW of community solar in the United States was active, enough to power about 600,000 homes. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW by 2025. DOE estimates customers enrolling in community solar will save an average of about 20% on energy bills. 
The Community Renewable Energy Act was sponsored by the Coalition for Community Solar Access, and met with strong support from groups like SEIA, GRID Alternatives, Vote Solar, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and more. Notably, investor-owned utilities, which serve over 75% of the electricity usage in the state, opposed the bill. Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Edison all signed on in opposition to the bill. 
AB 2316 provisions include: 
“Californians are struggling with high energy and housing costs more than ever. Community solar plus storage can put money back in their pockets while fighting climate change and building a more reliable power grid,” said Susannah Churchill, deputy program director, West at Vote Solar. “By signing this bill, Governor Newsom can ensure California leads the nation in equalizing clean energy access among families with low incomes while accessing billions in federal funds to supercharge this long overdue change.”

From pv magazine global
Ada Li, head of Latin America at Sungrow, told pv magazine that the Chinese inverter manufacturer is carefully evaluating the possibility of opening a new factory outside of China. Such a factory would assemble inverters, with parts imported from China.
Separately, Sungrow said it has reached 9 GW of total delivered capacity to South America, with 6 GW of the total delivered to Brazil alone. It said about 3 GW in Brazil were delivered for utility-scale PV projects, with central inverters accounting for a 70% share of the market, and string inverters accounting for the remainder.
“We think that in the next five years Brazil will continue to be in the top five of PV markets worldwide. The biggest growth will be in distribution generation, for the residential segment,” said Li.
For Sungrow, financing is still the most challenging aspect of working in the Brazilian PV market.
“We see one restriction for demand – not so much module prices, but bank interest rates here in Brazil,” Li said. “This is the main issue.”
Brazil’s baseline interest rate currently sits at 13.75%, leaving its PV market sensitive to the capex of solar projects. Public and private credit lines with more attractive interest rates have been created to incentivize the installation of solar.
Beyond Brazil, Sungrow is currently looking at Chile for utility-scale storage, and Mexico for commercial and industrial (C&I).
*This article has been amended. The location of the factory was initially indicated by the company as North America, but it has since specified it is evaluating locations outside of China.
