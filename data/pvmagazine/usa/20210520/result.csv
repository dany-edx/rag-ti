The net metering regime for current solar customers will be extended through 2025 or 2029, depending on when customers switched to solar. At the end of that period, customers can continue with the current setup at 2025 or 2029 retail rates, or switch to the new program. Key elements of the new program include time-of-use rates and rebates for smart thermostats, both of which SEIA said better align customer behavior with electricity system needs.
Regulators unanimously approved the net metering stipulation agreed to by Duke Energy Carolinas; Duke Energy Progress; North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association; Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and Upstate Forever; and Vote Solar.
In late April, regulators unanimously approved a bid to keep net metering in place while gradually transitioning to Dominion Energy’s existing time-of-use rate schedule for customers. The recommended action was petitioned for by both local solar advocates and consumer choice advocacy groups.
In accepting the proposal, regulators rejected Dominion’s apprach which would have stuck residential solar customers with a fixed monthly rate and a monthly payment based on the size of their rooftop system. Because of those two components, the average South Carolina solar homeowner would have seen their cost savings shrink by 60%.
Multiple advocacy groups claimed that Dominion’s proposal would have slowed the state’s rooftop solar market to a crawl.
In its most recent net metering decision, regulators agreed to a stipulation includes a cap on solar applications from June through the end of 2021 equal to 1.2 MW for Duke Energy Carolinas and 300 kW for Duke Energy Progress per month. If the monthly cap is reached and a customer wants to install solar under an interim rider through 2029, the customer will need to withdraw its application and submit it again the next month. Regulators warned, however, there is no assurance that capacity will be available.
Both utilities will offer interim riders to residential customers whose applications are received from June 1 through December 31. Those customers will remain on their existing rate schedule until May 31, 2029, and will be placed on a new Net Energy Metering (NEM) rider. That new rider will include monthly netting with net excess energy credited at avoided cost, and non-by passable charges for costs not directly related to providing electric service for each applicant.
The stipulation also said that the permanent tariff for residential customer-generators is a Critical Peak Pricing Time of Use Tariff. The permanent tariff includes, among other provisions:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/20/wisconsin-regulators-approve-solar-project-despite-local-land-use-concerns/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WISCONSIN",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 20, 2021",Wisconsin regulators approve solar project despite local land use concerns,"Wisconsin regulators approved construction for one of the largest planned solar installations in the state, the 150 MW Onion River solar project, set to be located in Sheboygan County. Approval came despite vocal protests from nearby residents.
The project is set to be constructed in Holland, just south of Green Bay, and is one of six plants planned for construction by Alliant Energy as part of its plan to replace coal-fired plants with renewable energy.
Residents voiced concerns over the use of crop land, potential loss of property values, and  worries over the process by which developers secured leases before seeking regulatory approval.
The Onion River solar project was initially approved by regulators on April 22, along with the 200 MW Grant County Solar project; the 150 MW Wood County Solar project; the 75 MW Crawfish River Solar project in Jefferson County; the 50 MW North Rock Solar project in Rock County; and the 50 MW Richland County Solar project.The estimated total cost of the solar projects is $887 million. Regulators said that Alliant’s customers will see savings of around $127 million through the retirement of higher-cost coal-fired generation. Onion River is expected to generate $600,000 a year in local government revenue over the project’s 30-year lifespan.
The six projects are the first phase in Alliant’s plans to add nearly 1,100 MW of solar capacity by 2024, which also includes an application, filed last month, to acquire an additional six solar farms for about $515 million. Alliant plans to retire its two remaining coal plants by 2025, as it seeks to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030. The company has said that replacing coal plants with up to 1,000 MW of solar capacity can avoid up to $6.5 billion in additional costs over the next 35 years.
Alliant’s renewable plans mark a shift in the state’s generation philosophy, as only 442 MW of solar have been installed in Wisconsin thus far. In addition to Alliant, We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service have filed plans with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for the Darien Solar Energy Center, a 325 MW solar+storage project to be built in Rock and Walworth counties in the southeast part of the state.

The plan offers a set of actions aimed at putting the Northwest on a path to build a renewable hydrogen production sector.
The plan makes two calls to action. First, it calls to “lead with projects” that produce renewable hydrogen and deliver it to customers. Second, it calls for creation of a 10-year roadmap to lay out renewable hydrogen’s future role and steps to get there.
The organizations involved in developing the plan said they are already taking action to advance renewable hydrogen’s deployment. For example:

Solar Systems, a Canadian solar components distributor, has become a distributor for Polar Racking Inc., a Canadian manufacturer of solar PV mounting systems.
Following the announcement of the partnership, BayWa r.e. will immediately add access to Polar Racking’s PRU-D ground mount product line to its line card and web store, available in Canada. According to both parties, Polar’s PRU-D line was chosen due to it being a quickly deployable ground mount solution that is capable of installing in Canada’s diverse and potentially difficult ground and climatic conditions.
Polar’s PRU fixed-tilt racking system is engineered to handle heavy loads from wind, slopes, and a wide range of variable ground conditions.
Excelling in extreme weather has been one of Polar’s biggest selling points, with Polar  chosen by BMR Energy as its racking and foundation supplier and mechanical installer as part of a re-build of the 6.4 megawatt Donoe Solar Farm in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The original Donoe Solar Farm was heavily damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017, and the new system will likely face its share of extreme weather events.

The project is being built and will be owned and operated by Primergy Solar.
The agreement calls for nearly 1.8 million modules to be supplied over a four-quarter period starting in the second quarter of 2022; project completion is planned by the end of 2023.
The Gemini Project is a 690 MWac solar photovoltaic plus a 380 MW/1,400 MWh battery energy storage project.
The Gemini project will be one of the largest operational solar power system in the U.S. when completed. It is expected to provide a foundation to support the start-up and initial operation of Maxeon’s new Performance line module capacity for the U.S. solar power market. Using large-format G12 mono-PERC solar cells manufactured in Malaysia, and module assembly in Mexicali, Mexico, this project is expected to take a significant portion of the expected output of Maxeon’s new capacity during the first year of operation.
EPC firm Burns & McDonnell said it recently completed construction of CenterPoint Energy’s 50 MW utility-scale solar project near the Ohio River in southern Indiana.
The Troy Solar power plant uses First Solar 440-W thin-film photovoltaic modules and consists of approximately 150,000 solar panels distributed across 300 acres. Modules are mounted on a NEXTracker single-axis tracker enabling the modules to track with the sun to maximize energy generation.
Burns & McDonnell was hired after the project’s first engineer-procure-construct (EPC) contractor exited the market. The company provided engineering, detailed electrical, civil and structural design, procurement specifications, and construction execution services.
Fourth Wave Energy said that GeoSolar Technologies filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the spin-off of GST from Fourth Wave. Following the spin-off, GST and Fourth Wave will be two separate and independent public companies.
As part of the spin-off agreement, GST received all commercial rights to the GeoSolar Plus technology and patents in exchange for the issuance of around one share of GST common stock for each outstanding common share of Fourth Wave.
The GeoSolar Plus system is designed to reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions in residences and commercial buildings. It is made up of a number of components including solar/PV and geothermal and is designed to produce more energy than it produces with no carbon.
Clean energy investment firm Sunwealth announced a $2.9 million loan from Calvert Impact Capital. Sunwealth said it will use the financing, together with $4.3 million in tax equity investment from private investors, to support 18 solar projects on the rooftops and parking lots of nonprofit organizations, multi-family apartment buildings, houses of worship, and commercial office buildings in communities underserved by traditional renewable energy financing.
The community-based solar projects will generate enough electricity to power over 300 homes annually, and will provide customers with $3.8 million in lifetime energy savings. The loan will also help catalyze additional investment in Sunwealth’s solar financing model.
Sunwealth supports solar projects ranging in size from 5 kW to 1 MW on building rooftops and parking lots. It partners with local solar developers and installers to design and construct these projects, which deliver solar access and long-term energy savings to building owners and to low- and moderate-income households through community shared solar agreements..
One of projects is a 37 kW installation on the roof of a multifamily apartment building owned by Fifth Avenue Committee, a nonprofit community development corporation in Brooklyn, New York. Installed by Brooklyn-based Solar Energy Systems, the system will provide building tenants with $240 in annual energy savings.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/20/canadian-solar-sees-exponential-growth-in-energy-storage-warns-of-possible-project-delays-as-prices-spike/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 20, 2021","Canadian Solar sees ‘exponential’ growth in energy storage, warns of possible project delays as prices spike","Canadian Solar said its first quarter 2021 results included $1.1 billion in revenue, a 17.9% gross margin, and $23 million in net income.
For the quarter, net income rose to $0.36 per diluted share, up from $0.11 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, some of which it used to stockpile materials both to meet customer demand and to lessen the impact of rising raw material costs.
In announcing the results, Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO, said that demand for battery energy storage systems is growing “at an exponential rate.”
The company said that virtually all its solar power projects under development can co-host energy storage facilities and have done so during the first quarter. The approach helped the company nearly double its energy storage pipeline to almost 17 GWh during the quarter.
“By co-hosting energy storage facilities with solar power plants on the same piece of land and using the same interconnection point, the company expects to significantly enhance the value of its assets under development,” it said.
The company also reported a “challenging quarter” with cost inflation driven by continued higher raw material and transportation costs, and with what it said were unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. It said the price of polysilicon has tripled over the past 12 months. The company mitigated the impact in part by raising module prices, which it said saw a “near double-digit percentage increase” compared to the fourth quarter. The company also said it prioritized margins ahead of shipment volumes.
And while Canadian Solar said that underlying demand for solar energy “remains strong” driven by public and private sector targets, it noted that “increasing price elasticity of demand” is elevating the prospect that “certain utility-scale projects may be delayed.”
That assessment echoed a mid-May research note from Roth Capital Advisors, which warned clients that current price pressures could delay as much as 15% of planned 2021 utility scale solar development. Roth Capital’s Philip Shen said that U.S. utility scale module pricing six months ago for delivery in the third quarter of 2022 was on the order of $0.25 per Watt freight on board (FOB), or $0.27/W delivered duty paid (DDP).
Shen pegged more recent pricing at $0.28/W FOB and as high as $0.32/W DDP. And with unlevered internal rates of return as low as 4-8% and levered IRRs of between 13-18%, “there is not much room to absorb input cost inflation.”
Looking ahead to the second quarter, Canadian Solar said it expects total module shipments to be in the range of 3.5 GW to 3.7 GW, including roughly 80 MW of module shipments to its own projects. Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 9.5% and 10.5%.
The company also reiterated its full-year 2021 module shipment guidance of 18 GW to 20 GW and project sales guidance of 1.8 GW to 2.3 GW. The company introduced 2021 total battery storage shipment guidance of 810 MWh to 860 MWh. Total revenue guidance for 2021 is expected to be in the range of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion.
Currently, the company has around 500 MW of projects in operation, more than 5 GW of projects under construction or in backlog (late-stage), and another 15 GW of projects in the pipeline (mid- to early- stage).
