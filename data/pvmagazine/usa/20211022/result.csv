The U.S. solar industry employed about 231,000 people, down 6.7% from the 240,000 workers in 2019.
The figures were reported by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and show that Covid-19 had a damaging impact on the industry. A return to job growth is expected in the coming years.
The IRENA report, citing figures from the 2021 National Jobs Census, found in the U.S., more than 40% of 2020 installations took place in the final quarter, as lockdowns were loosened and as customers sought to qualify for the federal solar investment tax credit. The credit had originally been scheduled to step-down this year, so demand to complete projects before the end of 2020 spiked.
The report also found that U.S. solar jobs are better paid than the national median wage of $19.14 an hour. Solar jobs paid a median $24.48 an hour, but that was lower than nuclear ($39.19) and fossil fuels (roughly $30).
About 85% of solar jobs worldwide were from the top 10 countries. China took the top spot at 2.3 million jobs, followed by the U.S., and Japan. The Americas had an 8.8% share of global solar jobs.

About 5% of the global output of polysilicon, a critical material in the manufacture of the most common solar module type, was attributed to the U.S.
North America had a 2% share in the global production of mono- and polysilicon modules; by contrast,  Asia-based producers contributed 95% of the world’s supply.
While U.S. electricity use fell 3.8% in 2020 due to Covid-19 lockdowns, generation from solar and wind grew 15%. Record PV capacity was added, with 14.9 GW deployed. That was up from 7.5 GW in 2019.
Though deployments were up overall, the Solar Energy Industries Association said small- and medium sized installers struggled because the cash sales they rely on declined during the COVID-19 recession.
Solar jobs in the U.S. are down 11% from the peak in 2016. In addition to Covid-19 related job losses, an increase in workforce productivity accounted for some of the loss. IRENA measured a 19% productivity increase in the residential sector, and 32% in utility-scale solar since 2010.
The 155,000 installation and construction jobs made up the bulk of U.S. solar employment, around two-thirds of the total. Manufacturing employed 31,000. The share of women in the workforce rose from 26% to 30% in 2020 (compared to 47% economy-wide). And, about 10% of solar workers were unionized.
Solar workforce training programs continue to arise in the U.S. A recent example came from Colorado, where a bill diverted $15 million to support coal-dependent workers transitioning to clean-energy jobs. Around $7 million was directly dedicated to apprenticeship and training programs for workers and their families.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/22/states-choosing-smart-inverter-settings-could-follow-hawaiis-lead/,"OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,POLICY,HAWAII",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 22, 2021",States choosing smart inverter settings could follow Hawaii’s lead,"Thanks to Hawaii’s smart inverter settings, most customers can “instantly interconnect” new solar despite high levels of solar already on distribution circuits. That’s according to Steven Rymsha, policy director for grid solutions at Sunrun.
He said that other states considering smart inverters “need to understand what Hawaii has achieved” through smart inverter functions, in terms of increased hosting capacity, deferral of new infrastructure, and consumer protection.
“People still don’t believe the amount of saturation” of distributed solar in Hawaii, Rymsha said in an interview. He said that distributed solar represents about 18% of generation in Hawaiian Electric’s service area, or around half of the utility’s renewable generation.

Twelve states besides Hawaii and California are evaluating smart inverter standards.

The Hawaii Solar Energy Association, utility Hawaiian Electric, and others have proposed blanket activation of volt-watt alongside volt-var, combined with consumer protection measures for rare cases where volt-watt causes excessive curtailment. California already uses both volt-var and volt-watt.
Twelve states besides Hawaii and California are evaluating smart inverter standards: Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Kentucky, North Carolina, Maryland, New York, and Massachusetts, plus Washington, D.C.
Following a 10-year career with Hawaii utilities and now working on state policy for Sunrun, Rymsha said that when a state begins discussing smart inverter settings, utilities say “‘We can’t have one common setting like California and Hawaii, that’s not going to work for us.’ They seem to be stuck in this mode of analyzing.” In one state, he said, the smart inverter discussion has been going on for two years “and we have nothing to show for it.”

In one state, he said, the smart inverter discussion has been going on for two years “and we have nothing to show for it.”

Rymsha said he is concerned about “how much wasted infrastructure” will be built in other states as a result of delays in choosing smart inverter settings. He said he empathized with utility staff with whom he interacts, and said that “everyone’s scrambling for time, everyone’s delayed.” Even so, “they’re imposing requirements on interconnection that just make the processes clunkier, harder, longer.”
Rymsha said that a decade ago, when he worked at Kauai island’s utility, “we were trying to figure out” how smart inverter functions were going to work. Six years ago, when he left Hawaiian Electric, “interconnection was really challenging, as we were just policing thresholds.” Now, he says smart inverters are “working fabulously, they’re working incredibly.”
Solar association leaders in Hawaii and California recently echoed that sentiment, saying that with smart inverters being required for new distributed solar, they no longer hear of limits to new distributed solar due to voltage issues.
The consultancy GridLab has produced a brief report on regulating voltage using smart inverter settings, targeted at a general audience. And the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has published a longer document, with more technical detail, on the same topic.

In conjunction with the acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a roughly $824 million convertible equity portfolio financing with Apollo Global Management.
The financing is the lowest cost in the partnership’s history, according to a statement. Terms were set with a more than 250 basis point lower implied return than the first iterations of the structure in 2018 and early 2019.
The portfolio includes:
NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the interests in the assets for around $849 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments, plus NextEra Energy Partners’ share of the portfolio’s total tax equity financings, which is estimated to be approximately $866 million at the time of closing.
The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of around $184 million to $194 million.
NextEra Energy Partners said it expects to close the acquisition later this year or in early 2022, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of certain regulatory approvals.
The financing will provide NextEra Energy Partners with the right to periodically buy out the investor’s equity interest in the portfolio between the five- and 10-year anniversaries of the agreement at a fixed pre-tax annual return of around 5.6% (inclusive of all prior distributions).
NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to pay 100% of the buyout price in NextEra Energy Partners’ common units, issued at no discount to the then-current market price.
When fully drawn, the financing agreement will allocate at least 35% of the portfolio’s cash flows to NextEra Energy Partners over the initial 10-year period. This cash flow allocation implies a roughly 4.8% effective annual coupon on the investor’s outstanding investment over the initial period prior to NextEra Energy Partners’ anticipated initiation of periodic buyouts of the investor’s equity interest.

The 144 MW Clearview Solar project is set to occupy around 1,075 acres of a roughly 1,195-acre project area located in Champaign County, west of Columbus. The hardware is subject to change, but the preliminary site plan was modeled using First Solar’s Series 6 Plus modules, Nextracker NX Gemini single-axis trackers, and SMA America’s Sunny Central 4600 inverters. Construction is expected to begin late this year and take about 12 months.
The 120 MW Ross County Solar project is set to occupy roughly 927 acres within a roughly 1,433-acre project  south of Columbus. The project application does not include what specific manufacturers the developers intend to use. It said that the project will consist of around 365,000 monocrystalline bifacial PV panels, mounted on single-axis trackers.
The application also lfets open the possibility of using either polycrystalline or thin film modules. Construction is expected to begin as early as the fourth quarter with commercial operations beginning as early as the fourth quarter of 2022.
These two projects add to the surge of utility-scale solar applications and approvals in Ohio. The state ranked 23rd in the nation in terms of installed capacity at the end of Q2 2021, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). With roughly 797 MW installed to date, Ohio is one of the states SEIA said it anticipates to have an especially bright solar future. The trade group projected 5,596 MW of new capacity over the next five years, good for sixth-most in the nation.

The move is in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s emergency proclamation to accelerate the rapid deployment of new clean energy and storage projects for summer 2021 and 2022. The utility, known as SCE, will use land at its existing substations to develop, permit, and interconnect the battery storage resources. The company contracted Ameresco to install the battery energy storage systems that are expected to be online next August.
The additional storage capacity adds to long-term capacity contracts completed last year, which include 1,355 MW of utility-scale battery storage and 5 MW of demand response that uses energy from customer-owned energy storage. With the new capacity SCE’s total amount of installed and procured storage capacity will be about 2,810 MW.
The latest battery storage additions are intended to help SCE meet demand in the San Joaquin Valley, Rancho Cucamonga, and nearby communities as well as the greater Long Beach area, including the Port of Long Beach.
SCE estimated the state needs to add 30 GW of utility-scale storage to the grid and 10 GW of storage from distributed energy resources to meet the state’s clean energy and carbon neutrality goals.
