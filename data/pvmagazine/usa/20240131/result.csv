This is the first time FEMA will directly fund net-zero energy projects.
FEMA will make funds available via its Public Assistance program, which covers the rebuilding of schools, hospitals, fire stations, and other community infrastructure during post-disaster events. It will also administer funds via its Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HGMP) and offer incentives through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program.
Examples of eligible net-zero projects are solar microgrids, heat pumps, certified high-performance appliances and passive heating or cooling. States, tribes and territories can now submit expenses for these activities for FEMA reimbursement, said the agency.
Any disaster declared after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, August 16, 2022, can now take advantage of the funding opportunities. FEMA said as of January 30, more than 80 disasters have been declared across all 10 FEMA regions in that timeframe.
FEMA said climate related disasters continue to become more frequent and severe. In the 1980s, the United States average 3.3 disasters costing more than $1 billion each per year, adjusted for inflation. Since 2019, the U.S. has averaged 20.4 disasters of such magnitude, with 2023 having 28 weather and climate disasters costing over $1 billion each. In 2023 alone, FEMA spent over $10 billion on rebuilding and hazard mitigation construction.
The FEMA funded projects are designed to boost community resilience under pressure from climate related disasters. They also support the Biden Administration’s goal of reaching net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050.
“After a disaster, communities don’t just want to build back. They want infrastructure that will last and will serve them better in a future that promises more extreme weather events fueled by the climate crisis,” said John Podesta, senior advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation.
Any community interested in introducing low-carbon materials or implementing net-zero energy projects can work directly with their point of contact at their FEMA region or reach out at FEMA-IRA-Implementation@fema.dhs.gov or fema-climate@fema.dhs.gov.

With peak output AC power of 384 W, the new microinverters are designed to pair with a full range of solar modules up to 540 W.
IQ8HC Microinverters can manage a continuous DC current of 14 amperes, supporting higher powered solar modules through increased energy harvesting. The IQ8X Microinverters are available in the U.S. and support solar modules with higher output DC voltage and cell counts, such as 96-cells, 80 half-cut cells and 88 half-cut cells.
The new IQ8 Microinverters build on the previous models’ ability to keep the power running during a grid blackout. The device is designed to react to real-time usage in the home and adjust accordingly. The system will feed as much electricity as it has access to based upon sunlight available and solar power capacity, and it, reportedly, will adjust on the fly. When the house is using more energy than provided by the solar setup, the Enphase system is designed to shut down and to instantly restart when the excess load is removed.
The company offers a 25-year warranty for all IQ8 Microinverters activated in the United States and Canada, and a 12-year warranty for products activated in Mexico.
“Enphase is staying ahead of the industry by developing products that can handle the ever-increasing power density of new solar modules,” said Tom Chentnik, owner of Independent Green Technologies of Texas, an installer of Enphase products.
Enphase Energy Systems in North America reports that the IQ8 Microinverters can also be paired with IQ Batteries for an all-in-one solution. The IQ Combiners consolidate interconnection equipment into a single enclosure and provide a pre-wired solution that includes an IQ Gateway, cell modem, current transformers (CTs), and more.
Enphase has shipped approximately 72 million microinverters, and more than 3.8 million Enphase-based systems have been deployed in over 145 countries. However, in October pv magazine USA reported that Enphase had had a difficult year, with its performance struggling in-line with other residential solar market leaders, which have seen high interest rates, regulatory changes like California’s NEM 3.0, and stabilizing energy prices make a significant dent in rooftop solar installations.
Enphase attributed its pullback in sell-through in California to NEM 3.0. However, at the time, management said it is confident that solar-plus-battery systems will have a payback period under NEM 3.0 that approaches NEM 2.0 levels, and that sales should normalized in “a few more quarters.”

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/31/bipartisan-senators-request-increased-tariffs-on-solar-imports-from-china/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-01-31,Bipartisan Senators request increased tariffs on solar imports from China,"In a joint letter to President Joe Biden, Senators Ossoff (D-GA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) urged for the increase of tariffs on solar modules, cells and wafers imported from China. The Senators said Biden can increase tariffs via the Trade Act of 1974.
The Senators argue that the United States cannot price-compete with China for solar panels, which Wood Mackenzie reported fetch an average price of $0.15 per W. This is about 60% cheaper than the average U.S.-made panel.
The United States has shown a commitment to nearshoring its clean energy supply chain for national security and energy security purposes. The U.S. supports domestic solar manufacturing through component-level production tax credits, demand-side tax credit adders with domestic content adders, and more. However, the Senators argue that China’s heavy subsidization of its solar industry makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to compete.
Bloomberg reported that China installed 216.9 GW of solar last year, eclipsing its record of 87.4 GW from the previous year. This equates to more solar installed in one year than the United States has achieved in its entire history.
“China’s aggressive subsidies for its own solar manufacturing industry demonstrate its intent to control the industry globally. By 2026, China will have enough capacity to meet annual global demand for the next ten years. This capacity is an existential threat to the U.S. solar industry and American energy security,” said the letter to the President.
Since the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which contained Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America (SEMA) bill, the U.S. has announced over 162 major manufacturing projects, leading to over 60,000 estimated jobs and over $60.7 billion in investments announced. Many of these announcements include global companies setting up manufacturing operations in the United States for the first time.
Despite this unprecedented level of investment in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, many of these projects are announcements and are in early stages. The Senators argue more needs to be done to level the playing field.
“These heavily subsidized and artificially low prices put U.S. solar manufacturers at an extreme disadvantage during a critical turning point in the development of the domestic solar manufacturing industry. Section 301 tariffs are needed to avoid dire consequences not only for our economic and national security, but also for the thousands of workers employed by these manufacturers,” said the letter.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/31/chaberton-energy-sees-community-solar-installations-skyrocket/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,DELAWARE,MARYLAND,NEW JERSEY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-01-31,Chaberton Energy sees community solar installations skyrocket,"After four years of very strong growth, Chaberton reports it controls 650+ MW of community solar sites in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, New Jersey and Italy.
Headquartered in Maryland, Chaberton Energy is a public benefit corporation focused on developing sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy projects. Its work ranges from site conception to full operations. The company launched in 2020 with community solar projects in the mid-Atlantic region but has since broadened its portfolio to include commercial and industrial installations. Due in part to favorable solar policies that continue to emerge in states across the country, Chaberton quickly expanded its market.
Community solar installations have grown overall from 85 MW cumulative in 2015 to 6.2 GW in 2023, according to Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the market is expected to grow 8% annually between 2024 and 2028.
“Chaberton will be busy this year offering valuable solar options for communities and for businesses that recognize the benefits of generating their own electricity, cutting costs and reducing their carbon footprint,” said Chaberton Energy CEO and founder Stefano Ratti.
Recent projects
A few of its recent projects include Friendship, Crestone, Greyrock and Fuji.
Friendship is made up of two community solar projects in West Friendship, Howard County, Maryland, which, combined generate 6.5 MW. They came online early 2023 and serve local community residents and small businesses, via the Community Solar Maryland program, and Loyola University Maryland, via the Aggregate Net Energy Metering program. Like all of Chaberton’s projects in the mid-Atlantic, they feature a pollinator habitat.
Crestone is a community solar project in Harrington, New Kent, Delaware, totaling 6.4 MW. This is the first project to participate in the newly revamped Delaware Community Solar program.
Fuji is two installations in one. Located in Franklin, NJ, it has a combined capacity of 5 MW. What is unique is this is a floating solar installation, which will be installed on the surface of an industrial pond.
The installation will serve both industrial and community solar needs, as the first phase of the project involves installing a behind-the-meter system to meet on-site energy requirements of an aggregate material production site. The second phase of the project is a community solar installation with local residents as subscribers.
Greyrock, in Pittsville, Md is a 2 MW community solar project on a 34-acre parcel of land, which will serve residents and businesses within the Delmarva service area. Its pollinator habitat was designed following recommendations set forth in the Maryland Pollinator Protection Plan. The project is expected to be operational in the summer of 2024.

Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE has fabricated a perovskite-silicon tandem solar module with a glass-glass design.
The panel has a power conversion efficiency of 25% and an output of 421 W. It measures 1.68m2 and uses cells produced by Oxford PV, a UK-based perovskite solar cell manufacturer with pilot production in Germany. Oxford PV says that the module was assembled by the Fraunhofer team using its specifications.
“This new world record is a crucial milestone for Oxford PV, proving that our tandem solar cells can deliver record-breaking performance when assembled into solar panels,” Oxford PV CEO David Ward said in a statement.
The tandem cells produced by Oxford PV are M6-format. Last year, the company broke a record with a verified cell efficiency of 28.6 %. The tandem cells are currently produced in a small series line in Brandenburg, Germany, with commercial production slated for later this year.
The researchers said they utilized commercially available PV production equipment installed at the Fraunhofer Module Technology Evaluation Center (Module-TEC) and optimized the processes to make the glass-glass modules. “The fact that mass production-compatible technology was used for its manufacture demonstrates the enormous potential of tandem technology for the PV industry,” said Stefan Glunz, head of PV at Fraunhofer ISE.
The solar cells were interconnected using conductive bonding equipment at Fraunhofer ISE’s Module-TEC. As the perovskite layer of the tandem cells is temperature-sensitive, the research team said it had to develop low-temperature processes for the interconnection and encapsulation of the solar cells.
“In the future, we will also be testing another alternative: soldering the solar cells at low temperatures,” said Achim Kraft, who heads up the interconnection technology group at Fraunhofer ISE. “These are suitable for industrial mass production and can be implemented on commercial systems. The necessary adaptions can also easily be implemented in today’s PV production lines”
For the calibration measurements, the Fraunhofer ISE tapped its well-equipped calibration lab to determine the module efficiency, noting that precise and reproducible statements about the tandem module’s power, are only possible if both the perovskite and the silicon cell layers are illuminated by appropriate LED light sources under conditions as close as possible to natural sunlight.
“As the currently standardized measurement methods are not fully transferable to this new technology, the method used was additionally validated with field measurements,” noted the researchers.
The project teams from Fraunhofer ISE and Oxford PV are now working towards certification of the PV module and tests on long-term stability.
