To kickstart this ambitious project, the company has secured $8.53 million (NOK 90 million). These funds will also potentially bolster operations at their home facility in Ardal, Norway.
Over half the funds were sourced from two new investors: Statkraft Ventures, which contributed $3.79 million, and Årdal Energi, which chipped in $0.95 million. Additionally, continued financial backing came from longstanding shareholders Nysnø Klimainvesteringer, Scatec Innovation, and ABN AMRO Sustainable Impact Fund. Both the company’s management and several smaller shareholders also made contributions.

Erik Løkke-Øwre, NorSun’s CEO, mentioned that the company is currently navigating the early stages of its expansion strategy. The goals include securing sales contracts with wafer purchasers, and subsequently gaining financing for the proposed facility. NorSun is optimistic about finalizing these plans by the close of the year.
The company did not announce who those sales contracts might be finalized with though.
However, pv magazine USA has closely followed Meyer Burger’s move into the U.S.. We reached out to Dr. Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger, to determine how close the NorSun announcement was being followed due to the two companies’ existing relationship (NorSun and Meyer Burger sign wafer deal in Europe).
pv magazine USA: Is Meyer Burger in talks with NorSun to purchase these wafers?
Dr. Erfurt: We have a strong relationship with NorSun and purchase wafers already for our manufacturing in Germany. Expanding this business is in the interest of both companies. And worth mentioning: NorSun produces best in class n-type wafers which meet our technological requirements potentially better than the products of their competitors.
pv magazine USA: Was the existing Meyer Burger/NorSun relationship part of the motivating action to deploy this factory?
Dr. Erfurt: NorSun is aware of MB‘s growth plans and we are aligning these as [well] as possible.
pv magazine USA: Does Meyer Burger see a path to expand the U.S. solar cell/module assembly capacity to 5 GW/year?
Dr. Erfurt: Yes.
pv magazine USA: Does Meyer Burger have imminent plans to announce the expansion to 5 GW if it is possible?
Dr. Erfurt: Yes, as soon as we have firm projects to be communicated. We informed in today’s H1 2023 call that we expect further offtake agreements potentially within this year.
Meyer Burger recently already announced two gigawatts of solar cell manufacturing and a similar amount of module manufacturing capacity. Both the solar cell and solar module facilities have additional space to carry deploy additional manufacturing lines.

Recently, NorSun received a grant of EU53.6 million ($58.4 million) from the EU Innovation Fund. This grant aims to expand their current facilities’ ingot and wafer manufacturing capacity from 1 GW to 3 GW. The estimated cost of this expansion stands at $300 million. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2024, and upon completion, the facility is expected to employ 300 people.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/17/texas-attorney-general-counties-cannot-block-solar-development/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 17, 2023",Texas attorney general: Counties cannot block solar development,"Residents of rural Franklin County in northeast Texas have been actively fighting solar development in their community. They have pushed for county commissioners to impose a 180-day ban on solar development.
The issue was raised to the Texas attorney general’s office, which this week advised that county governments lack the legal authority to place such a ban.
The anti-renewable stance of some Texas residents stems from concerns about the land use required for utility-scale projects. Trees, brush, grasslands or farmland are sometimes cleared for these larger projects, fueling resident concerns about over-development.
However, solar is a flexible resource, and utility-scale projects offer co-benefits when developed with pollinator habitats or dual-use agrivolatics, which combines productive farmland with renewable energy production. Another way to add emissions-free solar while limiting development is distributing it on the built environment – on rooftops, carports, and highway rights-of-way. Meanwhile the old alternatives of oil, gas and coal, often require more invasive methods of extraction and production, and produce health-damaging emissions.
In other anti-renewable efforts, some Texans have also urged lawmakers to pass Senate Bill 624, which would have placed significant permitting restrictions and fines on solar and wind energy projects in the state. The bill, which met the ire of renewable energy developers and environmental advocates, passed the Senate, but was unable to make it out of the legislature.
Texas, once the heart of the nation’s oil boom, is now undergoing the nation’s largest solar boom. A 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the 16 GW that is active to date. This buildout will make Texas the #1 state for solar development in terms of capacity, leapfrogging California, the perennial leader.
Much of this investment in solar, which nears $20 billion, is going toward big solar farms, often exceeding 100 MW in capacity. Over 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and those jobs numbers will rise sharply as more utility-scale projects are built. Today, nearly 5% of Texas electricity is generated by solar.
While some Texans are resistant to the transition to renewables, others have embraced it. Take Concho County, for instance, which houses the Galloway solar project. The project has led to 250 construction jobs and is estimated to generate $18 million in local property tax revenues over its operational life.
“Today, solar is not only one of the lowest cost forms of electricity generation, but also one of the fastest growing workforces in America. Here in Texas, we are creating lifelong careers in clean energy that can sustain generations to come,” said Tom Buttgenbach, founder and chief executive officer of Avantus, developer of the Concho County project.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/17/new-study-claims-pv-industry-is-neglecting-overirradiance-issues/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 17, 2023",New study claims PV industry is neglecting overirradiance issues,"From pv magazine global
An international research team has investigated how overirradiance (OI) may impact the performance of PV installations at low- and mid-latitudes and have found several issues may arise when OI conditions last more than one minute and at ambient temperatures above 30 C.
These events may affect the operating performance of photovoltaic plants, the stability of the electrical grid, and the efficiency of inverters. These effects are due to the increase and drastic fluctuation of irradiance, which can vary by more than 900 W/m2.
“To our estimation, the industry in the last decades, the PV industry, has been neglecting overirradiance, possibly due to unawareness or the belief that these events are rare and isolated,” the research’s lead author, Marco Zamalloa, told pv magazine. “We ourselves were not aware of such events before seeing them in our irradiance data a few years ago. However, since we are relatively new to this topic, we cannot say with absolute certainty whether some PV energy industry branches and project developers now consider these overirradiance conditions.”
 According to Zamalloa, OI conditions are common and occur everywhere with cloud formation. “They can be imagined as a wandering focal point of a magnifying glass,” he further explained. “With the movement of the cloud, it wanders over the earth’s surface. We become only aware of the irradiance enhancement when the focal point passes a sensor.”
In the paper “Overirradiance conditions and their impact on the spectral distribution at low- and mid-latitude sites,” published in Solar Energy, Zamalloa and his colleagues analyzed the spectral distribution of OI conditions in Lima, Madrid, and Berlin using spectroradiometers, tilt and azimuth angles, and sampling interval. They measured, in particular, the spectral distribution of solar irradiance in W/m2/nm, ranging from 350 to 1050 nm, via two years of measured spectral data.
Through their analysis, they found that OI conditions cause red-shift and cloud a blue-shift of the clear-sky spectrum. “The red-shift caused by overirradiance conditions results in different spectral distributions, depending on the average photon energy of the clear sky,” they explained, adding that the spectral red-shift indicates a cloud-enhancement of the direct normal irradiance.
“We believe the photovoltaic industry requires a quantitative evaluation of the impacts of overirradiance on the operation of photovoltaic systems, which are just beginning to be carried out,” co-author Jan Amaru Töfflinger said. “The sudden change in irradiance makes it necessary to improve the response time of the inverters and the MPPT algorithm, both to take advantage of the increase in irradiance and to avoid heating the cables, fuses, and photovoltaic modules due to the high current generated by the overirradiance events.”
Töfflinger also stressed that overirradiance conditions are frequent in Brazil and can have technical and economic effects on photovoltaic plants. “We have contacted colleagues from Brazil, where, so far, most papers have been written regarding the impact of overirradiance conditions on PV plants,” he concluded. “They say they are quite aware of the potential risks and are taking precautions in sizing the inverter and protective fuses.”
The research group is formed by scientists from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Germany’s Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie GmbH, and the University of Jaén in Spain.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/17/solaredge-adds-power-control-system-to-inverter-for-system-oversizing/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 17, 2023",SolarEdge adds power control system to inverter for system oversizing,"SolarEdge, a provider of inverters for residential and commercial solar projects, announced it has released updates to its Home Hub and Wave inverters in the U.S., adding a new power control system (PCS).
The new PCS integrated with the inverters enables solar array oversizing by 50% larger or more without triggering the need for an upgrade to the home’s main panel. Main panel upgrades are often a late costly addition to a solar project that can be a barrier to adoption for the customer.
SolarEdge inverters can now monitor, balance and control the currents on the main panel busbar, enabling larger installations than the National Electrical Code’s 120% rule. A typical home with a 200 Amp main panel can now attach up to three 11.4 kW SolarEdge inverters without triggering a main panel upgrade.
The DC-coupled design also enables up to 200% DC oversizing and storage of excess solar production in its SolarEdge Home battery.
“Customers are seeking to install larger PV systems on their rooftops and financial considerations play a crucial role in their decision making,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer, SolarEdge. “With the new SolarEdge inverters, installers will be able to offer their customers bigger PV systems while avoiding main panel upgrades, significantly improving the economics of PV and battery storage across the U.S.”
The PCS will be embedded in SolarEdge’s Hub and Wave inverters, requiring only a current transformer to be installed on the main panel, with no external connector boxes required for installation.
Higher interest rates and lowered compensation rates for net-metered electricity have squeezed the return on investment offered to residential solar customers. Updates like this new PCS are designed to keep upfront costs low and navigate a shifting environment for rooftop solar. SolarEdge’s main competitor, Enphase, has made adjustments to its microinverter product offerings to adapt to these headwinds as well.
“While the U.S. residential solar market is currently seeing some headwinds primarily related to higher interest rates, we are navigating through this period by leveraging our geographic and multi-segment strengths in the solar markets and expect to benefit from the positive long-term outlook for this sector.”

The company said it also upgraded its inverters with software improvements for faster commissioning and automotive-grade critical components for improved reliability.
In its Q2 2023 earnings call the company reported record revenues of $991.3 million, up 5% from $943.9 million in the prior quarter and up 36% from $727.8 million in the same quarter last year. SolarEdge beat Wall Street’s consensus estimate by 0.21%, an estimate it has now consistently beaten in the last four quarters.
Revenues from the solar segment were a record $947.4 million, up 4% from $908.5 million in the prior quarter and up 38% from $687.6 million in the same quarter last year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/17/canadian-solar-to-deliver-1200-mwh-of-battery-energy-storage-in-arizona/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ARIZONA",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 17, 2023",Canadian Solar to deliver 1200 MWh of battery energy storage in Arizona,"Canadian Solar Inc. announced that e-Storage, part of its majority-owned subsidiary CSI Solar, will deliver 1,200 MWh (1,519 MWh dc nominal) of energy storage solutions to Recurrent Energy’s Papago Storage project in Arizona.
Papago Storage is expected to be one of the world’s largest standalone energy storage projects and the largest standalone energy storage project in Arizona. Once operational, the project is expected to dispatch enough power for approximately 244,000 homes for four hours every day.
Recurrent Energy, owner of the project, secured a 20-year tolling agreement with Arizona Public Service (APS) for the energy storage project, under which the utility pays for the right to charge and discharge the battery when it needs to.
In April of this year Canadian Solar rebranded its wholly owned global energy subsidiary as Recurrent Energy. This segment develops both stand-alone solar and stand-alone battery storage projects, as well as hybrid solar-plus-storage projects.
Last year Recurrent brought online 2 GWh of energy storage, including the1,400 MHh Crimson Storage project in California. On average, the Crimson project is expected to store and dispatch enough electricity to power more than 47,000 homes each year.
The Papago battery energy storage systems (BESS) project will use e-Storage’s SolBank, a containerized, proprietary battery energy storage solution designed and manufactured for utility-scale applications.
SolBank, which was announced last year at RE+ in Anaheim, uses high-cycle lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries with a 2.8 MWh energy capacity. LFP chemistry has been found to cut the risk of thermal runway, or fires, that can be problematic in other lithium-based battery systems. The battery enclosure contains liquid cooling mechanisms and humidity control, and active balancing battery management systems. The company said the technology complies with the latest international safety standards.
e-Storage will integrate the SolBank with battery inverters and controls, as well as offer operations and maintenance services and performance guarantees under a 20-year long-term service agreement to the project. e-Storage currently operates two fully automated manufacturing facilities with an annual capacity of 10 GWh for 2023. As of July 2023, the company deployed more than 2.7 GWh of battery energy storage solutions across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and China.
Recurrent Energy began developing the project in 2016. Construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2024 with planned commercial operation in the second quarter of 2025.
Arizona Public Service is Arizona’s largest electric company, serving more than 1.3 million commercial and residential customers in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties. The company has committed to serving its customers with 100% clean and carbon-free energy by 2050.
