The prototype project, Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD), has had successful land-based demonstrations, and it will now run tests to show its ability to beam usable energy from orbit.
Space-based solar power provides a way to tap into the practically unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space, unaffected by the cycles of day and night or by cloud cover and shading from objects.
A craft called the Momentus Vigoride carried the SSPD into orbit, propelled by a SpaceX rocket. The trip is expected to take about ten minutes to reach orbit, and testing will take place over the following weeks.
The 50-kilogram SSPD will deploy a constellation of modular spacecraft equipped with PV to collect sunlight, convert it to electricity, and then wirelessly transmit the electricity over long distances wherever it is needed. Caltech said the technology could be particularly useful to remote areas that do not have supportive transmission infrastructure.
 
The SSPD is made of three major components, each of which will be tested on the mission:
The research team expects the pilot testing mission to take a few months to operate the PV arrays and collect data on their performance.
“It works here on Earth, and has passed the rigorous steps required of anything launched into space. There are still many risks, but having gone through the whole process has taught us valuable lessons. We believe the space experiments will provide us with plenty of additional useful information that will guide the project as we continue to move forward,” said Ali Hajimiri, professor at Caltech and co-director of the project.
Caltech’s space solar program began in 2011 when philanthropist Donald Bren became interested in the technology. Bren has donated an excess of $100 million in support of the project and associated endowed professorships through his foundation.
“For many years, I’ve dreamed about how space-based solar power could solve some of humanity’s most urgent challenges,” Bren says. “Today, I’m thrilled to be supporting Caltech’s brilliant scientists as they race to make that dream a reality.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/04/three-solar-industry-trends-to-watch-in-2023/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 4, 2023",Three solar industry trends to watch in 2023,"The year 2022 represented a turning of the page for the solar industry. The beginning of the year was marked by lingering COVID-19 related delays, trade law enforcement, supply chain issues, and price hikes for components and shipping. Many of these headwinds led to delays and cancellations, and project deployments fell short of initial projections.  
The second half of the year was characterized by a renewed optimism as the landmark Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was passed, allocating a record $369 billion in spending for climate and energy measures. Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Assocation has dubbed the forthcoming ten years as the “Solar + decade” as solar and energy storage buildout is expected to continue to build momentum, now energized by the spending package. What can be expected for 2023? 
All eyes on California 
As is often the case with new technology policy and adoption, the country will look to California as a case study for where things may head for the solar industry. Specifically, Net Energy Metering (NEM), which is instrumental to the value of rooftop residential solar, will be a policy to watch again this year. 
Just before the clocks changed to 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) unanimously approved NEM 3.0, altering the mechanism by which rooftop residential solar customers are paid for sending their excess generation to the grid.  
Under the new NEM 3.0, Californians who install their project after April 15 this year will be paid on average 75% less for their exported solar production as compared to the previous regime. This damaging effect on customer value has led ROTH Capital Partners to project a 30% year-over-year decrease from 2022 residential solar installations in the state. 
The nation will watch California’s residential solar industry closely to see how it will adapt to the loss in system value. A spike of installations can be expected before April as Californians rush to secure the NEM 2.0 credit value for the next 20 years. After that, the industry could suffer a precipitous drop off in installation requests, as happened in Nevada in 2017 when it made a similar cut to net metering. 
California will act as a proving ground to show if the CPUC was correct in its judgment that solar- plus-battery systems will rise in adoption as NEM is cut. Recent analysis has shown that an increase in adoption is highly unlikely as the value to the end-user has been damaged by the new structure. 
Last year, NEM policy changes occurred or were blocked in Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Vermont and many other states, and 2023 will likely prove another battleground year for this policy. 
Inflation Reduction Act rollout 
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 set aside a record $369 billion to support climate and energy goals. Implementation of this package will take time as the industry sorts out the finer details on how to meet certain requirements in the Act to qualify for significant tax credit incentives and value adders. 
The Biden Administration is continually working with industry stakeholders to understand how to best implement the law. The White House released a guidebook in late 2022 to help industry members navigate the complexities of its many offerings. 
The way the law is interpreted and implemented will be watched closely in 2023 to determine its final impact. For example, major microinverter provider Enphase Energy said it plans to add between 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of manufacturing capacity in the United States, depending on the interpretation of the Production Tax Credit (PTC).  
Enphase chief executive officer Badri Kothandaraman said that the company will not make a significant investment in U.S. manufacturing unless his firm can secure a significant return on investment and retain 50% or more of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Production Tax Credit (PTC) value. 
(Read: “The role of solar in the Inflation Reduction Act”) 
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership,” said Ross Hopper. 
Module supply 
Perhaps the most difficult headwind faced by the solar industry in 2022 was the lack of steady supply of modules and other solar components caused by lingering COVID-19 related delays, increased commodity and shipping costs, the threat of tariff implementation, and the enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).  
Some of these headwinds are calming in early 2023, as shipping costs are cooling and polysilicon, the essential component in solar panel manufacturing, continues to fall in price. This trend may continue, as global polysilicon capacities are expected to double by the end of this year to 536 GW. 
Wood Mackenzie said that supply chain issues may ease by Q2 2023, and at that point the firm may positively revise solar installation projections to reflect this and the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act incentives. 
However, it remains unclear how much of an effect the UFLPA will have on the ability of components to pass U.S. Customs and enter the market. The UFLPA places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the Xinjiang region of China, home to roughly 50% of the global polysilicon supply chain, are made with forced labor. The act places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever.  
“It has proven more difficult and time-consuming to provide the proper evidence to comply,” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst, solar, Wood Mackenzie. 
Recently, Customs cleared a meaningful supply of JinkoSolar modules made with Wacker polysilicon for the U.S. market. While this clearing of goods was a good sign for solar module supply, there is a significant backlog of modules remaining to be cleared.  
In November , Reuters reported that over 1,000 shipments of solar energy components, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, have been blocked in U.S. ports under enforcement of UFLPA. ROTH Capital Partners said in August that as much as 3 GW had been held in Customs since the law was enacted.
ROTH warned that following the release of JinkoSolar goods, Customs Border Patrol may now turn its attention beyond the top solar component importers. “We could end up being in a two steps forward, one step back situation,” said Phil Shen, managing director, Roth Capital Partners.
The lack of clarity on exactly how UFLPA and anti-circumvention tariffs will be implemented makes this another major story to watch in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/04/the-price-of-polysilicon-has-fallen-by-54-since-august/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 4, 2023",The price of polysilicon has fallen by 54% since August,"According to two sources, the price of polysilicon is falling hard and fast. And while this price decline was expected, it is arriving a little sooner than most analysts had predicted.
This morning, BloombergNEF and Infolink published their polysilicon market spot prices. BloombergNEF’s chart showed the price of polysilicon at $17.51 per kilogram. We can compare that with August’s peak price of $38.32, per Rob Barnett.

This represents a 54% fall. The most expensive class of polysilicon, per Bloomberg, was over $44 per kilogram in July.
Infolink has shown similar price drops. The last price increase noted by Infolink was in a tweet from August 31, 2022, bringing the cost to 303 yuan ($43.98)/kg. Today, Infolink’s weekly spot price tally showed the market dropping by 20% over the last week, settling at 190 yuan ($27.58/kg).

The price decline for Infolink was 37%. There are differences in the products that are priced between Bloomberg and Infolink, with the Infolink product being the more premium product that is more commonly used in the high-end market today.
The recent price increase is the highest that polysilicon has been since the big prices of the late 2000’s and early 2010s as demand ramped up just before major polysilicon manufacturing ramped.
Some projections show that globally, we could manufacture up to 500 GW of solar modules in 2023, making the once explosive projection of 1 TW a year in 2030 seem very much within reach.

One caveat to these higher prices: Over the last decade, the amount of polysilicon per watt of solar has fallen by nearly two thirds. For instance, a 500 watt solar panel in 2012 (no, they didn’t exist yet), would have used roughly 3,000 grams of polysilicon, while in 2021 that number would be closer to 1,000 grams.
The $40/kg polysilicon in the 2012 module – 3 kg – would have cost $120, while the same priced polysilicon in 2021 would cost just over $40. And that’s before accounting for inflation, which effectively lowers the price an additional ~25% over the past decade.

The loan guarantee from the DOE would support Nostromo’s energy storage-as-a-service (ESaaS) solutions for the deployment of behind-the-meter, modular cold energy storage projects to commercial and industrial customers.
The invitation to submit a Part II DOE loan application means that the government loan office has determined that Nostromo’s proposed project is innovative, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and meets technical eligibility requirements under Part I of the application.  If approved, the DOE loan will help Nostromo deploy more than 275 MWh of cold storage dispatch systems over a network of 120 commercial buildings, creating hundreds of jobs in the construction stage as well.
Nostromo Energy retained investment bank Independence Point Securities to source an undisclosed equity raise to fund a remainder of capital costs to deploy the 120-building portfolio.
Nostromo’s IceBrick systems are managed by the company’s Cirrus cloud-based energy management system and operate as a virtual power plant, which provides demand flexibility to the local power grid.
The company’s patented IceBrick system is a 12 foot by 20 inch rectangular energy storage block with 132 gallon volume. The cold dispatch storage product provides the lithium-ion equivalent of  8 to 12 kWh of avoided energy and provides 10 ton hours of cold stored energy. The IceBrick cell has an up to 92% thermal round-trip efficiency over an approximate 4-hour dispatch cycle.
Nostromo Energy was formed in 2016 in Shdema, Israel, and has a U.S. office in Irvine, California.  The company has raised about $42.2 million in funding to date from Migdal Group, Freepoint Commodities, and other investors.
Commercial buildings
Buildings account for 74% of all U.S. electricity consumption. The commercial and industrial market has fallen behind in terms of energy storage deployments, accounting for just 1% of new storage capacity in California, compared to 93% of front of the meter (utility-scale) and 6% of residential storage deployments.
Nostromo’s ice-based energy storage system is positioned for rapid deployment in the C&I sector, who’s cooling energy demands accounts for approximately 50% of a building’s energy use and more than one-third of the total potential for load shifting by behind-the-meter storage on the entire power grid.
By lowering daily commercial building energy usage, more power from the grid is able to be deployed on energy-intensive technologies coming online such as EV charging and back-up power resilience during extreme weather.
DOE loan process
Under the Title XVII Innovative Clean Energy Loan Guarantee Program, the Department of Energy has provided more than $35 billion in loan guarantees to energy projects to date. The loan application consists of two parts:
Additional details for new applicants under Title XVII can be found at the DOE website.
Other recent applicants for DOE loans under Title XVII include Eos Energy Enterprises, which provides zinc-based grid energy storage product, and Advanced Clean Energy Storage, developer of a green hydrogen storage facility in Utah that received a $504.4 million loan guarantee.  The Eos loan funding is expected to be disclosed in the coming months.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/04/new-york-to-add-25-gwh-of-energy-storage-for-less-than-the-cost-of-a-slice-of-pizza/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 4, 2023",New York to add 25 GWh of energy storage for less than the cost of a slice of pizza,"New York state has released a roadmap to deploy 4.7 GW of additional energy storage projects by 2030. The Empire State is seeking 3 GW of “bulk storage,” 1.5 GW of retail storage, and 200 MW of residential storage. The state’s modeling predicts that it will cost $0.46 per month per electricity bill to incentivize developers to deploy this capacity.  By comparison, Bloomberg suggests the average slice of cheese pizza in New York City is just over $3.
Currently, the state has already deployed 130 MW of energy storage, and has more than 1.3 GW of energy storage waiting in its queues. The combined volume will exceed 6 GW of energy storage.
The state is also pushing forward with long duration storage (typically defined as greater than 4 hours).

 
The majority of the 4.7 GW of added capacity, plus the existing 1.3 GW, is expected to be coupled with four hours of energy storage. However, the eight-hour duration product is expected to start growing by 2030, when the combined storage is approximately 25.6 GWh.
By 2030, 400 MW of this capacity might be of the eight-hour variety. And by 2035, the state sees just over 4.1 GW of eight hour duration energy storage and 7.4 GW of four hour energy storage.
By 2050, the state’s four-hour storage target reaches 10.4 GW with 41.2 GWh, and eight-hour storage reaches 6.7 GW with 53.6 GWhs. At that point, the Empire State’s total bulk energy storage deployments will approach 100 GWh.
The report also references 10-hour and longer duration storage projects, which will likely be a necessary part of delivering clean, stable energy in winter. No capacity projections were made for this asset class.
About 6 GW of energy storage capacity would meet approximately 25% of NYISO’s 2022 estimated winter peak demand of 23,893 MW, and 18% of NYISO’s 2022 summer estimated peak demand of 31,765 MW.

The document shows that while the state initially procured “580 MW and 1,654 MWh of energy storage, cancellations have brought these numbers down to 480 MW and 1,314 MWh.”
The state has also required utilities to study “the potential of high-value energy storage projects towards providing cost-effective transmission and distribution services not currently available through existing markets”.
The report also includes capacity beyond energy storage, predicting 59 GWac/~76 GWdc of solar power by 2050.

NYSERDA notes that 4.5 GW of peaking plants are located in the state, with a majority of the plants located in the highly populated New York City and Long Island region, whose grid is managed by utilities Con Edison and PSEG. The units have a 5% to 10% capacity factor. It is suggested that batteries could replace these plants without any reliability issues, and that the batteries would be eligible for an extra 10% adder, since they would be located within an IRA Energy Community.
Vehicle to Grid (V2G) will be modeled in the future. By 2035, all newly sold passenger cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs will be required to be zero emission. 
The report also shows that while energy injections to the grid are not a primary use of EV batteries, (due to uncertain participation by EV owners), the capacity contained within EVs will not be automatically counted toward the 3 GW or 6 GW targets. However, V2G will be considered, as just 1% of EVs plugged into the grid would offer hundreds of megawatts of power. Most of that storage is located exactly where it is being used, since people tend to stay near their cars.
As of yet, the state has not finalized a financial structure to support the battery installations.

Six different types of programs are being considered:
The previous bulk energy storage program offered an upfront incentive, and was sold out in a very short time.
Final design decisions for New York are expected in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/04/leading-solar-inverter-trends-of-2022/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",TRISTAN RAYNER,"JANUARY 4, 2023",Leading solar inverter trends of 2022,"From pv magazine global
A fury of competition and innovation throughout the decade of solar’s boom has largely perfected the job of turning DC power into AC. In 2022, improvements and refinements to the process are harder won. And as boom times prevail, the inverter industry continues to grow.
Yet 2022 wasn’t a story of easy times despite demand. Supply chains still failed to keep pace, with most inverter manufacturers unable to cut down lead times to anywhere near pre-pandemic timeframes. Things are said to be improving in 2023, but choke points remain for key components including insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and advanced chips. And that story leads us to identifying some of the bigger trends throughout the year in inverters.
S-curve stalls
PV inverters are facing a typical late cycle in a technology or innovation S-curve, where mature, rapid improvements in DC-AC inverter technology have been made, and new gains are harder won.

At the opposite end of this typical S-curve is the hydrogen market, which is seeing rapid advancements in technology and products, with new gains easier to achieve through scale and investment.
However, PV inverters are arguably some way off reaching the tipping point of diminishing returns, thanks to an actively changing market. For example, at the residential and commercial level, many regions are embracing hybrid inverters as default to accommodate battery storage. Other examples include accommodating EV charging and, at some point, vehicle-to-grid solutions, as well as virtual power plant capabilities, smart controls and connectivity, and more. However, the core DC-AC conversion is mature.
All of this was evident in fewer step changes in products: new and better inverters came to market at all classes from a flourishing industry, but marketing departments were forced to work harder to explain benefits outside of raw efficiencies.
Elsewhere, high-power string inverters seen throughout 2020 and 2021 weren’t eclipsed in 2022 by even higher-power offerings, perhaps as weight and sizing limits were met. And, looking towards new technologies, silicon carbide semiconductor PV inverters continue to show considerable opportunity for the industry, but electric vehicles control the demand, costs remain high, and IGBT-powered inverter topologies in solar remain the dominant type.
Manufacturing growth
Inverter manufacturing expanded significantly in 2022, despite the wide economic downturn and tougher conditions for businesses. Enphase committed to adding four to six new manufacturing lines, totaling around 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of solar microinverter manufacturing capacity in the United States, provided it can secure funding via the production tax credit (PTC) system that is part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Fronius also announced this year it will invest $244 million to expand production in 2023, with Martin Hackl, Global Director Marketing and Sales of the Solar Energy business unit at Fronius International, noting, “photovoltaics are in greater demand than ever before and the demand is exploding as a result.”
Central inverters
The central inverter market blossomed again in 2022 with multiple companies re-invigorating the market. Sungrow introduced a new “1+X” modular central inverter solution to the market, and Gamesa Electric won awards following the launch of its Proteus PV central inverter.
Sungrow’s option offered modularity at 1.1 MW increments up to 8.8 MW to meet the demands of project developers while promising higher energy yields, while Gamesa went for industry-leading efficiency from its Spanish-made inverter, with options scaling up to 4,700 kVA in a compact design.
New string inverters series launched throughout the year, but at utility scale, central inverters were some of the more interesting products entering the market.
Off-grid grows
2022 also saw inverter manufacturers turn niches into larger market opportunities: more off-grid inverters emerged into the market this year, and more inverters were certified to handle both on- and off-grid operation, adding some variation to grid-tie-only solutions. Intriguingly, manufacturers bringing their solutions to Europe and the US had previously established markets in regions like Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa, where power outages are more common. In response to both the energy market crisis and climate crisis, know-how from less grid-stable places became more useful.
Rule of thumb
As inverters reach technical maturity and both project and homeowners aim for less maintenance and more longevity, 2022 saw some useful studies emerge as a guide to plant life. A study by Bern University of Applied Sciences shows that the performance of most PV inverters and power optimizers remains optimal for up to 15 years, the current industry rule of thumb anyway, after evaluating inverter failure surveys from 1,280 PV systems with 2,151 inverters, finding well-founded fears over inverters left in the causing faster aging.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/04/solar-is-front-and-center-in-the-fight-for-energy-justice/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 4, 2023",Solar is front and center in the fight for energy justice,"Energy justice seeks to correct damage done to people in low-income communities which have long suffered from fossil fuel pollution near their homes, lack of access to renewables-driven affordable electricity, climate change, and more. The concept is broadly referred to as environmental justice. But that term casts a much wider net, to include cross-cutting issues such as healthcare and transportation, whereas energy justice focuses on making affordable energy accessible to all. Renewable energy plays an important role in bringing energy justice to disadvantaged communities as clean energy can bring relief in many forms, including community and residential solar as well as energy storage.
The U.S. Department of Energy has developed a method for designating disadvantaged communities based on 36 criteria related to energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, socio-economic vulnerabilities, and fossil-fuel dependence. While these communities stand to benefit from renewable energy, a recent Berkeley Lab report, “Residential Solar-Adopter Income and Demographic Trends,” indicates that even though the rate of solar adoption among low-income residents is increasing (from 5% in 2010 to 11% in 2021), that segment of energy consumers remains under-represented among solar adopters, relative to its share of the population.
People living in these communities have several barriers to adoption. Many do not own the home they live in and are likely to live in multi-family housing units. Therefore, putting solar on the rooftop is not a viable option. Because such households are on low incomes, they often have low credit scores and cannot take advantage of the no-upfront-cost lease options on the market. Furthermore, their budgets are stretched thin – especially in the current economic climate – and they have little or no expendable income.
Community solar is especially applicable for those who can’t afford to “go solar” on their own, those who don’t own a rooftop, and those whose rooftops are not suitable for solar. Community solar is a solar project or purchasing program in which the energy from a solar project flows to multiple customers within a certain geographic area. The concept is taking off in the United States. For example in August, pv magazine USA reported that the community solar market in the U.S. would add at least 7 GW (DC) of generation capacity in existing markets over the next five years, based on a report by analyst Wood Mackenzie and the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).
However, the availability of community solar is a challenge. According to Olivia Nedd, senior policy director for access and equity at clean energy nonprofit Vote Solar, “some states are more adept at allowing community solar-enabling legislation, like California and Colorado.” Others, she said, “put up every roadblock barrier that you can imagine to stop community solar legislation or any kind of rooftop advancement.” She noted that in areas that lack policies to support community solar, low-income people face challenges in understanding how to access the technology.
Vote Solar is one of the groups working to make a difference by identifying programs and funding streams and then providing support to partners throughout the process of going solar. The group tries to connect people who want solar energy with community-based organizations, frontline groups, and individuals who can also provide input on how they should be spending their money.
Fortunately, there are incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that promote the development of community solar in the United States. “The support can be so significant, it can transform communities,” Nedd said. “But we need to put a massive asterisk on it because it requires developers to take up projects within low-income communities.”
The IRA offers support in the form of tax incentives, with a 30% tax credit for the solar installation plus three adders that can add up to 70%. Additionally, the IRA includes the interconnection fee in that tax credit. This all should be incentive enough but, as Nedd points out, more effort is needed to engage communities. “Community-based organizations need sufficient time to provide input on how the programs are designed because these programs are what’s going to impact them,” she said.
The CCSA is a national trade group that seeks to expand access to community solar. Jeff Cramer, president and chief executive of the CCSA, said that with about 75% of American households lacking the ability to put solar on their rooftop, community solar serves as the key pathway to accessing the benefits of local distributed solar. The CCSA works at the state and federal level to create sustainable and scalable programs that benefit all customers and the grid. The group is working with a broad set of stakeholders to figure out how to ensure that the benefits laid out in the IRA are going to the customers that need it most. The CCSA aims to bring projects online quickly, sustainably, and scalably over the ten-year life of the IRA tax credit.

Cramer noted that another piece of legislation which applies to low-income residents is the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is a $7 billion program of federal funds to support state governments and other eligible entities to create or expand distributed solar programs that provide benefits for low to moderate-income customers.
Grid Alternatives is another group working to bring equitable energy to those who need it most. This non-profit organization is dedicated to helping communities get clean, affordable renewable energy in addition to transportation and jobs. The group has an international focus, with energy justice work ongoing in the United States, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Mexico. Since 2004, Grid Alternatives has served more than 27,000 households, 204 community facilities – such as apartment buildings and nonprofits – and has saved families a combined total of $640 million. Its installations have produced almost 2.63 TWh of electricity, or the equivalent of saving more than a million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Grid Alternatives not only helps low-income families go solar, it also provides a training program that has helped launch new solar careers for nearly 40,000 people.
State focus
A few states have strong energy justice programs, including Illinois, New York, Colorado, and California. In September 2021, Illinois passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which focuses on climate change, racism, and economic divestment. As its name implies, it prioritizes job training, hiring, ownership, and entrepreneurship in low-income communities.
New York has a similar policy. In its Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019, which requires a minimum 40% of all state climate and equity spending to go to frontline Black, brown, and low-income communities. Furthermore, New York’s plan to achieve 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030 calls for 1.6 GW of newly deployed solar to benefit disadvantaged communities.
In Colorado, campaign group the Environmental Justice Coalition and other parties challenged utility Xcel Energy to support more-equitable clean energy. The power company agreed to dedicate $32.8 million toward renewable energy programs and incentives for low-income customers and those in disadvantaged communities. Up to $52.6 million is also set aside for community solar projects, and $6.5 million will go toward approximately 10 MW of energy storage capacity.
In California, the Community Renewable Energy Act (AB 2316) creates a community renewable energy program which includes community solar-plus-storage options. The CCSA’s Cramer said his organization believes that this funding can serve as “a catalyst to create long-term sustainable and scalable low-income solar programs and distributed solar programs.”
Inflation Reduction Act
The IRA legislative package which was passed in August in the U.S. offers several grant programs designed specifically to help launch meaningful initiatives to improve public health, reduce pollution, and revitalize marginalized and underserved communities. Considered the most significant climate legislation in U.S. history, it encourages clean energy adoption across the board and it is possible that it will have its greatest impact on overburdened communities. For example, the IRA includes the Justice40 Initiative, which supports programs that improve clean transit and workforce development while also investing in programs that make clean energy more affordable and accessible and strengthen resilience to climate change.
The IRA also set up a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator, which will seed state and local clean energy financing institutions and support deployment of zero-emission technologies. Half of those investments are prioritized for disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, programs specific to tribal communities offer rebates on the purchase of efficient electric appliances, to bring clean power to homes that have lacked electricity, and more.
“The money’s on the table now,” said Cramer. While there are groups pushing for solar access for all, and states with strong legislation, there are other pockets of interest in surprising places in the United States. For example, Louisiana has no policy for community solar or support for low-income residents going solar but the city of New Orleans has its own utility commission with a community solar program. In Nebraska, forward-looking co-operatives have created community solar projects.
“I think it’s starting with a seed of interest that continues to grow,” said Cramer. As the movement grows, he added, “the benefits of community solar become undeniable and the desire to develop capacity gains momentum.” Ultimately, it’s about making sure that those interests grow and continue to call for access to solar in the name of energy justice for all.

Neoen has started building a 93 MW solar power plant in Starland county, in the Canadian province of Alberta. The company awarded the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the project to Germany’s Goldbeck Solar. It will connect the facility to the 24.5 kV distribution network operated by local utility ATCO Electric.
“The launch of the construction of the Fox Coulée plant, less than a year after the constitution of our local team, demonstrates our commitment and our desire to become a benchmark player in Alberta and Canada,” said Emmanuel Pujol, the company’s director for the Americas.
The commissioning of the plant is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, the project will sell power via power purchase agreements (PPAs), but also partly to the local electricity market.
Alberta has a deregulated electricity market and an ambitious carbon tax policy. It aims to deploy 5 GW of renewables by 2030, so it can source 30% of its electricity from renewable energy by the end of the decade, while also phasing out coal.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/04/schneider-electric-launches-home-energy-management-system-that-integrates-solar-storage-ev-charging-and-appliances/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MONITORING,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOFTWARE,FRANCE,NEVADA,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 4, 2023","Schneider Electric launches home energy management system that integrates solar, storage, EV charging and appliances","Swiping through any number of smartphone applications, a homeowner can see the throughput power coming in from his or her rooftop solar array during the afternoon while their EV charges in the garage or fills a battery storage system.  This week, Schneider Electric unveiled the Schneider Home platform, the first consumer energy management system (EMS) that integrates all energy endpoints and household appliances in one interface that can be monitored via a single smartphone application.
The Schneider Home system was released a day before the kick off of the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) conference, taking place January 5 through 8 in Las Vegas, where the company has been recognized as a 2023 Innovation Award Honoree for the new platform.
The residential platform allows users to not only monitor the energy consumption of household appliances, it also allows users to prioritize power during outages to extend available back-up power during power outages to appliances such as the refrigerator or freezer.
At the utility level, the residential EMS platform provides additional energy cost savings by allowing for the enrollment in utility programs such as net metering. It can also help qualify the homeowner for tax incentives such as the solar investment tax credit for installing  solar and storage solutions.
In contrast to existing solutions that require individual apps and hardware, Schneider Electric has eliminated the complexity for homeowners by automating energy production, storage, measurement and control. Recognized by CES, Schneider Home’s sleek styling and integrated approach mark a new age of home energy management solutions.
“Homeowners are now able to produce their own energy and seamlessly switch between power sources to optimize cost,”  said Nadege Petit, executive vice president of innovation at Schneider.
The Schneider Home platform consists of five home components that integrate energy resources and digital capabilities, including:

For an existing home, Schneider Electric reports that it makes the most sense when a customer needs to make updates to their electrical system, for example, if they are adding a new technology such as an EV and charging system. The residential system includes the solar inverter, but system installation would require other aspects of the solar system such as wire harnessing and electrical equipment to be provided separately by an electrician or EPC contractor, a company spokesman told pv magazine USA.
Schneider Electric brings together disparate home energy technologies into an integrated, open, and streamlined system – all controlled by a single app with unique capabilities, including:
“Choice, control, convenience – these are the characteristics that consumers are looking for in every experience. What better or more meaningful place to deliver that than in their own homes?,” said Jaser Faruq, senior vice president of innovation and energy storage at Schneider. “We took the opportunity to reimagine home energy placing the customer at the center, then designing a full-featured, integrated system around their needs and paired with an intuitive app to simplify its operation.”
Faruq joined Schneider Electric in September 2021 to head up the Schneider Home platform after a six-year tenure at Tesla, where he was head of business operations for the EV manufacturer’s Residential Energy business, as well as solar roof growth and operations lead manager.
Over the last two years, Schneider Electric has been on a corporate acquisition spree for products that comprise many core solutions found in the Schneider Home platform, such as EV Connect, Qmerit, Zeigo, EnergySage and AutoGrid Holdings, whose technologies include residential EV charging, climate-technology data, and distributed energy resources integration.  In May 2021, the energy solutions provider launched a retail website to sell distributed resources such as solar and energy storage products.
Paris-based Schneider Electric is a Fortune Global 500 company formed in 1836 as a steel, mining and electrical service company.  From 1981 through 1997, the company divested out of the steel, mining and shipbuilding markets to become a full-service electric solutions provider, primarily through acquisitions.
The company currently trades at EUR 139.80 ($148) per share, with an $84.5 billion market capitalization.
