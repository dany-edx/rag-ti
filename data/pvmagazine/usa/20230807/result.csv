These updates include sound regulations that extend to a mile away, modified setbacks – allowing for a 350 foot setback for non-participating neighbors – and a contingency plan in the event of a horizontal directional drilling inadvertent release of drilling fluid.

Updated guidelines now require project developers to conduct two public information sessions prior to submitting their proposal to the OPSB. The second of these meetings must occur a minimum of 90 days before the application is filed to the OPSB. Updated guidelines now require project developers to host two public information sessions before submitting their proposal to the OPSB. The second session must be held at least 90 days prior to the application’s submission. If local authorities modify the solar project’s boundaries, a subsequent public meeting must be convened to discuss the changes, resetting the 90-day window before submission to the OPSB.
Another pivotal change is the introduction of a new noise standard. The OPSB notes that “sensitive receptors” will be positioned within a mile of the project site to ensure noise levels do not surpass the “greater of 40 dBA or the ambient daytime and nighttime average sound level (L50) by more than five dBA.”
Setback adjustments now dictate that solar panels must be a minimum of 50 feet away from non-participating parcel boundaries, at least 300 feet from non-participating homes, and no closer than 150 feet from the edge of pavement of any road inside or adjacent to the project area.
Furthermore, all solar facilities must now submit a “horizontal directional drilling inadvertent release of drilling fluid contingency plan” alongside other mandatory paperwork. This plan is designed to prepare for potential water contamination from the construction process used during boring.

Horizontal Drilling Inadvertent Return Control Plan
This boring technique is typically used to insert conduit and wiring deeper underground to prevent any adverse impact on sensitive areas such as streams and wetlands.
Interestingly, the board opted not to amend a particular rule, despite numerous public requests. The OPSB chose not to clarify the phrase “public interest, convenience, and necessity” within its rule-making terminology, a clause that has been described by the public as contentious.
This matters because the board recently rejected its third solar power project due to “general opposition by local citizens and governmental bodies.” In addition to the board’s decision, various counties in the state have taken steps to prohibit wind and solar projects outright. To date, ten counties have implemented solar bans. Just last month, Clermont County Commissioners unanimously barred large solar and wind projects in seven townships.
Ohio has a complex relationship with energy. While it is home to First Solar, a leading solar power company, the state is currently embroiled in a significant bribery scandal. Allegedly, over $60 million has been funneled to various political groups to endorse H.B. 6. This legislation provided over $1 billion in bailouts to coal and nuclear facilities owned by FirstEnergy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/07/gaf-timberline-solar-shingles-recalled-for-fire-hazard/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,QUALITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 7, 2023",GAF Timberline solar shingles recalled for fire hazard,"GAF Energy LLC, headquartered in in San Jose, California has recalled two products following a report of fire and five reports of thermal incidents leading to property damage. The recall was reported by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Division.
TLS-1 energy shingles and TLS-1 jumper modules have been recalled as electrical components within the shingle are prone to malfunction. Damage to customer roof decks were reported, but no injuries have been sustained from the thermal incidents.
GAF will inspect the electrical components of the shingles for repairs and replace all jumper modules free of charge as result of the recall. About 2,100 units are affected by the recall, and GAF is directly contacting affected customers. The products under recall were solar between November 2021 and April 2023.
GAF’s solar shingle product is a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) design that mimics roof shingles. Much like a shingle, it can be nailed to the roof, positioning itself as a solution that can be readily installed by existing roofing companies. The lightweight solar shingles measure 64 inches by 17 inches by 1 inch thick and weigh about 10 lbs.
The Timberline solar shingles are water-shedding and warranted to withstand winds up to 130 mph. The Timberline Solar design achieved UL’s 7103 certification, which authorizes GAF Energy to install the system on residential roofs as a roofing product and a solar energy product, the first of its kind to be recognized as both. In addition, GAF Energy worked with Sandia National Laboratories, a U.S. Department of Energy research and development lab, to verify the product’s strength, durability, and overall market-readiness.
In Summer 2022 the company announced it will open a 450,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Georgetown, Texas, one of the many U.S. solar manufacturing investment announcements over the last year. The facility is expected to create 260 jobs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/07/california-puts-multi-meter-rooftop-solar-at-risk-in-proposed-decision/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 7, 2023",California puts multi-meter rooftop solar at risk in proposed decision,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has released a proposed decision that is expected to be harmful to the value of rooftop solar for renters in multifamily housing, farms, and schools.
The decision sets hard limits on how much electricity produced by rooftop solar can be self-consumed by multi-meter properties. The policy effectively forces customers to first sell their solar production to the utility, and then buy it back at higher rates.
California’s Virtual Net Metering and Net Energy Metering Aggregation programs allow properties with multiple meters to install a single solar array for the entire property, sharing one system’s electricity and associated net metering credits with all customers and meters on the property. This new proposed decision deems that these customers should be limited in how much of their own solar production they can use, even if it is stored in their own battery.
The decision to not let multi-meter properties consume electricity from a system they own and operate comes with a clear motive: profit protection. If a rooftop solar owner is using their own electricity, they aren’t buying it from the utility. The CPUC has shown time and again that protecting utility profits is chief among its functions in the last year of rooftop solar rulemaking decisions.
“It would force customers in multi-meter properties—such as renters, small farmers, schools, and colleges—to sell all of their generation to the utility at low rates and buy it back at full retail rates,” said the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA).
The proposed decision is scheduled for a CPUC vote on September 21, 2023.
California’s rooftop solar market has already taken heavy blows to demand in recent months as Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 was implemented, a move that dramatically slashed compensation rates for exporting excess solar production to the grid.
Despite warnings from the industry, environmentalists and California residents that the move would be a devastating blow to residential solar, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) moved forward with NEM 3.0, gutting the value of sending excess local solar generation to the grid.
And despite assurances from NEM 3.0 proponents that the industry would weather the storm and readily start attaching batteries to customer systems, demand is now forecast to fall by nearly 40% in California through next year, according to Wood Mackenzie. The problem has been exacerbated by rising interest rates that have worsened the loan packages offered to customers.
The new proposed decision for multi-meter properties is an example of inconsistent logic from CPUC. While NEM 3.0 was justified on grounds that rooftop solar net metering causes cross-subsidization of rooftop solar customers by non-customers, this new ruling would effectively increase the amount of electricity being net metered. The one consistency: both rulemaking decisions are beneficial to utility profits.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/07/private-investments-in-clean-energy-and-manufacturing-top-270-billion/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 7, 2023",Private investments in clean energy and manufacturing top $270 billion,"The Inflation Reduction Act, passed nearly one year ago, has stimulated an unprecedented level of clean energy investments in the United States. A report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) shows federal support has led to announced private investments totaling $271 billion in domestic clean energy projects and manufacturing facilities over the past 12 months. This exceeds the combined clean energy investments made over the previous eight years.
The Clean Energy Investing in America report estimates that announced projects total 184.85 GW of new utility-scale clean energy capacity. To bring domestic content to these projects, 83 new or expanded utility-scale clean energy manufacturing facilities have been announced, amounting to an investment of over $22 billion, and opening nearly 30,000 new manufacturing jobs.

“Investment in clean energy production and manufacturing is surging. New jobs and revenue are bringing opportunity and optimism to rural communities across the country. America’s manufacturing centers are competing to meet new clean energy demand with a new domestic wind, solar or storage manufacturing facility announced every four days,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP.
Grumet noted that while the U.S. has the financial capacity, technology and “human capital,” the question is whether government policy will allow for the clean energy infrastructure to be built out fast enough to achieve clean energy dominance.
The report also showed a significant uptick in the manufacturing capacity of clean power components, thanks to the 83 announced facilities. The report says that 52 of these facilities are supporting the utility-scale solar industry and 14 support utility-scale battery storage.
Should currently announced manufacturing facilities reach operation, ACP estimates a nearly ninefold increase in solar module production and a more than fifteenfold increase in grid-scale battery storage, along with significant increases in production output for solar cells, polysilicon, ingots and wafers, as well as wind components. The report indicates that if the anticipated manufacturing facilities reach operation, U.S. solar module production could grow to 62 GW. Production of cells, ingots and wafer are also expected to increase.

In addition to boosting U.S. clean energy, the new buildout is revitalizing American manufacturing, which has been in decline. Grumet points out that steel mills are being repurposed to manufacture clean energy components. For example, a former steel mill will be rebuilt to produce wind foundation components, investing an estimated $115 million in the community and creating nearly 300 local jobs.
Manufacturing facilities for utility-scale clean energy components have been announced in districts across the country, and multiple states have announced five or more facilities, including Georgia (7), Tennessee (6), South Carolina (6), Texas (5), and Colorado (5).
One particular manufacturing facility is being built by German company, Meyer Burger, which is redirecting the manufacturing equipment originally intended for a German facility. Instead it will be used to set up a 2 GW solar cell manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colo. to supply its previously announced solar module plant in Goodyear, Ariz. Production of the solar cells is expected to start in Q4 2024.
The report includes an interactive map that shows where manufacturing facilities are planned.

Challenges
An industry planning to build clean energy production and manufacturing facilities faster than ever before will face some hurdles, the report contends. These challenges include supply chain issues, inflation, permitting bottlenecks and opposition. ACP says the opposition is driven by misinformation and must be addressed—along with the other challenges– in order to reach the full potential of the incentives provided by the IRA. 
Permitting for clean energy facilities can take from five to ten years, ACP reports, stating that Congress needs to pass permitting reforms in order to take full advantage of the investments and move clean energy forward. The report also suggests that Congress find common ground on transmission policy to ensure that cheap, abundant clean energy can find its way to consumers. 
An important benefit to the American people is the consumer savings, estimated by ACP to be $4.5 billion. The report cites estimates from several U.S. utilities that report reduced electricity costs as a result of federal incentives. Duke Energy Florida, for example, reports that it plans to decrease rates, saving customers $56 million annually. Pointing to the production tax credits within the IRA, Duke Energy Florida state president, Melissa Seixas said that Duke Energy sees this as a way of passing tax savings on to its customers.
The American Clean Power Association (ACP) represents 750 utility-scale solar, wind, energy storage, green hydrogen and transmission companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/07/arizona-sues-vision-solar-and-lead-generator-solar-xchange/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,ARIZONA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 7, 2023",Arizona sues Vision Solar and lead generator Solar Xchange,"Arizona’s Attorney General, Kris Mayes, has taken legal action against Vision Solar and has announced a nearly $14 million settlement with Vision’s lead generation partner, Solar Xchange.
The lawsuit alleges that telemarketing agents from Vision Solar and Solar Xchange frequently mislead consumers by falsely stating that their company, occasionally referred to as “Energy Exchange,” had affiliations with electric utility companies or government entities.
The complaint further contends that since at least 2019, Vision Solar’s telemarketers, including those from Solar Xchange, have placed tens of millions of unsolicited calls to numbers listed on the National Do Not Call Registry. The document reveals that over 150,000 consumers received at least 50 calls, while over 12,000 consumers were contacted a minimum of 100 times. Numerous recipients, who were also on the Do Not Call list, had expressly requested Vision Solar and Solar Xchange to refrain from calling. However, they continued to receive multiple calls.
The state points out that Vision Solar has faced lawsuits “numerous times” for its abusive telemarketing practices. Vision Solar is currently facing legal action in Connecticut recently.

The lawsuit suggests penalties could be imposed on Vision Solar and Solar Xchange, with fines reaching up to $50,120 for each breach of the Do Not Call registry rules.
An additional complaint noted that the solar sales and installation process was misrepresented. It was often touted as offering immediate savings of 20-50% on a customer’s electricity bill. In reality, customers would procure a loan and begin making payments shortly after the major installation phase completed, however, the system sometimes would take several more months to become operational due to necessary state inspections and approvals. Arizona argues that this discrepancy was falsely represented, causing undue financial strain on homeowners.
In a separate filing, the Attorney General’s office noted that lead generator Solar Xchange has agreed to a settlement regarding the claims, without admitting any wrongdoing. The company is required to pay a partially suspended civil penalty of $13.8 million, with $62,500 payable within a week to both the U.S. Treasury and State of Arizona. Solar Xchange is also mandated to cooperate fully with any related investigations, specifically noting the state’s lawsuit against Vision Solar.
