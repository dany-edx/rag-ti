https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/29/boosting-bifacial-panel-efficiency-with-albedo-ground-covers-field-test-results/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 29, 2021",Boosting bifacial panel efficiency with albedo ground covers: Field test results,"PV module production is increasingly changing from mono-facial to bifacial panels as the production gains and resulting project returns from bifacial panels are being validated. Many sources are projecting that bifacial production will overtake mono-facial within the next three to five years.

In order to maximize production returns, we at 7X Energy are starting to change our panel selection exclusively to bifacial. Due to this shift, we are evaluating the largest contributor of bifacial gain, the albedo or reflectivity of the ground surface.
In this evaluation, we tried to figure out how we could artificially increase gain for our project sites. The engineering team at 7X Energy performed research on commercially available ground material that would increase the ground albedo of its bifacial PV solar plants currently in construction.
(Read “Satellite-derived datasets to measure ground albedo for bifacial PV” from pv magazine Global.)

In addition, the team performed an economic analysis on a selected white ground cover and modeled the resultant production boost using PVsyst to take advantage of productions gains from using bifacial solar panels mounted on single axis trackers.
Here we share the results of the financial modeling analysis of two 7X Energy projects (the 200 MW Taygete II and the 130 MW Elara facilities) and offer some insights about the project feasibility economic modeling exercise.
After extensive research and analysis on albedo enhancing materials, we selected a woven polypropylene white ground cover manufactured by DeWitt Co. [Ref. 1] which is typically used in agricultural ground cover applications.
The 3.2 ounce/ sq. yd. material is a UV stabilized fabric and permeable. The material is expected to last five years based on the manufacturer and is shipped in rolls with dimensions of 12’ x 300’. This material was selected based on durability, permeability, cost, and availability among other criteria.
Our analysis was based on covering the entire surface area below the panels and between trackers as a means to providing the highest increase in yield. Previous research and analysis conducted and presented by Canadian Solar showed this scenario provided the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) vs. other surface area covering scenarios [Ref. 2]. The only areas not covered were main access roads, inverter access roads, and the buffer between the trackers and project fence line.
For the financial analysis we assumed two scenarios: one that would not include the 30% ITC qualification and one that would. All economic modeling was based on the material’s 5-year expected life.
We also adjusted the modeled albedo as we expected the material to show a reflectivity reduction as the material aged and broke down. The resultant production gains were multiplied by the indicative modeled price ($30/MWh) to show increased revenue. Then, we added additional budget to the operational expense since we expected some wear and tear from maintenance techs, weather, and so on. We also assumed the annual expenses at 10% of the total capital cost for the material. And last, we included operational savings from the reduction of vegetation management due to the ground cover.
We started the project net present value (NPV) analysis on our Taygete II project, which is currently under construction in West Texas. Project details included 1.29DC/AC ratio, 0.226 measured average ground albedo, 0.26% ground coverage ratio (GCR), and 1 in portrait orientation single axis tracker. Below is the summary of the financial NPV modeling for the project.

Based on the initial capital expense of roughly $4.2 million and cash flow over 5 years, we showed a negative NPV of around $2.8 million. When we assumed that the project would qualify for the 30% ITC, we still had a negative NPV on the order of $1.6 million. This was not the result we were hoping for, but we continued further modeling on additional projects.
The second project was our Elara project currently under construction in South Central Texas. The Elara project has a 1.35 DC/AC ratio, 0.185 measured average ground albedo, 30% GCR, and 1 in portrait orientation single axis tracker. Below is the summary of the financial NPV modeling for the project.

The first thing that stood out was that we still had a negative NPV although it was significantly closer to breaking even than our Taygete II project. Since the projects offer different capacities, we compared the project returns on IRR, which are -5% for Elara vs -24% for Taygete II assuming no ITC. Elara showed more economic feasibility, so we took a closer look to better understand the difference.

First, the delta in the initial albedo vs. the modeled albedo is higher for the Elara site. This accounted for the initial annual production gain of 4.3% vs. 3.4% at the Taygete site. Next, the GCR was higher for Elara, thus reducing the amount of surface area that the ground material covered and lowering the capital expenditure (CapEx).
Last, we had a significant savings in our operational costs because we assumed four mows per year at Elara versus just two mows per year at Taygete II. This was due to the vegetation on site and also the precipitation at the specific locations. This led to an overall annual operations savings of $95,000 at Elara vs. annual operations expenses of $136,000 at Taygete II.
From this comparison, we concluded that lower initial albedo sites, higher GCRs, and sites with at least average U.S. precipitation provide more favorable NPV returns for this albedo-enhancing material.
Based on the results of our financial modeling exercise, it appears the material does not deliver the project returns we would like.
However, we wanted to understand what site characteristics could potentially provide the positive NPV we are looking to achieve, and model some sensitivities in the financial modeling inputs that we could change.
For this analysis, we used the Elara financial model as the basis, or baseline, and calculated the change (delta) in NPV for each isolated site characteristic to determine the gain in NPV vs. the baseline. We started with the baseline of a -$898,000 NPV; the results shown below are in NPV gain ranking order of highest NPV delta.

From the results, we see that the ability to capture the ITC had the highest impact on NPV, with a gain of $725,000. When we added this to the baseline – $898,000, we had a net -$173,000 NPV. This matched our Elara project modeling.
The second-highest NPV delta was a scenario in which we required two additional mows/year (for a total of 6 per year) along with limited herbicide treatments. In this scenario we gained $682,000 of NPV. Adding the ability to capture 30% ITC resulted in a positive NPV of $509,000. That is finally an encouraging value!
By adding just these two items (the 30% ITC and 2 extra mows), the ground material proved to be worth pursuing for further study and possible implementation.
The third-highest NPV is the material ground cover O&M. Here, we adjusted the operating expense from 10% to 5% of total CapEx per year. We lack operating cost tools and experience to provide a confident cost for this item, but we believe an opportunity exists to adjust it down to 5%.
Fourth on the graph is the project’s power price. We assumed competitive pricing in the model, but a number of project sites within the U.S. and internationally that have significantly higher contracted prices versus the $30/MWh that we modeled.

Following that, the ground cover life variable had a $449,000 NPV gain. Here, we assumed the ground cover lasted two more years than the expected 5-year life.
Ground coverage ratio is shown next. Increasing the GCR by 5% (in other words, decreasing the tracker row spacing and thus the plant’s surface area), we increased the NPV by $448,000. Based on our experience, 35% GCR is a more common GCR in the U.S. vs. the lower GCRs we were able to achieve with our Taygete II and Elara sites. This figure has a high potential to be included in many projects.
Moving farther to the right, we have a positive $401,000 NPV gain based on a 33% reduction in the labor to install the ground material. We think there are some labor efficiencies that could be gained in deploying the material, hence the potential for this reduction. Note, however, that if we had a higher albedo–such as 0.23–then a $308,000 loss in NPV would have occurred.
One item that stood out was the mediocre production gain with this high albedo ground cover. We expected significantly higher yields with the white ground cover-modeled albedo. When we further analyzed the PVsyst production loss breakdown, we found that the inverter AC clipping was excessively high: 5.6% vs 2.4% in year 1 on Elara for the 0.55 and 0.185 modeled albedo, respectively.

The excessive inverter AC clipping was due to the increased irradiance with the ground cover, particularly during the middle of the day. Thus informed, we redesigned the project assuming the new approach, and included the ground cover installed and optimized for the increased irradiance. This resulted in a new DC/AC ratio of 1.25 vs. the previous 1.35. We re-ran the NPV modeling and generated a -$290,000 total NPV project vs. the -$898,000 baseline.
So, even with an optimized design, we still came up short of a positive NPV. However, if we can take advantage of any of the variables noted in the NPV graph, then the additional NPV gain will net us a positive NPV project.
We arrived at three main conclusions when evaluating the opportunity to install an artificial albedo enhancing ground cover.
The ground cover material showed a lot of promise. But even if a project with notable positive NPV were identified, some testing still is required to prove the long-term durability, degradation rates, and validation of the installation labor and O&M.
We look forward to working with industry partners to further review and analyze–and hopefully deploy–this material on one of our bifacial projects in the near future.

The lawsuit also alleges that the charge violates Wisconsin’s landmark Energy Priorities Law, which requires maximizing energy conservation, efficiency, and solar generation.
“Wisconsin’s highest-in-the-Midwest fixed charges discourage conservation and local, clean energy investment,” said Vote Solar’s Midwest Regulatory Director, Will Kenworthy.
Fixed charges are not new and have long been a point of contention between utilities and residential solar advocates, who argue that the fixed rate undermines the bill savings that solar customers are trying to achieve. The rates also may add time to solar system payback periods, further hampering customers’ efforts to save money.
The lawsuit also asserts that the charge is discriminatory towards low-use customers and those on fixed incomes, especially retirees and customers living in smaller homes and apartments.
“We’ve all seen that the climate crisis and undeniable economic disparities require us to reevaluate our systems and how we operate our society,” said Sierra Club Wisconsin Chapter Director, Elizabeth Ward. “MGE’s inequitable rates undermine the progress we need.”
In addition to alleged discrimination, the lawsuit also calls out the Wisconsin Public Service Commission’s decision not to hold a hearing before allowing MGE to recover more than $20 million it over-collected. The lawsuit argues that these funds, which were gathered through customers’ bills, are owed to those customers.
Fixed charges have been a point of contention previously in the state. In 2016, regulators approved Wisconsin Power and Light’s proposal to raise the utility’s fixed charge from $7.67 to $15 a month for residential customers, and from $7.67 to $17 a month for commercial customers.
Update 2/5/21: This article has been corrected to reflect that Sierra Club and Vote Solar are involved in a lawsuit with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, not Madison Gas and Electric, and that Madison Gas and Electric’s fixed charge has not been instituted recently.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/29/delaware-legislature-approves-boost-to-renewable-portfolio-standard/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,DELAWARE,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 29, 2021",Delaware legislature approves boost to renewable portfolio standard,"Delaware lawmakers passed a bill to increase the state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). S.B.33, sponsored by Sen. Stephanie Hansen and Rep. Ed Osienski, now goes to Gov. John Carney for his signature.
According to the bill sponsors, Delaware is on track to meet its existing RPS goal of 25% renewable energy by 2025. S.B.33 would extend the standard for regulated utilities and gradually increase it each year until reaching 40% by 2035.
The RPS solar carve-out would nearly triple from 3.5% by 2025 to 10% by 2035.
Osienski called RPS policies an “effective solution to transitioning away from harmful fossil fuels” and said it “makes good sense” to establish higher goals for Delaware.
However, environmental group Sierra Club argued the proposed 40% by 2035 target doesn’t go high enough.
“While Senator Hansen’s bill importantly raises the state’s dismal renewable energy standard, it still leaves Delaware far behind virtually every state in the region, most of which have 50% or higher renewable energy commitments during the same timeline,” said Sherri Evans-Stanton, director of the group’s Delaware chapter.
The Sierra Club said it plans to work with state lawmakers on future energy legislation.
According to the bill sponsors, S.B.33 would settle a dispute over cost caps for renewable energy credits by establishing a maximum price and alternative compliance payments, should the cost of these credits rise unexpectedly.
Sponsors claimed this market-based mechanism would replace existing cost cap provisions, end ongoing litigation on the subject, and protect ratepayers.
Carney has expressed support for the RPS update and is expected to sign the bill into law.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/29/massachusetts-lawmakers-re-pass-vetoed-climate-bill/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 29, 2021",Massachusetts lawmakers re-pass vetoed climate bill,"The Massachusetts state legislature again passed a sweeping climate change bill, setting the stage for a potential showdown with Gov. Charlie Baker.
The governor had “reluctantly” vetoed the legislation earlier this month. Although Baker said he largely supported the bill’s goals, he argued some of its provisions were misguided, overly ambitious, costly, and potentially damaging to the housing development market.
Because the bill, “An Act Creating a Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy,” was first passed right before the legislative session ended, Baker couldn’t send it back in time for amendments. Similarly, lawmakers didn’t have enough time to override the veto.
Following Baker’s decision, Senate President Karen E. Spilka and House Speaker Ronald Mariano vowed to immediately refile the bill in the new legislative session. Now, both chambers have passed the bill a second time, and sent it back to the governor’s desk on January 28.
The bill retains the same host of ambitious environmental, social, and clean energy goals. Many provisions are designed to help boost the state’s solar market, including net metering changes and a long-awaited tax compromise to provide greater certainty.
In a statement, Spilka said, “Time is of the essence, and we could not let a delay hamper our efforts to protect future generations.”
Several energy and environmental groups had denounced Baker’s veto, and applauded the state legislature for following through on its promise to resurrect the bill.
“Passing climate change and environmental justice legislation twice in a month sends a clear message: urgent challenges demand urgent action,” said Stephan Roundtree Jr., Northeast director of Vote Solar.
If a compromise is needed, there’s enough time in the new legislative session for lawmakers and Baker to negotiate. However, because the bill passed with a supermajority, the legislature could override a potential veto.
According to local reports, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said the Baker administration “looks forward to engaging in productive discussions with lawmakers and stakeholders.”

The company worked with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) to develop what GM is calling “a vision of an all-electric future” as well as “an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.”
“With this extraordinary step forward, GM is making it crystal clear that taking action to eliminate pollution from all new light-duty vehicles by 2035 is an essential element of any automaker’s business plan,” said EDF President Fred Krupp.
To reach its goals, GM plans to transition to battery electric vehicles or other zero-emissions vehicle technology, source renewable energy, and leverage “minimal offsets or credits.”
The automaker said that it believes that the energy sector is “well on its way to a decarbonized grid” and that an all-electric future will be supported by renewable infrastructure and technology.

GM said it will offer 30 all-electric models globally by mid-decade and that 40% of the company’s U.S. models offered will be battery electric vehicles by the end of 2025. GM is investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, up from $20 billion planned a year ago.
The planned investment includes ongoing development of GM’s Ultium battery technology, updating facilities such as Factory ZERO in Michigan and Spring Hill Manufacturing in Tennessee to build electric vehicles from globally sourced parts, and investing in new sites like Ultium Cells in Ohio as well as manufacturing and STEM jobs.
The Ultium battery system is based on a modified chemistry for lithium-ion cells that is intended to reduce battery cost and improve performance. EVs typically make use of an NMC chemistry that is made up of nickel, manganese, and cobalt coatings on the cathodes. The Ultium cells add aluminum, enabling the cobalt content to be reduced by 70%.
GM said its batteries are designed with large-format, pouch-style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. It said this configuration will allow engineers to optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. The battery platform is designed to charge more than 100 miles of range in 10 minutes.
The automaker said that more than half of its capital spending and product development team will be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs.
Renewable Energy
GM also said it will source 100% renewable energy to power its U.S. sites by 2030 and global sites by 2035. The company said that target represents a five-year acceleration of its previously announced global goal. GM said it already ranks among the largest off-takers of renewable energy in the world.
GM said it also expects to invest in carbon credits or offsets. The company said it recognizes that offsets “must be used sparingly” and should reflect a “holistic view of mitigating the effects of climate change and helping people thrive around the world.”
The company is working with EVgo to triple the size of a nationwide electric vehicle fast-charging network by adding more than 2,700 fast chargers by the end of 2025. GM said the move will help foster widespread electric vehicle adoption.
General Motors, its subsidiaries, and its joint venture entities sell vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Baojun and Wuling brands.
Siemens Energy said it will design, build and commission a battery energy storage system with black-start capability at the Marsh Landing Generating Station near Antioch, Calif.
Black-start capabilities will allow the station to restart the flow of electricity to the facility’s auxiliary systems without the support of an external power supply in the case of an outage or blackout. The BESS will be designed to support up to three attempts to restart a unit at Marsh Landing within one hour.
Kiewit
As described in a 2018 filing with the California Energy Commission, the black start project consists of installing up to a 7 MW/3.6 MWh lithium-ion BESS to provide black start capability to the Unit 3 and 4 gas turbines. The BESS consists of seven Li-ion battery banks installed in two metal enclosures.  The project also will involve transformers to increase voltage; switch gear to integrate the BESS into the broader Marsh Landing system; electrical, civil and structural engineering; and control system modifications.
“Battery storage systems like this one are capable of fully restarting power on a highly expedited basis,” said Laura Anderson, senior vice president, Controls and Digitalization for Siemens Energy North America.
The Marsh Landing Generating Station is a four-unit simple-cycle plant. It entered commercial service in 2013 and can provide 720 MW of electricity to the California grid. Siemens Energy supplied the four gas turbines, four generators, the SPPA-T3000 distributed control system and auxiliary and secondary systems for the plant.
Work on the BESS is under way, with the project scheduled to commence in early-summer 2021.
Lightsource bp today entered into a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Verizon Communications Inc. that will enable construction of a 152.5 MW solar farm in Indiana. The Bellflower solar farm, around 40 miles east of Indianapolis, is expected to become operational in 2022.
In 2020, Verizon issued its second $1 billion green bond, which will be used to fund long-term renewable energy purchase agreements, including this agreement with Lightsource bp. The project will be part of university research on the benefits of co-locating pollinator habitat and solar installations.
