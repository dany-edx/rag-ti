To meet this need, Raptor Maps, a provider of solar lifecycle management software, has released an enterprise-grade warranty claims product with JinkoSolar, one of the largest  module manufacturers in the world.
“It is particularly exciting to have JinkoSolar as a launch partner, as they share our mission of enabling customers to scale solar operations in the long-term,” describes Raptor Maps CEO and co-founder Nikhil Vadhavkar, noting that JinkoSolar modules are accepted by 85 financial institutions. “In addition to providing better tools and guidance for boots-on-the-ground workers, we enable JinkoSolar to track in-field performance of their modules to monitor trends and proactively engage with customers.”
Raptor Maps is a U.S.-based solar software company and its flagship product, Raptor Solar, enables data-driven asset management for commercial and industrial portfolios. The company said its new software provides a solution to a historically complex process by fusing robotically-captured inspection data with both in-field and manufacturer-supplied data. Warranty submissions allow for an auditable data log and enable status updates.

“Our U.S.-based support team takes pride in being the most trusted supplier of solar and energy storage equipment in North America,” explains Nigel Cockroft, general manager of JinkoSolar (U.S.) Inc. “Our commitment to customer success and long-term partnerships has earned us that trust. We are proud to be Raptor Maps’ launch partner, which helps us achieve this mission and provide a top-tier experience for JinkoSolar customers.”
To date Raptor Maps has provided analytics for over 65 GW of solar installations in 40 countries. JinkoSolar has built a vertically integrated solar product value chain, with an integrated annual capacity of 43.0 GW for mono wafers, 42.0 GW for solar cells, and 50.0 GW for solar modules, as of June 30, 2022.

The company has manufacturing facilities in Spain and Saudi Arabia, and has been a market leader in European and Middle East markets since 2018. Now, the company is set to make a splash in the U.S. market, as it announced it will build a Texas-based facility to manufacture its products.
The company said it expects the 6 GW factory to be operational by June 2023, supplying its product for projects across North America. PVH said most companies sign sourcing agreements with a wide set of providers, but it operates differently. The company said it controls every aspect of its product, from buying its own steel, sourcing electronics to building its own controllers, making its own rivets, owning its robotics, and paying for in-house PVH labor. The site will be the company’s third wholly-owned factory globally.
“The solar industry is one of the most challenging in terms of execution times. We are building bigger plants than ever in a shorter period of time, it is an impossible task if it’s not well supported by suppliers. Thanks to PVH, we are able to received the material in the shortest time imaginable and start construction on schedule despite challenging market dynamics and supply chain disruptions. A dedicated manufacturing line is essential for short and timely deliveries,” aid Hitesh Patel, head of solar PV, KSA.
PVH has operated in the U.S. since its founding in California in 2011. The company has supplied over 2.5 GW across 36 photovoltaic projects across the country. The company’s manufacturing playbook for solar is planned well in advance, and the company is currently buying goods for 2025 plans. The new factory will allow PVH to rely on local materials and workforce, boosting the economy and contributing capacity to the expected rapid growth of solar across the United States.
The announcement is the latest in a wave of cleantech manufacturing developments following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has numerous incentives across the supply chain, including:
Across the solar supply chain, the IRA includes the following credits:
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.

And instead of thousands of power plants acting in concert, there will be tens of millions of virtual power plants.
But again – it comes down to the inverters communicating across the grid – and that can present challenges.
The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) published research detailing multiple grid events that produced solar power outages across a region. One pattern that has arisen is that a grid asset abnormality occurs, like power plants tripping or fires causing shorts. Solar assets react by lowering output for a short to medium amounts of time, versus ‘riding through’ these events.

In prior pv magazine USA coverage, a West Texas event earned a NERC analysis after a single-line-to-ground fault on a generator step-up transformer at a combined-cycle power plant led to a reduction of 1,178 MW of solar PV resources – up to 200 miles away. NERC later released Multiple Solar PV Disturbances in CAISO, which described why more than 100 utility scale solar plants, and a significant amount of distributed solar, shed gigawatts of capacity during grid fault events in the spring and summer of 2021.
NERC has now released an analysis of the Blue Cut and Canyon 2 Fire disturbances of August 2016, and October 2017, respectively. The report is a product of ongoing work by the Inverter-Based Resource Performance Task Force.
The report notes that the Blue Cut Fire caused a 500 kV line fault and led to a temporary loss of 1,178 MW of solar generation. NERC stated that inverters were tripping erroneously on instantaneous frequency measurements, and that a majority of the units quickly ceased injecting energy into the system when voltage measurements fell outside of a standard range.

The Canyon 2 fire caused ‘phase-to-phase’ faults on 220 kV and 500 kV transmission lines. These events caused the reduction of solar output “across a wide region of the Southern California Edison footprint.”
It was suggested that the main issue of the Blue Cut Fire (inverters tripping on calculated frequencies) was ‘mitigated at Canyon 2. However, a list of additional challenges were noted:
NERC also suggested that “transient interactions between momentary cessation, transient overvoltage, and in-plant shunt compensation” will warrant further investigation.
Prior reports have suggested that many inverter problems could be solved by correcting settings or performing basic updates.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/08/agrivoltaics-co-locating-solar-and-agriculture-yields-mutual-benefits/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,ARIZONA,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022",Agrivoltaics: Co-locating solar and agriculture yields mutual benefits,"Solar energy is central to models of environmental sustainability, but not all projects are built the same. One concern in energy development, renewable or otherwise, is the concept of “energy sprawl,” which is the dedication of land for energy production and distribution.
Environment California estimates rooftop solar could prevent the development of 148,000 acres of land versus a ground mounted utility-scale only model. This is based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW of rooftop solar through 2045 in order to meet clean energy goals. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles that could be preserved.
Solar is hailed for its ability to be integrated into the built environment, placed on rooftops, integrated into building facades, on carports, etc. However, in order to meet aggressive decarbonization goals and achieve a 100% renewable energy system, ground-mounted solar will be also needed. This is where agrivoltaics, the practice of co-locating solar energy production with agricultural functions, can step in.
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland. At a global scale, it is estimated that 1% of all farmland could produce the world’s energy needs if converted to solar PV.
Biosphere 2
Agrivoltaics does more than preserve land and make the most of an acre. There are synergies between the solar arrays and the agricultural activities below.
For example, a team of researchers with the University of Arizona, which operate an agrivoltaic test center at the Biosphere 2, a fully self-contained indoor “natural” environment, found that crops improve solar array performance, and the solar arrays improve crop yield in dry environments.
The Biosphere team found that the shade provided by the photovoltaic system reduced evaporation, meaning that water would stay on the surface longer and better feed crops than open-air land-based agriculture. Not only does this save water, but it makes the plants grow stronger, leading to a better crop yield. Additionally, the shaded space provided by the panels causes plants to spread out, searching for sunlight. In the trials, the agrivoltaic-shaded leaf was nearly twice the size of the open-air one.
In dry climates like the one that surrounds Biosphere 2, there can often be too much light and heat for plants to grow properly. The panel’s shade helps create better conditions for the plants. The same goes for solar panels, which produce less power at high temperatures. A conventional solar facility may remove all vegetation below, which, in large solar arrays, causes a studied effect of a heat island.
Excess sun energy that isn’t converted to electricity can leave the area in two ways: either as latent heat or sensible heat. Sensible heat is the type that we can feel, and the type that is damaging to solar PV production. Latent heat is the energy that is absorbed by nearby water, evaporating into vapor. By adding crops below in a dry climate, you are adding more latent heat absorption, taking heat pressure off the panels, and boosting production and lifecycle.
Dry-climate farmers may enjoy working with agrivoltaics, too. Preliminary data from the center suggests skin temperatures are about 20 degrees Fahrenheit lower than open-air farming.
InSPIRE project
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is exploring many possibilities for agrivoltiacs, including placing cattle or sheep, crops, pollinator-friendly native plants, or soil rehabilitation and other ecosystem services in the same plot of land as active solar arrays.
NREL’s main research project on agrivoltaics is called Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE). The InSPIRE project developed a financial calculator to quantify the benefits of the practice. It also developed a list of best practices for those interested in entering the field. Additionally, InSPIRE tracks all the active agrivoltaics site across the U.S., which can be found here.
“Through our work, which spans multiple regions, configurations, and agricultural activities, we’ve seen so many initial promising results,” said Jordan Macknick, NREL’s lead energy-water-land analyst and principal investigator for the InSPIRE project. “Now, our challenge is to figure out how to scale up and replicate these successes.”
NREL also developed a set of five basic principles for success in agrivoltaics, called the five C’s:
InSPIRE represents the largest, longest-running, and most comprehensive agrivoltaics research effort in the world, spanning 28 sites in 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Some of these sites involve direct research, some involve research design and consideration, and some involve ongoing consultation and mentoring of partners.
“One thing InSPIRE has done really well is to create a community of people who are thinking differently about PV solar design and management. Universally, following an InSPIRE conference call hearing scientists and industry practitioners share their results, there’s tremendous energy and optimism for the challenge and opportunity ahead of us,” said Rob Davis of Connexus Energy, the Midwest’s largest electric co-op.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/08/bi-directional-charging-approved-for-nissan-leaf-in-the-u-s/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022",Bi-directional charging approved for Nissan LEAF in the U.S.,"Bi-directional charging technology is used not only for charging electric cars, but it can also send the energy stored in the car’s battery back to the building or the grid. Now Nissan Leaf owners equipped with the Fermata Energy FE-15 bi-directional charger can also take advantage of that functionality.  According to Nissan, use of the approved charger will not impact the Nissan LEAF’s battery warranty.
The Fermata Energy Demand Charge Management application that works with the FE-15 charger continuously monitors a building’s electrical loads, and may draw on the Nissan LEAF’s energy to provide power to the building during high-demand periods when energy costs are high. In states with utility demand response programs, bi-directional-enabled Nissan LEAF vehicles (2013 and later) are able to safely send energy stored in the battery to the grid during peak energy demand times, such as in summer months.
“We applaud Nissan for their ongoing leadership in delivering new, meaningful technologies to EV owners. V2X bidirectional charging is an important innovation that enables Nissan LEAF owners to create additional value from the energy stored in the vehicle’s battery. That value helps reduce the total cost of ownership of their car, while supporting grid resilience,” said David Slutzky, CEO and founder of Fermata Energy. “At Fermata Energy, we were the first to receive the UL 9741 certification in the world and now the first to have Nissan’s approval on a bidirectional charger in the U.S.”
The Fermata Energy bi-directional chargers are installed at multiple sites across the United States. In Colorado as part of a vehicle-to-build (V2B) program, the Fermata Energy platform has lowered the electric bills at the Boulder North Recreation Center, saving the city on average $270 per month, the approximate cost of leasing a Nissan LEAF in some markets.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) conservatively estimates that 130 million electric vehicles (EVs) will be on the road globally by 2030.  Bi-directional plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) offer an opportunity to support the grid, enhancing security, resilience and economic vitality. A bi-directional EV fleet could serve as both a clean transportation as well as an energy storage asset that could also create new revenue opportunities for EV owners or fleets. Fermata reports that the FE-15 bidirectional charger is available for commercial and government fleet owners.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/08/community-bank-tax-equity-financing-backs-11-6-mw-solar-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022",Community bank tax equity financing backs 11.6 MW solar portfolio,"With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, it’s now more important than ever for community solar projects take advantage of tax equity financing. KeyState Renewable’s SOLCAP solar tax equity fund is partnering with Renewable Properties, providing tax equity funding for its 11.6 MW Fund 6 Portfolio of community solar projects.
The Fund 6 Portfolio consists of three solar projects: the 5 MW Rock Island Road solar project in Gouverneur, New York and the 5.7 MW Bullis Road solar project in Marilla, New York—both of which were completed in the summer of 2022. The third is a nearly 1 MW qualifying facility project in Bourne, Mass., which was completed in December 2021. The three projects combined are expected to produce a total of 16,645,000 kWh of solar energy in their first year, or enough to power approximately 1,929 homes and reduce greenhouse emissions by 10,263 tons.
The recently passed IRA offers many incentives that use tax equity to enable renewable energy development, and will entice mid-size businesses and community banks to deploy capital into renewable energy projects across the U.S. KeyState Renewables and Corner Power launched the SOLCAP tax equity platform in 2019.  Since then, SOLCAP has funded 28 similar solar projects to date, totaling over 160 MWdc.
Renewable Properties has been working with SOLCAP since 2019 to develop a solar industry financing product that would lead to scale and efficiency, a partnership that led to the financing of these New York and Massachusetts projects in Fund 6. Renewable Properties and SOLCAP are now working together on new projects in Maine, North Carolina, and California.
“Great partners like SOLCAP are imperative for the solar industry to thrive,” said Allan Riska, chief investment officer for Renewable Properties. “Without tax equity investors, we would be further from accomplishing U.S. climate emission reduction targets. With so many tax equity-based incentives available to investors today, finding consistent tax equity partners can be challenging. That’s why it’s crucial to have strong investor partners like SOLCAP, which allows us to responsibly develop and own projects. Having a long-term and reliable partner is critical to building out more green infrastructure. We look forward to continuing our successful relationship with SOLCAP.”
SOLCAP has an additional 22 projects that are in development or under construction. Upon completion of all in-progress solar projects, SOLCAP projects will span seven states and it will have deployed over $200 million on behalf of its community and regional bank investors.
“Community banks are very logical tax equity investors for small-scale utility and community solar projects. Our SOLCAP tax equity fund platform allows community banks to efficiently deploy tax equity investments across a diversified portfolio of projects,” said Josh Miller, CEO of KeyState Renewables, the managing member of SOLCAP. “Renewable Properties has been a tremendous partner over the past four years. Their seasoned management team’s focus on small-scale utility and community solar projects is a perfect fit for our community bank investors. SOLCAP looks forward to being a stable, efficient source of solar tax equity for Renewable Properties for years to come.”
Renewable Properties is further expanding its portfolio with more community solar and locally-sited projects for its upcoming 32 MW Fund 7, which is expected to be fully funded in Q1 of 2023 and will continue a successful partnership with SOLCAP.
