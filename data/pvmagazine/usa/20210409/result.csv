In 2010, there were only a few community solar projects to speak of compared to 2,529 MW as of Q3 2020. Community solar is uniquely positioned to aid in America’s recovery from the current Covid-induced economic recession, especially in hard-hit communities. It provides jobs—both temp and long term—lower-cost energy, tax revenue, and lease revenue to landowners and agricultural producers, all while helping to address environmental injustices.
The drivers behind the growth of community solar vary, but one of the most important is that it is the only mechanism that enables a large portion of the market to access renewable energy. Without community solar, 77% of U.S. households wouldn’t be able to directly access solar energy, according to Greentech Media’s US Community Solar Market Outlook 2015 – 2020 report. By creating an opportunity for this previously untapped customer base to access solar energy, the U.S. community solar market has been able to grow rapidly during the last decade.
The economic benefits from this level of market expansion aren’t isolated to industry and company profits. It also comes with the important benefits of economic stimulation and job creation.
On a whole, the solar industry added jobs five times faster than the wider economy between 2014 and 2019, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And, with an expected 43%increase in installed capacity in 2021, that job growth isn’t expected to slow overall.
Local solar development specifically creates five more jobs on a per-megawatt basis compared to utility-scale electricity generation, according to the Local Solar Roadmap Report produced by the Coalition for Community Solar Access, Vote Solar, Vibrant Clean Energy, and Local Solar for All. This is largely a result of more construction and operations jobs. The report estimates that by integrating, optimizing, and growing local solar + storage, 1.4 million jobs could be created by 2050. That total could be as high as  2 million if there are associated clean electricity targets (this estimate includes direct and indirect jobs but does not include the ripple effect of direct economic impacts).

More  states are adopting community solar programs each year, and as they do, companies will need to hire local workers. Looking at New York as an example, Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced accelerated plans to help local governments and state agencies to build at least 40 community solar projects, part of the larger recently announced plan by the New York Power Authority’s goal to reach 75 MW of community solar projects by 2025. The community solar projects are expected to stimulate $135 million in investments and more than 1,250 short-term and long-term jobs.
Building solar in communities that have suffered as a result of economic shifts and from persistent pollution, including low-income rural and urban communities, communities of color, and Native communities provides opportunities for jobs and higher wages.
Local solar development brings economic benefits to the local community in the form of property taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, local permitting and siting fees, and more. This revenue is typically used to improve local public infrastructure or fund public projects, such as parks, school enhancements, and more.
At the heart of community solar’s purpose is to provide access to renewable energy and the associated cost savings for those who haven’t been able to take advantage, such as renters, income-constrained, or those who own properties not suitable for solar. Community solar subscribers typically save between 10-20% on their monthly energy costs. This cost savings lowers the “energy burden” that many low-income households experience.

Nationally, low-income households spend a larger portion of their income on home energy costs than other households. This measure is often referred to as a household’s “energy burden.” One recent study found that low-income households face an energy burden three times higher than other households. High energy burdens can threaten a household’s ability to pay for the energy and force tough choices between paying energy bills and buying food, medicine, or other essentials. By providing cost savings on energy, community solar is helping to alleviate the energy burden low-income households face.
Many community solar projects are built on rural or agricultural properties in order to benefit from economies of scale and to deliver energy more cleanly and efficiently to communities far from conventional power plants. This has provided an opportunity to rural landowners to make additional stable and consistent income from solar land leases, which are often 20-25 years in length. Solar lease payments tend to be higher than leasing land for traditional agricultural operations. What’s more, the consistent stream of revenue benefits the farmer by providing higher flexible income than by cultivating certain agricultural products, such as hay, or by leaving the land vacant.

The potential to monetize unused land for the agricultural communities of America will continue to be important given the economic downturn they have been experiencing. Rural landowners can make tens of thousands of dollars in revenue each year by leasing their land for community solar.
For community solar to realize its full potential of helping to accelerate economic recovery on the ground level, all 50 states need to establish community solar programs. If not statewide, then at least in specific disadvantaged communities.
By investing in a local and clean electricity grid, the U.S. will be repaid back many, many times over; and not to mention that studies show that local solar development combined with utility-scale solar and wind is the most cost-effective solution. The proper investment could result in 223 GW of new local solar by 2050, $473 billion in savings, and more than 2 million jobs. In addition to saving billions of dollars, expanding local solar + storage results in lower costs per kilowatt-hour (total system costs divided by total generation), translating into lower rates and customer savings.
To provide the necessary foundation for sustainable job creation and growth, states should incorporate incentives for local hiring when approving projects. They also should establish training and apprentice programs to train workers as part of the programs or in advance of a project breaking ground.
States that have not fully invested in community solar development by now have many examples of successful programs — such as New York, Massachusetts, and Minnesota — and the economic, environmental, and social benefits community solar has brought to their communities. Now is the time for all states to embrace community solar.

The bill is an effort to encourage retail customer investment in solar energy.
The bill is an amended version of House Bill 3310 and contains a provision stating that solar energy facilities located on and designed to meet “only the electrical needs of the premises of a retail electric customer” do not constitute a public service. The provision goes on to state that the system’s output should not be subject to a power purchase agreement with the retail electric customer.
The exemption would be subject to certain conditions, including that the aggregate of all power purchase agreements and net metering arrangements for any utility may not exceed 3% of the utility’s total customer peak demand for the previous year.
In short, the bill provides for lease arrangements, where a customer has a solar system installed on their roof, owns the array, and also buys the electricity that is generated.
Another of the bill’s provisions limits generation facility sizes to 25 kW for residential customers, 500 kW for commercial customers and 2,000 kW for industrial customers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/09/branson-group-is-rebuilding-another-hurricane-damaged-solar-array/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,UTILITY SCALE PV,U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 9, 2021",Branson group is rebuilding another hurricane-damaged solar array,"Sir Richard Branson’s BMR Energy group started construction on a 6.4- MW solar farm in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.
The facility is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter and will sell power to the Virgin Island Power and Water Authority (VIWAPA) under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
The facility is being built on the site of a former 4.8 MW solar facility that suffered damage during the 2017 hurricane season. BMR agreed to acquire the site in 2019 from a unit of AES; it closed on the purchase last summer. The new facility incorporates design and construction features aimed at increasing equipment strength and resilience to future windstorms.
The solar farm will include more than 14,000 photovoltaic modules and has been designed with strengthened racking, foundations, and module connection systems to withstand wind speeds up to 180 mph. The three main equipment suppliers are Polar Racking, Longi solar modules, and Delta inverters.
This will be the second project BMR Energy will operate to provide electricity for the utility.
The Spanish Town Estate in St. Croix, USVI, solar farm had been in operation since 2015, but experienced significant damage after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The plant’s electrical equipment, including the inverters, suffered extreme water damage after a roof fan of the structure housing the equipment blew out. Other electronic equipment and many solar modules were severely damaged during a static surge.
BMR Energy bought the damaged facility from NRG Energy to restore it. As part of its work, BMR replaced electrical equipment with new outdoor-rated materials with salt- and moisture-resistant coating, installed a new roof fan, repaired the damaged module arrays, and reinforced all supporting structures. The team also set up new storm preparedness operating procedures to regularly check grounding systems and guard against future static surges. The solar plant returned to full operation in November 2018 and produces up to 4 MW.
This story was updated on April 9 to include the main equipment suppliers.

To stay up to date on what’s new, check out this latest cleantech product roundup:
A battery system known as Switching Battery is expected to be commercially available in early 2022, enabling  electric vehicle (EV) charging from renewable energy directly. The company claimed it does two things differently compared to non-switchable batteries. First, it charges and discharges the batteries using two independent switching circuits at 50-60Hz with transistor switches. Second, the switching circuits enables a new “voltage shifting” technology.
The battery uses what the company said is a new technique for energy flow called “voltage shifting” in which the first battery circuit is connected to the renewable power source in parallel initially to be charged. The circuits then switch to a second battery circuit that is timed and connected to the load in series, enabling a higher voltage to the load. Voltage shifting technology may be useful where there is a space constraint for solar panels, such as in electric vehicles. More information is available here.
Arctech Solar said that its two-module-in-portrait (2P) tracker SkySmart II received UL3703 and CSA certification from Intertek, meaning the product may be used in the North American solar market. Arctech said it has signed deals to supply nearly 20 MW of SkySmart II to two U.S. projects. The UL/ cUL certification addressed solar tracking system functions concerning the risk of electric shock, mechanical and fire hazards.
The company said its SkySmart II features a multi-point drive system that raises wind speed and is expected to increase stability and reliable performance under strong wind conditions. The 2P tracker requires nine foundation posts per tracker and shorter modules, reducing construction costs and offering better adaptability to different terrains. It is compatible with oversized and bifacial PV modules. More information is available here.
Power line sensor company LineVision said it closed its Series B financing round, raising $12.5 million. The round was led by UP Partners, a Los Angeles-based electrification and mobility fund. LineVision’s sensors collect real-time data on critical parameters of overhead power lines including line temperature, sag, horizontal motion, and anomalies.
National Grid is currently using LineVision’s V3 platform to assess conductor asset health, obtain greater situational awareness, and increase transmission line capacity with Dynamic Line Ratings. The technology is expected to help integrate more renewable energy resources by optimizing transmission lines. More information is available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/09/sunrise-brief-solar-is-poised-for-record-setting-growth-bnef-outlook-says/,"BUSINESS,EVENTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 9, 2021","Sunrise brief: Solar is poised for record-setting growth, BNEF outlook says","Hang on tight: Solar is about to see five years of record-setting large-scale capacity additions.
That’s the outlook from BloombergNEF’s (BNEF) latest 1H 2021 U.S. Renewable Energy Market Outlook. It said that the next 10 years will see the U.S. solar and wind fleet almost triple, even as the pace of cost declines slows.
It warned, however, that this pace of growth will “still not be enough to hit the Biden administration’s stated goal of decarbonizing the power sector by 2035.”
The forecast said that tax credits for both solar and wind will allow large-scale projects that are commissioned by the end of 2025 to offer lower costs to end users than those in the second half of the decade.
It predicts that the U.S. is about to enter “five years of record large-scale solar capacity additions” at a pace of more than 20 GW each year. Both large- and small-scale solar will grow during the years that tax credit extensions are available.
Over the coming decade, customer-sited solar capacity is forecast to add on average more than 8 GW a year. Over one-third of all new systems are expected to be built in California. Energy storage is forecast to become a greater factor for project economics as net metering is phased out.
Solar capacity additions over the decade are forecast to hit 287GW, while wind adds 115 GW of capacity.
The U.S. grid’s distribution systems are increasingly at risk from cyberattacks. Distribution systems are growing more vulnerable, in part because their industrial control systems increasingly allow remote access and connect to business networks. As a result, threat actors can use multiple techniques to access those systems and potentially disrupt operations.
Those are the conclusions of a new report by U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), which was asked to review cybersecurity issues related to the distribution network. It said the scale of potential impacts from such attacks on the distribution network is not well understood.
DOE cybersecurity plans do not fully address risks to the grid’s distribution systems, GAO said.

In March, pv magazine wrote that solar systems of all sizes could pose a risk to the grid in much the same way that an attack on a conventional power plant could result in widespread blackouts. The consequences of a cyberattack could be as minor as reducing a solar array’s power output, or as major as overloading a battery energy storage system to the point of failure. In a worst-case scenario, an intruder could initiate plausible, yet inappropriate commands that disable large portions of the grid.
The GAO report said that as the lead federal agency for the energy sector, the Department of Energy (DOE) has developed plans to implement the national cybersecurity strategy for the grid, but these plans do not fully address risks to the grid’s distribution systems. For example, the report said that DOE’s plans do not address distribution systems’ vulnerabilities related to supply chains.
According to officials interviewed for the report, DOE has not fully addressed such risks in its plans because it has prioritized addressing risks to the grid’s generation and transmission systems.
Q CELLS said it held onto top market share in the U.S. residential and commercial solar module markets, according to the Q1 2021 U.S. PV Leaderboard report by Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. Q CELLS said it obtained 24.8% market share in the U.S. residential market for FY 2020, marking 10 consecutive quarters at the No.1 position. The Leaderboard report also ranked Q CELLS as the U.S. commercial market leader with a 19.1% market share, up from FY 2019.
The American Solar Energy Society (ASES) said that it National Solar Tour will take place virtually and in neighborhoods the weekend of October 2-3. The ASES National Solar Tour is a collection of local solar tours, as well as standalone solar sites across the country, and offers an opportunity for local solar advocates to share their solar story with others.
The deadline to sign up is August 15. More information is available here.
