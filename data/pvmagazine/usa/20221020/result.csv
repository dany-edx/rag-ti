Manufacturers of electric vehicle batteries and grid-scale energy storage received a combined $2.8 billion to build and expand commercial-scale facilities in 12 states. 
The funds will support organizations that extract and process lithium, graphite and other battery materials, manufacture components, and demonstrate new approaches, including manufacturing components from recycled materials. 
This federal investment will be matched by recipients, leveraging a combined total of more than $9 billion to boost American clean energy technologies. 
“This is truly a remarkable time for manufacturing in America, as President Biden’s Agenda and historic investments supercharge the private sector to ensure our clean energy future is American-made,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Producing advanced batteries and components here at home will accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to meet the strong demand for electric vehicles, creating more good-paying jobs across the country.” 
Award recipients 
One of the recipients of funds was Koura, an Orbia company. The company received $100 million to support the manufacture of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) batteries. Koura will expand a facility on its existing site in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. Once operational, Koura expects the plant to produce up to 10,000 MT of LiPF6 each year. 
The future is powered by lithium-ion batteries. We are uniquely positioned to innovate with our ‘mine-to-market’ capability to meet modern needs for resilience and energy independence,” said Koura president Gregg Smith. 
Entek was another recipient of DOE funds. The company has over 35 years of experience producing battery separators for batteries to support electric, advanced start-stop and standard vehicles, trucks, emergency vehicles, emergency backup power, utility scale energy storage, and industrial batteries. It is a U.S. based producer of ‘wet-process’ separator for lithium batteries and continues to invest in the future of the domestic lithium battery industry. 
Another $100 million award was approved for Group14 Technologies, a global manufacturer and supplier of silicon battery technology. Group14 is building a battery materials manufacturing facility in Washington state. The company is already manufacturing its silicon battery technology at commercial scale today, and Group14 will leverage the funding from the DOE to expand the capacity of a secondary site to meet rising EV battery demand. Group14 launched in April of last year and raised $400 million in a funding round led by Porsche AG to support the construction of its second battery fabrication facility. 
“With our growing footprint in the Pacific Northwest, we’re answering the call for ‘all-American’ batteries and remain steadfastly committed to building out a fully end-to-end domestic battery supply chain to help the U.S. stay ahead in the electrification race,” said Rick Luebbe, CEO and co-founder of Group14. 
Massachusetts-based 6k received a $50 million award for production of engineered materials for lithium-ion batteries and additive manufacturing. The company uses a proprietary plasma technology for its materials processing. The funds will be joined by 6K’s investment of $57 million in a full-scale battery material manufacturing plant to be built in the southeast United States. 
“We are at a tipping point where investments in transformational technologies like our UniMelt microwave plasma will set us apart from China to help drive America’s energy independence,” said Dr. Aaron Bent, CEO for 6K. “As the popularity of electric vehicles escalates and clean energy technologies like wind, hydro and solar are deployed, the urgency for domestic battery material production to support cell manufacturing and battery storage will become vital. Battery material processing on US soil will support our critical infrastructure and de-risk supply chain availability while strengthening our national security and US competitiveness.” 
Albemarle Corporation, a global specialty chemicals company specializing in lithium, bromine and catalysts, has been awarded a nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the first set of projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The grant is intended to help finance construction of a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at Albemarle’s facility at Kings Mountain, North Carolina.

ISS has an eleven-year track record of delivering utility-scale solar projects across the United States. 
The company currently has an active solar project pipeline of 10 GW, much of it focused on the booming market of Texas. ISS said Texas utility-scale projects are particularly appealing as funding these assets typically cost $1 per Watt in total costs, but can be sold on or before commercial operation date for $2 to $3 per Watt to long term owner-operators. 
ISS said it has 1.5 GW of Texas projects at or near Notice to Proceed (NTP), and expects to have another 1.5 GW in Texas ready to build within the next 12 to 15 months. The company values the 3 GW of Texas projects at $3 billion to construct, but expects the sale of these completed projects to be worth $6 billion to $9 billion. 
The company was founded in 2011 in Asheville, North Carolina. It has constructed 2.4 GW of solar projects in the past eight years, and currently has a staff of 26 employees. ISS also currently has several projects for sale, including eight projects in Texas ranging from 85 MW to 385 MW in capacity. 
As of late last year, Texas’ grid controller ERCOT projects that as much as 31 GW of solar may be deployed in 2023, the most of any state in the United States. This deployment may be joined by as much as 40 GW of wind deployment and 4.5 GW of energy storage in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/20/tesla-proposes-enabling-renewables-developers-to-estimate-a-projects-interconnection-costs/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Tesla proposes enabling renewables developers to estimate a project’s interconnection costs,"Developers deciding whether to submit interconnection requests for large-scale renewables or storage should be allowed to perform informational studies that estimate the cost of interconnection, Tesla said in comments on a proposed interconnection rulemaking, issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
FERC has instead proposed to require transmission providers to offer developers an informational interconnection study.
Tesla, known for its battery storage projects, said that FERC’s approach of relying on transmission providers to perform informational studies “threatens to consume already thinning transmission provider resources and delay customer projects.”
In contrast, developers, equipment manufacturers, and third parties acting on their behalf “are in a much better position to handle these studies and ensure their ultimate relevance to a specific project or group of projects,” Tesla said. These entities can assess not only different project locations but also different project control configurations “that might optimize available interconnection capacity and reduce the need for network upgrades.”
Non-synchronous generation such as battery storage, Tesla said, has more software features than traditional synchronous generation, “and transmission providers are not as familiar with the nuances of these software controls, making it more difficult for them” to account for software capabilities in informational studies.
For example, equipment manufacturers “can fine-tune aggregate plant controls regarding voltage and frequency stability at the point of interconnection, which can significantly influence the results of informational studies,” Tesla said.
Tesla estimated that “if provided the proper grid models and reports, we would be capable of conducting an informational study in less than two weeks,” allowing the firm to assess “many potential projects and points of interconnection, without burdening transmission providers.”
Tesla said its proposal would increase the likelihood that projects submitted for interconnection cluster studies are viable, and make it less likely that developers would alter or withdraw projects and trigger time-consuming interconnection restudies.
Grid models
To enable developers, equipment manufacturers and third parties to perform informational studies, Tesla asked FERC to direct transmission providers to furnish prospective interconnection customers with access to grid models, previous cluster studies, and cluster study models, subject to a standardized confidentiality agreement.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) already enables developers and manufacturers to conduct their own informational interconnection studies by furnishing customers with the necessary grid models to complete the analysis, Tesla said. The company recommended that high-level FERC staff and transmission provider staff “engage in cross-market discussions with AEMO” on this topic.
Tesla urged FERC to act quickly on recommendations from all commenters “to leverage the experience and knowledge-based resources” of manufacturers and developers “that can support significant and quickly scalable improvements to the generator interconnection process.”
Actual interconnection studies
Renewables-focused trade groups SEIA and Advanced Energy Economy (AEE) renewed in their comments a call to allow third parties to conduct actual, not informational, interconnection studies.
SEIA said “to the extent that transmission providers lack the resources” to complete interconnection studies, FERC should allow interconnection customers to use third-party consultants to produce required studies “in accordance with transmission provider standards and criteria.”
AEE said “interconnection customers should be given the option of using third-party consultants to produce required studies if transmission providers cannot do so accurately and on schedule.”
Comments from Tesla, SEIA and AEE are available via FERC’s docket search webpage, under docket #RM22-14-000.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/20/inside-the-ira-what-is-an-energy-community/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Inside the IRA: What is an Energy Community?,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers commercial solar and energy storage projects up to 10% additional tax credit for projects built within an “energy community.”
Starting on page 249 of the PDF on Congress’ website, in the section titled Special Rules for qualified Facility Located in Energy Community, the IRA defines energy community as:
These energy communities increase the available tax credit by 10% if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met or 2% if those requirements are not met for projects over 1 MWac. Residential projects do not qualify for the energy community bonus if owned by a private person, but if part of a commercial portfolio (like Sunrun), then they do qualify.
The 10% adder increases the tax credit from 30% to 40% (not from 30% to 33%). The additional 10% is transferable, just like the original 30%. If a project owner chooses the Production Tax Credit vs the Investment Tax Credit), the 10% increase applies there as well.
With all this cash on the table, the next question is – where are these energy communities located?
Energy Community Census Tract Map from Vibrant Clean Energy, full size image file

First, many parties seem to be exercising caution, and are waiting for the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service to release official opinions about what qualifies as an energy community. The IRS is seeking input from the industry on IRA questions, which will include these energy community questions. We should expect more official answers in the future, though it’s not exactly clear when that information will be released.
Additionally, multiple parties have reached out to pv magazine USA to express that the validity of any specific maps is up for argument at this point. They have suggested that the employment numbers might be used incorrectly, that EPA brownfields aren’t defined, and that the coal mine data is incomplete.
With that in mind, several parties have put together their own maps of energy communities, intended for public consumption (with caveats of course). And entrepreneurs are already aggressively chasing land that is presumably eligible for the added incentive.
Vibrant Clean Energy (VCE) released an analysis of low income and energy communities census tracts (see map above), according to their interpretation of the IRA. VCE is a company known for its wind and solar power forecasts. In its analysis, the group identifies brownfield sites, former coal communities and power plants, and former fossil fuel regions (oil and gas).
VCE’s analysis of former fossil communities notes that regions that have previously been defined as energy communities had ‘at least 0.17 percent fossil fuel employment’, and greater than ‘35 percent tax revenues affected’. VCE also notes that this definition of an energy community is expected to change over time, and must be updated annually.
VCE also makes available shape files of these tracts on their website.
S&P Global has created a gif that identifies the energy communities.
 
Based only on coal plant and mine closures, the group suggests that more than 2,800 individual census tracts would be eligible for the 10% adder. S&P Global Energy cites the EPA suggestion that there are between 500,000 and 1 million brownfield sites.
Census.gov states there are over 84,000 census tracts in the United States.
Resource.org has also put together its own maps, along with their sources, and a downloadable package of information for the more hands-on types. The group built their maps using EPA data for brownfield sites, EIA data for closed coal plants, and Office of Management and Budget maps for fossil fuel employment.
 
The most interesting part of the Resource.org maps is that they show how more than 39% of the United States could qualify for the 10% adder, based on fossil fuel employment and higher than average unemployment rates (shown in dark red in the map above).
Resource.org noted that they have an update coming to improve the accuracy of their maps, although the current model is already fairly accurate.
BTU Analytics, which provides market reports, consulting, and energy analysis tools, also released a series of maps. Their full maps and advanced data sets are available only to paying subscribers. In the team’s analysis they note there are still several questions to be answered before these maps finalize.
For example, they point out that geographic boundaries for brownfields are not publicly disclosed by the EPA and that they may vary in size from less than an acre to thousands of acres.

Data from BTU Analytics shows the volume of solar, wind, and energy storage projects that are already in the queue of various power grid regions, and are already located in energy communities. So far, there are already over 100 GW of projects in these queues.
Another interesting set of maps was put out by the global consulting firm Charles River Associates, and focuses specifically on the former coal communities of the United States. The authors note that as of 2022, a full 18% of the United States could be defined as former coal regions. That value is expected to increase to 20% or more by 2028, as additional coal facilities retire.
The group noted that they currently see 4,803 individual census tracts.

The region in the map above – from Illinois to Pennsylvania – is more than 46% covered with potentially viable census tracts. Nearly every tract in West Virginia is eligible, except for some land in the East.
Charles River Associates estimates that 59% of the three state regions of Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado are eligible.
Last, but certainly not least, are batch maps – along with their shape and data files – developed by Jesse Jenkins and the ZERO Lab team. While there are no specific details regarding the amount of eligible land, their map appears to show a very high percentage of potentially eligible regions.

Documentations from analysts and from the press have noted the potential for very high percentages of the nation to qualify as energy community regions – even more than the 39% predicted by Resources.org
Remember, the 10% adder begins in 2023, so remain cautious with your financial models until the IRS releases their official positions and documentation. And don’t forget that these maps will evolve in the coming years as fossil facilities shut down, and as employment and revenue numbers fluctuate.

“These energy communities increase the available tax credit by 10% if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met or 2% if those requirements are not met for projects over 1 MWac.” Also additional clarification was added on residential projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/20/albemarle-wins-grant-to-build-lithium-facility-in-north-carolina/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Albemarle wins grant to build lithium facility in North Carolina,"Albemarle Corporation, a global specialty chemicals company specializing in lithium, bromine and catalysts, has been awarded a nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the first set of projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The grant is intended to help finance construction of a new, commercial-scale U.S.-based lithium concentrator facility at Albemarle’s facility at Kings Mountain, North Carolina.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a landmark investment in roads, internet, bridges, water systems, transportation —  including electric vehicles and the advanced batteries to power those vehicles. Last year the Biden Administration set a goal of 50% of all new cars and trucks sold by 2030 to be electric vehicles. To meet this goal, and to ensure that materials are sourced domestically, a total of $2.8 billion in grants has been awarded to 20 companies in 12 states for the creation of domestically sourced battery-grade materials including lithium, graphite and nickel. Domestic sourcing is critical because 75% of battery manufacturing is done in China, and China controls nearly half the production of critical materials. “By undercutting U.S. manufacturers with their unfair subsidies and trade practices, China seized a significant portion of the market,” President Biden said recently in an address announcing award recipients. “Today we’re stepping up to take it back with bold goals to make sure we’re back in the game in a big way.”
Albemarle’s plans include the development of both the lithium concentrator and the mega-flex conversion facility, the proposed reopening of the Kings Mountain mine, and an active expansion of the Silver Peak facility. Construction of the new Albemarle concentrator facility is expected to create hundreds of construction and full-time jobs. When complete it will supply up to 350,000 metric tons per year of spodumene concentrate to the company’s previously announced mega-flex lithium conversion facility. The site of the mega-flex conversion facility has yet to be finalized, but, it is being designed to accommodate multiple feedstocks, including spodumene from the proposed reopening of the company’s hard rock mine in Kings Mountain; its existing lithium brine resources in Silver Peak, Nevada, and other global resources; as well as potential recycled lithium materials from existing batteries. Once complete, is expected to eventually produce up to 100,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium per year to support domestic manufacturing of up to 1.6 million EVs per year.
In addition to supporting the development of the concentrator, Albemarle will use a portion of the grant to support a $5 million mineral processing operator training program at Cleveland Community College, a $1.5 million minerals lab research program at Virginia Tech, and a $1.5 million minerals pilot plant and engineering training program at North Carolina State University’s Asheville Minerals Research Lab.
Albemarle CEO Kent Masters participated in the virtual White House event as part of the DOE award recipient announcement, reiterating Albemarle’s commitment to invest in the U.S. to source and process the critical materials used to make lithium-ion batteries.
“Albemarle is proud to partner with the federal government to bring manufacturing jobs to the southeastern United States, strengthening the domestic supply chain for the growing electric vehicle market. Receiving the DOE grant affirms Albemarle’s position as a global market leader and one of the only lithium companies currently producing battery-grade lithium from U.S. resources,” said Masters. “Expanding our U.S. footprint also increases the speed of lithium processing and reduces greenhouse gas emissions from long-distance transportation of raw minerals. We hope this project spurs additional investment by others in the domestic EV battery supply chain, such as cathode manufacturers, battery makers, and auto manufacturers.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/20/quinone-flow-battery-for-grid-scale-renewables-storage-now-close-to-commercial-viability/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 20, 2022",Quinone flow battery for grid-scale renewables storage now close to commercial viability,"U.S. startup Quino Energy, a spinoff of Harvard University, said it recently raised $3.3 million from a group of investors led by Japanese venture capital firm Anri. The sum collected through the funding round, which also involved Argentina’s Techint Group, will add to the $4.58 million grant that Quino Energy had previously secured from the US Department of Energy (DoE).
The company said it will use the funds to scale up its redox flow battery technology based on 2,6-dihydroxy-anthraquinone (DHAQ) – or more simply, anthraquinone or quinone.
“Harvard’s Office of Technology Development (OTD) has granted Quino Energy an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize energy storage systems using the chemistry identified by the labs, including quinone or hydroquinone compounds as the active materials in the electrolyte,” the startup said. “Quino’s founders believe the system may offer game-changing advantages in cost, safety, stability, and power.”
The company designed the battery based on previous research conducted by 16 scientists from the University of Cambridge and Harvard University. Quinone as the active material in the electrolyte eliminates the typical decomposition of chemically unstable redox-active species in redox flow batteries, which is the main factor affecting the storage capacity of such storage devices.
In the redox flow battery, DHAQ decomposes slowly over time, regardless of how many times battery cycles have been performed. When it is in contact with the air, after a cycle, this molecule absorbs oxygen and turns back into its original status.
For this reason, the researchers refer to the molecule as a “zombie quinone,” as it is kind of returning to life after being dead. They said redox flow batteries developed via this approach could offer a net lifetime that is 17 times longer than previous research has shown.
“For grid-scale stationary storage, you want to be able to run your city through the night and when the wind isn’t blowing, without burning fossil fuels. You might go two or three days without wind in a typical weather pattern, and you’ll certainly go eight hours without sunshine, so having a discharge duration at rated power of five to 20 hours can be a very useful thing,” Quino Energy said. “That’s the sweet spot for flow batteries, where we think they can be especially competitive versus the shorter-duration lithium-ion batteries.”
