This report tracks quarterly and annual volumes of orders, wafer material shipments and customer allocations.
On Friday, U.S. solar stocks traded up between 12% and 25% following the release of guidance from the U.S. Treasury on domestic content as it relates to the sourcing of American-made solar modules, hardware components under the federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Nextracker, an integrated tracking hardware and software supplier, was up 12.7%, with its stock trading at $40.03 per share, its highest trading performance since becoming a public company on February 8, 2023.
Tigo Energy
Tigo Energy, a distributor of inverters, optimizers and energy storage systems, reported $50.1 million in Q1 2023 revenue, up 406% from $9.9 million generated in Q1 2022, while the company also had its first successful profitable quarter, with $6.9 million net income.
“Looking ahead, our focus remains on providing an exceptional customer experience, including through our technology’s open architecture, easy installation, and powerful software,” said Zvi Alon, chief executive officer of Tigo Energy “We anticipate that we will close our previously announced merger transaction with Roth CH IV later this month and believe that this transformation will propel us into a successful second half of the year.”
The company provided Q2 2023 guidance with revenue expected of $70 million to $74 million.
In December 2022, Tigo announced a merger with special purpose acquisition company Roth CH IV, a SPAC funded by Roth Capital Partners and Craig-Hallum Capital Group, with $117 million of gross proceeds. Upon completion later this month, Tigo Energy will trade on the Nasdaq exchange under ticker ‘TYGO.’
Nextracker
Nextracker, a Fremont, Calif.-based solar tracking hardware and software solutions provider, reported $518.4 million in its fiscal Q4 2023 revenue and net income of $27.5 million for the quarter, its first quarter as a public company.
The company also reported full year revenue of $1.9 billion and net income of $121.3 million for FY 2023. Over the last year the hardware company saw a 90% increase to its backlog, growing to $2.6 billion, while the company executed multiple project portfolio contracts with owners and developers.
In 2023, Nextracker shipped 17 GW of hardware systems.
During its Q1 2023 earnings call, management said for customers that require domestic content, the company can accept orders for 70% to 80% of domestic content this year and in 2024 anticipated accepting orders for up to 90% domestic content.
“Our ability to grow revenue by 30% and earnings by over 120% for fiscal 2023, while posting our fifth consecutive year of profitability, reflects our leadership position in solar markets around the world, a global supply chain footprint supporting those operations, as well as solid execution across the business,” said Dan Shugar, chief executive officer of Nextracker.
The company provided fiscal year 2024 guidance with revenue expected of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, and net income in the range of $175 million to $205 million.
FTC Solar
FTC Solar, an Austin, Texas-based solar tracking hardware provider, reported $40.9 million in Q1 2023 revenue, a slight beat over the market consensus of $39 million, though down 17.5% year-over-year from $49.6 million of Q1 2022 revenue.
In Q1 2023, the company attributed strong bookings of $235 million to the United States’ continued enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which has banned since December 2021 the imports of various solar components from global suppliers from the Uyghur region of China that had seen forced labor violations.
“Results for Q1 came in at the high-end of our target ranges on all metrics,” said Sean Hunkler, president and chief executive officer of FTC Solar. “Our strategy is working, the multiple initiatives we’ve executed on over the past year are improving our operating performance. For example, our improved cost structure has enabled us to post our first positive gross margin since our IPO, one that is 14-points higher today than it was in the fourth quarter of 2021 when we had two and a half times the revenue, and one that is 57 points higher than just two quarters ago.”
The company provided Q2 2023 guidance of $42.5 million to $52.5 million revenue and continues to forecast egative earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of negative $3.5 million to $7 million as the company sees continual growth ahead since becoming a public company in April 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/12/wind-and-solar-energy-saved-texans-11-billion-in-2022/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TEXAS",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 12, 2023",Wind and solar energy saved Texans $11 billion in 2022,"A detailed examination of the Texas wholesale electricity market showed wind and solar power generation saved the state approximately $11 billion in 2022. This figure marks a nearly 300% increase from previous years. From 2010 to the end of 2022, wind and solar generation produced $31.5 billion in wholesale electricity savings, benefiting all Texas households.
This value is only expected to grow as wind and solar capacity fill the state’s power grid queue.

The report, led by Dr. Joshua Rhodes and produced by Ideasmiths, projects that expanding wind and solar capacity could save Texans between $6.1 billion and $15.2 billion per yeary, even as the state’s politicians fight tooth and nail against wind and solar project development.
The base calculation for these conclusions hinges on the idea that wind and solar energy, requiring no additional operating costs, induce high-priced power plants to shut down. In 2012, Dr. Rhodes discovered that wind and solar energy (predominantly wind at that time) reduced electricity pricing by just over a tenth of a cent per kWh. By 2022, this reduction had ballooned by 1,700% to over $0.02/kWh.
As a result, electricity pricing in 2022 was 26% lower than anticipated, with a base price of $0.062/kWh versus a projected $0.084/kWh.

From 2018 to 2022, these savings led to an average annual reduction of over $200 in electricity costs for the average Texas household. As wind and solar installation increases, this figure is expected to rise.
The analysis estimates that renewables will save between $21 billion and $43 billion in total from 2023 to 2025, provided that natural gas prices remain between $3.42/MMBTU and $7.34/MMBTU as forecast by the Energy Information Administration. At present, Henry Hub natural gas prices have fallen to near $2/MMBTU.
The report also calculated discrete savings in other areas, including sulfur oxide (SO2), nitrous oxide (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O).
Rhodes states that without renewables, fossil fuel burning power plants would have consumed an additional 252 billion gallons of water in a desert-like region often faced with water stress and frequent droughts. At $3 to $7 per thousand gallons of water, this implies savings of $800 million to $1.8 billion.

Adding the societal costs of SO2, NOx, and CO2, (which have a wide range of assigned values), Texans have saved an additional $10 to $77 billion in health and climate costs.
Including the $31 billion-plus in energy savings, it seems possible that Texans may have reaped financial benefits in excess of $100 billion from wind and solar installations since 2010.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/12/treasury-department-releases-guidance-on-solar-domestic-content/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 12, 2023",Treasury Department releases guidance on solar domestic content,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released guidance that provides detailed information about the domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Solar power projects that use domestic content are eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10%, to 40% in total, and 0.3 ¢/kWh for projects that use the Production Tax Credit.
The guidance allows developers to take advantage of the domestic content bonus credit for projects that begin construction this year. Additionally, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to propose that the forthcoming proposed regulations will apply to taxable years ending after May 12, 2023.
According to the IRS, “domestic content is generally defined as steel, iron or manufactured products that are manufactured or produced in the United States”.The guidance also clarifies the treatment of labor costs, to ensure the focus of the incentive remains on domestic manufacturing.
To assist taxpayers in determining the applicable steel, iron or manufactured product standards, the Treasury Department and the IRS are providing a safe harbor for certain types of clean energy projects. The Treasury Department welcomes input on how manufactured components are classified.
“The domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act will boost American manufacturing, including in iron and steel, so America’s workers and companies continue to benefit from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. These tax credits are key to driving investment and ensuring all Americans share in the growth of the clean energy economy,” said Janet L. Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury.
In addition to meeting the domestic manufacturing requirements, to be eligible for the bonus credit, projects must also meet one of the following requirements: 1) the project has a maximum net output of less than 1 MW of energy; 2) construction of the project began before January 29, 2023; or 3) the project satisfies the Inflation Reduction Act’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
“Having clear rules of the road is imperative for businesses seeking to invest in America’s clean energy future, and the domestic content guidance that was just released from the Treasury Department provides helpful clarity. We are encouraged by Treasury’s solutions to meet the manufactured product test, which are consistent with recommendations from ACORE and others, and we look forward to projects moving forward under this guidance immediately,” said Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
More than $13 billion of new manufacturing investments have been announced to date, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
“This highly anticipated guidance from the Treasury Department is an important step forward and will spark a flood of investment in American-made clean energy equipment and components,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA. “The U.S. solar and storage industry strongly supports onshoring a domestic clean energy supply chain, and today’s guidance will supplement the manufacturing renaissance that began when the historic Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed last summer.”
In addition to the tax credits for clean energy developers, the Inflation Reduction Act provides incentives for the build out of U.S. manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities.
Source: SEIA
SEIA estimates the IRA will lead to 47 GW of new module manufacturing capacity, over 16 GW of cells, more than 16 GW of ingots and wafers, nearly 9 GWac of inverters and well over 100 GWh of battery manufacturing (which serves the solar as well as the electric vehicle industry). SEIA also estimates that we can anticipate more than 20,000 tons of annual domestic polysilicon capacity coming back online and a multitude of new investments in tracker and racking capacity. And this is just the start—SEIA forecasts that we will see exponential growth in all of these sectors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/12/50-states-of-solar-incentives-colorado/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,COLORADO",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 12, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Colorado,"Colorado had installed about 2.3 GW of solar capacity through the end of 2022, enough to power the equivalent of over 450,000 homes, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA expects the state to more than double its capacity over the next five years, adding 3.2 GW along the way. 
The Rocky Mountain State is home to nearly 400 solar companies, employing over 7,000 people. It also is the site of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden. 
Over 6.3% of the state’s electricity generation comes from solar, higher than the national average. Colorado has over 300 sunny days per year and was among the first states to enact a renewable energy standard. 
Incentives 
Colorado was an early adopter of solar incentives, which may explain in part why it has the 13th most solar capacity among the states despite being the 21st most populated state. 
Residential solar customers are offered net metering, a program in which excess solar production is exported to the grid during the day and is credited for nighttime usage. The state’s largest utility, Xcel Energy, offers net metering for all projects 1 MW and smaller. Net metering helps secure a desirable return on investment for solar arrays, even when not paired with energy storage. 
Colorado also places tax exemptions on solar. There is no sales tax when purchasing a system, and it is property tax exempt, meaning that even though it will increase the value of your home, it will not increase your property taxes. 
Xcel Energy has a solar rewards program, under the program, you agree to sell renewable energy credits (RECs) to the utility in exchange for cash payments. RECs are intangible assets created by the generation of clean electricity. By agreeing to sell 20 years of RECs, Xcel will pay $0.07 per kWh for 10 years for the credits. This equates to a payment of $6,500 over 10 years for a 6 kW system. 
Holy Cross Energy offers $500 per kW up to 6 kW, and Energy Smart Colorado supports installations with rebates up to $2500 for Pitkin and Eagle County, Eagle Valley, Vail, and Summit County. 
Like all solar installations in the United States, Colorado solar projects are eligible for the federal Investment Tax Credit. The credit covers 30% of installed system costs, and can be rolled over year to year if the customer lacks the tax liability to take advantage of the credit in one tax session. 
Colorado also supports a microgrid grant program. Microgrids are a connected series of distributed energy resources like solar, paired with backup battery systems, and often connected with smart appliances and meters. Microgrids are particularly beneficial to communities that are exposed to extreme weather or experience frequent outages. Available to remote communities, the grant program allocates $400,000, with maximum individual rewards of $36,000. 
Notable installation 
On the edges of Boulder, Colorado sits Jack’s Solar Garden, a community garden that grows crops and local pollinator supporting plants. This community garden is far from ordinary, as it houses a 1.2 MW solar array that shares the same land as the crops below. 
Jack’s Solar Garden is the largest commercial agrivoltaics research site in the United States. The 24-acre plot is part of a research study being conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Colorado State University and the University of Arizona to understand the microclimates created by the panels and how they impact vegetation growth. 

The electricity generated by the single-axis tracker mounted array is enough to power 300 average Colorado homes annually. The power is sold to various subscribers via utility Xcel Energy’s Solar Rewards Community program, where customers receive a percentage of the net metered production as credits against their monthly electric bills.  
Fifty residents, five local businesses, and two local governments subscribe to the plant. Jack’s Solar Garden donates 2% of its power production to low-income households through the Boulder County Housing Authority. 
A study by Oregon State University showed wide-scale installation of agrivoltaic systems could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/12/new-york-law-allows-power-authority-to-build-renewable-projects/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 12, 2023",New York law allows power authority to build renewable projects,"This past week the State of New York passed a law in its 2024 budget that gives the New York Power Authority (NYPA), the state’s largest power authority, the ability to build renewable energy projects to help reach the state’s 2030 climate goals.
The Build Public Renewables Act is the result of about four years of clean energy policy initiatives and looks to solidify the Empire State as not just a leader in community solar deployments but also broader categories like offshore wind and standalone energy storage.
BPRA directs NYPA to plan, construct, and operate renewable energy projects in service of the state’s renewable energy goals, essentially giving the authority more power over clean energy directives than the previous 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which set greenhouse gas reduction goals of 70% for its power fleet to come from renewable energy while cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.
The new law includes several provisions that provide community solar access to low- and middle-income residents (LMI), as well as codified labor and energy justice provisions for workers displaced by fossil fuel projects.
BRPA requires NYPA to establish a LMI program allowing disadvantaged residents to receive credit on their monthly electric bils for renewable energy produced by the power authority.
In the labor category, the new law requires that workers or contractors hired for construction of clean energy projects be protected by a collective bargaining agreement framework. Under BRPA, employers must sign a memorandum of understanding with labor unions to uphold and protect fair pay rates, provide training and safety protocols for workers on such projects.
The new law provides priority to job candidates who previously worked in oil and gas industry roles, and provides a job training framework for retaining clean energy jobs. Starting in 2024, NYPA will begin to invest $25 million per year in workforce training programs for the renewables sector.
Another bold piece of the BPRA law is a bullet point calling for the removal of simple-cycle natural gas power plants, or peakers, in NYPA’s jurisdiction by 2030. The law requires that peakers be replaced with dispatchable clean energy projects such as energy storage, removing a source of daily air pollution that has been cited for health conditions such as asthma in and near urban environments.
BPRA was written in 2021 and failed to pass into state law for the past two legislative sessions. Assembly Member Sarahana Shrestha (D-Kingston) has been instrumental in pushing the clean energy policy through the assembly. According to Shrestha’s website, before serving in the assembly, the Nepali-American official was part of the Public Power NY Coalition, and held public events in support of the BPRA.
BPRA is codified as Assembly Bill A1466D and was sponsored by assembly members Robert Carroll (District 44 – Brooklyn), William Colton (District 47–Brooklyn), Jeffrey Dinowitz (District 81–Bronx) and Richard Gottfried (District 75–Manhattan).
According to the New York Research Development Authority (NYSERDA), the state’s energy development authority, through February 28, 2023 the state had 4.58 GW of solar deployments across 193,529 total projects.  The state enjoys a $1.98 per watt cost to install solar, an increase from $1.81/W in 2022, according to the NY Solar Map.
Industry reactions
The public power bill passed despite opposition from state and national trade groups Independent Power Producers of New York, the Alliance for Clean Energy New York (ACE-NY), and the Solar Energy Industries Association, among others.
In a joint letter to N.Y. Governor Kathy Hochul, six trade groups that include the ACE NY and SEIA said giving NYPA such authority “does not create a level playing field with the private sector.” They also raised concerns that the law does not address issues related to grid interconnection, upgrading power transmission systems or permitting processes.
“To meet its renewable energy mandates, we need the private sector to remain acutely interested in New York and aggressively develop, invest in, and build wind, solar, and battery storage energy projects. Our fear is that, if N.Y. state signals that it prefers that NYPA build the needed renewable energy and storage, the private sector will decide it is preferable to engage in the development process outside of N.Y.,” said the joint trade group.
ACE-NY members include national developers Cypress Creek Renewables, Avangrid, Invenergy and EDF Renewables North America.
Russell Wilcox, founder and chief executive officer of Urban Energy, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based rooftop solar canopy and storage installer, said: “The only way this will be a successful program is if they allow private companies to lease rooftops and provide clean energy in an open market without labor provisions. Increasing the cost of labor in rooftop solar beyond the competitive market will make these projects impossible to be competitive on an institutional finance level.”
“Unless New York State is willing to provide extremely low interest rate debt and tax equity financing, projects like this cannot afford the increased cost of labor and regulation. Companies like Urban Energy provide a living wage for all in-house laborers and provide a inclusive platform for great, high paying jobs. If we need to provide labor with prevailing wages, it will significantly slow deployment and make it impossible to meet the goals of the act,” Wilcox told pv magazine USA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/12/first-solar-acquires-perovskite-specialist-evolar/,"BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 12, 2023",First Solar acquires perovskite specialist Evolar,"From pv magazine global
First Solar said it is buying Swedish manufacturer Evolar AB in a bid to accelerate its efforts to develop tandem PV technology. The U.S. solar module maker will initially pay around $38 million, but it might later pay an additional $42 million, subject to certain technical milestones being achieved in the future.
First Solar said in a statement on Friday that the acquisition will accelerate the development of next generation PV technology, including high-efficiency tandem devices. It aims to integrate Evolar’s know-how with its existing research and development streams, intellectual property portfolio, and expertise in developing and commercially scaling thin-film PV.
“This acquisition supplements our existing R&D streams with expertise in thin film semiconductors that complement CadTel. We expect that it will accelerate our efforts to develop tandem technology that continues our commitment to ultra-low carbon, responsibly produced solar,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of First Solar.
Evolar, which was founded in 2019 by now-insolvent CIGS thin-film manufacturer Solibro, focuses on developing solutions, including manufacturing equipment, to commercialize tandem solar technology with perovskite thin films.
The company says that its unique evaporation technology enables it to apply a thin-film layer of perovskite, known as “PV Power Booster” technology, to increase cell energy yield by 25% at a minimal cost. It is currently in the process of commercializing its turnkey production line for perovskite cells, which can be seamlessly integrated into silicon production lines to upgrade tandem cell production.
Last year, Evolar put its encapsulated, semitransparent standalone perovskite modules through a series of industry-standard accelerated reliability tests. The results suggested that the cells could stand up to 25 years if deployed outdoors.
Evolar holds the current world record for CIGS research solar cells with an efficiency of 23.6%. The company collaborates closely with Uppsala University and has established a research laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden. This marks First Solar’s first R&D facility in Europe, although the terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
After the transaction closes, around 30 of Evolar’s R&D staff will join First Solar and collaborate with the company’s team of approximately 60 scientists at its research technology center in Santa Clara, California, and development teams in Perrysburg, Ohio.
The Perrysburg facility, representing an investment of up to $370 million announced in October 2022, is believed to be the first of its scale in the Western hemisphere. It is expected to accelerate the development and production of advanced thin film PV and tandem PV modules and is scheduled to be completed in 2024.
