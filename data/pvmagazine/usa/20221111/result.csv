Without the SEIA proposals S79-22 and S81-22, the proposal from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) under S76-22 was required to meet Risk Category 4 requirements, a more stringent risk category typically reserved for hospitals, fire, police and emergency services, buildings and infrastructure.
The SEIA proposals under S79-22 and S81-22 carve out a special category for the approval of solar and energy storage facilities.
“The extreme and overly burdensome code measures that would have been required under the FEMA proposal could have stifled clean energy growth without improving grid resilience,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA. “The resulting effect, whether intended or not, would have been a disastrous decrease in renewable energy projects while we aggressively strive to meet important climate goals.”
Prior to the SEIA proposals, more than 315 clean energy companies had called on the ICC to reject the FEMA S76-22 proposal that could have stifled U.S. clean energy progress.
According to SEIA, it balances a significant increase in the structural requirements for solar facilities with enough breathing room for project construction to move forward. FEMA officials themselves confirmed they support the proposals put forward by SEIA and supported by the Distributed Wind Energy Association (DWEA), according to oral testimony on Sept. 15 and a voter’s guide that FEMA sent to voters on Oct. 13.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/11/california-introduces-rooftop-solar-net-metering-3-0-an-industry-reacts/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022",California introduces rooftop solar net metering 3.0: An industry reacts,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has released its proposed decision for Net Energy Metering (NEM), implementing a net billing mechanism and slashing payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%. Based on an initial analysis, the new proposed decision would cut the average export rate in California from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, making the cuts effective in April 2023.
NEM has been a critical policy in launching the California rooftop solar market, which has grown to a robust 1.3 million homes covered with panels, representing about 50% of the US residential market. It has also been instrumental in launching the state’s commercial and industrial solar market.
Under the new net metering structure, payments for excess solar production to the grid will be cut to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a minute fraction of the retail rate paid by customers for electricity supplied by the grid. CPUC said the new proposed decision will lead to an average payback of nine years for residential rooftop solar, based on an assumption of a $3.30 cost per Watt. Read the complete proposed decision here.
There is still opportunity for the proposed NEM 3.0 decision to change after the final decision. ROTH Capital Partners managing director and senior research analyst Philip Shen said his firm expects the final decision to be made on December 15, 2022. If implemented, the “sunset date,” or last date by which projects can submit to interconnection to receive the preferable NEM 2.0 rates, would land on April 15, 2023.
Reaction
“The CPUC’s new proposed decision would really hurt. It needs more work or it will replace the solar tax with a steep solar decline. An immediate 75 percent reduction of net energy metering credits does not support a growing solar market in California. If passed as is, the CPUC’s proposal would protect utility monopolies and boost their profits, while making solar less affordable and delaying the goal of 100 percent clean energy. California needs more solar power and more solar-charged batteries, not less,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
“Maintaining a strong distributed solar and storage market is critical to California’s clean energy future. The CPUC rightly rejected proposals to impose unprecedented grid access fees on new solar and storage customers. However, additional work is needed to ensure a more gradual transition to net billing so that all Californians, including schools, farms and low-income residents can adopt solar and storage,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
“This is a temporary, strategic retreat from the indefensible solar tax the CPUC and utilities got caught trying to impose on rooftop solar owners. Even so, by slashing the payments rooftop solar can earn from selling clean, unused energy back to the grid, going forward this proposal will significantly compromise California’s greatest clean energy success story. One look at the changes the CPUC is proposing shows that they’re on an anti-solar trajectory,” said Environmental Working Group president and California resident Ken Cook.
“At a time when California needs rooftop solar to flourish, it’s risky to cut a key incentive without having a viable alternative in place. California’s decision-makers need to make rooftop solar as affordable and accessible as possible so that every household with solar potential can realistically make the choice to go solar. While the revised proposal eliminates the solar tax and protects current solar customers, it will make transitioning to solar power more expensive. If we want to protect the environment, our climate, and our health, we must keep rooftop solar growing and continue incentivizing the growth of clean, renewable energy across California,” said Laura Deehan, Environment California state director.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/11/due-to-forced-labor-concerns-u-s-ports-have-blocked-over-1000-shipments-of-solar-components/,"COVID-19,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022","Due to forced labor concerns, U.S. ports have blocked over 1,000 shipments of solar components","Reuters reported that over 1,000 shipments of solar energy components, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, have been blocked in U.S. ports under enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
The Xinjiang region of China, which is home to roughly 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, an essential material in conventional solar modules, has come under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Beijing has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor.
The UFLPA places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the region are made with forced labor, and it places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever. To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at a facility, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
Corporations like Coca-Cola and Nike lobbied against the UFLPA, as their supply chains are deeply woven into China’s economy.
Reuters was told by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that it has seized 1,053 shipments of solar energy equipment between June 21, when the UFLPA went into effect, and Oct. 25. Customs said none of the shipments have yet been released.
Three of Reuter’s sources were told the shipments include solar panels and polysilicon cells, adding up to 1 GW of capacity, and primarily made by three of the largest Chinese PV providers. This includes Trina Solar, JinkoSolar, and Longi, which together account for about one third of U.S. panel supply, said Reuters. Other reports have said the impact may be even larger than that.
In August, ROTH Capital Partners said over 3 GW of components were held up at Customs. It estimated that much as nine to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering U.S. markets by the end of the year.
In a press briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijan said forced labor allegations are, “the lie of the century fabricated by a small group of anti-China individuals.”
“The U.S. side should immediately stop the unreasonable suppression of China’s photovoltaic enterprises and release the seized solar panel components as fast as possible,” said Lijan.
Module supply challenges have been an ongoing issue in the United States, exacerbated by COVID-19 related shutdowns, increased shipping costs, semiconductor supply chain challenges, and the enforcement of the UFLPA and other trade and labor laws.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said solar developers across the United States planned to install 17.8 GW of capacity this year. However, through six months, only 4.2 GW had been brought online. From January through June 2022, about 20% of planned PV capacity was delayed, according to the EIA. Reports show solar installations were delayed by an average of 4.4 GW each month, compared with average monthly delays of 2.6 GW during the same period last year.
At the RE+ conference in Anaheim this September, marketing directors at Trina Solar told pv magazine they were confident in the high degree of traceability of its products and supporting supply chains.
“We realized supply chain can not be centralized in one place and customers also want independence. Our mid-term strategy is to have a clear fragmentation of products and markets, as well as geographically diversify our supply chain. Different markets require different supply chains,” said Helena Li, president of global cell and module business at Trina.
In an email, JinkoSolar said it is working with Customs Border Patrol on documentation proving its supplies are not linked to forced labor and is “confident the shipments will be admitted.”
“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said Marty Walsh, U.S. Secretary of Labor.

The framework detailed under parent company Allete’s IRP plan, called EnergyForward, dates back to early 2021. The current IRP more than doubles the amount of renewable energy to enter the state’s energy mix from the prior 2021 proposal that called for 200 MW of solar and 200 MW of wind development.
Minnesota Power devised a Solar Energy Standard protocol in 2013, which, in addition to statewide wind, hydro and biomass resources, positions stakeholder groups in the state to support three pillars for solar growth:
(*Text of the 2021 MN IRP can be found here.)
Utility Projects
The utility met its June 2020 SES portfolio standard after proposing 33 MW of new solar projects across three installations, with Camp Ripley Solar (10 MW) installed in April 2017. Three additional projects, Laskin Solar (9.6 MW), Sylvan Solar (10 MW), Duluth Solar (1.6 MW), will be operational in the coming months.
Community Solar
Since launching a community solar program in January 2018, the utility said the state still sees a waitlist for subscriptions into the program with 1.04 MW of fully subscribed solar assets, so there is growing demand for the construction of new community solar projects.
C&I Market
Minnesota Power continues to support the C&I solar market by providing distributed generation rebates of $0.56/kW for the first year of project operations and a $10,000 maximum under the state’s SolarSense rebate program for projects up to 20 kW of total capacity.
According to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE), the state’s SolarSense program awarded approximately $175,349 in rebates in 2022 for C&I development.
In Q3 2022, Minnesota catapulted up to 15th in the Solar Energy Industry Association’s (SEIA) statewide solar rankings from 29th place in 2021, with 1.7 GW of deployments through Q3 2022 and installing 111.1 MW of new projects in 2021.  The state ranks 17th in the country for jobs with 4,570 employed in the solar market and 147 solar companies operating in the state.
Minnesota Power, owned by Allete, provides electric services to more than 145,000 customers in a 260,000 square mile territory in northeast Minnesota from north of St. Cloud to International Falls and Duluth to the east.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/11/freyr-plans-the-giga-america-lithium-ion-battery-manufacturing-facility-in-georgia/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022",FREYR plans the Giga America lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility in Georgia,"FREYR announced that it has selected and purchased a site in Coweta County, Georgia for multi-phase Giga America clean battery manufacturing project, which will be developed in multiple phases. In the first phase it plans to produce approximately 34 GWh with an estimated capital investment of $1.7 billion. Additional investment may amount to $2.6 billion by 2029, the company estimates. Over the lifetime of the project more than 720 U.S. jobs will be created in Georgia.
The company purchased 368 acres of land at the Bridgeport Industrial Park site, with options for further expansion. FREYR had plans to manufacture in the United States, but those plans were accelerated based on the strength of the U.S. renewable energy and electric vehicle industries coupled with recently announced tax incentives associated with the Inflation Reduction Act. FREYR intends to apply for grants or loans from the U.S. Department of Energy to assist with development of the gigafactory. The company reported that is has also received “robust assistance” from the State of Georgia and Coweta County.
FREYR is using the SemiSolid battery production technology was developed by 24M Technologies, a spinout from MIT in Cambridge, Mass. The 24M process has reportedly simplified lithium-ion battery production with a design that requires up to 80% less of the inactive materials, such as copper and aluminum, and fewer manufacturing steps. The process reduces manufacturing costs by up to 40%, according to 24M. Its solution is a semi-solid flow battery in which the gooey electrodes are mixed directly into the electrolyte, eliminating the energy-intensive process of drying and solidifying the electrodes in traditional lithium-ion production.
The company currently has a gigafactory under construction in Norway called the Giga Arctic project. With a planned nameplate capacity of 29 GWh, its battery technology will also be based on the 24M production platform. The U.S. project team intends to replicate major elements of the Giga Arctic development, and maintain a continuous dialog with personnel in Norway.
“Today’s landmark announcement underscores FREYR’s ambition to develop a very strong and near-term operational footprint in the United States. Expanding into the U.S. has been a foundational aspect of FREYR’s long-term strategy from our inception, and with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we expect U.S. demand for ESS, passenger EV and other electric mobility applications to grow rapidly over the next decade,” commented Tom Einar Jensen, co-founder and chief executive officer of FREYR.
FREYR is headquartered in Norway. Construction is underway in Norway and now planned for the U.S., the company also intends to build a factory in Finland. FREYR has a goal of 50GWh of battery cell capacity by 2025 and 100 GWh annual capacity by 2028 and 200 GWh of annual capacity by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/11/post-election-four-states-now-poised-to-speed-renewables-deployment/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MARYLAND,MASSACHUSETTS,MICHIGAN,MICHIGAN,MINNESOTA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022","Post-election, four states now poised to speed renewables deployment","Four states with a combined population of 29 million could enact new renewables laws next year, or more aggressive versions of existing laws, thanks to voters in those states.
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has previously targeted 100% clean electricity by 2040, and will soon work with a state legislature with a majority of Democrats in both legislative bodies.
Similarly, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called for economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050, and will soon be backed by a majority of Democrats in both legislative bodies.
In each state, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) expects the new “pro-environmental” legislative majorities to “hit the ground running” with a major climate bill.
In Maryland, Governor-Elect Wes Moore campaigned on a goal to reach 100% clean electricity by 2035, and will lead the state alongside a Democrat-controlled legislature that last year enacted a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.
In Massachusetts, Governor-Elect Maura Healy pledged in her campaign to seek 100% clean electricity by 2030. The state’s legislature last year enacted a law targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and will retain its Democratic majority.
In each of those two states, a renewables law more aggressive than the current version could result.
In Arizona, where votes were still being counted, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs has proposed a water and energy innovation initiative in which stakeholders would work together toward carbon-free energy by 2050. If she wins her election, she may have the opportunity to work with a Democratic-controlled legislature to launch that initiative.
Calling the U.S. elections a “green wave,” Pete Maysmith, senior vice president of campaigns for LCV, saw a similarity to 2018, “when we saw new governors come into office ready to pass major clean energy and environmental legislation.” Four of those five governors have won re-election, he said, while in Nevada the vote count is ongoing.
New goals
Massachusetts Governor-elect Maura Healy proposes to reach 100% clean electricity by 2030 in part by reaching “a total of 10 GW of deployed solar by 2030,” with a focus on bringing rooftop solar to underserved communities, and encouraging “smart siting” of large solar projects.
Healy also plans to “press utilities to plan for and upgrade the distribution system to integrate new solar, without the delays customers face today due to utility backlogs.”
To position Massachusetts as “the nation’s offshore wind capital,” Healy plans to expeditiously permit the 5.6 GW of offshore wind procurements currently authorized by law, and “more than double” the state’s current target to reach 10 GW of offshore wind by 2035.
Healy also plans to quadruple the state’s energy storage deployment, install one million heat pumps, incentivize one million electric vehicles, and electrify school buses and Boston’s public transit buses, all by 2030.
Maryland Governor-Elect Wes Moore’s proposal for 100% clean electricity by 2035 would reduce energy consumption, “supercharge” investments in wind and solar projects, and invest in research and development of battery storage, to bring new technologies to market quickly.
Moore also plans to target net-zero emissions by 2045, through clean energy generation targets, incentives for electric vehicles and public transit, support for more sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, and reduced consumption.
Encouraging words
Offering suggestions for two of the states, Solar United Neighbors Communications Director Ben Delman said that Maryland could make the state’s community solar program permanent, while Minnesota could protect homeowners who want to go solar, yet face restrictions set by homeowner associations.
With changes in the Michigan and Minnesota legislatures, Clean Energy States Alliance Executive Director Warren Leon said the two states are “good candidates” to convert their respective governors’ goals into law.
Vote Solar sees opportunities across the four states, said Chief Program Officer Sean Garren, and is “eager to take full advantage” of those opportunities.
