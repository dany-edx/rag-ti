The February 2022 edition of the EIA’s Electric Power Monthly shows the electrons set loose by solar panels growing 26% during the year, following on similar growth in the previous year.
But this growth, and the contribution of solar to the electricity system, is highly uneven from state to state. While some states have very little solar (cough—the Dakotas—cough), California got a whopping 21% of its power from photovoltaics (PV) installed in the state over the course of the year, while Hawaii got 20% and Nevada 19% of their power from in-state solar. In fact, a total of five states got 10% or more of their electricity from solar in 2021, with PV meeting 12% of demand in Utah and 11% in Arizona.

One quick note: this year we are back to looking at solar in each state in relation to the state’s electricity demand, not of electricity generation in-state. We’re doing this because some states, like Massachusetts and Vermont, import a lot of power from across state lines. Therefore looking only at their in-state generation paints a somewhat distorted picture of the progress of solar in those states. Our assumptions also include that solar generated in a given state meets electric demand in that state.
Speaking of New England, one state east of the Rocky Mountains is on the cusp of 10%: Rhode Island.
Wait—did you say Rhode Island? Yes. After several years of dramatic growth, with output from solar doubling year over year from 2018 to 2019 and again from 2019 to 2020, Ocean State solar output grew another 45% this year to come in at 9.78% of demand. Next year, it will inevitably be the first state East of the Rocky Mountains to cross the 10% barrier.
Notably, Rhode Island got more than half of its generation from “small-scale solar,” which is defined by EIA as projects smaller than 1MWac. That’s a lot of old mill buildings & malls with solar on their roofs—and a lot of homes.
There are other regional exceptions as well. North Carolina got 7.6% of its electricity from in-state solar in 2021, as the leading state in the South. Unlike Rhode Island this was nearly all from large-scale solar power plants in the 5–20MW range, much of it from a boom several years ago driven by state implementation of PURPA.

But with high penetrations come new challenges—like California’s duck curve, and the collapse of mid-day power prices. It is no accident that more than 90% of the solar projects in the interconnection queue of California’s grid operator include battery storage. And the duck curve is already showing up some days in New England.
Big growth in small markets
Solar is also growing quickly in a number of smaller markets. Six states in the Midwest and Atlantic Coast showed triple-digit growth, with output from solar more than doubling in Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
These are all relatively nascent markets—in Maine and Virginia solar meets around 2.7%–2.9% of demand, and in most other states less than 2%. However, they are growing much faster than larger markets; in 2020 Texas’ solar output grew 61% and California’s only 15%.
Four of the states with fast-growing solar are in the Upper Midwest, an area that is split between the PJM Interconnection and MISO grids. As reported in our Solar Tsunami 2022 article last month, both of these grid operators have enormous volumes of solar projects in their queues; 87 GWac in MISO and 188 GWac in PJM. 

All of this suggests that large-scale solar is poised to take off in the Midwest in the next few years. But while the recent reforms to MISO’s interconnection queue are promising, PJM Interconnection’s request to freeze new requests while it works through its queue are more troubling. In future articles PV Intel will have more to say about the growth of large-scale solar in the Midwest, as well as the accelerating growth of solar over time.
While 4.24% of power shows tremendous progress over the past few years, solar is not stopping there. EIA expects the United States to install 21.5 GWac of solar this year. Even with the projects already under construction we can expect another big increase in electricity from solar this year, and again next year, as part of renewable energy displacing fossil fuels to take over the U.S. power system.
A note: PV Intel, in our drive to make the most accurate and sharpest data available, has begun to analyze solar generation in a more finely tuned manner. For instance, we’ve begun to consider the fact that onsite or near site distributed solar power does not suffer from the same line losses that occur with all other large- scale energy sources. The EIA and other groups put these losses in the high single digit range.
See you next month!

The purpose of the document is to help guide the state in policy creation as it moves toward a required additional 2GW of solar power by 2030. It is estimated that fully decarbonizing the state by 2050 will require a total deployment of 10 to 20 gigawatts.

The request for proposal (RFP), released last Tuesday, gives potential respondents until March 16 to formulate and submit questions. Following the DOER’s response to those questions, a quote for services will be due on April 13, 2022 by 4 p.m. EST. Winners will be notified the following month, with the contract to be signed soon thereafter. The work will begin in June of this year.
The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2023. The DOER has set a maximum price of $150,000 for the services.
The DOER outlines five key tasks to be completed as part of the RFP:
These tasks require the creation of focus group discussions and will require stakeholders to collect information from environmental justice populations. Applicants are asked to develop a methodology for ranking potential sites based on a variety of factors including land constraints  and impacts to natural resources, and to model the economic factors that result from different types of solar development. Potential consultants are also asked to weigh the loss of sequestered carbon from land conversion against the electric generation of the solar facility, in order to determine lifecycle GHG benefits.
The state notes that the 3GW of solar power currently installed ended up using 7,900 acres of land, 50% of which was forest land that was cleared to install facilities. Massachusetts’ land area is approximately 6.7 million acres, meaning the current solar capacity has used 0.11% of the state’s area to generate almost 7.7% of the state’s electricity demand.
Massachusetts currently has greater than 100,000 individual solar power facilities installed.
Those facilities will soon be complemented by a massive amount of wind and energy storage.

Recent bids have secured more than 5GW of offshore wind, including 2.4 to 2.6GW to be developed by Avangrid Renewables, and another 2.5GW to be developed by Vineyard Wind.
In 2015, the state commissioned an energy storage report – State of Charge, which suggested that installing 600MW of battery power could save rate payers more than $2 billion. What is most interesting is that these numbers were based on pricing from the first half of the 2010s, just as energy storage was beginning its precipitous price decline of 90%.

The State of Charge report also suggested that 1,766MW of energy storage could eventually be deployed, offering a full range of services. This volume of capacity, again based on battery pricing from the early 2010’s, showed a benefit to cost ratio of 2.77 to 1.
In the years following the report, Massachusetts has been slowly establishing multiple energy storage programs, which now include battery adders for the SMART solar program and the Clean Peak Program.
A recent analysis of Connecticut solar potential found that one third of the state’s electricity demand could be met by putting solar panels on top of existing parking lots. Adding rooftop solar would bring that value to 85.5% of the state’s total electricity demand.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/28/50-states-of-solar-incentives-maine/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MAINE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Maine,"The renewable energy landscape of Maine shifted dramatically in 2019, when current Gov. Janet Mills took office and spent her first legislative session signing legislation to undo the state’s net metering replacement policy, gross metering; raise the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 50% by 2030; create a block grant program to support the installation of 375 MW of distributed solar by mid-2024; and reduce the state’s emissions 45% from 1990 levels by 2030.
In the time since, Maine has emerged into a robust economy for the development of solar projects, especially small scale installations like community solar, commercial and industrial (C&I), and residential solar. And while the rebate and incentive environment in Maine isn’t as complex as some of its New England neighbors, it’s worth taking a look at the policies and tools that have enabled the state to rebound so quickly.
Bye-bye gross metering
Perhaps the most meaningful change was also the first one that Mills pursued. During the tenure of former Gov. Paul LePage, Maine’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) adopted solar policy changes that instituted immovable, fixed fees on rooftop customers; capped net metering project size at 660kW, and limited community solar projects to just 10 customers.
The state’s Gross metering policy, which replaced an existing net metering program, required that all electricity generated by rooftop PV systems be metered, whether or not it was consumed on-site. It also set a system whereby the credits for this self-generated electricity was discounted based on the year of installation.
The Mills administration, the state legislature, and the PUC have since reversed these steps, instituting the Net Energy Billing (NEB) program, raising the community solar cap to 5MW (the practical standard), and eliminating the 10-meter cap for community solar projects.
Maine’s NEB program allows customers to offset their electricity bills by selling their excess generation back to the grid, same as most other net metering programs. Where the program differs is that its actually two programs: one available to all electric utility customers, and the other available to non-residential customers.
The NEB kWh Credit Program provides kWh credits on electricity bills for participating customers who have their own project installed on their property, or participate in a nearby community solar project. The NEB Tariff Rate Program provides dollar credits on participating C&I customers’ electricity bills at a rate determined annually by the PUC.
Alongside NEB, the state’s solar customers also have access to the Federal Investment Tax Credit, which can reduce the cost of a PV system purchased outright or leased by 26%. The NEB program has becoming critical in establishing a healthy and growing community solar market in Maine.
What’s to come
Distributed generation (DG) as a whole has become a focus in expanding Maine’s renewable energy capabilities, and was one of the targets of Mills’ initial legislative push. The Act To Promote Solar Energy Projects and Distributed Generation Resources in Maine, passed in 2019, calls for the procurement of a total of 375MW of distributed generation resources by July 2024, through five separate procurement blocks. For projects awarded under the procurement, Maine’s electric utilities agree to enter into 20-year contracts with projects awarded under the procurement, at the contract rate established for that particular block.
Like the NEB program, this program is also split up between shared DG projects and C&I projects. Shared DG projects will total 250MW across the five procurement blocks and individuals who participate will receive dollar credits on their electricity bills through participation in community shared solar projects. Logistically, DG projects have specific subscription requirements for municipal, low-and-moderate income and small subscriber offtake, and there is no cap on the number of subscribers that can enroll in a given project. The C&I portion of the program is limited to one C&I entity per project.
In June 2021, Gov Mills signed LD 528, a bill which sets out a plan for 300MW of new energy storage capacity by the end of 2025 and 400 MW through 2030. After that, the Governor’s Energy Office will reevaluate every two years for new storage goals. 
The PUC also plans to configure new electricity rate designs to encourage energy storage growth by the end of 2022. Such structures will include time-of-use rates and incentives to lower peak demand for power. 
The bill outlines four actions that will be taken to achieve this goal:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/28/auxin-antidumping-case-an-affront-to-the-industry-said-leading-solar-developer/,"INSTALLATIONS,INTERVIEW,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CAMBODIA,CHINA,MALAYSIA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",Auxin antidumping case “an affront to the industry” said SOLV Energy CEO,"Earlier this February, a new round of antidumping/anti-circumvention (AD/CVD) cases were filed against Malaysia, Thailand, and now Cambodia. A small US-based panel assembler, Auxin Solar, with about 120MW in development capacity in the US added its name to the petition, reviving what is viewed as a threat to solar development nationwide.
This comes just months after the Commerce Department tossed out an earlier similar request by an anonymous group of solar companies that sought tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules. About 80% of US crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. Auxin claims Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to these countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
Under this case, all crystalline-silicon modules from each of the four countries could be subject to a tariff. Unlike the first case, this one is designed to be focused on entire countries, rather than specific companies. This new petition adds Cambodia, as Auxin claimed Chinese companies were moving operations to the country in anticipation of tariffs. Historically, Cambodia contributes less than 3% of all US C-Si module imports.
AD/CVD tariffs can be as high as 50-250%, a level of uncertainty that has shuddered through the US solar industry. “Deployment is frozen,” said George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy in an interview with pv magazine. SOLV is among the largest utility-scale solar contractors in the United States, with a strong project pipeline of over 4GW across the nation.
Hershman said the uncertainty caused by these tariffs is simply too much to digest in a utility-scale solar project, where module prices can account for 50% of the cost or more. SOLV‘s projects can exceed $300 million, so a 50-250% tariff would impose between $75 -$375 million in additional costs. This level of risk is untenable and is why Hershman describes the case as “an affront to the solar industry.”
The effects of US market uncertainty may already be showing, as LG announced it will close its solar module business and close its 550MW module assembly plant in Huntsville Alabama.
Clock is ticking
The petition was filed by Auxin on February 8th, and now the Department of Commerce has 45 days from the date to decide on the case. If passed, the AD/CVD tariffs would be retroactive to the case, levying huge tariffs on solar modules shipped from the four countries in the meantime.
“There is no case law to support this, it is a meritless case. It has been determined that the conversion of wafer to cell is the country of origin,” said Hershman.
Hershman is hopeful that Commerce will throw out the case, just like it did with the previous anonymous petition. His request: don’t wait the full 45 days.
With the nation targeting high decarbonization targets and the clock running, there is little time to pin the industry down with such uncertainty, he said. Based on supply chain constraints alone, Wood Mackenzie lowered its 2022 utility-scale solar projection by 33%, a steep drop of 7.5GW.
Industrial policy
In addition to this, Hershman is supportive of US manufacturing, but believes tariffs are the wrong pathway. “We need to align around legitimate industrial policy to support manufacturing in the US,” he said.
In Hershman’s view, tariffs like the ones imposed by the Auxin case are temporary, short-term measures that won’t boost US manufacturing in a meaningful way. Long-term certainty is needed for a company to move a fabrication process to a new country. He called for industrial policy like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, includes numerous tax credits for US-based manufacturing.
An earlier proposal of the Build Back Better Act included key industrial policy measures, before it was shut down by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). The bill included targeted incentives for full domestic value chains, like solar module manufacturing and lithium battery recycling. Specifically, domestic production of PV modules would be incentivized at $0.07/W, cells at $0.04/W, PV wafers at $12/m², and polysilicon at $3.00/kg. Additional incentives were added for solar trackers, purlins, inverters from residential to utility-scale. Manchin said that he is once again open to talks but wants the conversation to start over “from scratch.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/28/seia-offers-framework-for-siting-community-solar-projects/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",SEIA offers framework for siting community solar projects,"Community solar is a fast-growing sector of the US electricity industry, with more than 3.6GW of these solar projects operating across the country at the end of third quarter of 2021. According to a recent Wood Mackenzie report, and the next five years is expected see the community solar market add another 4.5GW of capacity. The National Community Solar Partnership, a Department of Energy program, set an ambitious goal of enabling enough community solar projects to power the equivalent of 5 million households, and achieve $1 billion in combined energy bill savings.
To help meet these clean energy goals, SEIA released a white paper that proposes a siting framework for community solar projects that can produce carbon-free electricity, while enhancing ecosystems and conserving land. The framework builds off existing laws to balance development activity with environmental protection.
While community solar typically uses less land than utility-scale solar installations, siting and permitting smaller installations of up to 5MW can stir up local and statewide debates about managing solar development and protecting community character. Often the debate can be based on ill founded or uninformed opinions pitted against concerns about potential land use impacts and the need to preserve community character. These concerns are legitimate considering that, although lands for solar projects today make up a tiny fraction of the nearly 81 million acres of land across the nation dedicated to energy production, land taken up by renewables projects will need to grow significantly to achieve a carbon-free grid.
SEIA’s aim in this paper is to advance a process-based approach that balances the need for permitting many more community solar farms, with protecting property rights and sensitive ecosystems.
The paper is predicated on three underlying assumptions:
The SEIA framework details how to design for ecosystem services and how to avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential negative impacts.

Overall the framework recommends taking a fact-based approach while also considering pre-determined zones for solar development, as well as wildlife, forests and agricultural lands.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/28/clean-energy-tax-credit-reform-is-our-last-best-chance-for-a-net-zero-future/,"BANKRUPTCY,FINANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022","Clean energy tax credit reform is our last, best chance for a net-zero future","Many of us working in clean energy pushed hard for the game-changing Build Back Better package only to see it whittled down and finally stopped in its tracks. Though disappointed, we remain hopeful that a climate package can still gain consensus in Congress. And while other, more controversial proposals garner headlines, the biggest opportunity to create explosive growth in clean energy could come from a simple, cost-effective fix to the clean energy tax credit system.
Federal incentives for clean energy have already proven enormously successful; according to SEIA, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has driven 52% average annual growth in the solar industry since it was enacted in 2006. But a clunky tax credit system keeps vital incentives like the ITC and Production Tax Credit (PTC) from working the way Congress intended. Direct pay is the key to ensuring U.S. projects have efficient access to low cost capital with greater certainty by providing cash incentives directly to clean energy projects and project sponsors. Tax credit reform—including 100% direct pay alongside the expanded and extended ITC and PTC—will unleash capital for clean energy investment at a critical time.
Many clean energy project sponsors do not have enough tax liability to fully utilize the tax credits themselves, and instead rely on the tax equity market to monetize the value of those credits. But a chronic shortage of financing in the tax equity market lends uncertainty to those transactions, and big banks and Wall Street middlemen extract a significant portion of the credits’ value. Providing 100% direct pay will significantly expand the opportunity for businesses of all sizes—as well as non-profits and public utilities, who are unable to monetize the credits at all—to deploy renewable energy within their operations.
Perhaps most importantly, 100% direct pay will make renewable energy more accessible to businesses in disadvantaged and economically challenged communities. Today, many of these businesses are unable to deploy renewable energy despite the significant long-term economic and environmental benefits they could achieve, simply because they are too small to be considered for traditional tax equity financing.
Direct pay is a simple and straightforward fix to the problems that have plagued the efficient use of the PTC and ITC. The option would transform the industry’s current reliance on the surge and freeze cycle of tax equity financing. Right now, projects that are critically needed to meet America’s climate goals and create jobs face a minefield of uncertainty around financing. When tax cuts, recessions, or other shocks to the financing system happen, the availability of tax equity investment grinds to a halt, as do the clean energy investments that rely on that system.
To say this creates a major bottleneck in clean energy investment and deployment is an understatement. At a time when the opportunity for the energy transition is greatest, two thirds of wind projects set to begin construction this year are still seeking tax equity financing, along with more than half of large-scale solar projects. These delays hold America back from its potential as a global clean energy leader.
The people making the energy transition happen—from utility-scale wind and solar developers and forward-thinking utilities to clean energy financiers, large corporate power purchasers, and centrist and progressive policy think tanks—all agree that reforming the tax code to enable 100% direct pay is necessary to meet clean energy deployment goals. And the policy has strong support from voters of all political stripes: new polling from Data for Progress shows 74% of Americans are in favor, including 74% of Independents, 63% of Republicans, and 82% of Democrats. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that a rising tide of public officials, corporate leaders, and environmental groups are voicing their support for direct pay.
Making direct pay an option for current and emerging technologies—including energy storage— without the artificial constraints of the tax equity market would be one of the most transformative energy policies in decades, opening massive new opportunities for investment as well as new options for conventional loan underwriting and bond issuances for large projects. In fact, new research from the Rhodium Group finds the benefits of direct pay could be three to four times larger than its costs. This simple tax credit tweak could have a massive impact, adding up to as much as $1.5 trillion in economic surplus while eliminating more than 5 billion tons of planet-warming carbon pollution through 2050.
U.S. leadership of the clean energy transition depends on American entrepreneurship and innovation. Direct pay is the most concrete action that Congress can take to send a clear signal to investors that the energy revolution will happen here.

The project, located in the northern part of the state, is expected to be capable of power 16,000 New Mexican homes throughout the year.
Honeywell’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) BESS is integrated with the Experion Energy control system, a battery management platform that integrates with asset monitoring, distributed energy resource management, supervisory control, and analytics functionality. These capabilities will help Hecate Energy forecast and optimize energy costs.
The company said the battery energy storage system has a four hour round trip efficiency of 98%. The battery management system has three levels of safety, at cell, module and rack level. Forced air HVAC and optional liquid cooling manage heat for the battery.
Honeywell’s BESS segment serves commercial and industrial operators, independent power producers, and utilities. The BESS can be scalable from 500kWh to 4GWh. The company also deploys integrated SCADA solutions for solar plant operation and maintenance, and microgrid control systems.
Performance and outcome-based guarantees back the BESS. Honeywell guarantees predictable and consistent costs and improved uptime. The system enables “revenue stacking” capabilities, participating in multiple activities, like peak shaving, backup power generation, and demand response programs.
“We chose Honeywell for this landmark project because of their depth of knowledge and decades of expertise,” said Alex Pugh, Hecate’s Project Manager.
The project comes in pursuit of the Public Service Company of New Mexico’s (PNM) decarbonization goals. Earlier this month, PNM released its integrated resource plan, which aims for zero carbon emissions by 2040. The plan added to previously announced strategies for an accelerated phase-out from coal-fired generation, which is set to take place by 2024.

Solar also maintained its place as the country’s fastest-growing electrical resource in 2021, with just over 25% growth in new capacity, when compared to 2020. Combined, solar and wind grew by nearly 16% and accounted for more than one-eighth of total U.S. electrical generation, with wind accounting for just over 9% and solar for just under 4%.
Moreover, SUN DAY’s analysis shows that wind and solar combined now provide more than three-fifths of all generation by renewable sources, sitting at 62% combined.  In general, 2021 was a strong year for renewable resources across the board, with the exception of hydropower. According to the analysis, hydropower output fell by nearly 9%, which the analysis attributes to severe drought conditions during the year.
In such a banner year for renewable resources, it’s shouldn’t come as a surprise that renewable sources expanded their lead over nuclear power in 2021, providing one-eighth more electricity than the nation’s atomic power plants, which accounted for roughly 18% of all generation. Natural gas remained as the top source of U.S. electrical generation with a nearly 38% share, but that share is down from 40% a year ago. Coal rebounded into second place with a 21% share, growing 16% year-over-year from 2020.
The analysis, however, predicts this coal resurgence to be short-lived, citing EIA expectations that nearly 22GW of new utility-scale solar capacity will come online in 2022 along, bolstered by 4.4GW of small-scale solar capacity and 7.6-GW of new wind capacity. Hydropower is expected to rebound in 2022, as it increased its output by nearly 20% in December 2021 compared to December 2020. All told, EIA now expects renewables’ share of U.S. electrical generation to top 22% this year and exceed that of coal while nuclear power’s share declines further.

The world’s major solar manufacturers can be expected to switch from industry standard PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) products to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology “within the next few years,” according to a US analyst.
The technological shift prompted by manufacturers nearing PERC’s conversion efficiency threshold of 23.7% – for commercially produced products – is one of the predictions made by Denver-based Clean Energy Associates (CEA) in its survey of the solar manufacturing industry during the last three months of 2021.
The analyst also revealed Chinese manufacturer GCL exited the solar cell production market in the fourth quarter of last year, contributing to a slower-than-expected expansion of PV cell and module capacity expansion.
With the CEA citing the removal of old production facilities by Chinese manufacturers; tough global manufacturing conditions; and a difficult trade relationship between solar superpower China and the US as other reasons for delayed cell and module capacities, the analyst said the picture was entirely different for the manufacture of solar panel raw material polysilicon.
The report, announced in a press release issued by the CEA on Friday, estimated 500,000 tons of annual poly production capacity will come online this year, with a lot of facilities that were set in train in late 2020 due to hit full production in “early to mid 2022.”
That should see a reverse in polysilicon prices which rose sharply last year, contributing to solar panel price hikes. Chinese polysilicon manufacturer Daqo today announced it had signed a five-year deal with an unnamed “leading solar manufacturing company in China.” Daqo expects to supply around 30,000 tons of poly to the end of 2026, with the actual volume and prices to be determined monthly.
Although there were fewer new cell and module production lines ramped up in the closing months of last year, the CEA said it expects expansions to resume pace this year with around 45GW of new annual solar panel manufacturing capacity to arrive by the end of December, and more than 55GW next year.
Chinese demand could play a significant factor with the CEA speculating Beijing could remove clean electricity from this year’s application of its “dual control” policy, which limits energy consumption and the energy intensity of manufacturing processes and which last year prompted electricity shortages.
Supply chains
The solar market will also be pumped over the next four years by manufacturing plans announced in Europe, as the region attempts to wean itself off an over dependence on Chinese supply chains.
The CEA expects solar ingot and wafer production lines could “potentially” amount to more than 20GW of annual capacity in Europe in 2025; cell output capability “could grow” to more than 30GW in that year; and the module figure can be “expected to increase” to more than 45GW by the middle of the decade.

State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), which operates roughly 80% of the nation’s electricity grids spanning across 26 provinces, has unveiled plans to massively expand its battery storage fleet and pumped hydro storage capacity and thus help the nation move towards its decarbonization goals.
SGCC Chairman Xin Baoan said Wednesday in a commentary published in the state-owned People’s Daily that SGCC aims to have 100GW of battery storage by 2030, up from 3GW today. This is a very ambitious goal, given that BloombergNEF forecasts that all of China will have about 96GW of battery storage by 2030.
Under a five-year plan released this week, China is aiming to slash battery storage costs by around 30% by 2025, paving the way for local industries to dominate the global market by 2030. In addition, the fifteenth five-year plan drafted by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) gives special attention to compressed air storage and envisages that this technology will realize engineering applications in units of 100MW of capacity.
But SGCC’s plans don’t end only with battery storage, the grid operator is also planning to increase its pumped storage capacity from the current 26.3GW to 100GW by 2030. This builds on its announcement in January when it said it had commissioned the world’s largest pumped-hydro facility. Located in Hebei province, the 3.6GW Fengning Pumped Storage Power Station consists of 12 reversible pump generating sets with a capacity of 300MW each and has a power generation capacity from storage of 6.612 billion kWh. To put SGCC’s plans into perspective, China is targeting 120GW of operational pumped-hydro facilities by 2030, according to the NEA.
Beyond storage
Furthermore, Xin said that SGCC is also planning to increase its cross-provincial power transmission capacity and support the buildout of solar and wind in the western desert areas. Finally, he said the grid operator will also seek to implement flexible DC transmission, virtual power plants, safety and stability of large power grids, and ultra-high voltage tap-changers, among other technologies.
According to Xin, SPCC made these plans to align with the Chinese government’s dual carbon goal to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. China’s decarbonization policy has already created pressure on state-owned enterprises mandating energy storage with the order to build renewables-plus-storage projects introduced for the very first time by the NEA last April.
In terms of supporting policies, NEA, the country’s major energy policymaking authority, has already launched a series of incentives and advisory documents with an eye on the interim goal to deploy 30GW of energy storage capacity by 2025. In addition, several provinces have also released policies supporting storage for renewable energy installations.
But despite its decarbonization plans, China continues to account for a great share of global coal additions. A recent report published by three environmental think tanks and lobbyists finds that China is home to 55% of the world pipeline for new coal facilities and, together  with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, and Bangladesh, jointly accounts for 82% of plans for new coal plants.
