The report found that the U.S. solar market installed 5.6 GW in Q2 2023, a 20% jump over Q2 2022 totals. The industry has installed nearly 12 GW in the first half of 2023, indicating volumes are set to grow year-over-year after experiencing contraction in 2022.
Residential solar had a record 1.8 GW of installations in Q2 2023 as Californians rushed to secure more lucrative export compensation rates under net energy metering (NEM) 2.0, which transitioned to NEM 3.0 in April. Wood Mackenzie said it expects the installation surge to continue through Q3, beginning to taper off in Q4.
Commercial solar added 345 MW in the second quarter, declining 9% compared to the previous year’s Q2. Despite this, the count of projects installed increased 7%, which Wood Mackenzie said is an indication of relatively stable volumes for the segment.
Community solar stalled out some in Q2 2023, adding 226 MW. This is flat compared to last quarter and a 16% decrease over Q2 2022. The report highlighted that there is momentum behind the sector, but challenges around interconnection, market penetration, siting, and permitting are bogging down growth.
Adding the largest capacity among the sectors, utility-scale solar installed 3.3 GW in Q2 2023, representing 22% growth over Q2 2022. This year, the sector has rebounded from supply chain limitations that led to project delays and cancellations. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that total new utility-scale installations will reach 172 GWdc between 2023-2028.
Across sectors, Wood Mackenzie expects a 52% growth in installations year-over-year, rebounding from a 13% pullback in 2022.
Perhaps the most significant development in the U.S. solar market over the last year is not in installation figures, but in boosted domestic manufacturing capacity. Wood Mackenzie forecast solar module manufacturing will grow an order of magnitude from 10.6 GW pre-Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to 108.5 GW in 2026.
“The United States is now a dominant player in the global clean energy economy, and states like Florida, Texas, Ohio, and Georgia are at the forefront of this job growth and economic prosperity,” said SEIA president and chief executive officer Abigail Ross Hopper. “The solar and storage industry is delivering abundant clean energy that is generating tens of billions of dollars of private investment, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.”

“In our five-year outlook, annual growth in the solar industry will average 15%,” said the report. “Implementation of the IRA, which was enacted just over a year ago, has been slow and complicated. But the long-term policy certainty provided by the legislation continues to drive our expectations for double-digit growth in the solar industry.”
Wood Mackenzie said the market will start to realize the benefits of the IRA in 2024 and 2025. However, it has decreased forecasts for the mid-late 2020s by 4% due in part to persistent challenges with interconnection queue delays. 
“In the year since its passage, the IRA has undoubtedly caused a wave of optimism across the solar industry. Announcements for domestic module manufacturing have exploded, promising more stable solar module supply in the future,” said Michelle Davis, head of global solar at Wood Mackenzie. “Now the challenge becomes implementation — the industry is waiting for clarity on several IRA provisions before moving forward with solar investments.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/07/residential-solar-average-payback-period-is-8-3-years-said-energysage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023","Residential solar average payback period is 8.3 years, said EnergySage","Residential solar and storage marketplace and informational site EnergySage has released its market intelligence report for June 2022 to July 2023, highlighting a shifting market under raised interest rates. The report tracks million of data points based on homeowner shopping transactions in its marketplace.
Reported solar prices have now climbed for two years consecutively, though more gradually in the first half of 2023. EnergySage said its average solar quote was $2.90 per Watt, up 1.8% in the first half of 2023. The company said that early Q3 data shows that solar prices have begun to cool off, decreasing about 3.5% so far in-quarter. Prices bottomed out in the first half of 2021 at $2.67 per Watt.
Energy storage prices also increased 1% in the first half of 2023. Over 50% of solar quotes on EnergySage included a battery, a trend that continues to rise steadily. Storage in the first half of 2023 averaged $1,352 per kWh, with batteries often sized as 10 kWh in major markets.
Headwinds have hit the residential solar sector hard this year, with major public companies in the space like Sunrun, Enphase, and SolarEdge down 50% or more in 2023. Rising interest rates and sharp cuts to compensation for exporting solar, or net energy metering, have put a damper on installation rates.
“While the first half of 2023 was tumultuous at times for the solar and storage industries in the U.S., we remain optimistic: solar and storage have proven to be resilient in the past, surviving–and even excelling–irrespective of expiring tax credits and incentives, changing net metering policies, shifting tariffs, supply chain issues, and labor shortages,” said Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive officer and founder, EnergySage.
EnergySage said typical loan offerings have shifted from 2.99% interest rates in the second half of 2022 to 4.99% interest rates for a 25-year loan in the first half 2023. This leads to an average monthly cost of $30 more for a $30,000 loan.
For products, EnergySage’s most-commonly quoted solar panels were Qcells, while Enphase was the highest-quoted provider for both energy storage and inverters. Breaking into the top ten most-quoted list or gaining in significant market share were Waaree solar panels and FranklinWH batteries.
The average estimated payback period for residential solar is 8.3 years, averaging 10.4 kW. This has improved slightly from the average breakeven return on investment of 8.7 years. A typical solar array can produce local, predictable-cost, and clean energy for 20 to 30 years or more.
The five largest markets for solar averaged lower quoted prices when compared with the national median. California averaged $2.89/W, Texas $2.59/W, Florida $2.45/W, New York $3.30/W, Nevada $2.55/W.
California was the only top-ten market to have price increases on a median per-Watt basis in the first half of 2023. California also had the nation’s smallest average quoted system size at 8.05 kW, while the median was 10.4 kW, and Arkansas had the largest median system size at 14.88 kW.
Over time, quoted panel power ratings have increased on the EnergySage market. Nine out of ten quotes in first half 2023 included 390 W or larger panels. In the first half of 2020, nearly half the quotes on the marketplace were 330 W or less.
The report noted a steep uptick to consumers showing interest in storage in order to self-supply solar generation, suggesting that lowered net metering rates are discouraging export of local, clean electricity. Nearly 40% of consumers reported self-supply as a reason for getting a storage quote, up from less than 20% in 2022. Backup power for outages and savings on utility rates were also listed as top reasons for including energy storage in a quote.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/07/enervenue-launches-new-metal-hydrogen-battery-variant/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",EnerVenue launches new metal-hydrogen battery variant,"From pv magazine global
The California startup, EnerVenue has developed a new version of its nickel-hydrogen batteries for large-scale renewables and storage applications.
“The newest version of EnerVenue’s batteries extends the solutions’ durability, operational flexibility, and cost-efficiency benefits for stationary storage projects across myriad use cases,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The next-generation ESVs can flexibly cycle up to three times per day, at two to 12-hour discharge rates, enabling unique applications and business models for developers, integrators, and owners.”
The battery has reportedly a 30-year, 30,000-cycle lifespan, with the manufacturer offering a 20-year/20,000-cycle warranty that guarantees at least 88% battery capacity remaining after that period.
EnerVenue claims its nickel-hydrogen battery technology can operate at temperatures between -40 C and 60 C. It can also provide the promised cycles without degradation and at varying rates, for a wide range of fast and slow charging capabilities.
The battery has an efficiency ranging from 80% to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
In May, EnerVenue conducted UL 9540A evaluations for thermal runaway fire propagation at the cell, module, and unit level. The company certified its Energy Storage Vessels to UL 1973, said EnerVenue CTO Majid Keshavarz. He said the UL 9540A test results validate the company’s battery chemistry as the top choice for customers aiming to eliminate fire or thermal hazards in their grid-scale installations.
The nickel-hydrogen battery technology is particularly good in remote and harsh conditions with operational temperatures ranging between -40 C to 60 C, as demonstrated by its use in NASA satellites.
EnerVenue raised $125 million in a December 2021 Series A equity offering from Schlumberger, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, and Stanford University. It was advised by Barclays. The funding round followed another $12 million seed round earlier that year.
In March, EnerVenue announced plans to invest in a gigafactory in Kentucky, where it will design, manufacture and test its nickel-hydrogen Energy Storage Vessels. It reports that it has more than 7 GWh of customer commitments, including orders from Pine Gate Renewables, Nicon Industries’ Green Energy Renewable Solutions unit, and Schlumberger New Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/07/treasury-and-irs-propose-renewable-energy-prevailing-wage-and-apprenticeship-requirements/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",Treasury and IRS propose renewable energy prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements,"Payment of a prevailing wage to workers and employment of apprentices are key requirements for renewable energy developers to obtain the various tax incentives for their projects provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). A little over a year following enactment of the IRA, and nine months after release of the initial guidance, on August 30, 2023, the Treasury Department and IRS released the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NOPR”) on prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
The November 30, 2023, initial guidance (“Initial Guidance”) still governs prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but the clock is ticking: taxpayers may rely on the NOPR beginning October 30, 2023.
(Read: “The clock is ticking on the IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements“)
The NOPR provides useful clarifications and additional details helpful for taxpayers evaluating their project compliance strategies but still leaves certain details open to interpretation. The NOPR is, of course, not the final regulation, but it is an additional step in the rulemaking process open to comments from the public.
Overall, the NOPR is consistent with the Initial Guidance (outlined in our  article here), with key updates outlined below.
Prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements apply to all “construction, alteration or repair” of a qualified facility, and continue through any portion of a taxable year within the 10-year period beginning on the date the qualified facility is placed in service. But the NOPR provides a key clarification for plant operations: it specifies that “construction, alteration or repair” does not include “work that is ordinary and regular in nature that is designed to maintain and preserve existing functionalities of a facility after it is placed in service.”
It provides examples of basic operations and maintenance services and notes that such services do not include (and therefore, that prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements do apply to) work that “improves a facility, adapts it for a different use, or restores functionality as a result of inoperability.” In other words, the NOPR holds that routine O&M services are likely not subject to prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements – a detail that was not evident from the Initial Guidance.
The NOPR and Prevailing Wage requirements
The NOPR confirms the IRA is not a Davis-Bacon Related Act (“DBRA”), and therefore that compliance with prevailing wage requirements does not require DBRA certified payroll. Generally, the NOPR incorporates DBRA guidance regarding wage determinations and definitions (for example: laborer/mechanic, construction, alteration or repair, wages, employed) for purposes of prevailing wage compliance – but it excludes required contractual incorporation of DBRA provisions and certified payroll mechanisms.
Prevailing wage records pursuant to the IRA should not be submitted to the Department of Labor (“DOL”) for certification, and the DOL is not involved in enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance. The only consequence of noncompliance with prevailing wage requirements is loss of ability to claim IRA tax incentives.
Many developers and contractors were concerned about the uncertainty of regularly-updated prevailing wage determinations provided by the DOL (particularly in light of the August 23, 2023 final rule Updating the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts Regulations). The NOPR eased these concerns by clarifying that the applicable prevailing wage published when construction begins applies throughout the project, without the need to continue to update the wage if a new determination is published.
Wage determinations for individual projects, where SAM.gov published wages are not available, may be requested from the DOL pursuant to DBRA procedures (but, consistent with the Initial Guidance, also allowing email requests to IRAprevailingwage@dol.gov).
A wage determination, once issued, is binding on the project and can be “supplemental,” addressing selected labor classifications needed for a specific project and not already published. The NOPR confirmed the Initial Guidance’s direction to include specified information on any wage determination requests, and also expressly adopted Davis-Bacon Act review and appeal procedures for wage determination requests.
The NOPR and Apprenticeship requirements
The NOPR also provides additional clarity around the IRA’s labor hour, ratio, and participation requirements for registered apprentices. Of note, the apprenticeship ratio requirement, requiring that applicable apprentice-to-journeyworker ratios be satisfied, is a daily requirement. If the applicable apprentice-to-journeyworker ratio is not satisfied on any given day, the apprentice hours for that day do not count toward the labor hour requirement.
Additionally, if any registered apprentices in excess of the applicable ratio perform work on the facility, such apprentices must be paid the full prevailing wage rate for any hours worked. In contrast, the apprenticeship participation requirement is not a daily requirement. A contractor cannot spread out personnel schedules to avoid triggering the participation requirement. The participation requirement is designed to prevent taxpayers from satisfying the labor hours requirement by only hiring apprentices to perform one type of work – encouraging the use of apprentices across the full range of work performed with respect to the facility.
Similarly, the IRA’s good faith effort exemption is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. The good faith effort exemption allows taxpayers to satisfy the apprenticeship requirements by showing good faith efforts to obtain qualified apprentices from registered apprenticeship agencies, if the request is made in accordance with the usual and customary business practices of the registered apprenticeship agency and the request is denied or not responded to within five business days.
The NOPR, however, sets forth additional restrictions on use of the good faith effort exemption, noting that the apprentices should be requested from registered apprenticeship agencies with the necessary geographic scope, occupational training, and customary practice of placing apprentices with employers and also identifying the specific information that must be included on written requests for apprentices to registered apprenticeship programs. This requires the taxpayer to ascertain its workforce needs to determine how many qualified apprentices its needs to employ in order to satisfy the apprenticeship requirements; to identify applicable registered apprenticeship programs reasonably available to supply apprentices to the facility; and to demonstrate the capacity to employ apprentices in the requested occupations.
In addition, the NOPR provides that a one-time denial of a written request to a registered apprenticeship program does not automatically qualify the taxpayer for the good faith effort exemption. In the event of a complete denial of a written request, the taxpayer must also submit an additional request within 120 days of the previous request. Taxpayers may (and in all likelihood, will) need to submit a written request to more than one registered apprenticeship program in order to satisfy the good faith effort exemption.
The NOPR and overall compliance
In a boost to labor unions, the NOPR sets forth a new “Qualified Project Labor Agreement” (“Qualifying PLA”) concept, which provides that penalty payments for failure to meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements will not apply if the facility is subject to a project labor agreement meeting certain requirements (provided that, any correction payments owed are paid on or before the tax return is filed).
A Qualifying PLA must, at a minimum: (a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents, (b) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions, (c) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement, (d) contain provisions to pay prevailing wages, (e) contain provisions for referring and using qualified apprentices consistent with the Initial Guidance, and (f) be a collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations. In other words, a non-union or open-shop contractor cannot insulate itself from potential penalty payments using the Qualified PLA concept.
The NOPR, however, also helpfully provides practical flexibility prior to imposing penalties for “intentional disregard” of prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements – significantly easing concerns of potential penalty obligations based on good faith mistakes and administrative burden. The IRA provides that failure to pay prevailing wages with intentional disregard results in a tripled correction payment and doubled penalty payment; and failure to comply with apprenticeship labor hours or participation requirements with intentional disregard results in a tenfold increase in penalty payments, from $50 per labor hour to $500 per labor hour.
Intentional disregard, according to the NOPR, must be “knowing or willful,” based on a determination “made by considering all facts and circumstances,” including whether the failure was part of a pattern of conduct or the absence of exercising reasonable diligence. From the prevailing wage perspective, the NOPR incorporates by reference mitigating factors mirroring DBRA requirements, which taxpayers will do well to heed as a protection against penalties. Those factors include posting prevailing wage rates at the facility site, incorporating prevailing wage provisions in project agreements, and undertaking quarterly or more frequent reviews of wages paid to ensure they are prevailing wages.
In addition, if a taxpayer submits a DOL wage determination request prior to work beginning, and the DOL wage determination is issued after work begins, penalties will not be imposed if the applicable correction payment is made to impacted individuals within thirty days of the DOL wage determination. In addition, correction payments to individuals may be made at any time in advance of the filing of a tax return claiming the increased credit (potentially limiting the amount of additional interest the taxpayer must pay at the elevated rates).
If a taxpayer makes correction payments before receiving a notice of examination with respect to the claim for the increased credit, the NOPR provides a rebuttable presumption against a finding of intentional disregard. In other words, the NOPR broadcasts the intent to incentivize taxpayers to promptly self-correct errors in compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, waiving the penalty payments for such correction and minor discrepancies.
In conclusion, the NOPR provides helpful additional instruction to parties seeking to ensure compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements pursuant to the IRA. As the renewable energy industry adapts to this new normal, the NOPR outlines a more pragmatic path to compliance than many in the industry had feared based on Treasury’s Initial Guidance. Some questions remain unanswered (including the timing of DOL responses to wage determination requests and the lack of standard reporting forms), but the NOPR allows parties to begin negotiating appropriate provisions in project agreements with more certainty on the compliance standards necessary to satisfy prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.

The project has been awarded an up to $398.6 million conditional commitment for a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office, according to Eos. If that comes through, the loan will fund 80% of the company’s planned expansion, including capital expenditure and other eligible costs, Nathan Kroeker, chief financial officer of Eos, told pv magazine USA. The company’s current semi-automated line is 540 MWh of annual production capacity, and it is currently in the process of ramping up to commercial production at this level, Kroeker said. 
“The issuance of conditional commitment by the DOE was preceded by legal, technical and commercial due diligence by the LPO to evaluate the loan and the project’s potential to meet market demand and commercial and environmental benchmarks,” the company stated. However, the project will need to meet certain milestones and technical, legal and financial conditions before the agency officially funds the loan. 
Eos’ zinc halide storage systems are specifically designed for long-duration energy storage, including utility-scale as well as microgrid applications, Kroeker said. 
“The market needs numerous non-lithium alternatives in order to achieve the green targets that companies, utilities, and state and federal governments have set. Given Eos’ product is non-flammable, it is also suitable for urban and potentially indoor applications,” Kroeker added. 
In 2018, the company relocated its production and supply chain from China back to the U.S., and the battery includes predominantly American components. Because of this, the company can take advantage of direct pay tax credits included under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed by President Biden into law last August.
The implementation of that legislation requires the industry to move with speed and urgency if it is to meet the demand for long-duration energy storage, said Eos CEO, Joe Mastrangelo.
“Project AMAZE should allow Eos to fully commercialize a safe American-made energy storage alternative aimed at creating a resilient, diversified lower carbon energy future,” Mastrangelo said. 
Eos was founded in 2008 and says its technology presents a cost-effective and scalable alternative to other energy storage technologies on the market today. In 2020, the company signed a deal to supply 1 GWh of energy storage systems in projects in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, and another to supply Carson Hybrid Energy Storage with 500 MWh of battery energy storage systems for the California grid. 
Last November, Eos along with Invinity Energy Systems were chosen to provide their systems for a 60 MWh solar-plus-storage microgrid developed by Native American-owned Indian Energy, to provide back-up power to the Viejas Casino and Resort. Eos’ role in the project included providing a 35 MWh zinc battery.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/07/meteomatics-expands-work-with-energy-companies-in-u-s/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",Meteomatics expands work with energy companies in U.S.,"Meteomatics, a Swiss weather intelligence company that forecasts the weather’s impact on some of the world’s leading businesses, plans to expand its work with energy companies and investors in the U.S.
The company reports that it is currently the primary weather data source for 80% of the leading European electricity companies, including ENEL, EDF and Engie. In addition, Tesla Energy, Shell, Toyota, Heimdall Power, and Stadtwerke München rely on Meteomatics’ weather intelligence to forecast energy demand and consumption.
The company was founded in  2012 by Martin Fengler after he was on an airplane that experienced turbulence, and he realized the need for hyperlocal weather forecasts. Meteomatics set out to revolutionize weather forecasting by using a next-generation forecasting engine combined with the potential of yet-untapped weather data measured by Meteodrones, which are operated by the company’s drone pilots and collect weather data from the lower and middle atmosphere. The company says that these drones make it possible, for the first time, to carry out high-resolution and direct measurements of temperature, humidity, air pressure and wind—all of which are incorporated into weather model caluculations.
Meteomatics recently established U.S. operations in Exton, Pennsylvania, and is making its technology and data available to U.S.-based traditional and renewable energy companies and investors. The company reports that with its data, users can improve energy management, navigate stressors on the power grid, minimize risks, and optimize earnings.
The U.S. joined 100+ countries around the world in signing the Paris Agreement. However, in March the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the U.S. may only reach 25% to 38% of carbon emissions reductions below 2005 by 2030, falling well short of the 50% to 52% required by the agreement, said the EIA. Meteomatics sees an increased reliance on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower, all of which are affected by weather. It estimates that even a 1% difference in forecast error can trigger economic losses of several million dollars per year, accuracy is important is estimating when, where, and how much energy will be fed into the grid, at any time and any coordinate in the world. The company pairs its hyperlocal weather data with live data from companies’ respective power plants to deliver intra-day and day-ahead energy forecasts for solar, wind, and hydropower.
“Meteomatics helps us in our quest for continuous improvement. The accuracy of its weather data helps us to plan better, to increase the efficiency of our energy systems, and to reduce costs,” said Kevin Rosati, senior facilities and energy management engineer, Toyota Europe.
In addition to determining how much weather will be sent to the grid, Meteomatics’ data can forecast when there may be events that could damage power plant infrastructure and prevent interruptions in service, the company reports. For example, wildfires and hurricanes specifically impact transmission lines, while droughts can damage the reservoirs of hydropower plants. Meteomatics says that with accurate forecasts, companies can better protect consumers and infrastructures and avoid interruptions to operations.
“Weather plays a substantial role in meeting the power needs of the world, and we’re currently experiencing the effects of this in the U.S. as we face heightened energy demand due to extreme weather and record high temperatures,” said Paul Walsh, CEO of Meteomatics N.A. “Over the past decade, Meteomatics has made weather data easily accessible and valuable to businesses, and we’re looking forward to working with more U.S. energy companies and investors to guide critical decisions, optimize operations and maximize their yields.”
