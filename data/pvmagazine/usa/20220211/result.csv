The group was focused on cutting the value of rooftop solar by dramatically cutting payments for excess solar energy generation, and adding a fixed $8/kW fee per month, a cost of $64 a month to a typical 8kW system owner.
The NEM 3.0 proposal was met with heavy resistance from industry leaders, environmental and working groups, grid experts, and solar-supportive Californians. With a rooftop solar economy half the size of the entire United States potentially on the line, these groups actively fought the proposal, which was ultimately delayed indefinitely.

One of the central foundations of the utility-supported coalition is combatting the “cost shift”, which is the argument that paying for excess solar generation at a retail rate results in higher costs for the utility, which, in turn, leads to higher costs for non-solar customers. California utilities claim current solar customers impose a cost of $2.8 billion to the grid, adding $200 to every non-solar customer’s bill every year.
Under that framework, the group built NEM 3.0, a proposal that was estimated by EQ Analysts to cut the value of solar by 57-71% for an average solar owner. The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) said that $4 billion in economic activity, 65,000 jobs, and thousands of small businesses were at stake under the proposed decision.
Cost shift?
Sixteen state-level studies, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, have disproven the cost-shift argument, as has a national study, completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Berkeley found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar.
CALSSA said the foundational ideas of the cost shift argument are flawed. First, the idea that energy not purchased from a utility is a direct cost shift on all other ratepayers is a flawed concept. CALSSA argues that facilities with solar, even without energy storage, self-consume at nearly 50%. This means they are drawing 50% less power from the grid during bright, sunny times, where air conditioners draw high energy loads and the grid is stressed. This causes supply and demand relief, which CALSSA said would cut the impact of the cost-shift as presented in half. As more batteries are added, self-consumption raises, further providing relief for the grid.

The second flaw CALSSA notes is that utilities assume fixed costs going forward, particularly in the buildout of more infrastructure. The utility profits from the buildout of transmission, and can justify more buildout and more peak demand charges during times of high energy need on the grid, said CALSSA. By blocking rooftop solar, the utilities effectively keep demand high, especially at crucial high-demand times. California’s investor-owned utilities have spend roughly $20 billion on infrastructure and taken in $20 billion in profits in the last twenty years.
CALSSA also said the utilities improperly calculate the future value of solar in its cost-shift model. Most solar arrays are built to last 25 years or more, but the utilities use a nine-year assumption when calculating future value. It said the utilities also improperly value the present value of rooftop solar systems, using historical data from a much different grid and market profile.
Finally, CALSSA argues the coalition’s evaluation misrepresents costs of solar fields vs. rooftop solar. Affordable Clean Energy for All, claims non-solar customers pay $0.25/kWh for rooftop solar instead of $0.03/kWh from a utility-scale solar field. Comparing wholesale prices versus retail energy credits is based on false equivalencies. A home buying electricity from a solar farm located hundreds of miles away is different than crediting a local school’s rooftop for power shared in the same neighborhood. Transporting the electricity across hundreds of miles of wires into Los Angeles causes efficiency losses and causes large costs in supporting the infrastructure that delivers it. With all these arguments taken together, CALSSA said the utility’s own cost shift argument dissolves from a $200 per year cost to about $25 per year, or $2.08 per month.
CALSSA argues the “real cost shift” is the one utilities place on ratepayers by perpetuating the cycle of infrastructure buildout to deliver power from distant sources. Transmission and distribution costs have climbed 66% in PG&E territory alone since 2016, and unpaid bills from transmission construction and maintenance among utilities exceed $19 billion.
Long-distance transmission causes increased risk of wildfire, not only further costs, but taking the lives and homes of many Californians. In 2017 alone, PG&E’s downed transmission lines were found to be the cause of $7.5 billion in damages. Recently, a new Californian state agency established by the Newsom administration called the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety announced it granted PG&E a special provision to recoup wildfire costs from electric ratepayers by raising rates.
Responding to the news of the $1.7 million combined contribution to the Affordable Clean Energy for All coalition, Environmental Working Group president Ken Cook said, “If there is one thing PG&E and the other big utilities do well, it is to buy influence and political cover. This front group, masked as some grassroots coalition, has provided that cover as utilities try to quash rooftop solar.”

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory launched a new catalyst based on nitrogen and carbon to extract hydrogen from hydrogen storage materials at mild temperatures and under normal atmospheric conditions without using metals or additives. This “breakthrough” would ease current issues with chemical storage and in particular dehydrogenation, the team led by scientists Long Qi and Wenyu Huan said. “The key to its efficiency is the structure of the nitrogen. Catalytic activity can take place at room temperature because of the unique closely spaced graphitic nitrogens as nitrogen assembly which were formed during the carbonization process. The nitrogen assembly catalyzes the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (C‒H) bonds in LOHCs and facilitates the desorption of hydrogen molecules,” the Ames Laboratory wrote on Thursday. The related article was published on January 28 on Science Advances. 
A team of University of Delaware engineers has demonstrated a way to capture 99% of carbon dioxide from air using an electrochemical system powered by hydrogen. “We demonstrate an electrochemically driven CO2 separator (EDCS) to remove CO2 from the air feed using a shorted membrane that conducts both anions and electrons. This EDCS is powered by hydrogen like a fuel cell but needs no electrical wires, bipolar plates or current collectors, and thus can be modularized like a typical separation membrane,” the six researchers wrote in the article published last week in Nature Energy. The University of Delaware wrote that, as the hydrogen economy develops, this electrochemical device could also be used in airplanes and buildings. The approach tested by the team led by UD Professor Yushan Yan involves internally short-circuiting the device. “It’s risky, but we managed to control this short-circuited fuel cell by hydrogen,” commented Lin Shi, a doctoral candidate in the Yan group and the paper’s lead author.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the country is working on attracting new investments in electric vehicles and hydrogen, adding that priority should be given to green hydrogen given the country’s “unique opportunity.” Germany is considered to be a potentially central trading partner. “Over the past year, [the] government has built on its successful Hydrogen SA strategy to make major strides in positioning South Africa as a global leader in this new market. This includes the development of a Hydrogen Society Roadmap for the next 10 years as well as a Green Hydrogen Strategy for the Northern Cape, supporting the development of a green hydrogen pipeline worth around R270 billion [€15.65 billion],” Ramaphosa said on Thursday in his 2022 State of the Nation Address. Earlier this week, the South African president appointed Daniel Mminele as head of the newly established Presidential Climate Finance Task Team. “His experience before the SARB [South African Reserve Bank] included credit-risk analysis, corporate banking, and project and structured finance at private banking institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa,” the government wrote on Wednesday. 
Norwegian consultancy and classification society DNV launched, together with 18 industry partners, a new Joint Industry Project (JIP) to enhance the standardization for hydrogen production systems using renewable energy-powered electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. “We are tackling this challenge by joining forces with major industry partners to work towards a new certification scheme and industry best practice for electrolysers which will facilitate successful water electrolysis projects. We undertook a similar approach for the wind energy industry about 30 years ago which proved to be very successful,” commented Axel Dombrowski, director Innovation & Digitalisation for Renewables Certification at DNV. Partners include BP, EDP, Equinor, Industrie De Nora, ITM Linde Electrolysis, McPhy, Shell, Siemens Gamesa, and thyssenkrupp nucera. The JIP is open for more partners to join until mid-April 2022.
Norway’s Aker Clean Hydrogen has increased its portfolio of projects and prospects currently under development to 2 GW, according to its results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Aker Clean Hydrogen was launched in February 2021. Among its key projects in the last quarter were the completion of the Hegra green ammonia project feasibility phase, the prolonged grid permitting process for the Berlevåg green ammonia project, and some developments at the Aukra project. “Aukra hydrogen hub proving to be technically and commercially viable; initial estimates showing competitive levelized cost of hydrogen,” Aker Clean Hydrogen wrote on Friday.
Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects more technological solutions related to storage and chemical plant design this year, mentioning the case of Haldor Topsoe, who redesigned its ammonia plant to respond to fluctuating hydrogen supply. On the other hand, fewer hydrogen projects are expected to be announced in the next months. “Will we see the same growth rate for the CCUS and hydrogen pipelines in 2022? We don’t believe so. The coming year will be all about maturing projects and securing funding,” the consultancy wrote on January 31. Wood Mackenzie said that translating hydrogen policies into reality will be politically sensitive. On Thursday, for instance, AP news agency reported that a panel of state legislators has rejected a bill that would have provided new financial incentives in New Mexico for hydrogen fuel derived from natural gas.
Boston-based clean energy solutions company Angstrom Advanced wrote that the development of the hydrogen energy industry also depends on the creation of “hydrogen communities.” The idea is to create an integrated energy system based on hydrogen. “At present, a couple of relevant projects have been launched worldwide, including but not limited to Rugao Hydrogen Town, Jiangsu, China; Harumi Hydrogen Town, Tokyo, Japan; and Orkney Hydrogen Town, Scotland,” Angstrom Advanced wrote this week.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/11/solar-in-the-nfl/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 11, 2022",Solar in the NFL,"This weekend, Super Bowl LVI takes place between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals at the SoFi stadium in Los Angeles, California.
The stadium, which was opened in 2020, is a $5 billion modern marvel with a beautiful, paneled, light-transmitting roof. It looks like the perfect place for the design of semi-translucent buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), but, alas, the stadium has no on-site solar to speak of.
SoFi Stadium could take a few notes from the Mercedes-Benz stadium in Atlanta, which played host to Tom Brady’s last Super Bowl win as a New England Patriot. This arena opened in 2017 and its designers found a way to fit solar and energy efficiency into its $1.6 billion construction contract. Mercedes-Benz stadium is LEED Platinum certified, the highest tier of “green” ranking available.
The stadium and surrounding area are topped with 4,000 panels producing more than 1.6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said this is enough for the Atlanta Falcons to power their gameday operations all year and have energy to spare. Local installers Hannah Solar and Radiance Energy were hired for the PV projects.
Top commendations go to the Philadelphia Eagles’ Lincoln Financial Field. About one third of the stadium’s annual use is met by its on-site solar installations which feature 11,000 panels and a capacity of 3MW. The stadium integrates panels in its side, and solar carports keep Eagles fans dry while they tailgate.
 
This author would also like to tip his cap to the New England Patriots, which signed on with ENEL Green Power to purchase 900,000 kWh of renewable energy credits. The credits add on to the Patriots’ onsite solar arrays, one of the first to be procured by an NFL team. Nearby, on the Patriots Place shopping center, a 525-kW system of 2,556 panels powers about 30% of its operations.
Interestingly, in 2020 Gillette Stadium found itself another alternative energy partner, fuel cell maker Bloom Energy. The Kraft organization commissioned Bloom to build a 2MW fuel cell server, which supplies nearly 50% of the stadium’s needs. The servers are installed in a microgrid-ready configuration.
Though this weekend’s Super Bowl won’t be solar powered, more stadiums integrate PV each year. Perhaps there is still hope SoFi stadium can add solar energy to its sparkling new roof one day.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/11/nighthawk-utility-scale-storage-facility-to-use-tesla-megapack/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 11, 2022",Nighthawk utility-scale storage facility to use Tesla Megapack,"Nighthawk, a 300MW battery storage facility planned for Poway, California, is being developed by Tenaska in collaboration with Arevon. The facility, which will use Tesla Megapack, is pending permitting approvals, but is expected to break ground in 2023.
The Tesla Megapack comes fully-assembled with up to 3MWhs of storage and 1.5 MW of inverter capacity. Last year Tesla announced that it was using cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for its Megapack, which would presumably cut costs and ease demand for nickel-based battery production capacity. Arevon announced last September that it had acquired 2GW/6GWh supply of Tesla Megapacks for its Falcon portfolio, a joint project with Tenaska in which the two companies are developing standalone storage projects in California load centers over the next four years.
Arevon recently signed a long-term contract under which the Nighthawk storage facility will provide energy and resource adequacy services to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). The Nighthawk project will connect to the grid at the Sycamore Canyon Substation, which receives renewable energy generated in the desert and distributes it to the San Diego area.
“The Poway community will reap the benefits of not only a more reliable grid but also the economic benefits of such an infrastructure project,” said Tim Hemig, senior vice president in Tenaska’s Strategic Development & Acquisitions Group. “In particular, storage projects provide additional tax revenue and construction jobs. Our team looks forward to working with the community to maximize these benefits.”
The Nighthawk project is located within an existing industrial park. Construction is expected to begin in 2023 and take about a year to complete. At the peak of construction, approximately 100 workers will be on-site.
Nighthawk is the second storage project that Arevon has announced in the San Diego area. The Peregrine project, planned for Barrio Logan, is anticipated to start construction in 2022.
