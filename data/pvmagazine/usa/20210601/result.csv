The 11 projects will be located in Augusta, Belfast, Corinna, Edgecomb, Old Town, Pittsfield, Readfield,  Troy, Wiscasset & Waldoboro, will be open for subscription to Central Maine Power residential customers, with a select few of the projects also being open to commercial and industrial customers.
Syncarpha shares that it expects more projects to be added to the portfolio in the coming weeks and months, with hopes to have them start construction later in 2021 or early 2022. Of the 11 listed projects, the company has provided some specifics about three of them.
A 7 MW project in Old Town will be built on land leased from the city on Dewitt Airfield, land which was previously vacant, unused and untaxed.
Acquiring the land needed for the project in Readfield was a bit tricker, and the property owner will put approximately 75 of 95 acres into conservation, with the remaining acreage leased to Syncarpha. Once the project’s operational life has ended, equipment will be removed and the portion used for the former solar farm will be put into conservation as well.
The Augusta project will be constructed on rocky land bordering a highway, with 10 acres of the land being donated to the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine for their outdoor education center.
According to Syncarpha, most of the projects are planned to start construction over the course of the summer.

According to the Energy Information Agency (EIA), lithium-ion battery storage has captured upwards of 90% market share in the U.S., and I believe that it will likely be the de facto energy storage technology from here on out. Beyond the automotive sector, batteries power everything from consumer electronics to aerospace to grid-scale and more, making it all the more imperative to understand the trajectory of the battery sector and its role in the transition to full electrification.
When we look at the market as a whole, we can draw clear parallels between the evolution of the battery sector and that of the solar industry decades ago. For early technologists, investors and adopters, the solar industry has taught us vital lessons that are now applicable as interest grows in the battery sector.
Today, battery technologies are one piece of the puzzle to accelerate the energy transition, and specifically, the software layer is expected to play a massive role by offering insights into new, sophisticated models of physical and chemical interactions, whether in electric vehicles or on the grid.
We’ve seen this play out in solar, and now we’re bringing the same playbook to the battery industry.
By reflecting on the challenges that impacted the solar industry, battery materials manufacturers will be better equipped to scale these next-generation technologies from the lab to have a real-world impact.
In particular, there are two challenges that we saw with the rise of the solar industry that the battery sector now must address and overcome in order to create a sustainable ecosystem for the long-term transition to 100% clean energy.
Amid the excitement of new battery technologies entering the market, companies need to prioritize the technology’s overall design from the get-go to avoid bottlenecks down the line. Specifically, battery manufacturers need to factor in a battery’s life expectancy based on frequency of use and track degradation, remaining life cycles and other considerations all the way to end of life.
In the early aughts of solar, we saw companies fall victim to poor initial project designs that ultimately inhibited potential growth. Firms that overlooked the importance of project design came out blazing with systems that were oversized in terms of capacity and cost by 10% to 30%  – sometimes in an attempt to erase errors in actual operations – that in turn made deployment more expensive.
Tracking design from the start is essential to meeting end goals, and the right software can provide the best top-down transparency in real-time, enabling projects to be more configurable and scalable. As the battery sector continues to grow, hardware companies need to explore software solutions that can mitigate bumps in the road to keep up with the fast-moving electrification goals.
Another unprecedented hurdle faced in the solar industry is the intensive amount of maintenance required to keep installed assets in good condition. Before the global PV industry developed in full swing, companies assumed the innovative solar systems at the time could conveniently produce electrons for their 20-30 year life cycles unmaintained.
In reality, many of these systems require replacement inverters, regular cleaning and other operations and maintenance care that were often initially overlooked. Analyst firm Wood Mackenzie predicts that operations and maintenance costs for global PV systems could reach as high as $9.4 billion annually by 2025.
In the case of batteries, maintenance has become a clear but economically draining priority amid higher-than-expected degradation rates from charging or discharging too quickly, which harms battery cells, causes fires and destroys the end-use product.
While a battery life cycle ranges depending on its application, sectors that rely on larger battery systems such as EVs and grid-scale will need clear, data-driven visibility into the health, performance, and eventual degradation of the battery in order to keep all assets up and running.
There is no silver bullet for the energy storage sector, but battery technologies can certainly benefit from better visibility enabled by software. In the coming years, batteries — whether lithium-ion, lithium-metal, or a yet-unmet technology — will only evolve to become increasingly software-defined, requiring breakthrough chemistries and production techniques that can buoy higher-quality energy density and competitive costs.
With software, what would traditionally take months or years of battery material development and testing condenses into mere weeks or days. Moreover, modern-day software will enable chemical architectures to be built in the cloud before being incorporated into physical lab bench testing. All these progressions will enable manufacturers to have more time to iterate and simulate thousands or millions of battery material combinations, resulting in significantly fewer costs and shorter development timelines down the line.
A major driving force of battery technology adoption lies in cost; as we saw decades prior in the solar industry, huge strides are being made in the battery sector to reduce hard costs. A recent influx of cost-competitive materials and advanced manufacturing techniques has reduced waste, improved quality and decreased hardware costs.
But how can we further drive down costs in order to drive cost-parity for EV or grid-scale batteries?
With the rising commoditization of lithium-ion battery cells, costs won’t hinge on battery cell or equipment prices but on the “soft costs” that have been a looming detriment to the global PV market, accounting for up to 70% of installed solar cost. Similarly, lithium-ion battery system soft costs could account for over 50% of total expenses in the industry.
In order to unlock substantial market share, maximize operational efficiency and decrease these soft costs, we must look to breakthrough technologies that can streamline critical and innovative processes while remaining economical.
Today, the global battery market size across EVs, grid storage and other use cases is approximately $77 billion, slated to grow to $390 billion by 2025. As we saw with the solar industry, a battery industry at this scale can and will support standalone, venture-backable software businesses to elevate the battery ecosystem even further.
At Energize Ventures, we’ve been evaluating the battery and energy storage market for more than four years, waiting for the right time, technology and team to invest. Now, we’re seeing strong comparisons between the market sizes of the solar industry five years ago and the battery industry today.
In reality, the battery market is continuing to experience rapid growth as companies are spending 5 to10 percent of installed costs on software. This means we can anticipate today’s multi-billion dollar market to grow to about a $40-$50 billion market by 2030 for software innovation exclusively.
We are sitting at a junction in the industry’s evolution as the level of market maturity and rate of growth signal a turning point for greater and more meaningful digital innovation to help drive these formative renewable energy systems of the future. Right now is the peak of the battery era, and we are fast-approaching full electrification.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/01/duke-proposal-aims-to-accelerate-ev-charging-infrastructure-in-north-carolina/,"BUSINESS,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,NORTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 1, 2021",Duke proposal aims to accelerate EV charging infrastructure in North Carolina,"Duke Energy has filed a $56 million electric transportation proposal in North Carolina, its second such proposal, following six months of stakeholder input and deliberation.
According to the utility, the proposal aims to advance the state’s transportation electrification measures, with the ultimate goal of achieving 80,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025. The filing  is the second that Duke has made to North Carolina regulators regarding electric transportation; the first was a $25 million electric transportation pilot program, approved in November 2020.
The latest proposal is expected to lead to the installation of more than 1,000 EV charging ports across the state. The filing outlines that these be 240V Level II fast charging stations, which have quickly become the standard for EV charging. These charging installations will be targeted at multifamily dwellings and along state highways. The utility also outlined plans to provide financial support to school systems to buy 60 electric school buses.
Aside from increasing public charging infrastructure, the Phase II pilot program is intended to sustain the development of a diverse fast-charging market, as the pilots will use hardware from multiple manufacturers.
The utility also is looking to develop a tariffed EV charging program for residential and business customers. The tariff would allow customers to install and operate EV charging stations for a monthly rate along with maintaining all operational choices, like brand of hardware and network. The goal is for this to become a zero upfront-cost option for customers charging EVs.
Duke separately filed for approval of a tariff to provide credits to reduce the upfront cost of upgrading electrical systems to install charging infrastructure for homeowners and businesses, further targeting the cost barrier of installing EV charging.
Outside of North Carolina, Duke has installed almost 600 EV public charging stations in Florida, including 50 in  previously-unserved locations, and has established a program in South Carolina to provide 400 customers with $1,000 to put towards the installation of a Level 2 charging station. Those customers would need to provide access to their charging data, and focus their charging to occur during off-peak periods.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/01/seia-joins-lawsuit-to-roll-back-fercs-latest-purpa-rules/,"LEGAL,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 1, 2021",Clean energy advocates bring lawsuit to roll back FERC’s latest PURPA rules,"The Montana Environmental Information Center and nine other solar and environmental groups have challenged in federal court the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC’s) recent rulemaking on PURPA that they said “effectively guts” the law’s implementation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) filed a separate petition.
The PURPA law “is the sole federal policy requiring monopoly utilities to purchase energy from renewable sources,” the solar and environmental petitioners said.
“PURPA has always been unpopular with monopoly utilities and their allies,” which have consistently “lobbied for PURPA repeal and weaker FERC rules,” the petition said. FERC “finally relented to that lobbying” in changing the PURPA regulations in 2020.
The full name of PURPA is the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.
FERC’s new PURPA regulations “cut off” Congress’s goal of encouraging development of renewable energy, the petitioners said, just as “declining costs for renewable energy and rising costs for monopoly utility fossil fuel generation finally made small scale wind and solar under PURPA competitive.”
The lawsuit, filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenges what petitioners called “four unlawful aspects” of FERC’s rulemaking that “exceed the agency’s authority and conflict” with Congress’s goals:
The solar and environmental group’s petition asks the court to “vacate” FERC’s rulemaking order—that is, to rescind the regulations.
Four of the solar and environmental petitioners—Montana Environmental Information Center, Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, and Vote Solar, were represented by Earthjustice. Five others—Appalachian Voices, Energy Alabama, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, and Upstate Forever–were represented by Southern Environmental Law Center. One petitioner, Community Renewable Energy Association, was represented by the law firm Richardson Adams.

The assets will be developed through bp’s 50-50 solar joint venture Lightsource bp.
Under terms of the deal, bp will include 1 GW of “safe harbor” equipment and expects the acquisition to close in 30 days. The projects are expected to generate returns of at least 8-10%.
The projects are spread across 12 states, with the largest portfolios in Texas (ERCOT) and the Midwest (PJM). Assets with a combined generating capacity of 2.2 GW are expected to reach final investment decision by 2025, with the remaining progressing by 2030.
7X has developed multiple utility-scale solar projects with over 1,600 MW under construction or operational. It has safe-harbored $100 million worth of inverters to qualify more than 2,000 MW of projects for Investment Tax Credits.
The deal will move bp toward its target of growing its renewable generating capacity to 20 GW by 2025 and 50 GW by 2030.
A new report from Guidehouse Insights said that North America, Western Europe, and Asia Pacific are expected to account for almost 90% of the new long-duration energy storage capacity installed worldwide through 2030.
The report said that little agreement exists on which attributes of energy storage will be required and valued over time, specifically the energy capacity or duration of energy storage that could be cost-effective for certain electricity grid services and applications. Even so, as plans to deploy new renewable energy generation advance, future electricity grids will likely require different types of energy storage than those currently being deployed, particularly for long-duration challenges and seasonal capacity challenges.
The report said that despite the advantages of long-duration energy storage technologies, actual deployments have been limited so far. Barriers to broader adoption include geographic restrictions, lack of trust in new technologies, low round-trip efficiencies, improved lithium-ion battery technology, and higher upfront project costs.
Canadian Solar filed notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to sell up to $150 million of its common shares to support its long-term growth plans, including investing in its battery storage business and growing its storage pipeline.
The company may also use a portion of the proceeds to invest in or acquire businesses, assets or technologies that it believes are complementary to its business, including. The company expects to complete the offering over the course of around six months, or longer if necessary.
The common shares will be sold through US Tiger Securities as sales agent.
XL Solar Partners said it will deploy a 250 kW commercial rooftop solar system at FR8T Yard, a commercial office building in Houston. The system will include monocrystalline modules to maximize power generation on the project’s constrained land area.
According to Project Sunroof, Houston represents one of the largest commercial and residential rooftops solar development opportunities in the U.S. By one estimate, Houston has the most solar energy potential of any U.S. city with an estimated 18,940 GWh of rooftop solar generation potential per year. FR8T Yard expects to export excess power into the ERCOT grid.
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed House Bill 2165 into law, expanding access to electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, particularly to people with low incomes and people of color.
In addition to Oregon’s goals for electrification and vehicle emission reductions, Brown, as the chair of the Western Governors’ Association, launched the Electric Vehicles Roadmap Initiative to lay out a path to the adoption of zero-emission technology across the West.
HB 2165 removes the current sunset on funding for the state’s EV rebate programs. It also aims to strengthen the Charge Ahead EV Rebate Program to better serve targeted communities. And it is intended to streamline investment in EV infrastructure by Portland General Electric and Pacific Power through a small charge, with the requirement that at least half of the investment benefit targeted communities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/01/venn-diagramming-responsible-procurement-and-customer-requirements-nextrackers-take-as-the-higher-calling/,"SPONSORED POST,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",,"JUNE 1, 2021","Venn diagramming, responsible procurement and customer requirements: Nextracker’s take as the higher calling","There is increasing pressure for companies to be held more accountable for their supply chains. The global unearthing of forced labor, draft legislation in Europe, Covid-19, and climate change are all conspiring to bring supply chain transparency into even sharper focus, demonstrating just how critical governance is in terms of environmental protection and human rights for business success.
Meanwhile, a legislative initiative drafted by the European Committee on Legal Affairs on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability is also in discussion.
The groundswell demonstrates that this new directive, submitted to the European Commission last September, is expected to be adopted later this year. If successful, it will enforce mandatory supply chain due diligence for all companies operating within the European Union, even if they are established out of the region, but are selling their products and services there.
At the end of April, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published a set of tools, such as the Product Traceability Protocol, to support companies in proving no forced labor has been used in their supply chains.
The Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol is a set of guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.” (Read the protocol here.) It also released a Solar Buyers’ Guide on Traceability to put forth supply chain best practices.
In a webinar on Tuesday, June 1, Nextracker, SEIA, Engie, and Micron Technology will address these critical issues. Director of Sustainability Sarah Albert will discuss improving supply chain transparency with a particular focus on the importance of being on the ground, working closely with suppliers to meet sustainability expectations, and establishing a company-wide code of conduct.
Register for free to join this discussion
Joining her will be Evelyn Butler, Vice President of Technical Services at SEIA, who will outline the association’s newly published solar supply chain documents; Craig Murphy, Sr. Director Global Procurement Solutions, Analytics, and Product Compliance at Micron Technology who, in discussing the electronic manufacturer’s supply chain risk management, strategy, and processes, will provide insight on what lessons can be transferred to solar; and Thierry Dardeau, Procurement Category Manager – Renewable Energy at ENGIE, a customer of Nextracker, who will share the company’s responsible procurement strategy, including new supplier onboarding, exiting supplier management, integrated audit approaches and the overall importance of supply chain transparency.
In the run up to the webinar, Sarah Albert answered some questions on what the team at Nextracker is doing in this area.
Why is it so important to implement responsible procurement practices?
At present, we’re working to reduce our environmental footprint and in a company like Nextracker, working proactively with key stakeholders in our supply chain is a way to this just that. However, taking a holistic approach to implementing sustainability in to the procurement process is critical to build a resilient supply chain with properly managed risk mitigation. In the case of Nextracker, the growth we’ve experienced over the last few years has increased the complexity of our supply chain network and the only way to efficiently manage the process is by incorporating sustainability into our procurement practice.
Do customers really care? 
Absolutely. Responsible procurement comes up in nearly every customer meeting that we have and is often the most pressing question. We’re seeing the industry’s standards and expectations change very rapidly in this space which has provided us with a great opportunity to step up and demonstrate our commitment and dedication to improve.
At Nextracker, you’re looking to implement a sustainability engagement initiative and responsible procurement program (RPP) with your supplier partners. How does a company best approach suppliers about these issues? 
We meet our suppliers where they are. That means respecting and valuing their work, their cultural norms, language, and inviting them to the table to dialogue rather than a one-way conversation.
What are the key considerations in such initiatives and programs? 
We believe that to become true partners, we must invest in the capacity-building of our suppliers. We bring in third party vendors to provide customized training, risk assessment, and onsite audits. We always have a strategy but recognize that we must be flexible as we get to know each supplier better and make sure that we’re transitioning the knowledge we bring in from third party vendors in-house so that eventually the know-how becomes native and operational.
You recently wrote, “Much of what I learned from the employees and observed during my time on the factory floors led to Flex programs that have helped improve working conditions and expand workplace benefits.” Can you provide specific examples of improvements made? 
Factory floors are my favorite part of my job. I could go on forever about this topic. I’ve learned lessons such as the importance of safe, clean workplaces as well as safe and clean living accommodations to more complex issues such as managing communication and cooperation between different generations of workers. We’ve also worked on training managers to be less top-down focused in their management style and the importance of competitive compensation.
Final thoughts?
Tackling responsible procurement is a daunting task yet the solar industry can observe from other industries that meaningful strides are possible. I’m constantly learning and evolving my point of view and looking to learn from other industries for insights. We aren’t reinventing the wheel – it’s about communication. The most important component is an open dialogue between customer and supplier and to have local teams in each region to adapt to cultural norms and needs.
