If solar is to decarbonize the energy system, it would need to add 800 MW of new capacity every week for 30 years, said a report by Worley and Princeton.
That much solar would require the land area of 260 Tokyo Olympic stadiums every week until 2050, said the report.
In modeled pathways towards net-zero, the report highlighted the need for a multi-front offensive on carbon emissions, with no single strategy able to achieve the goal alone.

Two scenarios were modeled: one that showed solar and wind growing at the 2020 rate for the next 30 years, called “constrained renewables”; and a 100% renewables path that ends fossil fuels entirely by 2050, and does not require the use of carbon storage.
Under the “constrained renewables” path, the U.S. is faced with installing 200 GW of solar power each year. The path would also require unprecedented amounts of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power plants. The ask is difficult for electric power transmission, too, as the U.S. would need to outpace the current buildout of transmission corridors to deliver this newly integrated power.

The figure below estimates the amount of solar deployment necessary to achieve the 100% renewables model pathway. The dotted line represents the rate of the five strongest years of deployment across the U.S., and the solid line show the best five years for the entire world.

The report emphasizes a need for planning ahead and reducing project development times, especially in a pathway that uses carbon capture and nuclear, which take a long time to build. Solar PV demonstrated the shortest overall project timelines in both modeled pathways.
To prevent widespread “energy sprawl” for solar, wind, and transmission, the report looks to decentralized energy solutions. Rooftop and small-scale solar will be key to diminishing land use and the need for high-powered transmission lines. This, in concert with carbon storage, virtual power plants, and energy efficiency, can help protect lands from further development, the report said.
Worley and Princeton identified five shifts for the energy and carbon infrastructure to undergo for this vision to be realized:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/04/new-york-adds-52-5-million-in-community-solar-incentives-for-low-income-residents/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,NEW YORK",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 4, 2021",New York adds $52.5 million in community solar incentives for low-income residents,"The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) released $52.5 million in funding through the Inclusive Community Solar Adder (ICSA) program, which aims to provide utility bill savings through community solar energy for 50,000 households. The program includes low-to-moderate-income subscribers, affordable housing providers, and organizations working with disadvantaged communities. 
Equitable access to solar for low-to-moderate-income people can be challenging, as ownership and leases are often financially out of the question. Community solar represents an opportunity for underserved communities to participate in the benefits of clean energy. The incentives provided by this program are designed to better fund programs that have a focus in serving these communities.
The incentive is an installer-facing per-Watt adder that pays different amounts depending on other incentives that the project has already received:

An additional environmental justice incentive adds $0.20/W for Con Edison projects that are located in, benefit, and are developed in partnership with environmental justice communities burdened by nearby electric power generating facilities.
EnergySage reports that on a cost per Watt basis, a solar panel installation for homeowners in New York ranges in price from $2.45 to $3.31.
To receive the adder incentive, eligible projects must be metered as community distributed generation. The projects must meet the requirements set by the NY-Sun Commercial/Industrial (750 kW to 7.5 MW systems) or the NY-Sun Nonresidential incentive program. Projects must dedicate no less than 20% of their total capacity to eligible residential subscribers. 
The incentive was first discussed in March in a workshop, where some participants found the eligibility rules to be overly inclusive, said Hodgson Russ Attorneys. The New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) suggested that the LMI CDG Adder should only be provided to projects that would not receive the Community Adder, Phase One Net Energy Metering, the Market Transition Credit or the Community Credit, as those projects have progressed to a certain level of financial viability.  Other projects, where the additional adder may be needed the most, could be left with limited financial viability.
NYSERDA disregarded this recommendation, and said that all pipeline projects would be eligible. It clarified, however, that projects that had already reached operation would not qualify.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/04/walmart-signs-on-as-anchor-tenant-for-new-york-community-solar/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,NEW YORK",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 4, 2021",Walmart signs on as anchor tenant for New York community solar,"Walmart said it contracted with Nexamp to serve as an anchor tenant to support 129 MW of community solar projects in New York.
The retailer is subscribing to a share of each of 23 Nexamp solar farms across New York and will receive energy credits, equivalent to approximately 50 MW of the entire portfolio. Walmart has 36 stores and one distribution center participating in the program.
Walmart set a goal in 2020 to target zero emissions by 2040 across its global operations and aims to use renewable energy to power all of its facilities with renewables by 2035. The company said that 36% of its operations worldwide are powered with renewable energy. As of the end of 2020, Walmart had more than 550 onsite and offsite projects in operation or under development in eight countries, 30 U.S. states, and Puerto Rico.
In March, Nexamp closed a $440 million senior secured credit facility for a 380 MW portfolio of solar and energy storage assets. The portfolio covers five states and includes some 100 community solar projects, including energy storage capacity totaling 120 MWh. MUFG Union Bank served as the lead arranger for the syndicated financing, which included a group of lenders. At the time, Nexamp said it has nearly 300 new solar and storage projects in its development pipeline.
And in April, Sol Systems said it completed solar energy systems totaling 6.5 MW at seven Walmart stores in California. The portfolio included a mixture of solar energy systems installed on rooftops and parking lot carports. Total development cost was around $10 million, and Bank of America served as a tax equity partner. The retail outlets will take all of the energy. Interconnection approvals involved four separate utilities.
The fixed-axis solar arrays power stores in Burbank, Calexico, North Highlands, Perris, Placerville, Sacramento, and Wasco. The portfolio was developed by Sol Customer Solutions, a unit of Sol Systems, a joint-venture with global infrastructure investment firm Capital Dynamics. REC was the construction subcontractor. Trina supplied the modules and the inverters were sourced from CPS.
