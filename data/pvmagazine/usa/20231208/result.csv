The 20 MW / 80 MWh project is the largest active battery energy storage facility in Virginia, large enough to power the equivalent of 5,000 homes. 
The project was sold to Dominion Energy Virginia in September 2021 by East Point Energy, an energy storage business focused on origination construction, and operation. 
Virginia’s Clean Economy Act (VCEA) requires that 100% of Dominion’s electricity sales come from emissions-free sources by 2045. To meet the needs of a renewables-based grid, more energy storage like the Dry Bridge project will be needed. 
The project will support the firming of intermittent, renewable energy and provide energy supply during peak demand periods. The storage is also expected to improve energy distribution, lowering costs for consumers. 
“Dry Bridge, our first utility-scale, stand-alone energy storage facility, represents a significant milestone in our commitment to meeting our VCEA targets. Dispatchable resources such as this are critical to ensuring the reliability our customers expect,” said Brandon Martin, manager of business development at Dominion Energy. 
Solar push 
Much of the power stored by projects like Dry Bridge will come from renewable resources including solar and wind. Dominion Energy in October proposed a plan containing over a dozen new solar projects that would add 772 MW of capacity to the grid. This is enough to power 200,000 homes at peak output, said Dominion. 
Dominion’s proposal includes six solar projects that, if approved, would total 337 MW that will be owned or acquired by Dominion Energy Virginia. It also includes 13 power purchase agreements (PPAs) totaling 435 MW with independently owned solar projects. The PPAs were selected through a competitive solicitation process. 
If these projects are approved, Dominion will have more than 4.6 GW of solar in Virginia, or enough to power more than 1.1 million homes at peak output.

Solar design and proposal platform provider Aurora Solar is embracing AI in its product offerings as the industry matures.
Aurora’s AI uses machine learning algorithms to construct 3D models of homes and their roofs in about 30 seconds. Launched in 2022, the AI platform has been continually honed based on customer feedback. With AI, solar companies can use predictive tools to identify top prospects, enable sales teams with design tools, and improve design efficiencies with automation.
“Move fast. Speed is one of your main advantages over large competitors,” said Sam Altman chief executive officer of OpenAI.
Aurora’s AI is applied to its full project cycle from lead capture to initial proposal generation, to final system design.
The software is trained on nearly half a million site models and generates imagery based on satellite and lidar data. Aurora said the end result is a fast and accurate proposal generation.
Aurora said its automated design tool has performed well when compared to manual designs. Aurora AI performed as well or better than a human 63% of the time for simple roofs, 83% of the time for moderate roofs, and 76% of the time for complex roofs, said the company.
As for speed, Aurora reports that its design generator vastly outpaced human designs. While a standard design service may range from 30 minutes to 24 hours, Aurora says its tool produced a design in 32 seconds on average, based on 340 trial runs of the software.
Over the past year, solar sales teams and designers used Aurora AI 1.6 million times, with strong sequential monthly growth, said the company.
“Aurora’s AI-powered software and onboarding services helped us transform traditional roofing specialists into solar roofing specialists in a day, and even helped one dealer get their first sale in week one,” said Mark Stevens, solar application manager, CertainTeed.
Aurora said it has the following goals to improve its AI-backed services:

Acenes are benzene molecules with unique optoelectronic properties. They are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons made up of benzene (C6H6) rings which have been linearly fused.
Singlet exciton fission is an effect seen in certain materials whereby a single photon can generate two electron-hole pairs as it is absorbed into a solar cell rather than the usual one. The effect has been observed by scientists as far back as the 1970s and though it has become an important area of research for some of the world’s leading institutes over the past decade; translating the effect into a viable solar cell has proved complex.
Singlet fission solar cells can produce two electrons from one photon, making the cell more efficient. This happens through a quantum mechanical process where one singlet exciton (an electron-hole pair) is split into two triplet excitons. According to the researchers, acenes have the potential to display improved quantum yields in this process.
The research team developed a new synthesis method to stabilize acenes. The new approach consists of adding carbodicarbenes ligands to acenes that are already doped with boron and nitrogen. The scientists explained that acenes doped with these compounds have improved electronic properties. However, they are unstable when exposed to air or light, just like traditional acenes.
“With the addition of the new ligand, the acenes became positively charged, which improved their stability and also gave them unique electronic properties,” they explained.
Until now, most of the boron, nitrogen-doped acenes could emit only blue light. However, with their stabilization, the scientists could produce different colors. Depending on their length and types of chemical groups attached to the carbodicarben, they managed to build molecules that emit red, orange, yellow, green, or blue light.
“We’re still in the very early stages of developing the specific applications, whether it’s organic semiconductors, light-emitting devices, or singlet-fission-based solar cells, but due to their stability, the device fabrication should be much smoother than typical for these kinds of compounds,” the research team stated, noting that red emission, for example, can be used for biological applications like imaging.
Another potential application is to use the compounds as organic light-emitting diodes for screens.
The academics presented their findings in the study “Air- and photo-stable luminescent carbodicarbene-azaboraacenium ions,” published in nature chemistry.
In 2019, an MIT research group demonstrated how singlet exciton fission could be applied to silicon solar cells and could lead to cell efficiencies as high as 35%. They claimed to be the first group to transfer the effect from one of the ‘excitonic’ materials known to exhibit it, in that case tetracene – a hydrocarbon organic semiconductor, into crystalline silicon. They achieved the feat by placing an additional layer just a few atoms thick of hafnium oxynitride between the silicon solar cell and the excitonic tetracene layer.
The MIT researchers described their work as “turbocharging” silicon solar cells and said it differs from the most common approaches to increasing solar cell efficiencies, which these days are focused more on tandem cell concepts. “We’re adding more current into the silicon as opposed to making two cells,” they stated at the time.

The international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 63 of the “solar cell efficiency tables” in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The scientists said they have added six new results to the new tables since June.
One of the six results added to the tables is the 25.2% efficiency that researchers at Northwestern University in the United States achieved for a 1-cm2 lead halide perovskite cell.
Furthermore, the tables now include the 22.4% efficiency that US-based First Solar achieved for a 0.45 cm2 cadmium-telluride (CdTe) cell, the 26.1% efficiency that China’s University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) obtained for 0.05 cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell, and the 26.1% efficiency the Northwestern University and the University of Toronto in Canada achieved for a 0.05-cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell.
The fifth result added to the tables is the 36.1% efficiency that Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) and Dutch research institute AMOLF achieved in September for a multijunction solar cell based on silicon and III-V semiconductors such as gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs).
The sixth result is the 33.9% efficiency the Chinese module maker Longi announced for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell in early November.
In Version 62 of the tables, released in June the researchers added 21 new results, a record number for the Tables. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems and the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Data analyzed by Solcast, via the Solcast API, shows there was unusually high irradiance in large swathes of Northeast North America due to anomalous high pressure that kept Atlantic moisture offshore. In contrast, the Gulf Coast received notably lower irradiance resulting from atmospheric shifts and cloud formation produced by the same high-pressure system.
The North-East saw clear skies, reaching irradiance levels up to 30% above the long-term November average. This was an unusually strong and widespread anomaly stretching from Oklahoma US to Quebec Canada. The driving force behind this high irradiance is the anomalous high pressure across the continental US that kept Atlantic moisture and resulting clouds from impacting solar assets located in these regions.
The Gulf Coast experienced cloudier conditions from Florida to the east coast of Mexico, with irradiance around 20% below the long-term November average. The anomalous high pressure system that brought increased sunshine farther north, induced lower pressure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to increased atmospheric instability and cloud formation, reducing solar potential.
The Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range played a major role, shielding western Mexico from the Gulf’s moisture. The large disparity caused by the mountains can be seen in the average daily GHI data, with areas west of the mountains averaging 4-5 kWh/m2 across the month in clear contrast to the 3-4 kWh/m2 east of the mountains.

Despite the cloud-inducing impacts of the developing El Niño weather pattern along the US West Coast, a balance was achieved as the drying effects of the anomalous high pressure countered its effects. This pattern allowed solar asset operators on the US West Coast to still enjoy irradiance levels typical for November. However, further north along the west coast, the same high-pressure system diverted Pacific moisture away from the continental United States and towards British Columbia.
This redirection resulted in irradiance as much as 40% below the long-term average in British Columbia. Though significant in relative terms, this represented a small absolute reduction, considering the total solar potential in this region is only around 1 kWh/m2/day this time of year.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/08/geothermal-heat-pumps-help-decarbonize-energy-use-and-more/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 8, 2023",Geothermal heat pumps help decarbonize energy use and more,"By deploying geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) at mass scale could decarbonize heating and cooling and save energy in U.S. buildings, according to a report conducted by experts at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and funded by the Department of Energy (DOE’s) Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO),
By retrofitting approximately 70% of U.S. buildings with GHPs, along with improving the building envelope, the analysis finds that electricity demand could be reduced by as much as 13%  by 2050 versus decarbonizing without GHPs. According to the report, this would avoid as much as 24,500 miles of new grid transmission lines by 2050.
GHPs are help lower building energy costs because of their high efficiency and ability to supply heat without fuel purchases. Also called ground source heat pumps, the way GHPs work is they transfer heat to and from the ground by circulating water (or antifreeze solution in regions with cold climates) through underground piping. As a result, GHPs have no emissions.
GTO funding this study in order to investigate the impacts on the electric grid of the large-scale deployment of GHPs. For the purpose of analysis, the researchers simulated the energy use impacts of deploying GHPs into 68% of existing and new buildings in the United States (78% residential, 43% commercial) in 14 climate zones across the contiguous United States by 2050.
The study found significant savings in grid costs, CO2 emissions, and building energy consumption. Specifically, the research concluded that if all applicable buildings in the contiguous United States were retrofitted with GHPs at once, electricity use would be reduced by 401 TWh, which is an 18% reduction from the baseline EULP each year. Furthermore, the study found that such widespread use would eliminate use of 5,138 billion MJ of fossil fuels annually.
“Geothermal heat pumps offer enormous value for the nation’s energy future,” said Alejandro Moreno, associate principal deputy assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. “This report confirms that geothermal heat pumps are a ready-made strategy for decarbonizing our buildings while reducing the need for new electricity generation and transmission, and bringing energy savings to Americans nationwide—all while creating U.S. jobs.”
In addition to saving energy and cutting carbon, another advantage would be using domestically produced GHPs, as most are made in America. Increased use would stimulate a domestic industry, create local jobs to install and maintain the systems.
