Researchers from Australia and Vietnam have analyzed the short and long-term dynamics of the so-called solar energy rebound effect.
The rebound effect consists of a reduction in expected gains from a more resource-efficient technology as a result of behavioral or systemic change. As for residential solar, this effect equals the change in a household’s electricity consumption resulting from PV power generation.
“The issue occurs in almost every country, no matter whether it is developed or developing. The issue we found in Vietnam, of which customers abandoned solar systems, is a new finding. However, we believe this could also happen in any country where the policy supporting solar power is not fully and scientifically explained, and where consumers are not comprehensively consulted,” the research’s corresponding author, Luan Nguyen, told pv magazine. 
The research group used a panel dataset encompassing approximately 3500 households in Hanoi, Vietnam, and obtained two datasets on the household and district level, respectively, covering the period 2015-2021. The panel dataset contains detailed monthly information on electricity demand and bills, solar system capacity, production, and installation time. About 48% of the households had PV, and the rest used electricity solely from the grid.
“If households that adopt solar panels also substantially change their energy consumption patterns, it is possible that the overall carbon emissions associated with energy use may be relatively unchanged. This phenomenon is known as a ‘rebound effect,’ where increased supply fails to induce substitution between solar and grid energy,” the scientists explained. “Notably, all homes in the dataset did not possess solar batteries, but none fed solar energy into the national grid. It means all solar owners either consumed all solar production or wasted it.”
To estimate the effects of PV installations on consumption, the researchers used the difference-in-differences identification strategy, which is a statistical method used to calculate the causal impact of an intervention by comparing it to a group that did not receive the same treatment.
“Leveraging a substantial, distinctive, and up-to-date panel dataset, we unveil a substantial rebound effect that challenges the presumed environmental advantages of residential solar energy,” the researchers highlighted. “We are also (to our knowledge), among the first authors to study the dynamics of this process and show that both the primary effect and the rebound effect tend to diminish over time.”
Based on their data, the academics extracted four estimation outputs: two for households’ total electricity consumption and two for demand from the grid. “The only differences between models in each pair are the inclusion or exclusion of exogenous variables, and those differences are to test the consistency of the estimations,” they explained. Exogenous variables included electricity demand, price, income, and other social parameters.
The academics found that, when including exogenous variables, solar installations immediately increased the total electricity demand by approximately 16.3% compared to non-solar households. However, it diminished to about 3.5% after 13 months. Also, the consumption from the grid fell by 3.6% after installation, fading out to about 1.5% at the end of the period.
“Since households that install solar panels may possess unobserved characteristics that distinguish them from households that did not, there is the potential for our results to be affected by unobserved confounding,” they stressed. “However, across a range of diagnostic methods, we find little evidence that endogeneity or misspecification issues may be biasing our results.”
The research group comprised scientists from Australia’s Griffith University, the University of Adelaide, and Vietnam’s Hanoi Power Corporation. Their findings were introduced in the paper “Solar rebound effects: Short and long term dynamics,” published on Renewable Energy.

The company will instead focus on producing tandem solar modules.
CubicPV’s board of directors cited changing market dynamics, including “a dramatic collapse in wafer prices and a surge in construction costs” as the reason for aborting the plan.”
As part of restructuring plans, the company reduced its workforce and eliminated positions tied to the U.S. factory effort. The company said it would support the affected workers by providing severance packages and extended health benefits.
Following a 16-year tenure as CubicPV’s chief executive officer, Frank van Mierlo has decided to step down. Tim McCaffery, global investment director, SCG, will assume chief executive officer responsibilities, guiding the company through the transition.
“Together with our Board, we’ve concluded that the one thing that could truly make a difference in humanity’s fight against climate change and the U.S. ability to realize a solar manufacturing renaissance is to invent a better panel,” said Frank van Mierlo.
CubicPV will now focus on tandem module development. The company seeks to address stability, reproducibility and efficiency of silicon-perovskite tandems and promises to solve the durability challenge that has slowed the commercialization of perovskite material use in solar panels.
“Cubic’s engineering acumen and robust IP portfolio create a solid foundation for growth. SCG strongly believes that the Company’s tandem technology could be a solar breakthrough, transforming the energy landscape,” said Tim McCaffery. 
In Summer 2023, the company secured $103 million in equity financing to support the now-scrapped wafer factory. 
This past December, CubicPV and South Korean silicon producer OCI announced an eight-year supply agreement in which Cubic becomes OCIM’s first US customer for its low-carbon, U.S.-compliant silicon.
The contract was valued at approximately $1 billion, establishes a commitment for an annual supply volume by OCI, providing Cubic with the polysilicon it needs in order to begin manufacturing at its U.S. plant. Under the terms of the agreement, OCI would begin to provide silicon in 2025 from its manufacturing facility.
REC shutdown
In similar news, Norway-based REC Silicon has announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, REC Advanced Silicon Materials LLC, is shutting down polysilicon production capacity at its facility in Butte, Montana. The plant employed about 300 people and was one of the top private employers in the region.
The manufacturer said the shutdown of the business in Butte is “primarily necessary due to the regional structural imbalance in supply and demand for electricity.” It is also said to be part of its strategy to ensure long-term profitable operations.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/08/onyx-renewables-and-qcells-partner-on-solar-plus-storage-projects-in-massachusetts/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MASSACHUSETTS",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-08,Onyx Renewables and Qcells partner on solar-plus-storage projects in Massachusetts,"Onyx Renewable Partners L.P. is developing two community solar and energy storage projects in Massachusetts that will have a total of 6.2 MW of solar and 5.5 MWh of energy storage.
The two projects, which are planned to be located within the ISO New England (ISO-NE) region, are expected to offset 3,900 tons of carbon dioxide per year the equivalent to powering approximately 700 homes, according to the U.S. EPA.
Both solar-plus-storage installations feature Qcells modules along with DC-coupled battery storage technology and its Geli Energy Management System (EMS). Qcells and Onyx plan to deploy a risk-sharing partnership structure on the projects, including a revenue share agreement and Qcells’ Network Operations Center (NOC) Services offering to mitigate risk on the long-term assets.
 The Qcells Geli EMS reportedly uses the same machine learning algorithm to model the financial returns on projects as used in real-time battery operation, providing what Qcells says is accurate and reliable project revenue projections.
The projects are expected to benefit from the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program. This program is capped at an aggregate 1.6 GW of deployment and provides per-kWh incentives for PV projects 5 MW or less, with about 20% to35% of the allotted capacity designed for projects 25 kW or less. It works on a declining-block program in 80 MW blocks, meaning that earlier projects will be more heavily incentivized, and as the program passes through the blocks, incentive values will drop by 4% per block.
Both projects will also participate in the state’s Clean Peak Energy Standard (CPS), an initiative aimed at meeting high electricity demands with clean energy to create a more sustainable and reliable power grid.
 The Geli EMS will help optimize battery charging and discharging to comply with program requirements for SMART and CPS, the companies report.
Qcells announced the expansion of its solar module factory in Dalton, Georgia where it added 2 GW of solar capacity, bringing the U.S. factory’s output to more than 5.1 GW. The company said its Dalton factory is the largest manufacturing plant of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and the first solar panel plant expansion since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The expanded factory will manufacture nearly 30,000 solar modules a day, and will create 510 new jobs.
Onyx Renewables, based in New York City, is an institutionally backed, vertically integrated, developer, owner and operator of solar and energy storage projects. The company was established in 2014 by Blackstone Group, and is now, Onyx is owned by SDCL Energy Efficiency Income Trust (SEEIT), a global investor in sustainable energy solutions. The company reports that it has completed more than 11 GW of renewable energy, with an operating portfolio of over 380 projects and a development pipeline spanning 35 states.
Onyx and Qcells announced interest in expanding the solar-plus-storage partnership to projects in ISO-NE, California ISO, NYISO, and more.

Norway-based REC Silicon has announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, REC Advanced Silicon Materials LLC, is shutting down polysilicon production capacity at its facility in Butte, Montana. The plant employs about 300 people and is one of the top private employers in the region.
The manufacturer said the shutdown of the business in Butte is “primarily necessary due to the regional structural imbalance in supply and demand for electricity.” It is also said to be part of its strategy to ensure long-term profitable operations.
REC Silicon produces solar-grade polysilicon at its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, and electronics-grade polysilicon and silicon gas at its factory in Butte, Montana. The plants have an annual production capacity of more than 20,000 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon.
The company’s Washington facility restarted production in November 2023 after five years of idleness and following a 10-year take-or-pay supply agreement for high-purity fluidized bed reactor (FBR) granular polysilicon with Hanwha Q Cells, announced last September.
“Discontinuing the polysilicon production at Butte will significantly reduce annual energy consumption and operating costs,” the company said in press release this week.
The polysilicon business will continue to produce for approximately six to nine months to fulfill polysilicon supply obligations to the customers, said REC Silicon. After the supply obligations are satisfied, the company expects that the workforce in Butte will be reduced accordingly. Further details are to be announced.
“The decision to shut down the polysilicon business in Butte was very difficult from a human perspective because of the impact on REC’s workforce,” said Kurt Levens, REC Silicon’s CEO. “We did everything in our power to return profitability to the polysilicon business in Butte, however, forecasts for sustained high electricity costs that are outside of our control necessitated this decision.”
According to the manufacturer, short- and mid-term increases in electricity pricing in the region is not expected to abate and will not allow for profitable operations in the polysilicon business line.
The company took short-term mitigative measures that included electricity hedging, optimized production and increased sales prices. These efforts minimized the losses in the short term, but “the decision taken is primarily about the mid- to long-term viability of a very power-intensive polysilicon process located in a high electricity cost region, particularly relative to alternative manufacturers and regions,” said REC Silicon.
Polysilicon prices have been in free fall amid a growing supply glut, and manufacturers have struggled to turn a profit. In its recent market update for pv magazine, OPIS, a Dow Jones company, said that polysilicon prices in China fell to CNY 60.25 ($8.40)/kg on Jan. 16, down 51.8% year on year.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/08/nikola-opens-its-first-hydrogen-refueling-station-in-socal-for-heavy-duty-vehicles/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-02-08,Nikola opens its first hydrogen refueling station in SoCal for heavy-duty vehicles,"Nikola Corporation, a manufacturer of heavy-duty battery and fuel cell electric vehicles, has opened the first in what will become a network of hydrogen refueling stations in Southern California.
The station, located in Ontario, Calif. is part of Nikola’s HYLA brand and can fuel up to 40 of the company’s hydrogen fuel cell electric Class 8 trucks every day. Nikola is aiming to build a network of up to 60 such hydrogen fueling stations over the next few years, and plans to have nine up and running by the end of the second quarter of this year. 
While the Ontario station is part of a private network at this point in time, the company is designing the HYLA stations to accommodate all 700-bar Class 8 OEM trucks, Ole Hoefelmann, Nikola’s president of energy, told pv magazine USA. 
The process of launching this first refueling station has also provided the company with lessons learned, according to Hoefelmann. For instance, “it is beneficial to bring city government officials like city planners and fire departments to the project discussion as early as possible. They are great partners and most interested in bringing low emissions solutions to their communities,” he said. 
The Arizona-headquartered company began serial production of its hydrogen fuel cell electric truck last summer and has also seen some regulatory support, receiving a collective $58.2 million from regulatory agencies last year to build out its network of heavy-duty truck hydrogen refueling stations. The largest of these was a $41.9 million grant from the California Transportation Commission and California Department of Transportation, aimed at constructing six hydrogen refueling stations in Southern California. Also last summer, the company announced a voluntary recall of more than 200 Class 8 Tre battery-electric vehicles, following a fire that affected multiple trucks at its headquarters in Phoenix. 
Now, Nikola is focused on securing a robust supply chain and refueling infrastructure for hydrogen, which it sees as important to bringing more hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks onto the roads. The company expects that once it has completed bringing nine refueling stations online in the next few months, it will have one of the largest heavy-duty hydrogen refueling networks in the world. 
As of 2023, the U.S. had 59 retail hydrogen refueling stations, mostly in California, but few were equipped to cater to heavy-duty vehicles. But the U.S. is currently leading the development of new technologies and protocols to fulfill the heavy-duty transportation requirements, Hoefelmann said, adding that in the coming months, the company expects to see some of those innovative solutions on the field. 
Other companies are also taking a closer look at hydrogen refueling capacity. In 2022, Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy Resources and BlackRock Renewable Power entered a memorandum of understanding, with a $650 million initial investment, that included looking at building out charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. 
However, one challenge companies in the space continue to face regards permitting processes, and obstacles like extensive waiting times or unclear process streamlines continue to discourage the infrastructure developers, Hoefelmann added. 
California lawmakers have provided one good example on how to deal with that: Senate Bill 1291, passed in 2022, requires all California cities and counties to develop and expedite, streamlined permitting processes for hydrogen fueling stations, Hoefelmann said.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/08/arcadia-releases-its-first-report-on-the-state-of-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA,MARYLAND,MINNESOTA,NEW JERSEY,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-08,Arcadia releases its first report on the state of community solar,"Arcadia, a company that builds utility data technology to serve consumers in the community solar market, released its inaugural report on the community solar sector in 2023. The State of Community Solar report highlights the anticipated growth in an industry designed to serve all.
Community solar offers access to clean solar energy to the nearly two-thirds of Americans who do not have access to residential solar, whether it is because the don’t own their home, their roof is not positioned for solar or they cannot afford the up-front cost.
Challenges to its growth include high interest rates, increased local opposition to projects, interconnection delays, workforce issues, unfriendly regulatory environments and ongoing tariff issues between the United States and its trading partners, according to the report.
Despite these challenges, a Wood Mackenzie report expected community solar to exceed 6 GW by the end of 2023, estimating that existing community solar projects in the U.S. generate enough electricity to power 918,000 homes. The WoodMac report forecasts 118% growth over the next five years, with the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) setting a target of 30 GW by 2030, which Arcadia said is an important baseline for the growth of community solar in the years ahead.
In addition to providing clean energy to ratepayers, the growth in community solar is spurring investment in American-made products. The report points to the recent Nexamp order of 1.5 GW of Heliene solar modules to support Nexamp’s growth in the community solar sector.
Federal programs 
In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the most significant climate bill in U.S. history, giving a boost to community (and other forms of solar) through federal tax policy. Arcadia expects to see the IRA drive more innovative business models, and cites as an example the recent nationwide partnership between Arcadia, Google, and EDP Renewables NA, a collaboration that prioritizes direct community investments. According to the Arcadia report, it will deliver utility bill savings to low- to medium-income households by connecting an estimated 25,000 households in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic with 500 MW of distributed solar energy.
At the federal level, community solar also got a boost through several programs including : National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP), Low-Income Clean Energy Connector, Community Power Accelerator, and the American-Made Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar.
State programs
The Arcadia report notes important activity at the state level, including New Mexico, which adopted its first program, Maryland and New Jersey made pilot programs permanent. Other states, including Minnesota, dropped geographic restrictions that hobbled their community solar programming. California is expected to adopt a program this year.
Jobs
With the growth in community solar comes job growth, and Arcadia notes that this clean energy option creates “sustainable, good-paying jobs that can provide economic boosts to towns that need it”. The report cites a study by the University of New Mexico that predicts that its new program will generate over 1,500 jobs, totaling $58 million in labor income and $206 million in total industry economic output. The community solar industry supports 16,785 jobs as of 2022, and this number is expected to increase
Arcadia was founded in 2014 on the belief that everyone deserves access to clean energy, and reports that it manages the nation’s largest community solar portfolio with more than 2 GW of solar under management.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/08/connecticut-green-bank-allocates-100-million-toward-solar-and-storage-projects/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CONNECTICUT",JERUSHA KAMOJI,2024-02-08,Connecticut Green Bank allocates $100 million toward solar and storage projects,"The Connecticut Green Bank, a financial institution that is accelerating the green economy in Connecticut and striving to reduce the energy cost burden of commercial and private consumers, has doubled the amount of funds it will allocate toward the growth of commercial solar projects for businesses, towns, schools, nonprofits, and state agencies.
Up from $49.5 million in 2020, the fund now has $110 million to meet the growing number of commercial, municipal and state solar projects geared at reducing energy costs and leveraging Inflation Reduction Act credits. 
In January 2022, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority launched Energy Storage Solutions, a program that incentivizes Eversource and UI customers to install energy storage systems at their homes or businesses. CT Green Bank helped to finance the scheme’s declining-block upfront incentive, which reduces installation costs by a reported $200 per kWh of battery capacity, up to $7,500 for each customer. 
Since its launch, the Energy Storage Solutions program has initiated 21 residential, one commercial and one industrial project. Connecticut Green Bank states that an additional 109 proposed storage installations have applied to the program; 76 are residential and 33 are commercial and industrial. If approved, a total of 172,011 kWh of energy capacity will be added to the state’s renewable energy portfolio. 
CT Green Bank has also helped to finance the state’s Residential Solar Investment Program (RSIP). RSIP provides partial refunds and incentives to reduce homeowners’ rooftop solar costs. Once installed, utilities under Master Purchase Agreements with CT Green Bank buy Solar Home Renewable Energy Credits (REC) per its program’s policy. Green Bank’s REC sales revenue generates green bonds leveraged by individual and institutional buyers. The RECs and green bonds generate financing to support RSIP incentives and cover administrative costs. 
Connecticut’s RSIP has allowed 46,000 households – 50% of which are in vulnerable communities – to install rooftop solar panels. CT Green Bank states the program has generated more than $1.4 billion of public and private investment, including $160 million of ratepayer incentives, averaging at $30 per REC sale. RISP also helped generate more than 16,000 clean energy jobs across the state.  
CT Green Bank states that $50 million of the increased funding will go to solar projects at businesses, towns and schools. Bert Hunter, the executive vice president and chief investment officer at Connecticut Green Bank, says each is looking to reduce energy costs and increase resiliency to grid outages. At 0.28¢ per kWh, Connecticut has some of the highest electricity rates in the country, 46% higher than the national average, according to clean energy solutions platform EnergySage.  
CT Green Bank’s board also approved allocating more funds toward state projects facilitated by CT Green Bank’s Solar Marketplace Assistance Program. The platform helps state properties and municipalities navigate the process of going solar. Up from $20 million, the fund now has $60 million intended to support the development of 26 projects with a combined capacity of 17 MW. 
The green bank states that most of these projects will provide solar for the Department of Corrections, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, and the CT Technical Education and Career System. The CTECS development will offer students the opportunity to shadow various workers.   
The Connecticut Green Bank leverages a public-private financing model for its investments. The institution pools limited public dollars to create long-term solutions later financed by the private sector, helping scale clean energy projects across the state. CT Green Bank states it has attracted $2.06 billion in private investments using $362.7 million of its money. The institution has added almost $2.5 billion to the state’s green economy, with 40% allocated toward programs supporting moderate and low-income community members.
