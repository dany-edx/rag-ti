https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/30/clean-energy-jobs-outpace-the-overall-market/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 30, 2023",Clean energy jobs outpace the overall market,"According to the annual U.S. Energy and Employment Jobs Report, over 18,000 utility-scale clean energy jobs were added in 2022, outpacing the overall jobs market in terms of grow. Clean energy jobs rebounded 3.9% in 2022 after having a down year in 2021.
Today, over 460,000 jobs in the United States are devoted to solar, wind, battery energy storage and other cleantech industries, reported the Department of Energy. The energy sector has recouped 71% of the number of jobs lost in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, said DOE.
Solar had the largest number of jobs gained in the electric generation sector, adding 12,256 workers from 2021 to 2022. Coal electric power generation jobs decreased by 6,780 from 2021 to 2022, down 9.6%. Batteries, for both grid storage and electric vehicles, added 3,225 jobs, rising 4.6%.
Clean energy jobs grew across all 50 states and D.C. Excluding traditional transmission and distribution jobs, California added 13,116 jobs (+3.6%), followed by Texas, which added 5,198 (+5.5%), and New York, which added 5,054 (+3.0%).
When including transmission and distribution jobs, California added 13,293 (+3.2%), followed by West Virginia, which added 6,975 (+19%), and Texas, which added 5,136 (+3.5%).
The Department of Energy report shared that the solar industry employs veterans 60% more than the overall market. The industry also employs people represented by unions, collective bargaining agreements, or project labor agreements 60% more than the total U.S. workforce.
Manufacturing has been a large element in the clean energy jobs boom. More than 82,000 workers have clean energy manufacturing jobs in the United States.
“We are on the leading edge of incredible growth in the clean energy economy. Clean energy production and the manufacturing of new energy technologies are creating new career paths and economic opportunity in communities across the country,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association (ACP).
The number of women working in energy increased by 149,732, an increase of +7.8%, meaning that over half of the net jobs added in 2022 were held by women. However, the energy workforce was 73% dominated by men, making it less balanced in terms of gender than the U.S. workforce average, which was 53% male.
Employers across all technologies report they expect growth from 2022 to 2023, ranging from 1.6% expected job growth in fuels to 6.4% expected growth in energy efficiency.  
Over the last eight months, following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, over $150 billion in domestic utility-scale clean power investments have been announced, according to the American Clean Power Association (ACP). By 2030, it is estimated the IRA will drive the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery facilities. 
“While growth in clean energy jobs is outpacing the rest of the economy, sustaining this progress requires overcoming a number of looming obstacles,” said Grumet. “Topping the list is America’s need for high-capacity transmission lines to carry clean and reliable energy to homes and businesses across America. We must connect clean power to the people to achieve the economic promise and domestic job growth of these new industries.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/30/doe-provides-178-million-to-schools-to-lower-energy-costs-lower-emissions/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 30, 2023",DOE provides $178 million to schools to lower energy costs and emissions,"The Biden-Harris Administration, through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), announced the first round of schools selected to receive funding from the Renew America’s Schools grant program, a competitive award that will support the implementation of energy improvements in K–12 schools across the U.S.
The $178 million in funding will directly benefit 74,000 students and 5,000 teachers in 97 school buildings across the country by enabling them to pursue projects that will lower energy costs, lower emissions and create healthier, safer and more supportive learning environments in their schools.
“Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, DOE is demonstrating scalable and replicable clean energy models that will create healthier and safer K-12 schools,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm.
DOE more than doubled the funding for Round 1 of the competition from $80 million to $178 million, due to the number of applications received and the needs expressed. Applications were received from Local Education Agencies (LEAs) from 48 states and two territories. A total of over 1,000 concept papers were received, with a total request of nearly $5.5 billion in requests.
Nearly half of the applications received were from schools in DOE-identified Disadvantaged Communities (DACs), 95% were schools that qualified for Title 1 Schoolwide Programming, 73% included schools in which over 50% of the student population qualified for Free, and Reduced-Price lunch, and 45% included schools in a rural locale.
DOE selected 24 applicants that demonstrated significant technical merit and responsiveness to the goals of the funding opportunity. Many of those selected (42%) indicated that they plan to install solar modules and batteries; 13% plan to install “alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure”.
Part of the application process was to identify the community benefits, and all recipients have committed to specific economic and environmental benefits to their communities. Five of the projects selected, for example, are on Tribal lands, two include commitments to offer construction jobs first to Tribal members, and one commits to prioritizing apprenticeship opportunities for local youth.
More than half of the projects selected made commitments to work with labor unions, and with union-affiliated apprenticeship programs, to ensure that construction, operations and maintenance jobs pay a family-supporting wage and include strong health and safety standards, while also providing opportunities to women, veterans, tribes, and workers of color. Nearly every project includes a commitment to tying career technical education programs within the schools to job opportunities on the project, providing an entryway for students into high quality jobs in the construction trades.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/30/nrel-study-builds-framework-to-accommodate-ev-charging-infrastructure/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JUNE 30, 2023",NREL study builds framework to accommodate EV-charging infrastructure,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has been researching how the country could accommodate EV drivers charging needs for over a decade. Their most recent study is helping governments, organizations, and critical stakeholders get an idea of what the infrastructure could look like. 
Data for the study was collected by first evaluating the number, type and location of chargers needed to build an EV charging network that meets consumer needs. The research team had to estimate how quickly consumers would begin driving EVs seven years from now. They also looked at the varying charging needs of drivers and assessed how different climates across the United States might impact energy requirements.
Researchers used software from the EVI-X modeling suite, which NREL developed in conjunction with the California Energy Commission for charging network planning, site design, and financial analyses. EVI-Pro, for example, was used to estimate daily charging needs for users with and without private charging stations. EVI-RoadTrip was used to project charging infrastructure requirements for cross-country road trips, and EVI-OnDemand to understand what charging stations would look like for ride-sharing applications (think Uber and Lyft). They also estimated the number of EVs on the road under varying adoption rates.
This insight resulted in three frameworks catered to a low, medium and high consumption rate of EVs. To accommodate a mid-adoption scenario of 33 million EVs on the road by 2030, the report projects that we’ll need 28 million charging ports. While states will have to implement regulations requiring contractors to include EV charging features in residential homes, researchers forecast we’ll also require:
Eric Wood, a senior EV charging infrastructure researcher at NREL, said the data creates a snapshot of what experts think a successful charging network could look like in 2030.
By studying regional transportation data across the country, the research team assessed the impact of EV adoption in neighboring states on highway corridors of affected countries, “How might that out-of-state demand compare to the charging needs from residents in my area?” Wood said. 
Understanding this impact is integral to transitioning into the Administration’s equitable and clean transportation future – it considers the charging needs of communities in underserved areas. “We’re looking at climate, travel patterns, housing, charging preferences, and demographics,” Wood said. States and districts can now access this detailed region-specific analysis, which Wood suggests will help them better estimate EV charging infrastructure needs to guide local investments. 
And the consumer goods market is catching on, too: Subway announced in February that it would feature EV stations that could charge your car in as little as ten minutes. 
As the natural battery landscape continues to evolve, ongoing research and adaptation are necessary. Gabe Klein, executive director of the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, noted that while the findings serve as a snapshot of a moment in time, the work will remain relevant. NREL plans to regularly update the data to provide stakeholders with data that helps identify areas of the charging network that require improvement while scaling up successful components.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/30/beef-cattle-agrivoltaics-on-an-oregon-family-ranch/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TRACKERS,OREGON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 30, 2023",Beef cattle agrivoltaics on an Oregon family ranch,"An Oregon State University study found that most of the prime, flat land near grid load is already in use as farmland, growing food or ranching livestock. In many markets including the Pacific Northwest, agrivoltaics, which is the pairing of farming with solar, is a solution for the food versus energy transition dilemma.
Agrivoltaics provides benefits for the farmer or landowner, the project developer and local communities.
Ranching holds particular promise in the agrivoltaics community, as photovoltaic shade has been shown to benefit forage, especially in arid regions. This creates better soil composition for cows, sheep and other farm animals to graze, while creating a more natural soil composition around the panels, according to the Oregon State study.
David McFeeters-Krone, a founder of Rute Foundations and developer of a cattle farming agrivoltaics project in eastern Oregon, told pv magazine USA that his development, Bear Valley Solar Pasture, LLC, is currently engaged with a fourth-generation cattle grazer in Grant County, Oregon. The project is receiving oversight from Oregon State University’s agrivoltaics program for land use management, water and soil studies on the farm’s site.   
The farmer, Jack Southworth, who operates on a 12,700 acre farm and rents an additional 24,700 acres, was previously approached by an undisclosed large solar developer interested in taking over the farm as a whole, McFeeters-Krone recalls. With cattle revenue at a base rate of about $10 per acre, the farmer did not want to exclusively lease the entire ranch even though solar sited in the same area could produce $700 to $1,000 per acre from added revenue.  
Southworth Brothers Ranch runs a total of 650 cows and calves, and 600 yearlings, the developer said.
In October 2022, Southworth reached out to Dr. Serkan Ates, who studies pasture and grazing management at Oregon State in conjunction with Chad Higgins, an associate professor who heads the university’s agrivoltaics program, the developer said. “Can we have cattle and solar at the same time,’ is what he was asking about the best possible land use without losing his livelihood and the community impact,” McFeeters-Krone said.
By early 2023, the developer was doing demonstration projects with Oregon State and began working with Southworth on his ranch.
In an emailed statement to pv magazine USA, Dr. Ates said his team is planning to develop a research study at the Southworth ranch site, where he will try a number of forages and different vegetation establishment and management techniques.
In addition to the financial gains from sharing his land with a solar developer, McFeeters-Krone says previous studies have shown that solar project’s shading can improve the soil’s moisture retention, which should stimulate a regeneration of Southworth’s cattle lands as well.   
Grass and hay are encouraged following the introduction of ample shading, providing sustenance for the cattle grazer’s operations, while manure left behind from the cattle will add soil nutritional content over time as well, the developer said.   
Bear Valley Solar will deploy 240 kW of the 1.5 MW cattle-sited solar field pasture this year, with construction in its first phase ramping up this summer, McFeeters-Krone said. The project is cattle-friendly using the Rute Foundations SunTracker mounting hardware. The hardware combines a panel height and groups a supporting cable wiring harnesses mesh or grid to allow for cattle, farm vehicles and ranchers to safely pass underneath mounted PV systems.  The support cables also allow easy mounting of wiring harnesses, eliminating the need for expensive and disruptive trenching, he said. 
SunTracker uses a cantilevered foundation that is significantly stronger than a typical range fence construction. While the mounting hardware may not be strong enough to withstand impact of a herd of animals, its anchoring into the soil is designed to provide stability to cattle and weather elements, he said.   
“The Klamath region of Oregon has difficulty retaining water, so I suspect we’d create a micro-climate in southern Oregon region as well,” McFeeters-Krone said about the replicability of the Bear Valley small PV project.
Like Jack’s Solar Garden in Colorado, Bear Valley hopes to show soil rejuvenation, moisture retention and water preservation that can produce a 20% gain in regions such as Oregon which are increasingly seeing prolonged drought seasons due to climate change, the developer said.
Homegrown cattle farming
The cattle ranch that Southworth farms was started by his great grandfather in 1885. Southworth is a member and current chairman of Country Natural Beef, a cattle cooperative that focuses on raising beef in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner.
Southworth has planted willow trees to restore streams on his property and worked with the Forest Service to sustainably graze his cattle in the summers, among other measures employed by local farmers.
In addition to adding solar generation on his family ranch, Southworth is also a member of the Harney County Forest Restoration Collaborative. Since 2010 the southern Malheur Forest collaborative in Oregon has been responsible for the restoration of more than 250,000 acres of forest lands.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/30/10-best-practices-for-building-trust-when-developing-solar-projects/,"GUEST POST,MARKETING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 30, 2023",10 best practices for building trust when developing solar projects,"It’s a common story today. A solar developer identifies a promising parcel of land in a rural community, only to encounter staunch opposition from NIMBY (not in my backyard) activists.
Recognizing the growing prevalence of such concerns, Tim Montague, host of the Clean Power Hour podcast, organized a webinar Dahvi Wilson, Founder of Siting Clean, LLC, and myself. Together, we delved into public acceptance challenges around solar projects and explored ten strategies and best practices for building trust and overcoming opposition to solar project development. The following recommendations are based on our discussion.
Disinformation and misinformation
Social media platforms make it easy to spread misinformation and disinformation in today’s digital age. Let’s define both terms:
Both misinformation and disinformation are often conveyed by word-of-mouth, but Facebook and other social platforms act as super spreaders that can quickly shape public opinion and fuel concerns at zoning boards and other community meetings.
When disinformation, misinformation, and the fear of the unknown spread through a community, landowners and their neighbors can easily feel apprehension and resistance to solar project developers.
While there’s no way to stop misinformation and disinformation, here are ten strategies that can be used to reduce their impact.
1) Be a solar ambassador and educate others
Educating the community is the key to counteracting misinformation, disinformation, and fear of the solar unknown. When deciding to develop in a community, your team must quickly spread and separate solar fact from solar fiction. Facts and scientific research can help debunk any misinformation or disinformation that may be infecting the community via social media and word-of-mouth.
Facts should include positive aspects, such as no health and safety risks, carbon mitigation, job creation, tax revenue, and the low-impact nature of solar as a land use. They should also include negative but true information, such as the occasional need for tree cutting. With transparent facts in hand, you can address these concerns and present mitigation strategies and successful case studies.
2) Have a ground game
Your ground game should start well before public hearings. You’ll need to have data, establish local relationships, and engage with the community. By being proactive, your local project proponents will have an opportunity to tell their stories and address concerns before the opposition gains momentum. Waiting until the hearing may result in missed opportunities to build trust, answer questions, and incorporate feedback into the project design.
3) Build community trust
Solar developers are often seen as outsiders, so they must be able to gain community trust, especially in areas where renewable energy is still relatively new. As outsiders, developers must align themselves with the insiders.
As early as possible, take the following steps.
With your ground game in play, you should have the tools to become a reliable source of information while understanding that initial trust may not be readily given. Your transparency, accurate information, and acknowledgment of legitimate concerns will gradually foster trust and credibility, paving the way for constructive community conversations and informed decision-making.
4) Keep it simple, listen, and have empathy
While providing accurate information is important for building trust, keep the information simple. If your information is too technical, it may increase fear of the unknown. Instead, solar developers must go beyond technical details and genuinely listen to community concerns. Respond to objections with facts and examples from other projects.
It’s crucial to understand that community values often eclipse financial benefits. Honest conversations about the community’s identity and the importance of preserving their farming “way of life” can help address concerns and build a shared vision for the future.
5) Send FAQ mailers
Informational mailers sent directly to community members can counteract any myths and misinformation that may develop later. Mail them early to establish accurate information and address concerns proactively. Since these concerns are now common in many areas of the U.S., you can create a frequently asked questions template and fill in the local information.
6) Make information about solar or your project publicly available online
Create a website or provide access to an online data room that includes health and safety reports from local universities, affidavits from independent engineers, environmental reports, and other information provided with permit applications. This preemptively addresses misconceptions and allows developers to build trust and credibility. Include a web link to the report in the aforementioned direct mailers.
7) Mobilize local advocates
Identifying and mobilizing local solar champions is a powerful tactic for overcoming opposition. These advocates can be landowners, farmers, or community members invested in fighting climate change, preserving their agricultural heritage, or seeking economic stability. Engage with them and demonstrate how solar can align with their community’s values and aspirations to build local support. Advocates can also include universities, climate science groups, and local constituents. Meeting with mayors, members of the Board of Supervisors, City Council, or planning commissioners and understanding their concerns can form the foundation of community trust.
8) Host community meetings
Hosting community meetings outside of official public hearings allows individuals to express their concerns and feel heard. Actively listen and engage with community members to de-escalate tensions and work toward garnering support for your projects. Trust and support may not be achieved overnight, but these casual informational meetings can be the first building blocks of consistent interaction and genuine dialogue. If possible, co-host the meeting with the property owner who may be leasing or selling their land.
9) Prepare for opposition
To prepare for opposition, organize an internal team with specific roles and responsibilities. One team member can address scientific and environmental concerns, another can address misinformation campaigns, and another can engage with local stakeholders.
For all the common objections:
This concerted effort involving permitting managers, project developers, and other relevant team members can help navigate opposition and successfully permit the project.
10) Consider dual-use agricultural applications
Some people perceive that a solar project can change the community’s agricultural identity. To address this opposition, developers may be able to incorporate pollinator plant meadows instead of grass, which can increase the local biodiversity in the surrounding area. The pollinators will not only look more appealing than gravel and grass, but they’ll also show neighboring farmers that you support their crops by providing habitat for bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. Going further, developers can invite beekeepers to establish and maintain bee colonies on-site within the solar array.
Incorporating agrivoltaics, which allows for the cultivation of crops or the grazing of livestock beneath solar arrays, is another way to show your support for farmers. This approach has the potential to not only bring additional revenue streams to those involved with the project, but also preserve the cultural identity of the land and the community.
While these solutions may not always be feasible, they may help diffuse opposition if they can be incorporated. Agrivoltaics come with economic and operational considerations, including regular plantings, harvesting, watering and agricultural maintenance that will change standard solar O&M practices. As a result, agrivoltaics might not work in every market where you’re developing, but it’s surely a consideration and a growing trend within the broader industry.
In Summary
As solar development grows throughout the U.S., it’s natural to have community questions, skepticism, and outright political opposition. We hope this information has provided you with some useful strategies and tactics for winning public acceptance and counteracting local opposition. With a good ground game, transparency, outreach, and data, we’re confident that solar projects will one day become the norm and be welcomed in communities.
Climate change is a global problem that requires local solutions. It’s my hope that the strategies and tactics identified in this article will help you cultivate a local solution for the communities you’re working in.
