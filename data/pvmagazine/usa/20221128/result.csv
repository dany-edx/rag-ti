One of the most significant provisions of the infrastructure law is the long-term extension of the investment tax credit (ITC), which was instrumental in launching the U.S. solar industry. The bill calls for a 10-year extension of 30% of the cost of installed equipment to be tax exempt, falling to 26% in 2033, and 22% in 2034. That 30% credit also applies to energy storage, meaning retrofits of batteries to solar arrays can benefit. This is all good news for homeowners interested in high-efficiency appliances, sustainable building improvements, electric vehicles, battery storage devices, and solar panels. However, navigating the maze of incentives can be a challenge.
Palmetto Solar, a solar installer that’s been in business for 11 years and currently installing in 25 states, conducted a survey to determine which of the incentives people are most interested in. These include heat pumps, electric vehicles, additional solar panels, solar battery storage, and more.
A survey was sent to Palmetto customers across the U.S. who purchased a solar energy system in or prior to September 2022, when the survey was conducted. More than 350 Palmetto solar customers from 20+ states responded to the survey.

55% of respondents are located in the eastern United States.
About 20% of respondents were not yet producing power at the time the survey was conducted. While the respondents’ average system size was 24 panels, more than 50% of respondents purchased a 16 to 30 panel solar energy system.
The survey asked solar homeowners how satisfied they were with the energy efficiency of their home, with 1 being very dissatisfied and 5 being very satisfied. Most respondents fell into the 3 to 4 range, indicating some level of satisfaction but recognizing that there might be opportunities to improve their home’s energy usage and maximize their investment in solar energy.

More than 70% of respondents named price as a primary factor in the decision to invest in energy-efficient technology, while 55% named incentives and credits. Now that the Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes energy-efficiency upgrades, including home energy audits, high-efficiency (HE) appliances, and building envelope improvements, Palmetto is seeing a significant difference between adoption rates and interest—especially for solar battery storage and electric vehicles.
While only 5% of solar owners currently have battery storage, 61%, or 220 out of 358 respondents, said they are interested in investing in battery storage. EVs have even more interest, with only 11% of respondents having already invested in either a hybrid or electric vehicle, but more than 78% of respondents saying that they would be interested in a hybrid or electric vehicle as a result of the EV rebate outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. The only category for which adoption rate exceeded interest was high-efficiency appliances, with 58% of respondents already having invested in at least one HE appliance for their home.
While regional differences emerged for both the adoption of and the interest in home energy-efficiency upgrades, solar battery storage showed the greatest opportunity for market growth, having an adoption rate of only 5% and the highest interest rate at 61%. Among the home energy-efficiency upgrades presented in the survey, solar battery storage captured the highest level of interest in four out of five U.S. markets. In the Northeast, however, battery storage came in second to HE appliances at 57% vs. 59% respectively. Overall interest was highest in the Western and Midwestern states, where 70% of homeowners indicated interest in smart home battery storage knowing that incentives may now be available.
When it comes to environmental impact, solar owners believe that electric or hybrid vehicles and smart home battery storage would have the greatest impact on reducing their carbon footprint— even over additional solar panels—with about a quarter of respondents voting for each. Narrowly behind them were high-efficiency appliances, which many solar owners have already invested in.
When asked which upgrades might have the greatest impact on their financial savings, respondents favored solar battery storage and additional solar panels. Just over a quarter of solar owners believe battery storage will have the greatest long-term impact on their financial savings. In contrast, while solar owners believe that electric vehicles have the greatest impact on the environment, battery powered cars ranked last in terms of long-term financial savings. This may be due to the higher perceived cost of purchase and ownership, even after the savings provided by the Inflation Reduction Act.
One more insight from the survey was that high-efficiency appliances, rather than battery storage or EVs, had the greatest perceived impact on one’s comfort and lifestyle. Battery storage, however, came in second at 24.8%—most likely due to the fact that batteries can mitigate outages and save additional money on electricity bills, depending on the area and utility. Home energy efficiency improvements, such as insulation, windows, and doors, came in third.
The purpose of the survey was to understand the factors that are going to motivate homeowners to invest in these home upgrades, whether it be price, environmental impact, or something else. It turns out that price is the most important factor when it comes to evaluating future investments in home or vehicle energy-efficiency upgrades, with more than 70% of respondents choosing price as their most important factor.

That said, more than half of all respondents reported that the incentives and credits (55%), along with the savings they receive (50%) are an important, if not the most important, factor when determining which upgrades to invest in. Both environmental impact and availability came second to last and last, respectively. Nearly 100 individuals voted ‘yes’ to environmental impact being a factor.
Finally, the survey asked an open-ended question: “How do the new credits and rebates impact your overall interest in energy efficiency investments?” Responses were then categorized by stated level or type of impact. Our results indicate that more than 58% of solar homeowners show an increased interest in energy-efficiency investments in response to the Inflation Reduction Act. An additional 19% indicated that they were unsure and need more information. Some of the respondents shared that their interest in energy-efficiency upgrades preceded the Inflation Reduction Act, making the new credits a “nice-to-have” rather than a key driver.

The utility BESS system’s first deployments are for residents in the towns of Streator, Lostant and Milledgeville, Illinois, areas which have experienced outages in recent years.
ComEd’s pilot BESS project is focused on determining whether localized storage solutions can improve reliability and resiliency in northern Illinois to limit the duration and frequency of power outages, including in remote townships with difficult access to grid resources.
“Hyper-localized solutions like this BESS demonstration are another key tool to ensure outstanding reliability and resiliency, even as the grid is challenged in new ways by more severe weather associated with climate change, while preparing for the growth of renewable energy, and the electrification of transportation, buildings and industry,” said Michelle Blaise, senior vice president of technical services at ComEd.
The utility energy storage project is using 28 kWh batteries from Sunverge Energy, and 200 kWh and 350 kWh batteries from Mesa Technical Associates, which collectively will support 23 customers in the initial test phase. The systems will provide eight hours of back-up power use while the utility restores power during a power outage.
Since 2011 the Midwest utility has made smart grid improvements into its service territory, effectuating $3 billion in savings to avoid more than 19 million outages. ComEd smart grid incentives includes smart electric switches, reliability improvements, lightning protection, mainline and neighborhood underground cable improvements as well as storm improvements and tree trimming.
With 4.1 million customers, ComEd is the largest subsidiary of Exelon, a $39.5 billion market capitalization utility company that operates six electric and gas utilities in five states with 10.4 million total customers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/28/solar-to-hydrogen-project-to-be-first-stop-on-a-california-to-texas-hydrogen-highway/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,PORTUGAL,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 28, 2022",Solar-to-hydrogen project to be first stop on a California-to-Texas “hydrogen highway”,"Fusion Fuel, a modular solar-to-hydrogen facility provider based in Portugal, and Electus Energy, a hydrogen fleet-fueling and power infrastructure developer, announced the two have entered an exclusive joint venture agreement to construct a 75 MW green hydrogen facility in Bakersfield, California.
The proposed project is a solar-to-hydrogen site that would make use of Fusion Fuel’s proprietary hydrogen electrolyzer technology, called HEVO. The company said the facility, its first in the United States, would produce up to 9,300 tons of hydrogen fuel per year to fuel heavy-duty trucks.
Fusion Fuel’s HEVO technology is a miniaturized electrolyzer, affixed to the back of concentrated solar power (CSP) panel, which utilizes both photovoltaic-generated electricity and thermal energy. By using both heat and electricity, the electrolyzer’s efficiency is boosted considerably, thereby reducing the levelized cost of green hydrogen, said the company. The technology also uses dual-axis trackers to follow the sun throughout the day.
“By integrating the HEVO directly to the CPV module, not only are we able to utilize the electrical energy to power the electrochemical reaction without transport or conversion losses, but we can also recover that wasted thermal energy and use it to pre-heat the feed water, reducing the electrical load required to split water by roughly 10%,” said Fusion Fuel.
An investment of about $180 million is expected to be made to launch the 75 MW California project, with final investment decision to be made in early 2024 and project commissioning in early 2025.
“In just under two years as a public company, Fusion Fuel has established itself as a key player in the Iberian green hydrogen ecosystem. However, we knew that entering a new market, particularly one as large and complex as North America, would require a cornerstone project and a credible partner,” said Jason Baran, chief commercial officer at Fusion Fuel.
Once operational, the project will provide enough hydrogen fuel to support over 1,000 Class 8 trucks or buses per day. Class 8 is the largest category of trucking, with trucks weighing over 33,000 lbs.
Hydrogen is considered an effective use-case for technologies that need to readily dispatch high amounts of power, like in heavy-duty trucking or in industrial processes. However, the process of creating hydrogen fuel, electrolysis, requires large amounts of electricity. The marriage of solar and hydrogen electrolysis at one site helps trucking fleets achieve their emissions reduction requirements.
 
The two companies have entered into a land lease agreement to secure 320 acres in Kern County for the project’s development, and Black & Veatch has been consulted to perform a concept study with input from Cornerstone Engineering and Headwaters Solutions.
“Due to the unique combination of solar irradiance, California tax incentives, and proximity to large-scale offtake, Bakersfield is the ideal project to anchor our North American strategy,” said Baran.
Fusion Fuel’s partner on the project, Electus Energy, has been actively developing hydrogen mobility solutions in the Southwest U.S., cultivating relationships with prospective offtakers in the logistics and distribution sector. The partnership may mark the beginning of a “hydrogen highway” vision for the region, linking California to Texas with a chain of green hydrogen fueling stations.
“Bakersfield will be the first anchor project of our U.S. strategy, which is heavily focused on the hydrogen mobility and logistics opportunity and envisions a hydrogen highway from California to Texas. While our HEVO-Solar technology is best suited for markets with high solar irradiance, the expected introduction in 2024 of our newest product – HEVO-Chain – will make the entirety of North America part of our addressable market,” said Baran.

Located near the Sweeny Substation in Brazoria County, Texas, about 60 miles south of Houston, the new energy storage project will support ERCOT to manage grid stress and volatility in the power system that just 21 months ago suffered a grid failure following Winter Storm Uri.
“GlidePath’s team safely and successfully managed the development and construction of Byrd Ranch Storage from start to finish during a period of extraordinary supply chain challenges, said Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of GlidePath. “We’re looking forward to operating this project using the very latest storage technology available and showcasing what Byrd Ranch can do to benefit the local community as well as enhance reliability and resiliency for Texas power users.”
The energy storage facility uses CATL lithium-ion battery cells, as well as 20 bidirectional inverters rated at 3.62 megavolt amperes (MVA) each.
Byrd Ranch utilizes the optimization system of Habitat Energy, which allows the storage project to bid power capacity into the power market and provide performance optimization services.
IHI Terrasun is the energy storage system integrator, providing power plant control software and lifecycle services with a 10-year warranty and maintenance services agreement for Byrd Ranch.
Texas-New Mexico Power, a utility owned by PNM Resources, manages the grid in which the project is providing power frequency solutions.
GlidePath and Habitat Energy are both portfolio companies of Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners.
To date, GlidePath has installed more than 100 MW of standalone energy storage projects across the U.S.  In 2019, the company installed the 10 MW Prospect Energy storage facility in West Columbia, Texas, also in Brazoria County, representing one of the first ERCOT storage projects.
Other companies developing energy storage projects in Brazoria County, TX, include Tesla, Broad Reach Power and Key Capture Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/28/ohio-county-rejects-ban-on-utility-scale-solar-but-10-counties-retain-it/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,OHIO",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 28, 2022","Ohio county rejects ban on utility-scale solar, but 10 counties retain it","Clark County, Ohio has rejected the ban of utility-scale renewable energy development as codified by Senate Bill 52, a 2021 law that prohibits the development of solar and wind power facilities greater than 50 MW of capacity. The bill does not place a ban on smaller residential rooftop or commercial solar facilities.
To date, there are no utility-scale solar or wind facilities in Clark County, but the rejection now opens the door for new development opportunities. Landowners in unincorporated areas of the county can lease or sell land for solar and wind development following the ban’s rejection.
The Clark County Commission unanimously voted to uphold landowners’ rights to host the development of clean energy resources. Six of the ten townships in Clark County sent in requests to uphold the ban.
Farmer and Clark County resident Bill Agile said, “I guess I’m struggling with why we want to cover up our farmland, which is one of our greatest resources,” he said. “There’s plenty of city areas. Old, poor, worn-out buildings that can be destroyed, knocked-down and cleaned-up.”
Agile’s suggestion of building solar resources on rooftops, brownfield sites, and other unused land is a popular model for preserving land use, often called distributed generation (DG). DG resources are hailed for their lighter effect on land use, greater ability to be resilient and responsive under extreme weather events, and higher efficiency due to less transmission infrastructure requirements.
Despite this, utility-scale wind and solar resources are considered an important part of the energy mix as the nation rapidly pursues decarbonizing the energy sector in the face of climate change. The rejection of the development ban was also seen as a property rights issue.
“One issue that I really continue to not be able to rectify to myself is property rights: taking away property rights for any legal use,” said Melanie Flax Wilt, commissioner of Clark County. “That’s the thing that I continue to narrow in on, that it concerns me to take away the choice of the homeowner.”
However, 10 counties in Ohio still have restrictions predicated by Senate Bill 52. The bill prohibits solar and wind facilities of 50 MW or more, as well as “economically significant” wind facilities ranging from 5 MW to 50 MW.
Ohio resident Larry Ricketts warned that the ban may be too prohibitive. “We have a choice right now, and in the next couple of years. We can accept the fact that solar and wind and these types of farms are the wave of the future,” he said. “All I’m saying is, be careful when you do a thing like this, that says you cannot do something and then handcuff yourself.”
In addition to distributed rooftop and brownfield site development, the practice of agrivoltaics, or co-locating solar facilities and agricultural production, can be an effective way to address land use concerns.

In the past three years, the Honnold Foundation has helped 48 Partners in over 20 different countries and territories use solar energy to build equity, increase climate resilience, and support communities’ right to self-determination. The foundation doubled its grantmaking this year to fund $2 million in solar energy projects.
PSYDEH is one of HF’s partners. This organization in the Sierra Madres mountain of Hidalgo, Mexico that works with women in indigenous areas. With support from HF and in direct collaboration with women leaders, PSYDEH is bringing five solar powered technology hubs to communities that previously lacked access to most Information and Computer Technologies, including the internet.
Another partner, Coalfield Development, is based in West Virginia’s coal country and dedicated to investing in neighborhoods that are facing barriers to prosperity. In 2020, HF funded a large-scale solar array for Coalfield Development’s West Edge community facility and supported a solar job training program. This year HF is helping Coalfield Development build solar on mine-scarred mountaintop sites.
In recent news, the foundation announced that venture capitalist (VC) Peter Levine is providing a multimillion dollar gift over the next three years to launch the Levine Impact Lab in partnership with the Honnold Foundation. The lab intends to offer long-term support to organizations and individual leaders who otherwise might lack access to the best-in-class resources typically reserved for VC-funded startups.
“The repercussions of climate change are felt in every corner of the world with rising temperatures, increased frequencies of natural disasters, food and water insecurity, and economic disruption,” said Honnold. “Meanwhile, communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis are receiving the least amount of support, despite the best efforts of grassroots organizations and community leaders.”
“I’ve been involved with the Honnold Foundation and a supporter of Alex’s vision for a long time, and the Lab is an evolution of our longstanding relationship,” said Levine. “In my work, I’ve seen that money plus time equals the best outcome. So, it’s not just the dollar donation, it’s the fact that our team is willing to bring the concepts of best-in-class venture capital and company-building to nonprofits, striving to get the best outcomes for the organizations we serve.”
The lab has announced its initial cohort of domestic partners who will attend a three-year program to strengthen their skills in strategy, operations, and governance, as well as executive coaching and leadership development.
Among the initial cohort of domestic partners, the Lab will be working with grassroots organizations that include:
Commenting on her organization’s enrollment in the Lab, Suzanne Singer, executive director of Native Renewables, said, “We are thrilled to be a part of the first Lab cohort! This type of investment is so valuable for smaller nonprofits, we are excited to apply the resources and tools we gain over the next three years to growing our impact in tribal communities.”
The lab has plans to partner with 50 initiatives from around the world by 2050, working toward supporting the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13, described as ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all and taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
In addition to the launch of the Impact Lab, the Honnold Foundation plans to continue to strategically target community-based solar energy projects, with an emphasis on community-driven projects that are located in traditionally underfunded regions facing the immediate effects of the climate crisis.
