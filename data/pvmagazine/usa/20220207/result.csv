Florida SB 1024, introduced by Sen. Jennifer Bradley (R), was filed in November, upending the structure of a 2008 law that supported the nascent stages of the state’s solar industry. Under the 2008 law, residential and commercial customers with systems less than 2MW in capacity are eligible to sell their excess generation back to the utility at the full retail electrical rate on their monthly bill. To calculate a customer’s annual excess generation credit, compensation is based on the avoided cost to the utility for the power it would otherwise have had to generate.

The new bill calls for a new NEM structure to be submitted by January 1, 2023. The language loosely defines what NEM rates may be, stating it must ensure: “public utility customers owning or leasing renewable generation pay the full cost of electric service and are not subsidized by the public utility’s general body of ratepayers.”
The bill also calls for all energy delivered by customer-owned or leased solar to the public utility to be credited to the customer at the public utility’s full avoided cost, rather than the retail rate.
A third provision said the net metering rule may include fixed charges, including base facilities charges, grid access fees, or minimum monthly bills. This is particularly drawing the ire of solar advocates, who claim it goes directly against the idea of “fairness” that the bill is founded on.
Survey says… 
In a recent survey of over 250 active solar shoppers in Florida, solar informational site SolarReviews found 74% of respondents will no longer consider going solar if the proposal passes, and rates are paid on the utility’s avoided cost calculations. If the proposed monthly grid participation is added, 93% of the respondents said they would not buy solar.
Of the bill, Justin Vandenbroeck, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association said that, while the organization is still analyzing the full impact of the legislation, “Initial modeling suggests this legislation has the potential to set the rooftop solar industry back nearly a decade.  Erasing the thousands of jobs, consumer choice and savings, along with the resiliency benefits that rooftop solar offers to Floridians.”
Protest planned 
A similar proposal was set to be voted upon in California, where grid experts, environmentalists, and industry advocates cast dispersions on NEM 3.0’s proposed fixed charges, calling them a “tax on the sun.” Thousands of Californians held protests, calling for change, and it appears change may occur, as NEM 3.0 was delayed indefinitely.

Now, Floridians brace for a similar fight. Advocacy group Solar United Neighbors is calling for solar supporters to join a planned rally in Tallahassee. The rally is planned for February 8th, 2:30-3:30 p.m.
Cost shift?
This has led utilities to argue that there has been a “cost shift” to non-solar customers. Paying for solar generation results in what the bill calls “increased cross-subsidization of the full cost of electric service onto the public utility’s general body of ratepayers.”
However, today only about 90,000 of the 8.5 million electric customers in Florida are topped with solar. The utility argues that this some 1% of Floridians are creating significant costs for the other 99%.
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab’s sixteen large-scale state-level studies on the cost shift argument that may suggest the bill’s assumptions stand on shaky ground. It found that 40 of the 43 states with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributable to solar, and the cost picture remains this way until solar penetration reaches 10% of the state’s total generation.

The portfolio, located entirely in Massachusetts, comprises 16 rooftop solar projects, with two of those projects also featuring installations on adjacent parking structures. All 16 of the projects have already achieved commercial operation, coming online between the third quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2020. The portfolio is also spread across multiple project sites, with each installation ranging in capacity from 0.3MW to 4.2MW.
Each of the projects has long-term supply contracts in place with offtakers, including local businesses, utilities, municipalities, and local government agencies.
According to Greenbacker, the addition brings the company’s fleet of sustainable infrastructure projects to approximately 2.6GW of generating capacity, with that figure also including projects that have yet to reach construction.
Another of the projects contributing to that portfolio was announced just over a week ago, when Greenbacker acquired a 6.5MW to-be-constructed solar project from Encore Renewable Energy, set to be built in Middlebury, Vermont.
The project, called South Street solar, has a power purchase agreement in place with nearby Middlebury College, with the college contracting for 100% of the electricity generated by the installation. There are also plans to add an energy storage system to the installation, though specifics on that project have not yet been made available.
In November, Greenbacker bought two to-be-built solar projects in Maine from ReneSola Power Holdings. The projects are the Athens Ridge solar project, a 3.8 MW array set to be constructed in Athens, Maine, north of Augusta, and the Mars Hill solar project, a 2.8 MW array slated for Mars Hill, on the state’s border with Canada.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/07/convalt-plans-for-solar-panel-manufacturing-plant-in-new-york-hits-some-snags/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 7, 2022","Convalt Energy’s plans for solar panel manufacturing plant in New York slowed, but not deterred","Convalt Energy made the news last year when it purchased SunPower’s solar panel manufacturing lines as SunPower shut down its facility in Hillsboro, Oregon.  It was no small feat moving 115,000 individual pieces, 800,000 feet of cable, etc. – to be hauled in 350 truckloads from Oregon to Watertown, New York, with the intention of setting up one of the largest solar panel manufacturing plants in the US.
Last July, county officials approved a plan for Convalt to build a 300,000-square-foot module manufacturing facility, but recently the plan hit two snags. Last week, Hari Achuthan, CEO of Convalt Energy, learned at a Hounsfield planning board meeting that the town can’t move forward with the project until the company owns the land or has a lease, which could take months as the company currently has a lease to purchase. “Not a problem,” Achuthan told pv magazine. “It’s a small delay. We’ll get it done as it more of a formality.”
The greater snag is that National Grid recently handed Convalt the price tag of $19 million and a timeframe of at least two years to get power to the site. “When we heard that we told them that we’ll island our factory and we won’t need need the grid power for the approximately 4MW of load,” Achuthan said.
In a quick change of plans, Convalt bought an old building that already has power connections. To get their manufacturing process up and running quickly, they are putting two production lines in that existing building, and then will construct a new, larger second facility at the Watertown airport business park for another two production lines. Achuthan said they should be up and running with the first two lines in September or October 2022, bringing up to 200MW to market in Q1 2023. National Grid has come back with lower cost for the grid connection, but Convalt has already moved along with its new plan.
With the Biden administration’s recent extension of tariffs on imported solar cells, there’s renewed interest in stimulating US solar manufacturing. When asked about the extent to which the federal government has been involved with Convalt’s plans, Achuthan noted that they have been in conversation with them. “Key will be support from DOE for loan grants and loan guarantees and we should know in a couple of months.”
Slowed but not deterred, Convalt Energy is moving forward with plans to first get module production up and running and then to focus on wafer and cell production with hopes that they will achieve 3GW.  In all, Convalt intends to create as many as 1,500 jobs, many of which will be filled by veterans retiring from nearby Fort Drum, in keeping with its vision to “Make Solar American Again”.

Micro and macro nutrients, carbon storage, and soil grain size distribution at six commercial solar PV sites were compared to undisturbed control sites.
The authors point to existing studies which show biomass production of forage species under shade (e.g Pang et al, 2019 Agroforest Syst (2019) 93:11–24) Data from the: Horticulture and Agroforestry Research Center (HARC), New Franklin, Missouri. One of the more interesting findings of this research describes the relationship between levels of shading and the biomass production of various plants, shown in the chart below. The analysis found that the ‘meaningful forage productivity’ of most of their chosen ruminant appropriate species significantly increased under 45% shade, while most plants under 80% shade saw a marked decrease in biomass volume.

The results align with prior research from the University of Oregon, which found that solar panels altered the microclimate variables of mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and soil moisture. This improved water efficiency, allowing for much greater biomass growth, drove a 90% increase in grasses for sheep and cows.
The extensive list of plants examined is a definite positive, as the rate of installation for ground-mount solar power accelerates. Efforts are currently being made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture and University of Illinois to determine which row crops, foraging crops, and specialty crops are best to couple with solar panels in agrivoltaic settings.
In this project’s case, land at the facility has been managed by the Minnesota Native Landscapes’ Conservation Grazing Program. Their approach to regenerative land management relies on the planned impact of livestock grazing. This approach gives holistic consideration to the type of soil and plants, as well as the animals which will be grazing, with an eye towards rehabilitating the soil over time. The group works with sheep, bison, cattle, and goats in their land conservation programs.
Across the six sites, researchers allowed 500-700 sheep to graze the sites two to three times per year.
The researchers’ early estimates suggest that an acre of grazed native plants may improve soil at a rate of one ton of sequestered carbon per year, and that carbon and other nutrients may accumulate for 12 to 15 years before the soil is fully saturated.

The total exchange capacity of the soil (a soil fertility measurement based on how many cations can be retained on soil surfaces) showed a marked improvement at four of the six sites, and an overall increase in the estimated nitrogen release, ammonia, and nitrate was found at all but one of the sites. A similar increase was seen in other nutrients as well, including Mg, Na, K, P, Ca, and S.
This data points in the same direction as an analysis of Upper Midwest solar power facilities integrating natural prairie grasses, which sequester roughly half a ton of carbon per acre without livestock. That study demonstrated a 65% greater carbon retention compared to a purely agricultural scenario, and 35% improvement over a solar-turfgrass scenario.
This article was amended on Feb. 8, 2022 to note the separate study on biomass.

The silicon is recycled through a technique conceived by German specialist Reiling GmbH & Co. KG and the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP, which is claimed to recycle silicon from different types of modules, regardless of manufacturer and origin.
“At Fraunhofer CSP, the cell fragments with sizes from 0.1 to 1 millimeter are first freed from the glass and plastic by various sorting processes,” the Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “This is followed by the step-by-step removal of the backside contact, the silver contacts, the anti-reflective layer and finally the emitter by wet chemical etching. The silicon cleaned in this way is processed into monocrystalline or quasi-monocrystalline ingots in standard processes and then into wafers.”
The German scientists said the cells were fabricated only with wafers relying on recycled silicon and that no commercial ultrapure silicon was added during the manufacturing process.
The performance of the first trial PERC cells was tested and the devices were found to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.7%. “This is below the efficiency of today’s premium PERC solar cells, which have an efficiency of around 22.2 percent, but it is certainly above that of the solar cells in the old, discarded modules,” said Peter Dold, project manager at Fraunhofer CSP, without providing more technical details.

Spot is monitoring the performance of a utility scale solar plant it is operating in the Desert of Atacama, in northern Chile, the company explained. “The maximum payload of a drone can be about five kg, while Spot can carry almost 15 kilos,” said Carlos Crespo, head of Acciona’s robotics and artificial intelligence group. He also explained that drones are able to move faster than Spot and, however, their batteries usually last only up to 30 minutes of autonomous operation, while the robot dog can operate for up to 90 minutes.
The device has a built-in thermal vision system that generates thermographic reports on the status of the different PV plant components, as it walks between the panel rows following a programmed route. According to the robot developer – US-based Boston Dynamics – the big benefit of the robot legs is that they are terrain-independent.
“A robot with legs has the most traversability, and it can be used regardless of the type of terrain at a given site. And Spot’s built-in, state-of-the-art navigation stack – all of the software and the hardware that the robot needs to get from point A to point B – is quickly making Spot the ‘go-to’ resource,” the company said in a statement.
Boston Dynamics sold its first robot dog in 2020 at a price of $74,500. It has been used so far by various industries for a wide variety of applications. Initially, Spot was used to inspect the construction works of active infrastructure tunnels, according to the US manufacturer.
Acciona decided to incorporate the quadrupedal robot into its operations in 2019.

The projects must be ready to achieve commercial operations by 2023, to be interconnected with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid.
The projects are planned to serve the MIGreenPower program, a voluntary renewable energy supply program that currently has  as its subscribers 48,000 residential customers, 450 small businesses, and 35 industrial energy purchasers. The program allows customers to opt in for increased electric rates for an increased share of renewables in their energy mix.
Project bidders can register on the PowerAdvocate website and can attend a pre-RFP conference being held on February 15, 2022, once registered. Bids are due April 29, 2022, and the company said it anticipates executing contracts this summer.
The MIGreenPower doubled in enrollment for each of the past three years, driving more renewable energy procurement, said DTE. To date, customers have already enrolled in 1.8 million MWh, and DTE increased its renewable energy generation by 40% in 2021.
The company has additionally secured approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission to build a 20MW solar project in Ann Arbor. The project would join DTE’s portfolio of over 50 solar and wind projects, which represent about 15% of the company’s generation. DTE said it plans to double its renewable energy generation by 2025, investing $3 billion in renewable infrastructure in the process.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) ranks Michigan 26th in solar deployment, with 599.4MW reported through Q3 2021. An estimated over 400MW was deployed in the state in 2021 alone, an indication that it may be yet another market set to expand rapidly. The state holds about 185 solar companies, including 65 manufacturers, 68 installer/developers, and 52 others, employing a combined total of 3,379 people.

Lawrence McClure, the House sponsor of Florida’s House Bill 741, the companion to Senate Bill 1024, offered an amendment on the controversial bill, which would allow current solar users to retain their financial incentives for 20 years, instead of 10 years, as was originally written.
HB 741/SB 1024 would change the existing net metering structure from one that has promoted the development of renewable energy resources in this state, to one that purports to “continue” development “in a manner that is fair and equitable to all public utility customers.”
The basis for the change to the code relies on the cost-shift argument, with the claiming that, “The substantial growth of customer-owned and -leased renewable generation has resulted in increased cross-subsidization of the full cost of electric service onto the public utility’s general body of ratepayers.”
As it currently stands, roughly 90,000 of Florida’s 8.5 million electric customers utilize net metering to sell electricity back to the grid, and the bill claims that this roughly 1% group of electrical customers is unfairly shifting the cost of supplying electricity back to the other 99%.
SB 1024 calls on the Florida Public Service Commission to set up a successor net metering program by January 1, 2023. The new program is required to:
The bill would also allow utilities to add base facilities charges, electric grid access fees, monthly minimum bills, or other fixed charges to customers’ bills in order to ensure the utility recovers their cost of serving net metering customers. Customers who had their system operational before Jan. 1, 2023 would have their previous compensation rate sustained for 20 more years, as per the new amendment.
Sixteen state-level studies, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, have disproven the cost-shift argument, as has a national study, completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
Berkeley found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar, and that the cost picture remains this way until solar penetration meets 10% of a state’s generation portfolio.
Additionally, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, when Florida’s utilities last requested rate increases from the Public Service Commission, not one cited lost revenue from rooftop solar customers as an issue.
Of the bill, Justin Vandenbroeck, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association said that, while the organization is still analyzing the full impact of the legislation, “Initial modeling suggests this legislation has the potential to set the rooftop solar industry back nearly a decade.
