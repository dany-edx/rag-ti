https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/29/first-solar-plans-to-add-3-3-gw-of-capacity-in-new-facility-in-india/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARIZONA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 29, 2021",First Solar plans to add 3.3 GW of capacity in new facility in India,"First Solar said it plans to invest $684 million in a new, fully vertically integrated photovoltaic thin film solar module manufacturing facility in India. Contingent upon permitting, and pending approval of Indian government incentives that are satisfactory to the Arizona-based First Solar, the facility is expected to be built in the state of Tamil Nadu and commence operations in the second half of 2023.
The planned facility is projected to have a nameplate capacity of 3.3 GWdc. With First Solar’s expansion in the United States and India and optimization of its existing fleet, the company said that its nameplate manufacturing capacity will double to 16 GWdc in 2024.
The company also reported its second quarter earnings. It said that net sales for the quarter totaled $629 million, down $174 million from the prior quarter. It said the decline primarily was due to the sale of the Sun Streams 2, 4, and 5 projects in the prior quarter. The decline was partially offset by an increase in module segment revenue and revenue related to a settlement agreement for a legacy systems project.
The company reported operating income of $110 million, compared to $252 million in the prior quarter. Second quarter operating income included depreciation and amortization of $66 million, revenue and gross margin related to the settlement agreement of $65 million, $9 million related to underutilization and production start-up, and share-based compensation of $5 million.
Net income per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.77, compared to $1.96 in the prior quarter, the company said.
In early June, First Solar said it would invest $680 million to expand its domestic U.S. photovoltaic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually, representing an implied capital expenditure of around $0.20 per watt.
The company said it intended to fund construction of its third U.S. manufacturing facility in Ohio with existing cash resources.
The new facility near Toledo is expected to start operations in the first half of 2023. It is projected to achieve its throughput entitlement (modules produced per day) by the end of 2023 with more than 3 GWdc of nameplate capacity. It is expected to reach full nameplate capacity, based on the company’s module efficiency roadmap, in 2025.
The facility will scale the company’s northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GWdc, which First Solar said represents one of the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complexes outside of China.
First Solar produces its thin film PV modules using a fully integrated, continuous process under one roof and uses a Cadmium Telluride (CadTel) semiconductor.
In a statement, Mark Widmar, CEO, said that India offers an attractive market for First Solar in part because the company’s module technology is advantaged in a hot, humid climate. He said the country has “a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed every year for the next nine years.”
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected that India will overtake the European Union (EU) to become the world’s third-largest consumer of electricity by 2030, as the country’s population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) continue to grow. As part of its climate targets, India has committed to ensuring that renewables will make up 40% of its energy portfolio by 2030. The country is forecast to account for almost 20% of the world’s installed solar capacity by 2040.
The facility will be designed using the manufacturing template established for First Solar’s recently-announced factory in Ohio. Combining highly skilled workers with Industry 4.0 architecture, machine-to-machine communication, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things connectivity, it will feature high degrees of automation, precision, and continuous improvement.
The company said it continues to optimize the amount of semiconductor material used by enhancing its vapor deposition process. First Solar also operates a recycling program that recovers more than 90% of CadTel for use in new modules.

The one-million-square-foot manufacturing facility, dubbed the KOREPlex, will support up to 12 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cell production to help ensure a reliable and independent U.S. supply chain for lithium-ion battery cells. The facility will have the capacity to produce enough power for 3.2 million homes each year. KORE plans to start construction of the facility by the end of the year with the goal of beginning production in Q2 2023. Construction is planned to take about 18 months.
The company’s current annual production capacity of 2 GWh is in the process of scaling up to 6 GWh.
KOREPlex will employ more than 3,000 full-time personnel at the facility. The construction of KOREPlex will employ an estimated 3,400 workers during peak construction.
Once complete, KOREPlex will operate with net-zero carbon emissions through strategic partnerships and solar-plus- and storage co-generation.
The company said the Maricopa County location was chosen after a national site search and evaluation of the energy storage, manufacturing, and electric transportation opportunities across the country. Arizona is seen as advantageous due to site proximity to complimentary industries such as e-mobility, solar, semiconductor, and utilities, workforce and logistics capacity, and a pro-business tax and regulatory environment.
The facility will be located in Buckeye, a suburb west of Phoenix.

While President Biden has made decarbonizing the U.S. electricity sector by 2035 one of the premier goals of his administration, TVA, a federally owned electric utility corporation, currently has no plan to achieve emission-free power.
TVA has increased its contracted and installed solar capacity in the last 18 months, thanks in part to its Green Invest program and 2020 Request for Proposals for solar capacity. However, the roughly 1 GW that those initiatives have brought to the grid are less than what administration goals would require.

In their letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, the groups said that the most current resource plan shows that TVA will still be producing more than 34 million tons of CO2 annually in 2038. TVA just recently announced plans to add 1,500 MW of new gas to its resource mix.
Co-signers of the letter said they believe that TVA’s energy transition should emphasize community-based and rooftop solar systems, energy efficiency, battery storage, and microgrids to enhance climate resilience. In line with other Biden administration goals, they said any roadmap should ensure union jobs and strong labor standards for workers.
The power provider’s slow pace in transitioning away from fossil fuels has frustrated renewable energy advocates, as well as some  TVA member power companies. A number of those companies have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to leave TVA’s service umbrella altogether.
Four of those companies–Athens Utilities Board, Gibson Electric Membership Corporation, Joe Wheeler Electric Membership Corporation, and Volunteer Energy Cooperative–want to break their supply deal with TVA. They allege that the federal entity violated Section 211 A(b) of the Federal Power Act.

Section 211 allows any electric utility, federal power marketing agency, or any other person generating electric energy for sale for resale to apply to FERC for an order requiring a utility to provide transmission services. The section also allows FERC to redress discriminatory practices being made by transmitting utilities.
The companies alleged that their supply deal with TVA is discriminatory as long as TVA has a generation portfolio skewed toward fossil fuels and relatively lacking in renewables. They are asking to be freed from their supply deals so they can pursue electricity agreements from renewable resources.
TVA member companies are not alone in seeking to move away from fossil fuel-heavy generating companies. New Mexico’s Kit Carson Electric Cooperative provided an early model in 2016 with its $37-million buyout of a contract with Tri-State Generation & Transmission. In that instance, Denver-based Guzman Energy helped with the initial financing and later partnered with Kit Carson to build a solar portfolio.
The letter also was directed to Martin Keller, director of the National Renewable Energy, and asked that a transitional roadmap  be developed through NREL or other authority. The letter noted NREL’s recent work to create a roadmap for Los Angeles to follow to achieve 100% renewable energy by mid-century. It also pointed to  the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative which aims to advance distributed energy to transform Hawaii’s energy system to 100% clean energy by 2045.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/29/catl-claims-to-have-made-sodium-ion-batteries-a-commercial-reality/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,CHINA",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 29, 2021",CATL claims to have made sodium-ion batteries a commercial reality,"From pv magazine Global
Robin Zeng, chairman of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), a battery manufacturing heavyweight, said that the company is commercially launching lithium-free sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries.
The Nindge, China-based manufacturer said its newest product ticks all the boxes for modern customer requirements. For starters, the battery reportedly shows a high energy density of 160 Wh/kg. That is a little short of the 200 Wh/kg achieved by the LFP devices CATL ships for Tesla. Zeng has already suggested the second generation of Na-ion batteries will reach the 200 Wh/kg mark. Modern NMC-811 devices show energy densities more in the region of 300 Wh/kg. 
However, the sodium-ion product is apparently not lagging in its other electrochemical properties, and can reportedly charge to 80% in 15 minutes. On top of that comes the fact the battery is said to be working well in low temperatures. At -20 degrees Celsius, the Na-ion device retains 90% of its nameplate capacity, according to its manufacturer. Also, in terms of thermal stability, Chinese company CATL says its new product exceeds national standards.
CATL will use the first generation of the batteries to address the electric vehicle (EV) market and has highlighted key features such as its low-temperature performance, which would render it suitable for automotive markets with severe winters. CATL will initially roll out battery packs for EVs that combine sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, to compensate for the shortage of energy density. To achieve this, CATL has also developed a battery management system. 
The lower energy of the sodium-ion cells suggests that the technology may be more suited for stationary energy storage applications, which are less restrictive, said Wood Mackenzie research analyst Max Reid.  He said the unveiling of battery packs combining both sodium-ion and lithium-ion cells could point towards compromise in performance for low-cost electric vehicles, “with the potential to disrupt the mass market.”

That brings the total installed capacity of solar, wind, and energy storage to 170 GW, according to the inaugural Clean Power Annual report released by the American Clean Power Association (ACP).
The report said that clean power technologies deliver 10.7% of U.S. electricity and generate enough power for 50 million homes.
New installations included nearly 9 GW of utility-scale solar, 760 MW of battery storage capacity, and 16.8 GW of onshore wind. These three resources combined make up 78% of new power installations in 2020, a shift from the 28% share of new installations in 2010.
The report said that the clean power industry provides jobs to more 415,000 Americans, and wind turbine technician and solar installers are the first- and third-fastest-growing occupations, respectively. Current momentum combined with supportive regulation and policy could deliver over 1 million jobs by 2030, ACP said.

The 26 GW of clean power brought online is estimated to equal some $39 billion in investment. Since 2005, total  investment in clean energy reached an estimated $334 billion across the U.S. Nearly 90,000 MW of clean energy projects are currently underway, the report said, representing more than $120 billion in new investment.
The industry also paid an estimated $1.7 billion in state and local taxes and nearly $800 million in lease payments to landowners.
Since 2009, the unsubsidized cost of solar has fallen 90% and wind has fallen 71%. In most parts of the country, wind and solar offer the lowest cost of any generation type.
Corporate buyers announced 10,417 MW of clean power contracts and power purchase agreements in 2020, the report said. That nearly equaled the 10,854 MW contracted by utilities. Non-utility businesses had an all-time high share of renewables contracts at 46%.
Two-thirds of all U.S. states have at least 1 GW of operational clean power, the report said. Texas leads the nation with 37.4 GW of capacity, followed by California at 20.3 GW, Iowa with 11.4 GW, and Oklahoma and Kansas with 9.4 GW and 7 GW, respectively.

In 2020, Texas also added the most clean power capacity with 6.3 GW. California followed with 2.2 GW, and Florida added more than 1.2 GW. Texas led in both the solar and wind categories, with 3.1 GW and 2 GW respectively. California was the top battery storage adder, bringing online 573 MW of capacity in 2020.
These 2020 projects are estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 327 million metric tons, the equivalent of taking 71 million cars off the road, the report said.
Reducing carbon emissions, along with sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide, offer health benefits, including reducing asthma attacks, the report said. This year’s clean energy deployment is estimated to save $16 billion to $41 billion in long-term health benefits due to decreased mortality, respiratory issues, and other pollution-related health impacts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/29/nrel-releases-a-financial-analysis-tool-for-energy-storage-technologies/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 29, 2021",NREL releases a financial analysis tool for energy storage technologies,"Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed what they are calling the Storage Financial Analysis Scenario Tool (StoreFAST). The tool is used to evaluate the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), also known as the levelized cost of storage (LCOS).
The model can identify potential long-duration storage opportunities in the framework of a future electric grid with 85% renewables penetration.
NREL researchers designed StoreFAST based on the Hydrogen Financial Analysis Scenario Tool (H2FAST), which was created by NREL in 2015 as an aid for analyzing the financial aspects of installing hydrogen fueling stations.
The StoreFAST model is pre-populated with sample energy storage and flexible power generators to illustrate how it generates comparative assessments. The model allows users to specify up to 15 parallel technology assessments that can span completely different storage types or focus on a single technology variant. A user can perform a parallel assessment of current and future technology performance outlooks by specifying different outlooks for costs and performance in each technology slot.
StoreFAST analyzes both energy storage systems and flexible power generation systems on a side-by-side basis.

StoreFAST analyzes both energy storage systems and flexible power generation systems on a side-by-side basis. The model outputs visuals for three parameters: the LCOE, financial performance parameters, and time series charts for all financial line items. Primary inputs to the model include system power output capacity, capital costs, operations and maintenance costs, charging electricity or fuel costs, storage duration, and capacity factors.
StoreFAST offers what NREL said is a consistent comparison across all technologies. It does this by analyzing parameters that describe system cost, performance, and capacity factor to calculate the net present value of all capital, operating, tax, and financing expenses divided by the system lifetime electricity sales. This definition of LCOE offers a consistent comparison of storage technologies, NREL said.
Researchers used the StoreFAST model to analyze a system from 12 hours up to 7 days of storage duration. The NREL study found that for long durations of energy storage (that is, more than 60 hours), clean hydrogen systems with geologic storage and natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration are the lowest cost options. That was true regardless of whether system costs were based on current or future technology.
Researchers also modeled the cost of an energy storage system using fuel cells designed for heavy-duty vehicles rather than conventional stationary fuel cells, and found that this system achieved 13%–20% lower LCOE.
Funding for this work was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Strategic Analysis Team, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, Solar Energy Technologies Office, and Wind Energy Technologies Office.

While this is certainly a historic milestone, Duke still has a lot of work to do if the company wants to reach its renewable energy and emission reduction goals. Renewables currently make up about 8% of Duke’s electrical output, natural gas accounts for 42%, coal for 33%, and nuclear for 17%. By 2030, Duke plans for its generation mix to include 23% renewables, 30% nuclear, 38% natural gas, and 9% coal. This all comes in spite of the fact that Duke has goals of reducing emissions 50% by 2030 and going carbon neutral in 2050.
New renewable resources will be developed to replace the generation lost by the 1,922 MW of coal capacity the utility plans to retire by the end of 2025. While Duke will have retired more than 8,400 MW of coal in total by 2025, that only represents about a third of the utility’s coal fleet; some plants are scheduled to stay active until 2048.
The Pflugerville Solar project is a 144 MW installation located in Travis County, Texas that Duke acquired from Recurrent Energy in January of this year. The plant is comprised of approximately 489,600 pieces of Canadian Solar’s high-efficiency bifacial BiKu modules, spread out across 932 acres. The engineering and construction of the project was performed by Signal Energy.
The energy generated from the Pflugerville Solar project will be sold to Austin Energy under a 15-year power purchase agreement. Pflugerville also represents Duke Energy’s sixth solar installation in Texas, with the seventh set to come some time in 2022, as Duke advances construction on the 250-MW Pisgah Ridge Solar project in Navarro County, Texas.
Duke’s 10 GW of wind and solar capacity includes nearly 200 sites in 22 states, with over 1,000 megawatts of new projects under construction throughout the country, including Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas.

On its second quarter earnings call, the company said that it had raised almost $3.3 billion in capital under a new green bond program called “NextEra Green.” A key aspect of the fund is that the company agreed to increase the interest rate paid to bondholders in the event that it fails to bring renewables online within two years of funding.

NextEra’s Energy Resources team’s development slide showed continued growth. The company added 1,840 MW of capacity in the quarter, including 285 MW of new wind and wind repowering, 1,450 MWac of solar, and 105 MW/420 MWh of battery storage.
NextEra said that the Biden administration extending the Safe Harbor window for solar power projects under construction suggests strong support for renewable legislation going forward. As a result of this extension, NextEra said it now has more than $2.2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $45 billion of wind, solar ,and battery storage investments through 2024.
Solar+storage projects featured in at least two instances during the earnings call.
First, subsidiary FPL shut down its last coal power plant. The company suggested its generation is being replaced by solar construction within Florida, however, NextEra is still building gas plants on the plant’s local power grid.
Second, is a 310 MW solar+storage facility scheduled to replace a coal plant somewhere in the nation. NextEra didn’t mention the project name, but it had earlier announced  200 MW solar + 110 MW energy storage Paris Solar-Battery Park in Wisconsin.

The company’s contracted solar development pipeline chart now includes 4,232 MWac of solar scheduled for deployment in 2021-2022, with another 4,739 MWac to be deployed in 2023-2024 for a total of 8,971 MWac. By applying a DC:AC ratio of 1.25:1, then just over 11,200 MWdc should come from solar panels deployed at these sites.
The high end of NextEra’s expected solar power forecasts indicate a shot at 14,400 MWac/18,000 MWdc by end of 2024.
The largest solar project noted in NextEra’s queue is the two-stage Dunn’s Bridge BOT solar power plant of Indiana, with a capacity of 700 MWac. This project is expected to be coupled with 75 MW/225 MWh of energy storage capacity.

The energy storage program has contracted 2.81 GW/10.83 GWh of energy storage through 2024. The high end of NextEra’s 2024 energy storage forecast indicates a possible 225% increase over these contracted sites, for an approximate total of 24 GWh.
These high-end forecasts are important. At the beginning of the quarterly call, NextEra said that it had already met 75% of its low-end expectations for 2024, with more than three-and-a-half years to go. Add in multiple potential industry tailwinds — the Biden administration’s infrastructure package and record demand for renewable energy projects in states like California and Texas — and a picture of unprecedented growth may be emerging.

Through the partnership, SunPower customers can opt to install a Wallbox EV charger at the same time as their solar and/or storage installation.
Wallbox’s Pulsar Plus chargers come with a standard J1772 EV plug, an app for scheduling EV charging, and power sharing for two or more chargers with adjustable current output, making them compatible with most EVs.
SunPower and Wallbox are also exploring the potential of backup power solutions incorporating the EV charger’s bi-directional technology into the solar and storage system.
EV sales are expected to grow from 2.5 million in 2020 to more than 31 million by 2030, which would account for about 32% of new car sales. Wood Mackenzie projects residential solar installations will grow 13% in 2021 alone, following record growth in 2020.
What’s more, there is a strong overlap between solar and EV customers, with about 40% of EV drivers already having home solar. The savings and carbon reduction achieved by an integrated home solar and EV system are expected to be significant.
(Read: “Home solar makes EVs cheaper, reduces emissions”)
A traditional gas-powered light-duty car costs about $1,260 a year to fuel, while an EV lands at about $1,058 per year when a public charger is used. With home solar, EV owners can power their car for as little as $415 annually, according to a new consumer report run by SolarReviews.
Image: SolarReviews
SolarReviews compared a gas-powered Hyundai Kona, and an all-electric Hyundai Kona, and found that in a 13,500-mile year, the gas-powered Kona would spend $1,260 on gas, while the EV charged at home would spend $662 per year in California, and as little as $450 per year in a state like Florida.
Over a 25-year span, a typical warranty period for home solar, SolarReviews estimated that charging an EV with home solar could lead to average savings of $16,250.
From a carbon standpoint, home solar performs the best as well, reported SolarReviews. Home solar has an implied emission of 368 lbs. of carbon dioxide per 3,780 kWh, while grid power and EV chargers stand at 1,531 lbs., and 450 gallons of gasoline (an equivalent to 3,780 kWh) would emit a whopping 8,830 lbs. of CO2.

Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) joined 16 of his Republican colleagues to vote in favor of a procedural move to allow the package to move forward.
The bill includes $550 billion in new spending. It still needs to be turned into formal legislative text and must clear additional votes in the Senate and House.
If enacted, the measure would be the largest infusion of federal money into the public works system in more than a decade.
The bill would provide $73 billion for electric power infrastructure upgrades, including new transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. It would create a Grid Deployment Authority, invest in research and development for advanced transmission and electricity distribution technologies, and promote smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It also would invest in demonstration projects and research hubs for advanced nuclear reactors, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.
The compromise also includes $110 billion for roads, bridges and major projects; $66 billion for passenger and freight rail; $39 billion for public transit; $65 billion for broadband; $17 billion for ports and waterways; and $46 billion to help states and cities prepare for droughts, wildfires, flooding, and other consequences of climate change.
The bill also would provide $7.5 billion in funding for deployment of electric vehicle chargers along highway corridors to facilitate long-distance travel and within communities. Federal funding would have a particular focus on rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach communities.
The White House and Democratic leaders accepted less new federal money for public transit and clean energy projects than they had wanted, including for some electric vehicle charging stations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/29/new-jersey-regulators-vote-to-cut-net-metering-incentives/,"COMMUNITY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NEW JERSEY",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 29, 2021",New Jersey regulators adopt new net metering incentives,"The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted unanimously to implement a new solar incentive program that it said will enable up to 3,750 MW of new solar generation by 2026.
The Successor Solar Incentive Program (SuSI) was part of a nearly three-year process mandated by the Clean Energy Act of 2018 to replace the state’s Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) program with new incentives that encourage solar development while minimizing ratepayer cost.
The regulatory agency said that solar energy is expected to generate approximately 10% of New Jersey’s total electricity needs once the program is fully implemented.
The SuSI Program was approved on July 28 and will take effect on August 28. It contains two sub-programs.
The Administratively Determined Incentive (ADI): A fixed incentive payment for net metered solar projects of 5 MW or less, including all residential customers and most commercial and industrial buildings, and all community solar installations. The incentive value will vary based on project type and size, and will be guaranteed for 15 years.
The Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI): A competitive solicitation designed to incentivize the lowest financial contribution from ratepayers for grid supply projects and net metered commercial and industrial projects larger than 5 MW. The first competitive process is likely to launch by mid-2022.
The SuSI program’s approach is intended to lift solar market segments through tailored long-term incentives for a variety of project types. Regulators said this would allow them to contain program costs and provide financial certainty for market participants.
The program will provide one New Jersey Solar Renewable Energy Certificate-II (NJ SREC–II) for every megawatt-hour of solar electricity produced by a qualifying facility, with an additional $20/MWh for public entities such as school districts, municipalities, and public colleges and universities, as well as a temporary incentive for projects built on contaminated lands.
Incentive levels for the ADI Program range from $70-$120/SREC-II. Regulators said this would provide ongoing support for solar development while also offering “significant savings” over the prior SREC value of roughly $220.
Currently, NJBPU is evaluating 410 applications for Year 2 of its Community Solar Energy Pilot Program, and is examining the potential for dual-use solar facilities sited on agricultural lands under new legislation recently signed into law.
