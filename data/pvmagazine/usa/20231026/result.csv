Myrtle’s peak production capacity is 280 MW. The solar facility also has 225 MWh of co-located batteries manufactured by TotalEnergies subsidiary Saft. The French company designs, develops and manufactures batteries for transport, industry and defense. Saft’s utility-scale energy storage systems range from nickel to lithium-ion chemistries.
TotalEnergies states that its battery energy storage equipment is intended to help stabilize the Texas grid, which has already undergone pilot projects by The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to help increase resilience to extreme weather. 
The Myrtle project consists of 705,000 ground-mounted solar panels that cover an area of 1,800 football fields. TotalEnergies said its solar plant generates enough electricity to power 70,000 homes. 
However, 70% of Myrtle’s capacity will power three of TotalEnergies’ industrial plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast. That includes a synthetic plastic manufacturing facility in La Porte, Texas, a crude oil refinery in Port Arthur, Texas and a styrofoam production plant in Carville, La. The remaining 30% will provide Kilroy Realty with green electricity. The publicly traded real estate company, headquartered in Los Angeles, entered a 15-year corporate power purchase agreement with TotalEnergies.
The solar plant is expected to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of each industrial site. According to the National Grid, Scope 1 emissions are those from sources an organization owns or directly controls. That includes methane or carbon emitted during operations. Scope 2 emissions are related to what energy a company purchases. They are considered indirect because they result from the organization’s energy use, despite occurring at the facility, the Environmental Protection Agency states. 
The Myrtle project is part of TotalEnergies’ “Go Green” initiative, which aligns with the European Union’s carbon neutrality goal of sustaining an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To decarbonize its global facilities in this timeframe, TotalEnergies is beginning to include renewables like the Myrtle project to power its production practices. The company is working toward expanding its green power generation capacity to 100 TWh by 2030. This would be up from 33 TWh in 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/26/american-battery-factory-breaks-ground-on-1-2-billion-arizona-gigafactory/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,ARIZONA",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 26, 2023",American Battery Factory breaks ground on $1.2 billion Arizona gigafactory,"American Battery Factory (ABF) announced it has broken ground on its Tucson, Arizona lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery cell gigafactory. The two million square foot gigafactory will provide an estimated 1,000 jobs.
ABF is investing $1.2 billion in capital to open the factory. An estimated $3.2 billion in economic impact in Arizona is expected as a result of its operations.
The global market for lithium batteries is expected to reach $105 billion by 2025, as demand is expected to continue to accelerate. Increased renewable energy and electrification of transportation and the home is slated to drive this sharp increase in demand.
Located on 267 acres on the Pima County Aerospace Research Campus, ABF’s gigafactory will be a site for both LFP cell production and further research and development opportunities. The factory is being built using Sprung Instant Structures’ rapid modular construction model. The R&D center and initial factory module are expected to be constructed by 2025.
The company has recently expanded its executive leadership team, adding former Major General John Kem as president and award-winning Dr. Jun Liu as chief scientist. The company has also secured strategic partnerships with companies like Celgard, Anovion and FNA Group.
“Today’s groundbreaking represents a significant milestone for Arizona’s battery industry,” said Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, who participated in the event. “With this transformational investment, American Battery Factory advances Arizona’s clean energy industry and bolsters continued economic growth in Tucson and Pima County.”
Several clean energy companies have found a home in Arizona, including First Solar, TPI Composites, KORE Power and ElectraMeccanica.
Clean Energy Associates projects the global battery market will grow 186% by 2025 from 2022 production totals of 1,706 GWh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/26/sunnova-misses-on-q3-earnings-posts-sunny-forecast-for-2024/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 26, 2023","Sunnova misses on Q3 earnings, posts sunny forecast for 2024","Sunnova Energy International posted its Q3, 2023 earnings, noting a quarterly loss of $0.53 per share, a higher loss than the consensus estimate of a loss of $0.34 per share. Losses improved from Q2, which totaled a loss of $0.74 per share.
Despite coming short on EPS, the company posted revenues of $198.4 million, narrowly exceeding estimates. The quarterly revenues represents an increase from last year’s $149.4 million in Q3 last year.
Sunnova’s share have bled over 50% since the beginning of the year, struggling in a year when the S&P 500 is up over 10%. Residential solar stocks have been hammered by regulatory changes and high interest rates in 2023.
Despite the quarterly losses, Sunnova’s stock popped 15% following the earnings call. Management has issued a strong forecast for 2024, despite the headwinds it faces.
For 2024, the company expects customer additions to reach between 185,000 and 195,000, growing from this year’s expected count of 135,000 to 145,000. EBITDA is expected to land between $350 million and $450 million for 2024, up from $235 million to $255 million this year.
The company said it is among the pioneers embracing the newly introduced transferred credit program under the Inflation Reduction Act. In the third quarter, the company entered into a tax credit transfer transaction involving the sale of up to $145 million in investment tax credits.
Sunnova said maintaining a strong focus on liquidity, increasing operating leverage and profitability, and growing cash flow are primary objectives. As of September 30, 2023, Sunnova had total cash of $725.1 million, including restricted and unrestricted cash.
“As we navigate this higher interest rate and lower liquidity environment, it’s essential to recognize the unique opportunity that arises from the convergence of declining solar equipment prices and the steady uptick in utility rates, creating a distinct wedge of value for our customers,” said William J. Berger, chief executive officer, Sunnova. “This same wedge of value enables us to continue to increase our pricing power, which is reflected in our increased fully burdened unlevered return.”
Berger said the company has taken on multiple initiatives to position Sunnova for a prolonged period of challenging macroeconomic conditions. It will make a concerted effect to reduce working capital demands, trim operating expenses, and integrate software and AI to improve efficiencies.
“We are confident we will establish a solid foundation for our enduring success in this elevated interest rate environment,” said Berger.
Last month, Sunnova announced it secured a $3 billion partial loan guarantee from the Department of Energy Loans Programs Office for its Project Hestia. The project is designed to increase access to solar and virtual power plant services in low-income communities. The company will receive indirect and partially guaranteed cash flows for the loans associated with these customer accounts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/26/group-interconnection-studies-beneficial-but-not-a-panacea/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS,MINNESOTA,NORTH CAROLINA,OREGON,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 26, 2023",Group interconnection studies: Beneficial but not a panacea,"The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) has analyzed the shift from serial to group solar interconnection studies across five states. The analysis shows that under specific circumstances, group studies can alleviate some queueing issues, however, they do little to accelerate essential grid upgrades as solar continues to expand. In some cases, group studies may actually slow down the interconnection process.
IREC’s report, “Thinking Outside the Lines,” focuses on group study programs in California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, and North Carolina. The report describes the formation of group studies and their related timelines, study methodologies, management of project modifications and withdrawals, and the allocation of upgrade costs.
A primary advantage of group studies is found in areas with a high volume of interconnection applications tied to the same power grid. In such regions, projects can navigate through queues more efficiently and cost-effectively.
However, IREC also notes a drawback to group studies: They can take a lot longer to complete than individual studies. Initiating a group study can take from 40 days to 12 months, depending on how quickly projects are accumulated. Once underway, the more complex group study can take an additional 247 to 490 days to complete.

Initiating group studies presents its own set of challenges. In certain regions, solar power group studies must collect a minimum number of projects before launching, leading to uncertainty surrounding their commencement dates. On the other hand, some areas operate with fixed start dates. Missing a start date can postpone a project by a full year.
In the PJM interconnection region, group studies are launched every six months, with the preceding six months focused on collecting projects. When these studies commence, they evaluate hundreds of projects across various regions under their jurisdiction.
However, the PJM interconnection process has been put on hold for multiple years, as the grid management organization grapples with an influx of solar projects. By comparison, a lone interconnection application outside of PJM for a standard-sized, distribution-level solar project can get started within twenty business days and be completed in just four months.
Another benefit of group studies is cost allocation. As IREC notes, in Oregon, utility company PacifiCorp divides 50% of a group study’s charges per project, with the remaining half based on the project’s size in megawatts. In another example of cost allocation, an 80 MWac solar project in a North Carolina group study incurred a fee of just $3,000.

This $3,000 fee for a significant North Carolina project stands in stark contrast to the $18,600 fee for a single, ongoing 3.6 MWac project in New York, as relayed to pv magazine USA by a local developer. This disparity suggests that, on a per-megawatt basis, New York’s study fee is roughly 138 times costlier than North Carolina’s.
The IREC report also shed light on cost allocation challenges. In Minnesota, Xcel Energy’s upgrade costs were so steep that every participant withdrew upon discovering their share of the expenses. In contrast, Massachusetts is trialing a “beneficiary-pays” approach, wherein upgrade expenses are distributed among existing group study members, prospective interconnection customers, and ratepayers, and are determined by the benefits each group receives.
The Massachusetts group study process was put in place after state utilities say they were caught off guard by how much solar was submitted for connection to the power grid when the SMART program was launched.
Earlier studies from the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) have pinpointed fundamental issues with interconnection cost allocation. Specifically, existing customers reap substantial benefits from grid upgrades without shouldering the associated costs. ACORE’s investigation delved into 12 power grid upgrades driven by renewable energy projects, evaluating both the costs and the benefits of these upgrades. The findings were clear: Approximately $1 billion in benefits, funded by renewable projects, extend across the entire power grid, benefiting all energy sources, renewable or not.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/26/duke-completes-sale-of-renewables-business-renamed-to-deriva-energy/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 26, 2023","Duke completes sale of renewables business, renamed to Deriva Energy","Duke Energy has closed on the sale of its Commercial Renewables business to Brookfield and the company is renamed Deriva Energy. The new acquisition will maintain its operations in Charlotte and the employees will transition to the new company.
Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke Energy is a utility that provides electric services to more than 7 million customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, including retail natural gas service to over 500,000 customers in Ohio and Kentucky.
The process began in In November 2022, when Duke launched an auction for its commercial renewable energy platform. In June of 2023 it was announced that Duke Energy reached an agreement to sell its commercial renewable energy business for cash consideration of $1.1 billion and the assumption of $1.7 billion total debt. The utility had previously put a $4 billion valuation on its broader utility-scale renewables business.
“Today is a significant milestone for our business and opens an exciting new chapter in our history,” said Chris Fallon, president of Deriva Energy.
He noted that Deriva is now an independent developer, owner and operator of clean energy projects with the backing of Brookfield. Brookfield is one of the world’s largest owners and operators of renewable power plants, with approximately 900 GW of combined operating and pipeline capacity across all major U.S. power grids.
“As part of Brookfield, we have access to capital for growth and a wealth of operating expertise, which will enable us to continue our leadership in clean energy for many years to come,” Fallon said.
The closure of this sale is the final step in Duke Energy’s portfolio re-positioning to a fully regulated utility. In July 2023, Duke announced an agreement to sell its commercial distributed generation business to an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners for an enterprise value of $364 million. Duke said it expected about $259 million of net proceeds from the transaction.
The two divestments support Duke’s focus on the growth of its regulated businesses, including investments to enhance grid reliability and incorporate over 30 GW of regulated renewable energy into its grid by 2035.
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC served as financial advisors to Duke Energy for this transaction. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as legal counsel to Duke Energy.
