This clean energy boom is expected to help accelerate the build-out of green infrastructure. To help ensure that domestic capacity for developing green technology components will meet growing infrastructural demands, the Department of Energy (DOE) launched the Manufacture of Advanced Key Energy Infrastructure Technologies Prize (MAKE IT). 
The $30 million fund is meant to incentivize the domestic manufacturing of green technology critical components while ensuring facilities also benefit the communities in which they exist. It includes two multiphase tracks: The Facilities Track and The Strategies Track. 
The Facilities Track
This track is meant to help manufacturing plant developers transition from the planning stage to being ready for construction. It’s open to U.S.-based organizations interested in manufacturing. 
To apply, participants begin by submitting a Statement of Intent. This introductory letter is an opportunity to describe their team and the clean energy technology they want to manufacture. 
If the competitors are approved to compete in Phase 1: Scope, they must submit a proposal detailing their green technology manufacturing facility development plan. The American-Made Challenges program page states that about 12 winners will be awarded $500,000 each and move on to Phase 2: Shovel Ready.
Here, participants will exhibit how they can begin building a manufacturing facility by providing evidence of having control of a site, permits, financing, and proof of community engagement. There will be a maximum of four winners awarded $4.5 million each.
NREL states that The Facilities Track is currently accepting statements of intent from new teams interested in joining the track’s secondary timeline until Feb. 1. Participants whose statement of intent was deemed eligible under the primary timeline have until Feb. 1 to submit a Phase 1: Scope proposal.  
The Strategies Track
The Strategies Track invites U.S.-based organizations to submit proposals for boosting clean energy manufacturing, economic development, growth, and quality of life in their communities. Nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, economic development organizations, and other groups focused on a culturally responsive approach to nurturing the communities where these manufacturing facilities will exist are invited to apply, said Rebecca Szymkowicz, the commercialization program manager at the DOE. 
The American-Made Challenges Program page states that interested applicants get two chances to compete through two rounds, and each round has three phases. 
Phase 1: Engage asks participants to submit an introductory narrative sharing information on their team, region and possible approaches to their manufacturing development community engagement plan. About 30 winners will receive up to $50,000 each across each round of the competition. 
For Phase 2: Create awardees should submit a concept roadmap detailing the results of their community engagement and including a list of possible manufacturers for their region. About 20 concept roadmaps will be selected to move forward to the next phase, each winning $100,000 across each round of the competition. 
Those selected to move forward to Phase 3: Activate will be asked to submit a final copy of their roadmaps along with proof of interest from at least one entity looking to develop a clean energy manufacturing facility in their region. About eight winners will be selected to receive $250,000 across each round of the competition. 
The deadline to apply for Round 2 of Phase 1: Engage is Feb. 15. For a detailed list of each round and phase deadline, visit the American-Made Challenges Program page. 
NREL states that cross-track collaboration is welcomed to foster more cooperation between teams looking for sites for their manufacturing facilities and those searching for developers for their regions. 
The MAKE IT Prize is funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Technology Commercialization Fund.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/18/bloomberg-signs-15-year-ppa-for-texas-solar/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 18, 2024",Bloomberg signs 15-year PPA for Texas solar,"Ørsted announced the signing of an 80 MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with Bloomberg for renewable energy generated by the Mockingbird Solar Center. This agreement brings the 471 MW project currently under construction near Paris, Texas to a fully contracted status for its full capacity.
The project is Ørsted’s largest solar facility and ranks seventh on PV Intel’s largest projects to begin construction within the last year.  It is also the company’s first project to incorporate conservation efforts with the protection of native tallgrass prairie. Ørsted is collaborating with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to protect nearly 1,000 acres of native tallgrass prairies in Texas. The company will purchase and transfer the land to TNC this year. Less than 1% of the original tallgrass prairies of Texas remain today, and less than 5% has survived nationwide. The collaboration will mark the largest conservation of tallgrass prairies on record, the company reports. 
“Ørsted’s commitment to the responsible development of clean energy at Mockingbird Solar Center demonstrates that conservation and clean energy can coexist,” said Monica Testa, Head of Origination, Americas at Ørsted. “We’re proud to partner with Bloomberg in support of their sustainability goals and thrilled to see companies continue to prioritize the responsible development of clean energy in line with nature.”
Bloomberg is joined by Covestro and Royal DSM as corporate customers buying power from the Mockingbird Solar Center.
In 2016, Bloomberg joined the RE100, a global corporate initiative comprised of businesses committed to sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable energy. According to Bloomberg, in 2022, the company secured 192,533 MWh of renewable energy from 11 projects, representing 54.6% of Bloomberg’s global purchased electricity. With the signing of this PPA, Bloomberg expects the additional renewable energy sourced from the Mockingbird Solar Center to cover 100% of its U.S. electricity use and 80% of global electricity use.
“We look forward to partnering with Ørsted on the purchase of renewable energy to progress our RE100 target while also meaningfully contributing to conservation efforts,” said Dave Wildman, global head facilities, sustainability ops, MEP infrastructure at Bloomberg.

The Mockingbird facility is expected to produce the equivalent of 80,000 Texas homes’ electricity demand, interconnecting with Texas utility Oncor. The project will create at least 200 jobs during construction and will require long-term staffing for operations and maintenance. Project construction is slated for January 2023 and is expected to be completed in 2024.
The project will inject an estimated $215 million new revenue into the tax base, promoting local economic development in Lamar County, and providing long-term financial support for North Lamar and Chisum Independent School Districts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/18/u-s-government-identifies-22-million-acres-for-solar-in-western-states/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 18, 2024",U.S. government identifies 22 million acres for solar in western states,"The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has released a draft analysis of the Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), also known as the Western Solar Plan. It is designed to guide responsible solar development on public lands.
First published in 2012, the plan originally identified areas in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah with high solar potential and low resource conflicts. The new document refines the analysis in the original six states and expands it to include Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming.
It identifies 22 million acres across the 11 states that are best suited for solar development.
The document calls for solar development to be focused on areas with fewer sensitive resources, less conflict with other uses of public lands, and close proximity to transmission lines, having identified 200,000 acres of land near existing transmission infrastructure.
Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said the BLM’s proposal is a “big step in the right direction and recognizes the key role solar plays in our energy economy.”
“Under the current policy, there are at least 80 million acres of federal lands open to oil and gas development, which is 100 times the amount of public land available for solar,” he added. “SEIA has been advocating for changes to the Solar PEIS for over 12 years and appreciates BLM’s extensive efforts to gather stakeholder feedback and make revisions that balance development and conservation. We will continue to urge the Administration to streamline permitting and harness the federal lands portfolio to supercharge job creation, promote energy security, and improve conservation outcomes.”
The BLM also announced the next steps on several renewable projects in Arizona, California and Nevada, representing more than 1,700 MW of potential solar generation.
The BLM has approved 47 clean energy projects, or enough to power more than 3.5 million homes, under the Biden administration.
In December, the SEIA predicted that the United States added 33 GW of solar capacity across the country in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/18/nyc-solar-mecca-created-by-policies-and-incentives/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,NEW YORK",,"JANUARY 18, 2024",NYC solar mecca created by policies and incentives,"As progressive as the Empire City is, up until recently NYC’s transition toward renewable energy had suffered paralysis by its own laws and regulations. For example, despite much of the city’s suburbs’ flat-topped roofs being ideal to house rooftop systems, the city’s stringent zoning restrictions allowed for the majority of rooftops to only be outfitted with small, unsubstantial systems.
But at the close of 2023, the city passed a series of zoning amendments, as part of Mayor Adams’ ‘City of Yes for Carbon Neutrality’ initiative, which will relax burdensome zoning restrictions on solar development. These changes unlock 5 gigawatts of previously undeveloped capacity for rooftop solar development across more than 50,000 buildings and more than 1 million homes in NYC. In addition, 8,500 acres of parking lots will be re-zoned to allow for solar installations – equivalent to 10x the acreage of Central Park.
The relaxed zoning restrictions will usher in a new wave of solar development in time for homeowners to take advantage of a wide variety of federal and state incentives aimed at making solar installations affordable for all. For residents of New York City, there is an additional incentive of note. Beginning in 2024, the city’s property tax abatement (PTA), which was set at 20%, will be increased to cover 30% of the cost of a solar installation, over the course of four years. And the 30% rate has been extended through 2035.
The laxed zoning restrictions and financial incentives will make solar installation both logistically and economically feasible for property owners throughout the five boroughs, a necessary feat given New York State’s aggressive climate goals and the city’s implementation of Local Law 97. Local Law 97 (LL 97), which took effect at the start of the year, requires buildings greater than 25,000 square feet to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. Buildings that exceed emissions limits or fail to meet adequate reductions in emissions will face monetary penalties. Solar energy will play a significant role in ensuring buildings meet LL 97 regulations, and the zoning changes adopted by the City of Yes Carbon Neutrality amendments and the city’s increased property tax abatement are crucial to LL 97’s practicality and success.
These regulations and incentives have come together to create a “solar mecca” in the Big Apple that will propel the city toward its emissions reduction goals, while driving significant economic impact. The city’s comptroller predicts that the influx of solar-development will create 13,000 clean-energy jobs over the course of the next 8 years with experts predicting a potential market opportunity of more than $23 billion.

T.R. Ludwig is a clean energy leader with over a decade of experience in various management and executive roles within the solar industry. He is the CEO and co-founder of both Brooklyn SolarWorks and Brooklyn Solar Canopy Co. and serves as treasurer for NYSEIA. He has led solar companies both large and small, with a focus on sales, marketing, and finance, and helped pioneer solar lending in the Northeast market. T.R. received his MBA from the Maastricht School of Management in the Netherlands and was among the first solar professionals in the United States to become NABCEP Technical Sales certified.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/18/flexibility-is-key-as-energy-sector-moves-to-net-zero-future/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"JANUARY 18, 2024",‘Flexibility is key’ as energy sector moves to net-zero future,"A flexible approach to energy will be key as the industry grapples with ongoing reliability challenges, extreme weather, the electrification of different sectors of the economy, and the growth of renewables and storage, a new report from GridBeyond concludes.
The report, which looks at energy trends for 2024, noted that policy-makers around the world are keeping a close eye on energy security and affordability. And while a reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels and increased renewable use can lead to greater energy security and independence, grid operators do have to overcome certain challenges connected to them, such as intermittency. 
The energy sector is on the brink of its next evolution, into a fresh era characterized by an emphasis on sustainability and efficiency, Michael Phelan, CEO and co-founder of GridBeyond, said.
“At the same time, to achieve net-zero emissions, companies are redefining their strategies, embracing a flexible approach to energy utilisation as a core asset in remaining competitive within… this new landscape. Flexibility is key to ensure the success of the energy transition to a net zero future,” Phelan added. 
The energy sector is undergoing many changes, as well as challenges related to reliability. Extreme weather events can lead to increased electricity demand, as well as increase the chance that coal and gas power plants experience breakdowns, the report noted. At the same time, global renewable capacity additions are rapidly increasing, to more than 440 GW in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. In fact, under an accelerated model, renewable additions could touch 550 GW in 2024, as Europe and other parts of the world look to reduce dependence on Russian natural gas imports, the report noted. 
In this context, energy policy makers across the world are looking to expand energy flexibility on the demand side to help support the grid, the report noted. In a recent GridBeyond survey, 30% of respondents say energy flexibility as the “biggest trend impacting the energy markets of the future” – compared to just 22% a year ago, the report noted. 
“This trend is supported by a series of policy and regulatory developments in markets across the world as grid operators seek new and innovative measures to encourage flexibility in the power system,” according to the report. 
In the U.S., for instance, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT) Contingency Reserve Service, a daily procured ancillary service launched in June, is an example of this, and will help keep supply and demand balanced in real time as electricity demand grows. This is the first daily procured ancillary services introduced in the market in more than two decades, the report noted Japan, meanwhile, is set to launch new ancillary services markets in 2024, with rolling weekly and day-ahead markets that can compensate storage. 
Clean energy procurement processes, meanwhile, can be more complex than common forms of procurement today, and buyers will need to be encouraged with the right incentive and reward structures to help undertake them, the report said. 
“In designing new products and services, the incentives offered to the customers providing these services should reflect the value of any grid benefits and increased resiliency that can accrue to utilities, grid operators, or other market participants,” the report stated.
