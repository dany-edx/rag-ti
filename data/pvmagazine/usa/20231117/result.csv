The U.S. Department of Treasury has released guidance on how to access the ITC. Find the full document here. 
The ITC sets aside a federal tax credit of 30% of installed system costs for clean energy technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. The credit is offered as a base 6%, and the 30% credit is only offered to projects that satisfy prevailing wage requirements.
A further 10% tax credit adder is offered to projects installed in eligible Energy Communities, which are defined by income status and the economic impact of legacy energy systems in their area.
Another 10% adder can be applied to projects that meet domestic content requirements. A large portion of the spending in the IRA is directed towards supporting the buildout of U.S.-based clean energy manufacturing, and the 10% domestic content adder is designed to stimulate demand for these products. The three credits can be combined to cover 50% of installed system costs.
Two other key facets of the ITC are direct pay and transferability. Direct pay is made available to tax-exempt entities investing in clean energy projects. Credits including the 30% Investment Tax Credit, plus any applicable adders, can be used by these entities as a payment against tax liability, and any remaining balance can be refunded as a direct payment to these entities. Tax years beginning January 1, 2023 are eligible for this transaction.
Organizations that are exempt from tax by § 501(a) are eligible for the direct pay option, as well as those described by § 501(c), including public charities, private foundations, social welfare organizations, labor organizations, business leagues, and others. The option is available to Tribal Governments, rural electric cooperative utilities, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, as well. A frequently asked questions page offers more information.
As for transferability, this process enables project owners to monetize tax credits by transferring them to other taxpayers. Under this transaction, renewable energy developers and owners are essentially able to sell tax credits for cash, making financing easier for new clean energy projects. The transferability option is generally open to the entities that are not covered by the direct pay option. More information in the frequently asked questions section can be found here.
pv magazine USA will continue to provide updates on the Section 48 guidance, which can be read in full here.

Unreleased Department of Forestry and Fire Protection documents obtained by the publication state a sagging SCE electricity line allegedly touched a communication line below, leading to sparks igniting nearby vegetation and starting the Fairview Fire.
SCE spokeswoman Diane Castro told pv magazine that “our hearts are with the community and the people who suffered losses in the Fairview Fire.”
“We cooperated with CALFIRE during its review of the fire and are examining their latest report,” she said.
Asked whether pv magazine could obtain the report, Castro said she does not have a copy. pv magazine asked the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection for the document but did not get a response.
SCE, a subsidiary of Californian-based Edison International, delivers power to 15 million people across the state.
The company is being sued by the US government for alleged negligence of poorly maintained power lines, which led to another wildfire that burned close to 466 square kilometers in 2020.
According to the SCE’s “2023-2035 Wildfire Mitigation Plan” published earlier this year, up to seven catastrophic wildfires were “opined” to have been caused or linked to SCE utility infrastructure since 2007. The report states the Fairview Fire is still under investigation.
SCE’s safety report contains “lessons learned” and “resulting mitigations” following the fires. This includes modifying its inspection form with new questions to “capture and remediate” issues, and starting transmission and distribution structure inspections from the ground and sky.
A catastrophic fire is defined as a fire causing at least one death, damaging over 500 structures or burning over 2,023 hectares.
SCE said in March it had reduced the probability of catastrophic wildfires associated with its equipment by up to 80%.
The company published its “Countdown to 45” report earlier this year, which calls for a range of measures to achieve the Californian government’s pledge of net zero by 2045 goal. Measures include developing an extra 90 GW of utility-scale “clean” generation, around 25 GW of utility-scale energy storage and more than 15 GW of behind-the-meter solar and storage options.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/17/sdge-toyota-join-forces-on-vehicle-to-grid-research-in-california/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023","SDG&E, Toyota join forces on vehicle-to-grid research in California ","Southern California utility San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) and Toyota Motor North America are working together on researching vehicle-to-grid applications (V2G) for battery electric vehicles.
The research is specifically focused on bidirectional power flow, a technology that would allow EV owners to both draw power from the grid, as well as export it back to the power system from their car batteries. Electricity system stakeholders have been eyeing vehicle-to-grid – or V2G – technology for its ability to improve grid reliability and resilience, as well as help integrate renewables and potentially lower electricity costs. 
“V2G has the potential to be a game changer for the power grid and for consumers,” Miguel Romero, SDG&E’s chief commercial officer, said. 
SDG&E’s footprint is one of the largest markets for Toyota’s electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and California itself is one of the fastest-growing EV markets in the region. The utility has electrified over a fifth of its over-the-road fleet, and has deployed more than 3,600 chargers at offices, schools, parks and industrial facilities in its service territory.
The companies intend to conduct their research at SDG&E’s San Diego campus, and will use a bidirectional charger and vehicle-to-grid platform from Fermata Energy. Based on this research, SDG&E is aiming to get a better understanding of the infrastructure it will need to deploy to ensure the growth of vehicle charging infrastructure. Both companies also plan to pinpoint new products and services that can provide customer benefits. 
Vehicle-to-grid technology essentially allows EVs to operate as grid storage assets that provide the same services as stationary storage, but at a lower cost, David Slutzky, founder and chairman of Fermata Energy, told pv magazine USA. 
The size of EV storage capacity is massive, Slutzky added – California, for instance, anticipates having 8 million EVs on the road by 2030.  If every one of these EVs was paired with a 10 kW bidirectional charger, this would represent an 80 GW grid resource, he said. 
Toyota is looking to empower utilities to better anticipate and leverage the significant number of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles on their grids, both as a growing source of energy demand and, in the future, energy supply, Christopher Yang, group vice president of Toyota EV Charging Solutions, said. 
“We are embracing the concept of an entire electrified ecosystem for our customers, and the ability for vehicles to integrate with the grid is an essential component of this ecosystem,” Yang said. 
Bidirectional charging technology has been installed across the country, but is still somewhat nascent, according to Slutzky. In thinking about policy support for this sector, parallels can be drawn between the technology and the birth of the rooftop solar industry, he said. There were three policy pillars that supported the growth of rooftop solar – interconnection, incentives, and compensation for excess solar generation, in the form of net energy metering.
“Similarly, bidirectional charging and V2G needs to be more easily approved for interconnection, gain access to incentives already available for stationary storage and unidirectional chargers, and become eligible for compensation for exports of power from EVs to the grid,” Slutzky said. 
Bidirectional charging technologies also require a fourth interoperability pillar, he added.
“Although efforts are underway to standardize communication and technical standards, the fully interoperable environment needed for V2G to scale will require a great deal of work,” Slutzky said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/17/california-slashes-rooftop-solar-export-compensation-for-renters-schools-farms/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023","California slashes rooftop solar export compensation for renters, schools, farms","Roughly a year after cutting rooftop solar payments for single-family homes exporting electricity to the grid, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has now unanimously voted forward a decision that does the same for multi-meter properties, farms, schools, some commercial buildings, and more. 
Previous to this decision, properties with multiple electric meters in California would be connected via a Virtual Net Energy Metering (VNEM) and Net Energy Metering Aggregation (NEMA) program, which allow properties with multiple meters to install a single solar array for the entire property, sharing one system’s electricity and associated net metering credits with all customers and meters on the property. 
Properties under these programs sell excess solar generation back to the grid in exchange for bill credits. The new decision slashed these payments by roughly 80%, making a severe dent in the value proposition for new rooftop solar customers. 
Additionally, the ruling determined that common areas in residential buildings are no longer eligible for the aggregation feature within VNEM and NEMA, meaning that any solar capacity associated with common area electric meters must be used by that area, and any excess must be sold to the utility at a low rate, and then purchased back at a much higher rate, multiples above what it was sold for. These common areas that cannot be tied to other accounts include hallways, gyms, outdoor areas, EV charging stations, and more. 
“It is astonishing how intent the CPUC is on continuing to block the growth of solar at the expense of consumers and our state clean energy goals for the benefit of big utilities like PG&E.,” said CALSSA Executive Director Bernadette Del Chiaro.
(Read: “California rooftop solar policy struggles serve as warning to nation“)
The CPUC is mandated to serve the public, primarily securing electricity reliability and affordability. This recent decision by CPUC to make it harder for renters to adopt solar in California is particularly confusing given the justification for its previous slash to single-family homes in NEM 3.0. That decision was based on a utility-backed argument that rooftop solar was exacerbating inequality in California, and that renters were being left behind in the savings that solar can bring.
Now, just a year later, CPUC made another move to support that moat around the profits of the major private utilities. What’s more, alongside the net metering decision, CPUC voted to approve a 12.8% hike in electricity rates. The prices continue to rise steadily, even as California electricity rates have far outpaced inflation. 
“There’s no arguing that rent and cost of living in California are high, and solar is a real way to defer those expenses,” said Chris Hopper, chief executive officer, Aurora Solar. “This further eats away at that, and unfortunately, it impacts vulnerable communities who are easily hurt by high costs: renters, farmers, and small businesses. Overall, the change in pricing structures is going to have a much larger impact on low-income communities.”

The rooftop installation will provide 84 MWh annually and cover up to 75% of the facility’s power, the company reports.

S-5! hired Spear Commercial & Industrial from Texas to handle the solar installation, which includes 135 Trina Vertex S 395 W solar modules with Enphase IQ8 microinverters. The modules are mounted directly on the metal roof using the company’s own PVKIT for attachment. PVKIT enables solar modules to be mounted on metal roofs without the need for a rail system.
Mark Gies, director of product management told pv magazine USA that the company does plan to add battery backup in the future. “The weather in Colorado Springs is volatile especially in the winter,” said Gies. “We want to utilize the benefits of a battery backup as well as leveraging any future economics of ‘time of use’ shifting.”

The two-story office building, designed by PWN Architects and Planners of Denver, Colorado, was built with the environment in mind and makes use of native timber and natural moss rock, along with Corten steel, which provides a rustic appearance to the building exterior. The roof, installed by Weathercraft from Colorado Springs is a standing seam, Galvalume Drexel Metals 24-gauge supported by hand-peeled log trusses.
While the finished project is “now an office that I could only dream of,” said Rob Haddock, CEO and founder of S-5!, the road to completion was rocky at times. After ten years of searching, Haddock said he found land that had been burned in the Black Forest Fire of 2013. An architect began the plans, but they ran into challenges from formal rezoning, to fire protection, to escalating costs during COVID, to workforce challenges, and more. Despite the challenges, the corporate headquarters is finished and running on solar.

Priefert has begun manufacturing Nevados’ all-terrain solar mounting and tracking equipment at its 23-acre factory and expects to expand as a result.
Nevados offers the All Terrain Tracker, which is a single-axis tracker that fits to undulating terrain due to its design that integrates the driveline and articulating capability into the same components.

By the end of the year, the company expects to have contracted for enough trackers to supply around 1.5 GW of capacity in the U.S. Jenya Meydbray, chief commercial officer of Nevados said the company is “inundated with opportunities.” He said Nevados is in the “hockey stick growth phase of our life… and we don’t see that slowing down.”
In one deal alone, announced in February, Nevados agreed to supply Ampliform’s near-term project pipeline of 700 MW as well as its longer-term pipeline of 2 GW of projects under development across the U.S. Other Nevados partners include Cupertino Electric Inc., BlueWave, Cogent Renewables, CS Energy, Cupertino Electric, Inc., D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments (DESRI), Energix Renewables, Nexamp, Primoris Services Corporation, and SOLV Energy.
The Nevados and Priefert partnership is one example of the shift in manufacturing to meet the needs of the rapidly growing U.S. solar industry. The Priefert factory currently employs 900 people in a town of 16,000, with 100 of those employees focused on making Nevados solar trackers. Priefert expects both numbers to grow and plans to nearly double the size of the facility.
“We’ll keep growing the solar until we make up more than half of the employees,” Meydbray said.
While the final rules are still pending on domestic content adders as well as the advanced manufacturing tax credit under section 45X, Rocky Christenberry, vice president of manufacturing at Priefert said they are sourcing U.S. materials and will provide full traceability.
Nevados began its R&D process, winning a 2015-2016 SunShot award from the U.S. Department of Energy. Meydbray said that the proprietary design sets the All Terrain Tracker apart from its competitors, with bearings that allow for installation on slopes up to 37% with slope changes as great as 26% across a foundation. Other unique design aspects include non-continuous torque tubes, shorter pilings, and large tolerances, all of which simplify and speed up the installation, Meydbray said. Top-clamp clips also reportedly help solar modules to align during installation, and accommodate different module sizes. The torque tube and damper designs improve wind performance, which he noted have proven to withstand hurricane-force winds with zero structural damage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/17/power-struggle-the-grid-barrier-stifling-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 17, 2023",Power Struggle: The grid barrier stifling community solar,"Across the nation, the distribution grid is deadlocked. While headlines discuss supply chain bottlenecks or inflate communities’ hesitancy to build solar and wind farms on their land, the largest reason for this deadlock involves interconnection.
Interconnection, or the process of acquiring a utility’s permission to connect to the local distribution grid, threatens to derail tremendous progress being made across the country to build out innovative types of energy, including community solar, that offer equitable access to clean energy. Queues around the country are flooded with applications that overwhelm utilities, and the backlog threatens states’ 2030 climate goals.
The good news is many reasons for the current delays have a tenable solution. State utility commissions can help solve this significant challenge by working collaboratively and by improving data transparency.
The significance of interconnection for distributed, renewable energy generation cannot be emphasized enough. A rapid and cost-effective grid connection is crucial for project success. Unfortunately, interconnection delays and unpredictable grid upgrade costs have slowed community solar project development across the country.
In Maine, over 400 MW of projects have been delayed for more than a year due to cluster studies. Some of these projects might never be built due to the magnitude of delays, unexpected upgrade costs on the order of millions of dollars, or both. Utilities in states like Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland have overly broad technical planning limits that restrict where community solar can go, or that require prohibitively expensive protection equipment, known as Direct Transfer Trip, without considering alternatives.
A 2022 analysis estimated it would take 260 years to clear Minnesota’s interconnection backlog at Xcel Energy’s current pace of review. These serve as just a few examples displaying the prevalence of interconnection issues throughout the country.
Volume of applications
A major reason for delays is the sheer volume of interconnection applications utilities receive. Community solar offers an array of benefits, like reducing emissions,  increasing energy equity, and improving grid resiliency. Additionally, federal policies are accelerating deployment through the EPA’s Solar for All fund and the Low-Income Communities Bonus and Investment Tax Credits.
As a result, newly opened programs often incur a flood of applications. Delmarva Power received over 250MW of interconnection applications over a two-day period when Delaware’s community solar program opened in 2021. The number of interconnection applications in Massachusetts nearly doubled in the three-year period following the launch of its programs. New interconnection applications can also overwhelm utilities that have not modernized and streamlined their review processes.
However, even for utilities that have taken important steps to improve the interconnection process, many still can’t manage the flood of application requests. Part of the influx problem is that many of these applications are for “zombie projects.” A “zombie” project is a project that turns out to be infeasible to build — often because of information that the developer couldn’t have known without submitting an interconnection application in the first place.
Most utilities provide very little actionable information about the best interconnection locations on their distribution system in advance of submitting an interconnection application. As a result, project developers must rely on the interconnection application process as a prospecting tool, seeking to test out — through trial-and-error of application submissions — which grid locations might be suitable to interconnect. Any project could be viable, but the developer simply doesn’t know until they apply for interconnection.
Zombie projects
The end result is that interconnection queues are full of test project requests that ultimately aren’t viable — affectionately referred to within the industry as “zombie projects.”
The best way to get rid of zombie projects is to ensure project developers have the right information to put forward a well-founded interconnection application. Utilities and regulators can help drive this change in several ways. First, they can be required to publish hosting capacity maps that contain distribution asset information and are updated at least monthly. While many states now require utilities to publish hosting capacity maps, these two pieces of information ensure the maps are useful and up to date. Good examples of this exist in California, Massachusetts,  Minnesota, and Oregon.
Regulators can also ensure that interconnection queues are made publicly available. Substation and feeder names, application status (including withdrawals), interconnection cost estimates, and proposed in-service dates are especially useful details to include. Examples of states and utilities that provide this information today include Duke Energy, Hawaiian Electric Companies, Massachusetts, New York, and Xcel Energy.
Well-designed hosting capacity analyses and interconnection queue reports can significantly reduce the number of speculative interconnection applications. This is readily available information, and making it public would reduce the utilities’ duplicative efforts and workload, which is funded by ratepayers. Regulators should require utilities to adopt these best practices for the benefit of utility customers, and because states’ clean energy goals depend on it.
As the number of distributed energy resources blossom — including but not limited to community solar projects — these new installations will continue to seek to interconnect to the distribution system, and this kind of data transparency will be critical to keep the zombies at bay.

Sam Weaver is the interconnection and grid integration policy director at the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).
