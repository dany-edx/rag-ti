Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost effective is important in grid reliability.
Boston startup Form Energy developed technology to address this need, revealing recently the chemistry behind their iron-air batteries. The company said its iron-air batteries can store renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at system costs competitive with conventional power plants. At full-scale production, Form Energy said the modules would deliver electricity at tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air and create rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
$200 million in Series D funding has been secured for the project, led by $25 million from ArcelorMittal’s XCarb innovation fund. ArcelorMittal will non-exclusively supply the iron materials for the battery system production, and Form Energy said it intends to source its iron domestically, manufacturing the batteries near where the iron was sourced.
The company’s first project is a 1 MW / 150 MWh pilot installation with Minnesota-based utility Great River Energy, located near the American Iron Range. Form Energy said it expects to have the facility deployed at a Great River Energy power plant by 2023.
Mateo Jaramillo, CEO and Co-founder of Form Energy, said, “We conducted a broad review of available technologies and have reinvented the iron-air battery to optimize it for multi-day energy storage for the electric grid. With this technology, we are tackling the biggest barrier to deep decarbonization: making renewable energy available when and where it’s needed, even during multiple days of extreme weather or grid outages.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/23/ohio-regulators-consider-another-470-mw-of-solar/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,OHIO",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 23, 2021",Ohio regulators consider another 470 MW of solar,"A monumental summer for the future of Ohio solar is continuing strong, as the state’s Power Siting Board is set to conduct two hearings that could eventually lead to the development of 470 MW of solar capacity in the Buckeye state.
The first hearing, set to be held on August 16, 2021 at 6 p.m. at Bunsold Middle School in Marysville, Ohio is for the proposed 325 MW behemoth Union Solar project, the second-largest project ever proposed in the state and impressive in size, even on a national scale.
The project is proposed to lay on approximately 2,013 acres within an approximately 3,355-acre project area in Washington and York townships in Union County, just northwest of Columbus, and would be developed by Acciona.
The following hearing is set to be held on August 19, 2021, at 6 p.m. at the Fire/Township Meeting Room in Rosewood, Ohio, and is for the proposed Clearview Solar I project, a 144 MW installation planned for Adams Township in Champaign County, just west of Columbus.
Open Road Renewables is developing the project, and if approved, it will sit on 1,075 acres within an approximately 1,195-acre site area.
While Ohio is currently home to 527 MW of solar capacity, the majority of which came online in 2020, project proposal hearings have been coming in at an unprecedented rate this summer, with hearings set for projects that would exponentially increase that capacity figure.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) predicts that Ohio will see significant solar expansion over the next five years, adding a forecasted 2,955 MW, good for 11th in the nation over that period. That figure could end up being much higher, as this summer alone the Power Siting Board has set hearings for 1061 MW worth of utility scale solar and has approved 877 MW for construction.
Outside of the 1,938 MW that have been either approved or are under consideration, the state is soon slated to get a major capacity boost, as the Hillsborough Solar project nears completion. The 200 MW installation, which had construction begin last year, will be the largest active project in the state once it is completed.

The report said that roughly 6% of all U.S. residential PV systems installed in 2020 and 2% of non-residential PV systems included storage, though much higher rates have been realized within individual states and utility service territories.
Hawaii had “by far” the highest storage attachment rate of any state, the report said, at 80% residential and 40% non-residential. It credited the rate to net metering reforms that incentivize self consumption. California was second with attachment rates of 8% for residential and 2% for non-residential. Deployment there was largely driven by incentives and wildfire resilience issues.
In select pockets, attachment rates were 10-20%, including in areas served by Arizona’s Salt River Project and Washington State’s Puget Sound Energy.

Among paired residential systems installed in 2020, most used a single 5 kW battery with either 9.3 kWh (LG Chem RESU 10H) or 13.5 kWh (Tesla Powerwall) of storage capacity. The report said that the portion of systems installed with multiple batteries has been steadily growing (40% in 2020). Most residential systems have the ability to store 30-80% of average daily PV generation, depending on the relative size of the PV and storage components.
Roughly 50% of all residential PV installers and 17% of all non-residential installers have completed at least one paired system, although the residential and non-residential markets are both “highly concentrated” among a small number of firms. Even among relatively large PV installers, the depth of experience with paired systems varies considerably, the report said.
Comparing median installed prices for PV systems with and without storage suggests a storage premium of about $1.2/W-PV for residential and small non-residential systems in 2020, and about half that amount for larger non-residential systems. Depending on the data source used, the report said that the cost of adding storage to PV ranges from roughly $700-1,300/kWh of storage capacity.
Based on a pro-forma financial analysis, adding storage to residential PV yields a present-value benefit to the host customer of roughly $500-$1,000/kWh of storage capacity, across several key markets. Adding storage to non-residential PV yields a customer benefit of $1,200-$2,000/kWh, the report said.
Simulations of residential PV+storage systems operated for backup power purposes suggest that a typically sized system with 7 kW PV and 10 kWh of storage would be able to maintain, on average, 60-80% of a customer’s average daily load over the course of a year, depending on the region.

All around the nation, a flurry of virtual power plants (VPP) have been making news. Comprised entirely of distributed residential energy storage, these plants stabilize the grid, and often eliminate the need for new fossil peaker plants.
Starting July 22, if you have a Tesla Powerwall and app installed, you can “Opt In” to the California Tesla Virtual Power Plant. The company page notes the project is currently being offered with no compensation, and is being used as a public service during the current California power grid challenges.

The Tesla VPP website also said that as many as 50,000 Powerwalls are available to create “the largest distributed battery system in the world.” Most of the Tesla Powerwalls that are installed are 5 kW/13.5 kWh, suggesting a maximum potential capacity of 250 MW/675 MWh.
Data collated by the California Solar & Storage Association from the California ISO power grid (in the chart below) suggests that in 2020 alone, 165 MW/428 MWh of distributed energy storage was installed. Since 2011, the data shows 530 MW of distributed energy storage connected, suggesting a total stored capacity approaching 1,500 MWh.

Tesla has experience with networked VPPs. Its South Australia plant has a 50,000 unit goal, and is almost 10% deployed. That plant has been given credit for supporting the broader powergrid during complex events.
Powerwall owners who opt in should expect their batteries to be used during so-called “Flex Events,” like those which occurred earlier this summer, prompting a record 999 MW energy storage injection of power from energy storage into the California grid, as shown below.

And, considering the Texas power outage this past winter, a new Tesla-powered housing complex in Austin should attract some attention. The development is set to incorporate as many as 10,000 SolarRoofs and Powerwalls. Tesla says this nascent complex will become a testbed for its technology.
But Tesla’s announcements are just the tip of the iceberg. Managed, distributed energy storage projects have been making headlines with increasing frequency, and the average project size has been increasing as well.
Multiple parties commented to pv magazine USA that these projects are growing in size, and delivering solid data.
Sonnen and its sonnenCommunity platform is likely the oldest residential energy storage VPP platform in the industry. Whole neighborhoods of this battery have been around for years.
Vermont electric utility Green Mountain Power should be given credit for its VPP, too. First launched in 2017, it now incudes thousands of large and small Tesla batteries. Early on, the VPP saved $500,000 during a heatwave.
And of course, we can only wonder how many – and what new types – of VPP programs Lynn Jurich and team at Sunrun have been cooking up.
Sunrun’s NE-ISO capacity market win was a watershed moment for residential solar+storage on the bid power grid. Since then, the company has signed multiple VPP deals made up of slices of its hundreds of thousands of rooftop and garage power plants.
And let’s not forget Sunrun’s recent announcement with Ford, which suggests we should expect vehicle-to-grid VPP integration – especially considering the truck is expected to come with a battery somewhere near 150 kWh in capacity.

VPPs are clearly a recipe for grid success. Add in a dash of OhmConnect paying its homeowners hundreds of thousands of dollars with demand response during California power grid Flex events, and we can begin to see some real smarts emerging from well managed distributed resource power grid.
One big reason these VPPs exist is that distributed power grid assets were bought as part of a grassroots energy movement. Homeowners and business owners who paid for energy storage in their garages and businesses are directly improving grid reliability. The killer innovation is in using software to use these assets in a way that maximizes electricity savings and grid stability for everyone connected to the grid.
Research by Vibrant Energy projects that integrating the privately owned 250 GW of distributed solar and 4 TWh of distributed energy storage could save over $470 billion in general electricity costs. Those savings are delivered to all ratepayers and not just those who invest in the assets themselves. By the way, $120 billion of those savings would go to California alone.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/23/sandia-researchers-develop-new-grid-scale-energy-storage-battery/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 23, 2021",Sandia researchers develop new grid-scale energy storage battery,"Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories have designed a new class of molten sodium batteries for grid-scale energy storage.
Molten sodium batteries store energy from renewable sources. However, commercially available versions, called sodium-sulfur batteries, typically operate at 520-660 degrees Fahrenheit. Sandia’s new molten sodium-iodide battery operates at 230 degrees Fahrenheit instead.
Researchers said that “a whole cascading cost savings” comes along with lowering the battery temperature. For example, less expensive materials may be used, the batteries need less insulation, and the wiring that connects the batteries can be thinner.
But battery chemistry that works at 550 degrees doesn’t work at 230 degrees. Among the innovations that allowed this lower operating temperature was development of a catholyte, a liquid mixture of two salts; in this case, sodium iodide and gallium chloride.
A basic lead-acid battery, commonly used as a car ignition battery, has a lead plate and a lead dioxide plate with a sulfuric acid electrolyte in the middle. As energy is discharged from the battery, the lead plate reacts with sulfuric acid to form lead sulfate and electrons. These electrons start the car and return to the other side of the battery, where the lead dioxide plate uses the electrons and sulfuric acid to form lead sulfate and water.
For the new molten sodium battery, the lead plate is replaced by liquid sodium metal, and the lead dioxide plate is replaced by a liquid mixture of sodium iodide and a small amount of gallium chloride.
When energy is discharged from the new battery, the sodium metal produces sodium ions and electrons. On the other side, the electrons turn iodine into iodide ions. The sodium ions move across a separator to the other side where they react with the iodide ions to form molten sodium iodide salt.
It will likely take five to 10 years to get the sodium-iodide batteries to market.

Unlike a lithium ion battery, everything is liquid on the two sides, the researchers said. That eliminates issues like the material undergoing complex phase changes or falling apart. And that means the liquid-based batteries don’t have as limited a lifetime as many other batteries.
Additionally, at 3.6V, the new sodium-iodide battery has a 40% higher operating voltage than a commercial molten sodium battery, the researchers said. This voltage leads to higher energy density, meaning that potential future batteries made with this chemistry would need fewer cells, fewer connections between cells ,and an overall lower unit cost to store the same amount of electricity.
The next step for the sodium-iodide battery project is to continue to tune and refine the catholyte chemistry to replace the gallium chloride component, Small said. Gallium chloride is expensive, more than 100 times as expensive as table salt.
The team is also working on engineering tweaks to get the battery to charge and discharge faster and more fully. One previously identified modification to speed up the battery charging was to coat the molten sodium side of the ceramic separator with a thin layer of tin.
The researchers said it would likely take five to 10 years to get sodium-iodide batteries to market, with most of the remaining challenges being commercialization challenges, rather than technical challenges.
Development of the new sodium battery was supported by the Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Energy Storage Program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/23/nrel-develops-interoperable-scada-protocols-for-pv-inverters/,"OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,RESEARCH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 23, 2021",NREL develops interoperable SCADA protocols for PV inverters,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have evaluated a prototype code for standard SCADA software to enable the interoperability of PV inverters with other components in the system.
This interoperable module is claimed to enable legacy inverters — which are PV inverters that are not capable of providing some or all of the grid support functions — to participate in advanced distribution management. In addition, the interoperability code reduces the cost of adding additional communication protocols by inverter manufactures. That, the researchers said, can result in cost savings to customers.
The new prototype, which the scientists described as deployable in simple embedded controllers, was developed with two different protocols: the Distributed Network Protocol 3, which is an open and optimized protocol developed for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used by energy utilities to request data from substations using pre-defined control function commands; and the International Electrotechnical Commission 61850, which is an international standard defining communication protocols for intelligent electronic devices at electrical substations.
As for the software code for the DNP3 protocol, the NREL researchers used a DNP3 source code library from the Triangle MicroWorks’s (TMW’s) software platform. That platform provides software libraries, conformance testing software, protocol gateways, and OPC drivers/translators for industry-standard communication protocols. They also used the Distribution test manager, a software simulator from TMW that can simulate the DNP3 client and server.
For the IEC 61850 protocol, the scientists used IEC 61850 protocol source-code libraries, two types of software from TMW – the SCL Navigator and the Test Suite Pro. The latter is a Windows application with a set of tools for IEC 61850 testing and the former is an application for creating IEC 61850 System Configuration Language (SCL) files.
The prototype was assessed through a simulation testbed. The setup runs the code in real time and uses a laptop to mimic the inverter controller actions, the researchers said.  The hardware setup uses an sbRIO inverter controller that was developed in the Additively Manufactured Photovoltaic Inverter (AMPVI).
The research team, with the support of experts from TMW, identified a translator that is able to exchange data between the IEC server and the DNP3 client inside the embedded controller. The protocol translation module contains the mapping points to exchange information from IEC 61850 to DNP3. “The advantage of the developed module is that it can accept different mapping files,” they said.
The group also created two different sets of codes. The first code can be used directly to enable the IEC 61850 server on a PV inverter. The second code converts the data from the IEC 61850 client, initiates communication with a DNP3 client, and exchanges information with a DNP3 server through the DNP3 client. According to the scientists, these codes enable utilities to “seamlessly” communicate to IEC 61850 and DNP3 distributed energy resources.
The standard SCADA software code was presented in the paper Enabling Interoperable SCADA Communications for PV Inverters through Embedded Controllers.
