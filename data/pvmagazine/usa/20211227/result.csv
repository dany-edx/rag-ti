MacBeth Solar and Lyons Road Solar are located in Muskegon County, north of Grand Rapids, and Shiawassee County, west of Flint, respectively. Both projects are now under construction and are anticipated to achieve commercial operation in early 2022. Each project has a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with with Consumers Energy, through which they will deliver enough energy to power approximately 6,300 homes annually.
Irradiant worked with U.S. Bank, which provided the tax equity, and KeyBank, which provided the construction and permanent financing for Macbeth Solar and Lyons Road Solar.
Prior to Macbeth and Lyons Road, in early 2020, Pine Gate and Irradiant partnered on a portfolio of 14 projects across Michigan, all of which are now operational and providing 40MW of clean energy through 20- year PPAs with Consumers Energy. In Michigan, Pine Gate and Irradiant are developing an additional 22 projects totaling more than 400MW contracted through similar 20-year bilateral agreements with Consumers Energy.
“We are thrilled to continue with our buildout of our solar footprint in Michigan,” said Managing Director of Irradiant, Alta Yen. “We look forward to completing these projects with our EPC partner Blue Ridge Power, and further progressing our Michigan pipeline.”
In November, Blue Ridge Power, an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company that houses Pine Gate’s former EPC operations was selected to build a standalone energy storage system for Logan City Light & Power (LL&P), in Logan, Utah. It is planned to be operational by late 2022, and the installation is expected to be the first of its kind in in the state upon completion.
Earlier in the year, Pine Gate completed its first storage solution in the Carolinas, the 6.9 MW/10 MWh Grissom solar and storage installation Northeast of Raleigh, North Carolina. The company currently has more 12 GWh of storage in development as stand-alone or co-located with solar projects across the country.

A majority of the additions will be large-scale solar and energy storage projects, forecast to add 62% of the total figure at 49 GW. These totals do not include capacity added by smaller-scale distributed rooftop solar project
Dependent on configuration and charging sources, both solar and now energy storage may be eligible for the federal Investment Tax Credit, which is scheduled to phase down by 2024. The credit was extended to 26% in 2021 and 2022, will step down to 22% in 2023 before falling to 10% in 2024 onward.

Utility-scale solar is expected to add 49% (38 GW) of capacity. Since 2020, the sector has added more capacity (19 GW) than wind (11 GW), and that trend is expected to continue. In 2022, solar PV is forecast to add 21 GW to the grid, and wind is pegged for 16 GW.
Battery storage is set for big gains as well, with EIA estimating 10 GW capacity to be added over two years. Over 60% of this capacity is expected to be co-located with solar PV projects. Battery growth is expected to grow 300% from 2020 through 2021, with 1.5 GW installed last year, and an estimated 4.5 GW this year. Falling battery prices, favorable economics when deployed with solar, and value-adders like grid flexibility and resilience services are driving this growth, said EIA.
Three states comprise more than 52% of the 49 GW of solar + storage expected to come online in the next two years. California leads the way with 11 GW, followed by Texas with 10 GW, and New York with 4 GW.

Trends in PV manufacturing this year have proven that large format solar modules are here to stay. Since 2019, when PV wafer manufacturers began to introduce larger formats to the market, there has been much debate over the ideal size for a cell or module. This year has seen virtually all major PV manufacturers adopt either the 182mm or 210mm formats. While the debate continues over which of these offers the biggest advantage, it is now unlikely that we will see a shift back to anything smaller in mainstream production.
The first installations featuring modules based on either of the new cell formats have been completed, test installations are underway – and the backers of both formats claim an energy yield advantage in the field. Since it requires fewer changes and therefore lower risk in system design, the 182mm format looks to have the largest share for now. Standards are emerging, which should make things easier on the system and component design side. And analysts expect to see the 210mm format become more widely accepted further into the current decade.
Aside from the format switch, n-type technologies have been the other big news on the PV manufacturing side. Tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) and heterojunction (HJT) have waited in the wings for the past few years, and will still only represent a small chunk of the market in 2021. Major commitments from the biggest PV cell and module manufacturers, however, mean that major market growth for n-type is all but assured in the next few years. And initially at least, TOPCon looks to be the more cost effective of the two main n-type technologies, particularly for those manufacturers already operating large PERC manufacturing lines – which can be adapted to TOPCon, while heterojunction will require an all-new cell production line and a considerably higher investment cost.
Installations of ground and rooftop-mounted PV modules will still be the norm for solar; however, the past year has also seen big steps in the technology carving out new niches for itself. Promising and practical developments in agrivoltaics, building-integrated PV, floating PV and many more all point to the promise of integrating solar into our existing environments, and the direction the future could take.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/27/washington-looks-to-re-establish-rooftop-solar-incentive-program/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,WASHINGTON",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 27, 2021",Washington looks to re-establish rooftop solar incentive program,"From 2017 to 2018, Washington State ran a rooftop solar incentive program which provided $110 million to customers who completed residential and commercial solar energy installations, leading to the installation of nearly 7,500 residential energy systems, 380 commercial energy systems, and more than 100 MW of solar capacity.
In 2018, the $110 million allotted was spent, and the initiative, which was deemed to be a smashing success for bringing more solar to the grid and increasing access for thousands of Washingtonians, was phased out.
Three years after that phasing, Washington Senator Jeff Wilson looks to re-establish that solar incentive program by introducing Senate Bill 5493 in the state’s upcoming legislative session.
Like the original legislation, the incentive program would be administered by Washington State University’s (WSU) Energy Program. It would focus on encouraging residents to add solar or upgrade their existing solar installations, though the program could cover any renewable energy work.
Rather than provide an upfront credit, customers who put solar on their home or business, or who decide to organize a rooftop community solar project, must buy the components for their system and then apply to the WSU Energy Program their system’s approval. Once the project is completed and operational, the incentive will be paid each year based on the amount of power generated, with annual incentive caps.
Incentives are capped at $5,000 annually, per participant, for community solar participants, $5,000 annual for residential customers, $25,000 annually for individual commercial system owners, and up to $35,000 per owner, annually, for commercial installations with multiple owners.
If the bill passes the legislature, it will take effect on July 1. Customers with existing incentivized systems would remain on their existing payment plan at their current rates. Customers who choose to retrofit an existing system with additional panels would be issued a new incentive rate, but would still be on the same payment timeline and phase-out date of their original installation.
In his climate and energy budget proposal, released earlier this month, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee outlined $100 million for solar installation and energy storage grants. The focus of those grants would be supporting government agencies and municipalities.
Each proposition looks to propel Washington towards its goal of requiring the state to adopt 100% carbon-free power by 2045, as well as phasing out coal by 2025 and requiring all electricity sales to be carbon-neutral by 2030. This portfolio standard was passed by the legislature and signed by Inslee in 2019.

Thirty minutes later Webb’s fold-out solar array deployed and activated.
The world’s most powerful telescope, set to study phenomena like the formation of planets, and the age and extent of the universe, uses less power than one might think. In fact, only one kilowatt, equivalent to the power use of microwaving your lunch, is needed to power the device.
Webb will stay energy-efficient more than 1 million miles from Earth, said NASA.
The 20-foot solar array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the ‘powerhouse’ for the telescope, supplying energy to all its scientific instruments, communications, and propulsion systems. Though the telescope only needs 1 kW to perform, the array generates twice that much to factor in the degradation caused by the harsh conditions of space.
The array consists of five panels that are connected by hinges for folding into the launch vehicle, the Ariane 5 rocket. The telescope’s onboard battery was designed to only last a few hours, so the unfolding and activation of the array was considered one of the most critical early steps of the telescope’s voyage.
This post was updated to change the featured video to a capture of the live deployment rather than a model demonstration.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/27/enphase-energy-starts-shipping-iq8-microinverters-in-north-america/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,NORTH AMERICA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 27, 2021",Enphase Energy starts shipping IQ8 microinverters in North America,"The Enphase IQ8 has started production shipments in North America. The IQ8 claim to fame is that it is capable of forming a microgrid during a power outage, providing backup power even without a battery. How does that happen?  The IQ8 can limit energy capture to just what the home is consuming, so in the event that the grid suffers a power failure, a proprietary, intelligent chip within the IQ8 will seamlessly switch between on or off grid.
Read “Enphase going Einstein with IQ8 solar power inverters“.
“We began piloting the product in the third quarter of 2021 with select installers and the feedback has been great. Homeowners not only get backup power with sunlight, but also have the flexibility to add more solar or batteries in the future as their needs change,” said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO of Enphase Energy.
The Enphase Energy System with IQ8 comes in four different configurations: “Solar Only”; “Sunlight Backup” with no battery and the addition of IQ Load Controller to only support essential loads during an outage; “Home Essentials Backup” with a small battery; and “Full Energy Independence” with a large battery. While the first configuration is a standard grid-tied system, the remaining configurations are grid-agnostic systems that need the Enphase IQ System Controller 2 (formerly called Enpower smart switch) to island the home during an outage.
“After installing IQ8 it’s clear that this technology could be a breakthrough moment for reliable home solar power,” said Mike Teresso, president of Baker Electric Home Energy, an Enphase Energy installer partner based in California.
The IQ8 family includes five types of software-defined microinverters, IQ8, IQ8+, IQ8M, IQ8A, and IQ8H, with peak output AC power of 245VA, 300VA, 330VA, 366VA, and 384VA, respectively. Enphase reports that the IQ8H microinverter is its most powerful microinverter to date and has a California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency of 97%. The multiple types of IQ8 enable seamless pairing with a full range of solar modules, up to 540W DC.
While IQ8 pilot installations began in the third quarter of 2021 with select installer partners, production shipments for Enphase’s broader network of distributor and installer partners in North America started last week.

Today, Meyer Burger announced that it is establishing a production site for high-performance solar modules in Goodyear, Arizona.
Initial annual production capacity is expected to be 400 MW by the end of 2022, with the potential to scale to 1.5 gigawatts (GW) capacity in the future. At full 1.5 GW potential capacity, the facility will provide over 500 skilled manufacturing jobs
“Meyer Burger is thrilled to be establishing roots in Arizona and expanding our footprint to the United States,” said CEO Gunter Erfurt. “My sincere thanks to our partners in Arizona for their support throughout this process. Solar energy will be critical to achieving U.S. and global clean energy goals, and our proprietary heterojunction cell technology and patented SmartWire module technology enable us to produce products of the highest quality and performance in order to offer our customers economically competitive solar components.”
Initial production capabilities will enable the company to manufacture solar modules for residential, commercial/industrial rooftop, and utility-scale applications. Production is expected to be operational by the end of 2022. Meyer Burger has entered into a lease as the first tenant of a recently constructed new building at market conditions.
Long known as a manufacturer of PV production equipment, Meyer Burger pivoted in the summer of 2020 to producing machines for heterojunction, smartwire manufacturing exclusively for its own use. At the same time the company announced that it would no longer supply its technology to third parties and discontinued its partnership with REC Group.
“We are thrilled Meyer Burger has chosen Goodyear for their first manufacturing facility in the U.S.,” said Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. “The company’s new solar module manufacturing facility will further enhance Arizona’s standout reputation as a renewable energy leader”
Meyer Burger has begun hiring key personnel to support installation of equipment and initial startup of the facility. The company intends to continue hiring through 2022 in order to train personnel and ramp production quickly.
