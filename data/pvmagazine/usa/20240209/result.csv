The rule, known as net metering, requires utilities to compensate solar owners for sending local, emissions-free energy to the grid. 
The coalition, which included Environmental Working Group and NC Warn, argued that state regulators violated House Bill 589, passed in 2017, which mandates the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) to perform a cost-benefit analysis of solar net metering. 
“Duke Energy leaders are clearly determined to destroy the competition posed by customer-owned, local solar,” said Jim Warren, director, NC Warn. 
Under Duke’s plan, which was enacted on October 1, net metering credit rates are cut from a value ranging between $0.05 per kWh and $0.20 per kWh to a low rate of only $0.03 per kWh. This damages the value of rooftop solar for North Carolina residents, making it harder for them to invest in emissions-free electricity generation, despite state goals to boost clean energy access. 
The rate case also enforces minimum bills on solar customers of $22 to $28 per month, even if 100% of their electricity demand is met by their own solar array’s production. 
Attorney Matthew Quinn argued in the court of appeals that savings for customers in North Carolina would drop as much as 31% under the new program. The commission’s public staff office calculated that a rooftop solar customer’s electric bill would increase between 16.5% and 118% under the appealed ruling, said Quinn. 
North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein argued that the 2017 House Bill 589 mandates that the NCUC conduct an independent analysis of net metering rates, performing a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. Depsite this, Duke Energy opposed requests for a commission-led study, and instead regulators were left with exclusively using internal Duke Energy data and calculations to assess net metering. 
Environmental and public interest groups argue the internal Duke calculations largely ignored any benefit of net metering or rooftop solar access. 
“Can Duke investigate itself? The commission’s legal conclusion was: ‘Duke, you are permitted to investigate yourself.’ Now, our position is that can’t possibly be what the statute means,” said Quinn. 
Appeals Judge Toby Hampson agreed the NCUC’s use of Duke’s internal cost-benefit analysis was a questionable path toward meeting its obligation to review net metering under the 2017 law. 
“Surely the utility can submit information, an analysis, an investigation that says here’s why we think we meet the costs/benefits analysis. But isn’t it the obligation of the commission, then, to actually undertake a review?” said Judge Hampson. 
The Appeals Court is expected to release a decision in the coming months. The hearing was streamed on YouTube and can be viewed here.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/09/publicly-traded-solar-installer-sunworks-files-for-bankruptcy/,"BANKRUPTCY,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-09,Publicly traded solar installer Sunworks files for bankruptcy,"Solar installer Sunworks (SUNW) has filed for bankruptcy with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), submitting an 8-K filing on February 5, 2024.
The company has been in business for over 20 years, installing over 27,405 solar installations, adding over 224 MW of distributed solar energy to the grid nationwide. The company operates in major rooftop solar markets including California, Texas, the Southwest, the Carolinas, Florida, and the Northeast.
Under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a trustee will be appointed to liquidate the company’s assets and settle any outstanding liabilities. Along with the bankruptcy came the resignation of chief executive officer Mar Trout, and the company’s board of directors.
The company noted a 29.5% decline in quarterly revenues year-over-year for Q3 2023. Its residential solar segment declined 44.5% over the same period, while the commercial solar segment climbed 105%. The company reported net losses of $36.5 million in the third quarter, with a loss of $0.84 per share.
Sunworks’ struggles did not happen in a vacuum. Throughout 2023, high interest rates and regulatory changes in California drastically shrunk demand by worsening the consumer economics of installing rooftop solar.
California used to represent about 50% of the United States’ rooftop solar market, but following the transition to NEM 3.0, demand and installations fell off a cliff. This led business insurer Solar Insure to warn pv magazine USA in December that 75% of its covered solar installers were at “high risk” for bankruptcy.
Also in December, publicly traded solar provider SunPower (SPWR) breached its credit agreement, causing the company to warn that it had “going concerns.”
SunPower’s stock has been battered down nearly 80% over the last year and is down 93% from its all-time highs in 2021. Earlier this month, the company received waiver extensions on debt until February 16, and the company announced the receipt of commitments for $20 million in financing from TotalEnergies and Global Infrastructure Partners.
Time will tell how residential solar installers weather the storm of a high interest rate environment. The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) warned that more bankruptcies will likely persist in Q1 and Q2, while equipment provider Enphase said that the industry is nearing the bottom trough, and that 2024 will be “a year of recovery.”

As the world embraces renewable energy resources, PV Systems hold immense promise for a sustainable energy future. However, the challenges posed by the variable nature of PV generation necessitate a reevaluation of how we approach grid infrastructure planning. The recently released IEA-PVPS Task 14 report “Active Power Management of Photovoltaic Systems – State of the Art and Technical Solutions” provides a comprehensive exploration of a paradigm shift that could redefine the landscape of distributed PV systems’ integration into the grid.
Low Capacity Factor of PV Systems is a Challenge for the Grid Infrastructure
Distributed PV systems, while largely contributing to clean energy, possess a low capacity factor (ratio of energy output to the maximum possible power output). To ensure continuous power generation, this characteristic necessitates a careful consideration of grid infrastructure, deviating from conventional approaches. Traditionally, grid infrastructure planning revolved around sizing to accommodate power peaks. However, the new PVPS Task 14 report advocates for a fundamental shift towards energy-centric grid sizing. Active power management, e.g. curtailment, and complementary measures can address some of the limitations associated with the intermittent nature of solar energy, making PV a valuable component in the transition to sustainable energy sources.
A Solution for PV Dynamics: Active Power Management (APM)
According to the new PVPS Task 14 report, the key point of addressing the challenges posed by the low capacity factor of distributed PV systems lies in the adoption of Active Power Management (APM). APM, in some contexts also called curtailment, acts as a dynamic control mechanism that actively manages the power flow from decentralized assets to the grid to ensure it remains within operational limits. Unlike passive grid systems that react to fluctuations, APM introduces proactiveness by shaping the power flow based on real-time conditions. This helps to relieve the grid from high power peaks and thus protect them. By combining APM with other grid optimization measures the value of PV-generated energy increases.
Use Cases for APM
APM and, consequently, PV power curtailment becomes necessary in various scenarios. Common reasons for implementing PV curtailment include:
New Opportunities with APM
One of the primary benefits of APM is the enhancement of grid stability. Of all electrical power sources, PV systems have the lowest capacity factor. To reach the goal of a sustainable energy supply large quantities of PV systems must be connected to the grid and limiting power peaks can reduce stress on the power grid. Whilst traditional grid systems struggle to accommodate the rapid fluctuations in power output from PV systems, APM addresses this challenge by intelligently managing power injections and absorptions, ensuring a stable grid environment even during periods of high variability. When the power peaks are not fed into the grid, surplus electricity can be stored or used for less efficient applications. Using APM, the feed-in can be dynamically ramped up and down.
From an ecological standpoint, it may be advantageous to prioritize the construction of additional photovoltaic systems and operate them in curtailed mode rather than expanding grid infrastructure, given the minimal ecological footprint of PV modules.
Furthermore, as the IEA-PVPS Task 16 study “Firm Power Generation” has previously shown, accepting a certain amount of energy loss by curtailment is also cheaper than installing less PV but adding seasonal storage to the system. However, curtailment is not a goal but rather one method for increasing the utilization of power grids without exceeding their physical limits. It should only be the last option if the PV energy cannot be used elsewhere.
Minimizing Energy Loss
From an energy and environmental perspective, energy loss through curtailment should be limited. Therefore the IEA-PVPS Task 14 report emphasizes the importance of combining APM with complementary measures (see Fig. 1). The goal should be to establish a holistic and synergistic approach to grid management.
Grid measures involve upgrading the physical infrastructure to increase the power capacity of the grid. This may include reactive power control, tap changing transformers or grid reinforcement.
When combined with APM, these enhancements create a grid system that is both intelligent and robust. However, reinforcing the grid becomes redundant if there is insufficient consumption during the production period. It might therefore be essential to shift the load from periods of low production, such as nighttime for PV, to periods of high production. Hence, aligning demand and generation becomes imperative in scenarios with increasing penetration.
Integrating energy storage solutions, such as batteries, into the grid architecture further complements APM efforts. Energy storage serves as a buffer, capturing excess energy during periods of high generation and releasing it during peak demand. This synergy ensures that energy is utilized optimally, reducing wastage and enhancing overall system efficiency.
Proactive Measures for a Sustainable Future
The IEA-PVPS Task 14 report calls for Distributed System Operators (DSOs) to adopt a proactive stance in the face of evolving energy dynamics. Especially in the realm of distributed PV, where energy generation occurs closer to consumption points, DSOs are encouraged to explore and implement APM strategies.
The traditional approach of relying solely on grid expansion to meet increasing energy demands may fall short in the face of the dynamic nature of PV systems. Embracing APM aligns with the evolving needs of a modern and sustainable energy landscape. By actively managing power flows, DSOs can ensure the efficient integration of distributed PV systems, transforming them from potential challenges to invaluable assets for a resilient and efficient energy future.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/09/stormy-january-impacts-irradiance-across-north-america/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESEARCH,NORTH AMERICA",,2024-02-09,Stormy January impacts irradiance across North America,"From pv magazine global
Most of North America saw irradiance below average, primarily due to the stormy conditions that prevailed during the second half of January, according to data analyzed by Solcast via the Solcast API. Despite a cold and dry start in the north, low pressure over the Pacific drove moisture across the West Coast, delivering below-average irradiance. Humidity in the Gulf led to cloud and rain over Florida, but left a wide strip of clear dry conditions and high irradiance from Mexico to the Carolinas.
In January, northern latitudes typically receive the lowest monthly irradiance they will all year, due to short days and the sun being low in the sky, as well as winter storm fronts. This means that in locations further north even large increases relative to the average, might be low in terms of daily irradiance received or power generated by solar assets.

The early days of January were dominated by a polar vortex that brought a surge of cold air across the North Western region, pushed by a high-pressure system in the Pacific. This caused Vancouver’s record-breaking low temperature, with morning lows down to -16 C. On the other side of the continent, a similar low-pressure system led to cold and dry conditions in the North Eastern tip of the continent.
Mid-month, a sudden shift brought about by a deep low-pressure system north of Hawaii reversed the patterns earlier in the month, driving moisture and cloud from the Pacific onto the West Coast. This pattern prevailed, leading to the lower-than-average irradiance seen in the total monthly results. Just a few weeks after the record low, Vancouver saw record January high temperatures at 14.3 C.

From Baja to the Carolinas, there was a band of higher-than-normal irradiance. Other than Florida, the Gulf Coast received irradiance 10 to 20% above average for January. A stream of humidity across Central America led to rain and cloud across Florida and the Caribbean. This pattern also led to the drier conditions further north.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.

NYPA is requesting competitively priced proposals from developers, due by March 5.
The proposals should include design, development, construction, installation, financing as well as ownership, operation and maintenance of the solar project for the SUNY Oneonta. Proposals must demonstrate past success in these areas. NYPA encourages submissions to incorporate a battery energy BESS where possible, allowing energy to be stored when demand is low and used at a later time.
Evaluation criteria for the proposals will include price, technical competency, technical approach, strength of management team, financing availability and financial strength, risk analysis, and schedule for project delivery and completion.
“We’re excited to begin the planning process for the campus’ first on-site solar array. This project moves us closer to fulfilling one of the key elements of our Clean Energy Master Plan: reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. We’re looking forward to partnering with the New York Power Authority on this important initiative,” said Alberto J.F. Cardelle, SUNY Oneonta president.
The preliminary assessment has identified two sites on Ravine Parkway, one of which would host a 3 MW ground-mounted system on 60 acres of open area about a mile from the college. The second site would have a 2.2 MW ground-mounted system on a 7.5-acre parcel accessible from West Street. Developers are invited to participate in a walk-through at the site on Feb. 12.
Separately, SUNY Oneonta expects to participate in a grant-funded long-duration energy storage (LDES) project that will demonstrate a non-lithium-ion BESS technology on campus, behind-the-meter, in long-duration applications. The intent is to demonstrate the technology’s capabilities under various use cases to advance the product towards full-scale commercialization. To the extent possible, the vendor shall coordinate the solar or solar-plus-storage system with the planned LDES project. Details of the LDES project will be provided to the developer as they become available.
SUNY Oneonta recently completed its Clean Energy Master Plan that supports meeting the carbon reduction goals of the campus. The university is also subject to New York State Mandates and SUNY System Administration and State University Construction Fund Directives associated with energy and carbon reduction targets that include a goal of being carbon free by 2040.
Proposals are due March 5. For more information and to review the RFP, access NYPA’s Procurement site here.
