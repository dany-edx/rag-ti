In 2022, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 2.4 million MWh of solar and wind generation. Solar accounts for 95% of that total.
As intermittent solar generation increases, a lack of available transmission infrastructure or energy storage capacity is causing temporary gluts of generation. Curtailment occurs either when there is congestion, when power lines don’t have enough capacity to deliver the power, or during oversupply, when electricity generation exceeds customer demand.
In California, curtailment is largely a result of congestion, said EIA. Congestion-related curtailments have been steadily on the rise since 2019 as solar generation additions outpace transmission and storage additions.
CAISO tends to curtail solar the most in the spring when electricity demand is generally low due to moderate temperatures and production is relatively high due to sunnier conditions.
Three solutions
The system operator is working on a few solutions to the curtailment problem. One pathway to alleviate curtailment is to participate in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM), a real-time market that allows participants outside CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance supply and demand. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading in this market, said EIA. A day-ahead market is expected to be added to WEIM in Spring 2025.
CAISO is also expanding transmission capacity to alleviate congestion. Its 2022-2023 transmission planning report outlines 45 projects to accommodate a growing share of renewables. The look-ahead plan is adding significant capacity to meet the 40 GW of generation capacity expected to be added to the system over the next ten years.
As a third method, CAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can respond to demand. The state currently has 4.6 GW of battery energy storage, and developers plan to add 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, based on EIA data.
Duck curve
Another way to understand the effect of intermittent renewables on traditional centralized transmission grid operation is via the “duck curve” model.
The phenomenon of the “duck curve” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation (mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand (late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.
The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.
The EIA shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “duck curve” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to balance the grid.
The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.
However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.
“The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets,” said EIA. “Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’s neck.”
Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive. 
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.

The transaction, expected to take place in Q4, would result in a separation by Flex from its ownership in Nextracker.
Nextracker plans to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that includes a preliminary proxy statement of Flex, which will include additional information regarding the spin-off. The separation from Flex is currently expected to close in fiscal Q4 ending March 31, 2024, but remains subject to a number of conditions, and no assurance can be given that the spin-off will in fact occur.
Flex helped us considerably in maturing our business processes and supporting our expansion into emerging markets, especially in our early years as a young company,” said Dan Shugar, Nextracker founder and chief executive officer. “We are energized to start our next chapter.”
Earnings
Nextracker also released its fiscal Q2 quarterly earnings on October 25, showing growth in-quarter and strong earnings guidance for the “next chapter” of 2024.
For Q2 fiscal year 2024, revenue was $573 million, up 23% year-over-year. GAAP net income totaled $81 million, while earnings per share was $0.55. Adjusted EBITDA reached $110 million, rising 164% year-over-year.
“We closed our third consecutive quarter of growth year-over-year, as a public company, and it was our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion on a sequential basis,” said Shugar. “With a record first half and our anticipation of a strong second half of the fiscal year, we have raised our annual profit guidance and the mid-point of our annual revenue guidance.”
The company raised its mid-point Fiscal Year 2024 revenue range as a result of strong performance. The company now expects revenues to range $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. It raised GAAP net income expectations to $237 million to $266 million (raised from previous expectations of $176 million to $205 million. GAAP earnings per share guidance was substantially raised from a range of $1.45 to $1.65 to $1.95 to $2.15.
Nextracker said the quarter was defined by global supply chain repositioning and capacity expansions and product innovation with the next generation of its technology suite. The company launched three new products, including:
“We are well-positioned with our global scale and growth profile, and we are excited to pursue the market opportunities ahead,” said Shugar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/31/54500-gw-miles-of-within-region-transmission-needed-for-a-clean-grid-says-doe/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 31, 2023","54,500 GW-miles of within-region transmission needed for a clean grid, says DOE","The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Transmission Needs Study has found that the U.S. will need to add 54.5 TW-miles of within-region transmission by 2035 under future scenarios with moderate load but high clean energy assumptions. Those scenarios are “the most likely power sector future given recently enacted laws,” the DOE study says.
Interregional transfer capacities to transmit electricity between regions would need to increase by nearly 125 GW by 2035 for the same scenarios.
In a high-load scenario that could result from high electrification of transportation and heating, much more regional transmission and interregional transfer capacity would be needed. The study projects transmission needs for each of 13 regions of the continental U.S.
The study also found an “immediate need” for more transmission infrastructure, evidenced by delays and increased costs to interconnect new utility-scale generators, and by price differences for wholesale electricity across geographic locations. Those price differences indicate transmission congestion within a region or transmission constraints across regions.
The results for 2035 reflect DOE’s analysis of studies of the U.S. grid conducted by others using least-cost optimization modeling. While the needs study does not identify specific solutions for assessed transmission needs, a DOE spokesperson said that a separate DOE study, the National Transmission Planning Study, will identify potential transmission solutions to meet near- and long-term (through 2050) transmission needs.
A draft of that planning study found that transmission is needed to carry wind power from the central U.S. eastward. The planning study, led by two DOE national laboratories, is using “both national laboratory and industry tools” to conduct new modeling and analysis, said the spokesperson, adding that DOE will provide a status update on the planning study in the next few months.
DOE’s newly released study considers five “alternative transmission solutions” that can help meet transmission needs: energy storage; high penetrations of distributed energy resources; grid-enhancing technologies; advanced conductors and cables; and microgrids. Flexible demand, a strategy being pursued by California to balance renewables, is mentioned as an alternative transmission solution for rural Alaskan villages.
The needs study says that results from the study can inform DOE’s work to implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, and to implement the Department’s funding programs, technical assistance and broader transmission planning activities.
The study will also support DOE’s potential designation of National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors.
DOE expects that the needs study will also help inform existing industry-led transmission planning processes, including the regional transmission planning processes conducted in accordance with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations and policies.
Included is a section focusing on transmission benefits. An appendix synthesizes comments received on the draft version of the study and their resolution by DOE. Another appendix of national and regional fact sheets summarizes the study’s findings.
DOE is offering an overview of the transmission needs study’s findings in a webinar on November 8.

In California in particular, the demand is driven by California’s 2020 Solar Mandate that requires all newly built homes to install solar photovoltaic systems.
Four home construction firms– Beazer Homes, CC Homes, Meritage Homes and Toll Brothers—have contracted with SunPower to install Equinox solar systems on nearly 1,000 homes in eight states.
The SunPower Equinox system, which has been sold since 2016, features all SunPower-made products from the panels to the microinverters to the racking system to the monitoring hardware and software.
“Forward-thinking builders who incorporate a renewable infrastructure from day one can reduce the cost of homeownership, provide a shield against rising energy bills and positively address climate change,” said Matt Brost, vice president of New Homes sales for SunPower.
Meritage Homes began installing SunPower systems on California homes but will soon begin including solar as a standard feature on single-family homes and townhomes across the greater Denver area.
Toll Brothers, Inc. expanded its national agreement with SunPower to include not only California, but now Nevada, New York and Massachusetts.
Beazer Homes plans to add SunPower solar to 125 homes across Maryland and Delaware including the Chase Oaks development in Lewes, Delaware and all future homes built at Holly Farms in Parkville, Maryland. SunPower reports that all the homes in these communities will be certified by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as a DOE Zero Energy Ready Home. Beazer Homes has committed to ensuring that by the end of 2025 every home they build will meet the requirements of the DOE Zero Energy Ready Home program.
For a home to achieve DOE Zero Energy Ready Home status it must meet rigorous efficiency and performance requirements including generating enough energy to offset the home’s use. Most types of new homes in the U.S. are eligible to participate in the program, and the homes are verified by a qualified third-party as part of the certification process.
“Our collaboration with SunPower Solar will provide additional energy cost savings and bring Beazer homeowners one step closer to realizing net zero energy usage,” says Chance Hall, division president for Beazer Homes in Maryland.
CC Homes is now offering SunPower’s solar systems to all homeowners in their communities in South Florida. The collaboration is expected to retrofit hundreds of households within CC Homes’ communities with SunPower’s solar panels, along with equipping new construction with solar.

The consortium acquiring the business includes Greenbacker Capital Management, Sunstone Credit, IGS Ventures, and secured lender Cross River Bank. Collectively, they operate as ED Umbrella Holdings, LLC and have entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement.

To expedite its bankruptcy proceedings, Sunlight Financial sought a fast-tracked Chapter 11 process. A company press release assures trade creditors, suppliers, contractors, and employees that they can expect full payment without delays.
The consortium plans to inject substantial new capital into Sunlight Financial and continue originating residential loans. The objective of the investment is to “re-establish the Company’s position as the pre-eminent platform for residential solar and home improvement finance solutions.”
Details surrounding the bankruptcy were made public on the morning of October 31, 2023, and are accessible via the Sunlight Financial investor relations webpage.
Financial troubles for the company first emerged in August with the filing of 10-Q financial documents. These records highlighted Sunlight Financial’s struggle to maintain operations, casting doubt on its viability as a “going concern,” primarily due to challenges in obtaining new loan funding.
The crux of the problem lies in the company’s delayed response to rising interest rates, which the Federal Reserve increased to over 5% from near zero. This adversely affected the company’s core business of developing residential solar loans and selling them to investors, making such transactions financially unviable and causing a sharp decline in revenue and income. 

Weeks later, as the stock price continued to fall, the company implemented a 10-to-1 reverse stock split to maintain a share price above $1 and ensure continued listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/31/how-the-ira-is-changing-the-u-s-solar-manufacturing-landscape/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 31, 2023",How the IRA is changing the U.S. solar manufacturing landscape,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is dedicated to supporting renewable energy build out. Now just over a year later, the build out has begun. At RoundtablesUS 23, pv magazine USA spoke with four experts in solar manufacturing to discuss U.S.  solar manufacturing, potential supply chain gaps, uncertainties around domestic content, guidance and more.
Panelists included Mark Delaney, senior vice president of global sourcing at Invenergy LLC;  Eli Hinkley, a partner in Baker Botts, Washington DC office;  Christian Roselund, who leads policy research and communication at Clean Energy Associates (CEA); and MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing for the American Clean Power Association.

Setting the stage for the discussion of U.S. solar manufacturing, Christian Roselund said that CEA is tracking 120 GW of crystalline silicon module announcements, which does not count thin film. He said that in addition, CEA is expecting First Solar’s U.S. thin film module manufacturing capacity to expand from 6 GW to 15 GW in the United States by the year end 2027. From that 120 GW of module announcements and around 70 GW of crystalline silicon cell announcements, CEA is expecting only 50 GW of module capacity and 18 GW of cell capacity by year end 27, or about 40% of the module capacity and about a quarter of the cell capacity for ingot and wafer.
When asked how many cell and module factories are under construction, Roselund admitted that it’s tough to know for sure, but one indication is to look at the factories for which production equipment has been delivered. Right now there are seven new module factories with production tools being put in place, but there is no record yet of any cell factories being equipped with production tools, he said.
Continued reliance on imports
Understanding that it will take some time for U.S. cell and module manufacturers to ramp up and begin delivering product, a looming question is where the product will come from in the meantime. MJ Shiao suggested that we look at two scenarios. One is what we think will happen or what will happen in a business-as-usual way. And the other is what we think should happen with the supply chain. He referred to Roselund’s CEA summary, which expects the U.S. to be heavy with downstream solar manufacturing, and we’ll have to continue to rely on imports from foreign partners for polysilicon, ingots and wafers to the U.S. Shiao noted that we can do that, but that we should also look at the opportunity to build out a supply chain for new energy. “We certainly have done that with traditional energy sources,” he said, adding that we have a lot of catching up to do.
While the demand for U.S.-made solar grows it’s more necessary than ever to have patience, because growing a supply chain takes time. Shiao estimated that it can take from three to five years to build new polysilicon manufacturing, for example. One challenge for the manufacturers, however, is that the clock is ticking on the credits offered in the IRA. By the time a new polysilicon plant gets built, he said, they’re already halfway through the incentive period and the credit continues to step down.
Modules first
The first step is to concentrate on building manufacturing facilities to meet the downstream demand, ensuring that we have the demand, and start filling the demand in terms of executing on these module facilities, Shiao advised. He emphasized that we need to make sure we have a core set of competitive, stable module manufacturers, and then start to look for more of the upstream part of the supply chain for ourselves.
Filling in the gaps in the supply chain, however, is a tall task right now, but not insurmountable. Over 95% of production capacities of ingots and wafers are centered in China. While over-reliance on any one geographical area is not wise in general, we also have the tariffs that resulted from the Auxin investigation. And then we have the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) that aims to prohibit goods from being imported into the U.S. that are manufactured with forced labor in the People’s Republic of China, especially in the Xinjiang region.
The concern now is whether non-China polysilicon capacity will actually be enough to source long term to fulfill U.S. capacity needs going forward. According to Shiao, the American solar industry has to think of ways to give more market certainty and provide a better economic environment for non-Chinese polysilicon producers to expand.
The U.S. as an exporter
With the understanding that the build-out of U.S. solar manufacturing will take several years, Mark Delaney noted that it’s going to take more than the IRA’s 10-year window to get to the point where the U.S. is not dependent on other countries. He pointed out that, while we don’t want to be beholden to any one geographical area, that notion works both ways. Delaney said that, for example, “the companies that are making heavy capital investments in U.S. manufacturing are going to want exportation opportunities in the event of softness in the U.S. market at a particular time.” He added that he thinks the U.S. solar market is also going to want to continue to rely on importation in case we have a year of very high demand that can’t be met through U.S. made capacity.
The solar industry is known for changing market conditions, which Roselund pointed out creates a big risk for manufacturers to take.
“I think this is part of the unanticipated and unappreciated dangers of trying to sort of ring-fence off the U.S. market from the rest of the global supply,” said Roselund.
In the past decade or more, the U.S. has used tariffs as a method of spurring domestic manufacturing. Shiao pointed out that this approach increases the cost price of serving the U.S. market. What happens, Shiao said is that the competitors that are able to build and sell into that market have a higher cost structure and they’re not competitive outside of the U.S. market.
“What we need to do is to build through a combination of investment incentives, trying to take more control the supply chain, the IP itself and where the technology is headed,” Shiao said. “Build and encourage more competitive manufacturing in the U.S. that can also be competitive outside of the U.S. in order to have a sustainable manufacturing landscape.”
Carrots and sticks
A continued supportive environment is key to building out the domestic supply chain. Roselund said the IRA is just that.
“The IRA is a sea change in that we’re using industrial policy for the first time. Words that were not even spoken in DC, five, six years ago, “ said Roselund. “We’re suddenly talking about using industrial policy to provide carrots and not just sticks to do things in the United States, because the record of sticks in the form of trade barriers, did not result in significant additional U.S. manufacturing capacity.”
According to Hinckley, the tariffs are having an effect because both a carrot and a stick are necessary to drive U.S. manufacturing. Tariffs push up the cost of imported products and gives U.S. manufacturers an opportunity to become competitive with their domestically sourced products.
“Then if you can subsidize that domestic product, presumably underneath that price point, you break things down,” Hinckley said.
Coming to America
For a manufacturer looking to set up shop in the U.S., Hinckley advises that the first step is to identify a geography that makes sense from a cost structure standpoint for each product. And then from a logistics standpoint, manufacturing near the point of deployment makes sense. And then there’s the challenge of understanding and taking advantage of the support structure landscape.
Included in the IRA are two different advanced manufacturing tax credits. One is production based and will “catch a lot of your solar production” Hinckley said. He cautioned, however, that it’s limited. If it takes between two and five years to get a manufacturing facility up and running, the value of the tax credit diminishes pretty quickly, he warned.
The other credit is 48C, which is an investment-based credit that offers a 30% credit against the investment. However, as Hinckley noted there is a competitive application process with a limited pool of dollars.
After figuring out which way to go on tax credits, which Hinckley admitted is no simple task, the next step for manufactures is to look at other programs that can support the capital structure. This includes things like the loan guarantee program where a manufacturer can tap into lower-cost, longer-term capital that might have a little less sensitivity to price swings. Hinckley noted that one challenge here is that a manufacturer will “probably need quite a bit of scale for that program to make sense”.
The third step is being able to tap into the domestic content adders, which Hinckley called “a significant sort of bump in the value of the tax credits for the project side.”
From a developer’s point of view, qualifying for the domestic content adders is complex. For example, just looking at the module alone is complicated, according to Delaney, because a module has multiple manufactured product components or MPCs. To know whether it qualifies for adders, the developer has to add up all of the domestically produced MPCs. It also becomes significantly more difficult to meet the domestic content threshold as time goes on because that threshold increases over time.
Referring to challenges with the current guidance, Delaney said that the questions around how you can really show that something is domestic or not still needs to be ironed out. He sees this as one of the greatest impediments of building out a holistic supply chain in the U.S. He stressed the level of diligence and risk required of a purchaser in this market.
Matching opportunity and risk
Finding a way to navigate the uncertainties will help both buyers and sellers in this market, Hinckley said. “Understand that it’s going to take you some time and work to get to a place where you’ll have comfort, that you understand what your opportunity and risk matches.”
Stepping back and looking at the big picture, it’s understood that we have this dependence on China globally for certain parts of the supply chain. According to Roselund, the tools we have right now do not allow us to release our dependence on China, even though, as he noted, there’s impatience among policymakers to just move the full supply chain here. But the fact of the matter is that our dependence on China and Chinese companies in Southeast Asia will continue for the foreseeable future, and Roselund thinks that that fact needs to be taken into account when policies are made.
“Some of the policies that we’re putting in place now, instead of supporting that goal of trying to re-onshore in the United States, they’re working against it,” Roselund said. “I think that there’s a degree of nuance that I see missing in a lot of the discussions about this, not as much in this industry, but in DC.”
There is much work to be done in terms of implementing the IRA, but, as Shiao pointed out,  it’s also important to look beyond the IRA and determine how we can continue to support and encourage more domestic manufacturing.
“As an industry, we came together a year or two years ago, and we helped this government pass one of the most ambitious climate policies, tax credits and the other supports we’re talking about now,” Shiao said. “We need to continue to work together, move forward and continue that investment in this clean energy future.”
 
This article was amended to clarify that CEA is expecting First Solar’s U.S. thin film module manufacturing capacity to expand from 6 GW to 15 GW in the United States by the year end 2027, not just solar in general, as was originally implied.

The facility will be located at the utility’s DeBary solar plant in Volusia County, Florida, which currently has a 74.5 MW capacity.
Once completed, the clean energy from this facility will be routed to two 1 MW electrolyzer systems, which will split water into oxygen and green hydrogen. The hydrogen will then be transferred to reinforced containers, where it will be stored until needed. When electricity demand is especially high, the green hydrogen will be passed through a combustion turbine to convert it into power. 
The combustion turbine will be upgraded with technology from GE Vernova to run on either a blend of natural gas and hydrogen, or up to 100% hydrogen – the first turbine in the country that can get to such a high hydrogen percentage. The demonstration project will begin construction later this year and is expected to be fully operational sometime in 2024. 
Green hydrogen can play a key role in ensuring the reliability of a highly-renewable electric grid, since it serves as a “dispatchable” energy source that is available on demand. Unlike solar and wind power, it is not dependent on the time of day or weather. Moreover, using solar energy to create green hydrogen can optimize the solar plants, according to Duke Energy. 
“Relying on intermittent energy sources without available dispatchable energy sources would put our future electric system at risk of having insufficient energy to serve customer demand,” the utility said. 
Duke Energy is aiming to reduce its carbon emissions from electricity generation by 50% by 2030, and achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. As part of this, it is looking to decrease its use of coal to less than 5% of total generation by 2030, and phase out the fossil fuel entirely by 2035. 
The utility anticipates that hydrogen could play a major role in its clean energy future, said Regis Repko, Duke Energy’s senior vice president of generation and transmission strategy.
“Hydrogen has significant potential for decarbonization across all sectors of the U.S. economy. It is a clean energy also capable of long-duration storage, which would help Duke Energy ensure grid reliability as we continue adding more renewable energy sources to our system,” Repko said. 
While adding hydrogen facilities can help optimize solar plants, some industry players say that driving down solar’s levelized cost of energy – below $20 a megawatt hour – can also spur the adoption of solar for green hydrogen production. 
In fact, producing green hydrogen itself can be profitable in “wide swaths of the U.S.,” a report from policy consultancy Energy Innovation found – regions where the cost of electricity from new wind and solar averages less than $25 per MWh. And as the capital costs of electrolyzers decline, green hydrogen projects are likely to become economic in more areas.
