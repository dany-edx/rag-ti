https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/14/u-s-installed-a-record-2-6-gwh-of-grid-scale-energy-storage-in-q2/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",U.S. installed a record 2.6 GWh of grid-scale energy storage in Q2,"The United States utility-scale energy storage market continues to accelerate as 2,608 MWh of storage was brought online in Q2, 2022.
According to Wood Mackenzie and American Clean Power Association (ACP), grid-scale battery growth was largely driven in Texas, which deployed about 60% of the nation’s installed capacity.
However, the sector has been weighed down by supply issues. Project pipelines are facing rolling delays into 2023 and beyond. More than 1.1 GW of projects projected to come online in-quarter were delayed or cancelled, but 61% of this, 709 MW, is scheduled to reach commercial operations this year, said Wood Mackenzie.
Wood Mackenzie said it sees the United States on a path to be a 27 GW annual market by 2031, and 83% of that figure will be utility-scale storage. However, projections for 2022 and 2023 have been trimmed by 34% and 27%, respectively, due to disruptions from antidumping and countervailing duties tariff suit in the second quarter. Solar-plus-storage projects were impacted heavily by the investigation, leading to about 35% of grid-scale projects being delayed as a result.
“Supply chain issues, transportation delays and interconnection queue challenges were the main drivers behind delays in the commercial operations date for many projects,” said Vanessa Witte, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage division. The ongoing enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) is expected to continue to hamper imports.
Key drivers for growth in energy storage are the Investment Tax Credit for co-located solar and storage and the standalone energy storage credit, both set at 30% of the cost of equipment. Following the passage of the Act, Wood Mackenzie forecasts 59.2 GW of storage capacity will be added through 2026.
“The U.S. energy storage industry is reaching maturity,” said Jason Burwen, vice president of energy storage at ACP. “Energy storage is now regularly being installed at over a gigawatt per quarter. In addition, Texas overtaking California this quarter should serve as a reminder that generators, customers, and grid operators in all geographies are increasingly relying on energy storage. Combined with the tailwinds of newly available tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, the question for investors and grid operators now is not whether to deploy storage, but how much storage to deploy – and how fast.”
Residential energy storage had a record quarter as well, with 375 MWh installed in Q2, building upon the previous record of 334 MWh installed in Q1. Demand continues to rise in this segment, boosted by increased grid failures and extreme weather events. An increased number of solar installers now offer energy storage as part of their offering. The standalone energy storage tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to support the market for retrofitting batteries to existing residential solar systems.
Community, commercial and industrial storage installed 59.4 MWh, making it the lowest quarter recorded for MWh capacity since 2019. “Market players look forward to the emergence of a more diverse market, but current deployment remains limited to a few policy leaders in California, New York and Massachusetts,” said Chloe Holden, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, and one of the authors of the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/14/new-grid-scale-lfp-battery-from-canadian-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CANADA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",New grid-scale LFP battery from Canadian Solar,"A new Canadian Solar battery product will be unveiled at the RE+ conference in Anaheim, California, a large event that will bring together leaders in renewable energy and clean technologies from Sept. 19-22.
The battery is a utility-scale lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery with a 2.8 MWh energy capacity. LFP chemistry is hailed for cutting the risk of thermal runway, or fires, that can be problematic in other lithium-based battery systems.
Called the SolBank, the system is designed for safety, reliability, and bankability. The battery enclosure contains liquid cooling mechanisms and humidity control, and active balancing battery management systems. The company said the technology complies with the latest international safety standards.
Canadian Solar’s majority owned subsidiary CSI Energy Storage produces the unit in Jiangsu Province, China. The current annual battery manufacturing output capacity is 2.5 GWh and is expected to reach 10 GWh by the end of 2023.
The SolBank product will be displayed at Canadian Solar’s booth #2204, Anaheim Convention Center, Halls A-D.
CSI Energy Storage also provides full commissioning and integration services, turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction project execution and long-term operational service and capacity maintenance. As of Q2 2022, the company’s system integration total pipeline reached 11 GWh, including 861 MWh under long-term service agreements, 1.9 GWh under construction or contracted and an additional earlier stage pipeline of 8.2 GWh.
“Our manufacturing capacity in battery storage will spur the continued growth of our battery storage solutions business, which will in turn enhance the synergies with our battery storage project development business,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chair and CEO of Canadian Solar. “Solar plus battery storage will be one of the key solutions to combat climate change.”
Residential battery
Additionally, Canadian Solar recently announced an all-in-one residential battery and hybrid inverter, called the EP Cube, also to be displayed at RE+.
One unit can scale from 9.9 kWh to 19.9 kWh in capacity, and up to six units can be connected in parallel, achieving 119.9 kWh of storage and 45.6 kW output, said the company. This is more than enough to fully power the average home with high-surge-current appliances and AC units.
EP Cube is designed to be lightweight and easy to install, featuring all-inclusive components and self-configuration for fast commissioning. Each battery module weighs less than 70 lbs., significantly lower than many residential units, which can weigh upwards of 300 lbs. The battery module measures only 6.25 inches thick and is NEMA 4X rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The battery is compatible with the EP Cube app, which allows homeowners to monitor production and consumption in real time. Homeowners have access to their energy management through the app, and installers use the app to set up and troubleshoot the system. Updates are made remotely to the battery management system.
Over the past two decades, Canadian Solar has delivered over 76 GW of solar modules to customers across the world. Since entering the project development business in 2010, the company has developed, built and connected over 6.8 GW in over 20 countries across the world. Currently, the company has about 311 MW of solar projects in operation, 5.3 GW of projects under construction or in backlog (late-stage), and an additional 21 GW of projects in pipeline (mid- to early-stage).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/14/ambri-liquid-metal-battery-storage-system-to-help-back-up-microsoft-cloud-services/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Ambri Liquid Metal battery storage system to help back up Microsoft cloud services,"Microsoft, a specialist in cloud-based services, chose Schneider Electric to provide its uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to power the Microsoft datacenter equipment. The system is part of Microsoft’s plan to use 100% renewable power and replace diesel backup generators by 2030. The plan is a multi-phase program that enables Microsoft to reduce the need for diesel generation, allows for constant renewable power from any source, and provides access to ancillary services markets.
“Enhancing energy storage capabilities, including implementing long duration battery solutions for datacenters, is critically important to our mission. With this partnership, we are strengthening our commitment to sustainability and taking another step in our work to support the grid with ancillary services and shifting.” adds Ehsan Nasr, senior design researcher at Microsoft.
At the heart of the system is a planned long-duration energy storage solution from Ambri, a company that was spun out of MIT. Last year the company announced $144 million in funding last year to advance its calcium-antimony liquid metal battery chemistry. Headquartered in Massachusetts, Ambri recently received certification for UL 1973 for its liquid metal battery.
Ambri’s liquid metal battery is comprised of a liquid calcium alloy anode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a cathode comprised of solid particles of antimony, enabling the use of low-cost materials and a low number of steps in the cell assembly process.
The battery is designed to meet the demands of large industrial energy customers such as data centers. It is actively being integrated with TerraScale’s Energos Reno data center project. The 250 MWh battery will be bolstered by 500 MW of on-site renewable generation.
The company said the electrolyte is thermodynamically stable with the electrodes, avoiding side reactions such as film-formation that can lead to performance degradation. The negative electrode is fully consumed when discharged, and reformed on every cycle, resulting in what the company said is a “highly repeatable process with no memory effect.” Ambri said the battery has a lifespan of 20-plus years with minimal fade, and says the systems do not produce or emit any gases, and there is no possibility for thermal runaway.
“Ambri’s batteries will help improve Microsoft’s datacenter operations while delivering important environmental and commercial benefits. With the commissioning of this project, Ambri is demonstrating how advanced, sustainable, and versatile our technology truly is. We look forward to continuing our partnership with Microsoft as we help them to reach their sustainability goals,” said Adam Briggs, chief commercial officer at Ambri.
This project with Microsoft is the latest milestone in Ambri’s progress toward commercialization. The company recently announced its new facility in Milford, Mass., which more than triples the size of Ambri’s current manufacturing footprint and allows for a production capacity of 200,000 battery cells per year that will be ready for installation starting in 2023. The new facility is expected to support up to 200 jobs and is estimated to be at full volume production in 2024.
