The Psyche craft will be winged with two large cross-shaped solar arrays, which will power the craft’s measurement devices as well as its propulsion system.
The solar propulsion craft, developed by Maxar Technologies, is currently undergoing testing. Engineers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently demonstrated the solar array’s fold-out capability.

Each array is 37.1 feet long and 24 feet wide when fully deployed. About an hour after launch, the arrays will deploy sequentially, first with the center column unfolding, and then the two cross-panels unfurling and latching into place. One wing at a time, the total deployment takes about seven and a half minutes.
This is the largest solar array deployed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said NASA. So large, in fact, that the entire craft could not be unfolded during the test at Arizona State University’s lab in Tempe. ASU has partnered with NASA on this mission, which will observe the suspected unusually high amount of metals in the thickest band of the asteroid.
Psyche will use a Falcon heavy rocket to escape Earth’s gravity, but after that it will rely on the solar array and Hall thrusters to travel. Hall thrusters are propelled by xenon gas and require a small amount of electricity to run.
On Earth, the solar array can generate about 21kW of electricity, but far away from the sun alongside Psyche, they will only produce 2kW, about the same energy demand as a hair dryer. Despite this low amount of energy, it will be sufficient to power the planned three-and-a-half-year journey to the asteroid, and the two years of orbiting and observation of the body. Maxar’s cell technology is not fundamentally different from panels used on Earth, but design considerations were made to keep weight minimal, and resistance to radiation at a maximum.
“Even in the beginning, when we were first designing the mission in 2012, we were talking about solar electric propulsion as part of the plan. Without it, we wouldn’t have the Psyche mission,” said Arizona State University’s Lindy Elkins-Tanton, who as principal investigator leads the mission. “And it’s become part of the character of the mission. It takes a specialized team to calculate trajectories and orbits using solar electric propulsion.”
The launch is planned for this August, and the Psyche spacecraft may make first contact with the Psyche asteroid in 2026.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/07/do-rigid-trackers-get-the-most-out-of-large-format-modules/,"BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 7, 2022",Do rigid trackers get the most out of large format modules?,"As large format modules (LFM) have begun to take over the utility-scale solar space, design and engineering protocol from manufacturers across the solar value chain have had to change their practices accordingly, making tweaks in some instances and entire overhauls in others, in order to accommodate the new technology.
Tracker manufacturers have been especially subject to considerable design changes, with representatives from two of the industry’s biggest names meeting recently with pv magazine to highlight how their operations have evolved.
Another industry stalwart, Arctech Solar, has released a new white paper outlining the opportunities presented by stowing modules at a zero-degree angle in high-wind scenarios, a solution made possible by the advent of rigid trackers.
Arctech launched its newest stiff tracker product in October 2021: the SkyLine II 1P Tracker. Skyline II’s main points of innovation over more traditional, flexible tracker technologies are a pentagonal torque tube, which provides the product with larger bending and torsional capabilities, and a synchronous multi-point drive mechanism, which rigidifies the tracker enough to enable zero-degree stowing in instances of high wind.
Advantages of rigidity
This is the architecture and general design philosophy that Arctech believes will enable trackers to unlock the full value of large format modules, as safe operation and stowing in wind-prone areas has become a concern, due to the increased surface and sail area created by LFMs.
In the white paper, Arctech claims that not only does a zero-degree stow angle enable projects to expand geographically into higher-intensity wind zones, but it also prevents energy losses that would be incurred by other stow strategies and increases energy generation and revenue a “considerable” extent.
In a high wind speed event, traditional trackers needs to be stowed at a steep tilt angle, with the tracker nose down and the front panel surface facing the wind, in order to remain structurally stable and avoid torsional instability. The wind speed threshold that triggers this reaction is called the wind stow speed, and that trigger speed has to be lower than the known point of speed where structural damage and potential for catastrophic loss is initiated.
With the onset of LFMs, trackers got longer and wider, lowering rigidity and bringing the critical wind speeds down for all tilts. As a result wind stow thresholds declined to near 12 meters per second, a relatively common speed. If trackers are forced into stow functions at such a relatively common wind speed, modules will have less tracking time, meaning less energy will be generated and levelized cost of electricity, a critical metric for the financial viability of solar projects, will be raised.
For SkyLine II and any similarly-constructed rigid tracker, the the critical wind speed sits at 22 m/s, nearly doubling the parameters for wind a project can operate under.
Proving the point
To prove this, Arctech created a case study using A 100MW virtual solar farm near Amarillo, Texas; solar irradiance data for 2020 from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s NSRDB Physical Solar Model; and corresponding wind data for 2020 from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office’s GES DISC MERRA-2.
The study compared Arctech’s SkyLine II and SkySmart II (another rigid tracker offering), which have critical wind speeds of 22m/s and 20m/s and both stow at zero degrees, to a traditional tracker with a wind threshold of 16m/s and a 30-degree stow angle; a flexible tracker with a wind threshold of 14m/s and a 30-degree stow angle; and a hypothetical worst-case scenario with a wind threshold of 12m/s and a 45-degree stow angle.
The solar farms modeled under each scenario were then tested for how many hours of the year they spent stowed, what percentage of total hours in a year those stow hours accounted for; the estimated annual energy lost from stowing, represented as both a percentage of overall expected generation and by MWh, and the estimated revenue losses incurred by stowing, expressed in dollars and assuming a standard power contract price of $28/MWh.
Arctech’s SkyLine II spent just 15 hours, 0.17% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing 204MWh in that time, roughly 0.09% of projected generation, for a financial loss of just over $5,700.
Arctech’s SkySmart II spent 38 hours, 0.43% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing 262MWh in that time, roughly 0.12% of projected generation, for a financial loss of just over $7,300.
The traditional tracker spent 243 hours, 2.77% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing 1,711MWh in that time, roughly 0.77% of projected generation, for a financial loss of almost $48,000.
The flexible tracker spent 608 hours, almost 7% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing just over 3,750MWh in that time, roughly 1.7% of projected generation, for a financial loss of just over $105,000.
The worst-case scenario tracker spent 1,288 hours, 14.7% of the the modeled year, in stow position, losing nearly 9,300MWh in that time, roughly 4.17% of projected generation, for a financial loss of over $260,000.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/07/ihs-markit-battery-prices-wont-fall-until-2024/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,BRAZIL,CHINA,FRANCE,GERMANY,ITALY,JAPAN,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 7, 2022",IHS Markit: Battery prices won’t fall until 2024,"From pv magazine global
Business data company IHS Markit has predicted lithium-ion battery prices will not fall until 2024, thanks to rising metal prices, soaring demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and China’s near monopoly on the industry.
The analyst, which has produced a list of cleantech trends for 2022, also said current green hydrogen project timescales will have the world on schedule for a supply crunch of the energy storage medium in 2025.
Amid fierce EV demand for lithium-ion phosphate batteries, London-based, S&P Global-owned IHS has predicted a battery module price increase of 5% this year will drive up the overall cost of stationary battery projects around 3%.
With the analyst having recorded lithium-ion battery price rises of 10-20% in the “later months of 2021,” it predicted price tags will not return to a downward trajectory for another two years and even that development will depend on manufacturers expanding production capacity and seeing off demand from EV makers.
The green hydrogen bottleneck anticipated mid decade is in part a result of project announcements that included plans laid last year for almost 250GW of electrolyzer capacity – up from 70GW worth of announcements in 2020, and less than 15GW in 2019. IHS, however, predicted further electrolyzer production plans this year and next will help ease any supply squeeze and reiterated an estimate Europe’s green hydrogen demand alone is expected to require up to 250GW of solar generation capacity this decade.
Noting moves by the US and India to onshore solar manufacturing, IHS said it expects the logistics and input cost headaches, which drove up the price of solar panels last year will continue to inflate costs this year, particularly for the next four months. The market data firm did state, however, new manufacturing capacity of solar panel raw material polysilicon is coming online faster than expected, solar wafers are becoming more efficient, and new wafer producers are entering the market.
While solar and wind prices may continue to rise this year, IHS said, clean energy remains competitive, in part thanks to cheaper financing costs as banks become accustomed to backing such projects and the world experiences a continued enthusiasm for green finance.
Smaller
Solar projects with generation capacities no larger than 5MW will account for 45% of new arrays this year, according to IHS Markit, with China and Germany driving more than 60% of demand in the segment.
Brazil will continue to see demand for sub-5MW projects, with net-metered arrays installed through next year not subject to grid charges, and established smaller-scale solar markets in the US and France will be joined by new entrants, with a graphic produced by IHS Markit suggesting they could include Japan, India and Italy.
Home and business rooftop arrays continue to be competitive despite rising panel prices, IHS said, because they are competing against retail energy prices rather than the wholesale levels, with which utility scale projects have to contend.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/07/solar-is-nearly-50-of-planned-utility-scale-capacity-additions/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,NEW YORK,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 7, 2022",Solar is nearly 50% of planned utility-scale capacity additions,"Utility-scale solar and battery energy storage are set to be the dominant new source of energy capacity additions, as over the next two years the Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts the two technologies will combine for 60% of capacity added to the grid. Of the total 85GW capacity planned to come online through 2023, solar and energy storage represents 51GW. EIA said in many cases, solar and storage are collocated in the same project.
Rapidly falling battery prices and rising demand have driven the increase of energy storage attachment and standalone storage projects. Dependent on charging sources and configuration of the project, battery energy storage units may be eligible for the solar investment tax credit (ITC), another driver of growth. The ITC is set to phase down by 2024. It is scheduled to be 26% in 2022, 22% in 2023, and 10% in 2024 and after.
Three states dominate the solar and energy storage capacity share. Texas is expected to contribute 23% of new capacity with 12GW, California second with 11GW, and New York third with 4GW.
Utility-scale solar accounts for 48% of planned capacity in the US over the next two years, reports EIA. The 22GW planned for 2022 is dramatically more than the 13GW added in 2021. In 2020 and 2021, utility-scale solar doubled natural gas, adding 24GW versus 12GW, respectively.
Over the next two years, EIA expects 10GW of utility-scale battery storage capacity to be added, more than 60% of which will be co-located with solar installations. Roughly 3.1GW of battery storage was deployed in 2021.
The remainder of planned projects over the next two years, about 34GW, will come from natural gas (16GW) and wind (15GW). Wind capacity additions have notably dropped, as the 15GW is dwarfed by the previous years which saw 29GW of new wind come online.
EIA also recently reported it expects US energy use to rise through 2050, as population and economic growth outgain efficiency improvements. EIA’s annual energy outlook for 2022 projects petroleum and natural gas will remain the highest sources of energy consumption through 2050, with transportation being the greatest contributor to fuel use.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/07/irec-releases-training-courses-for-residential-solar-plan-review-and-permitting/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 7, 2022",IREC releases training courses for residential solar plan review and permitting,"The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and a team of partners announced the launch of a free series of self-paced, interactive, online professional development courses on the plan review and permitting process for residential rooftop solar installations. The series covers the primary tasks to confirm the electrical, structural, and fire code compliance of PV systems prior to issuing a permit.
IREC developed the course series in partnership with clean energy codes and building safety experts at the International Code Council (ICC), International Association of Electrical Inspectors (IAEI), National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Slipstream, and University of Central Florida – FSEC Energy Research Center.
“Building safety professionals need concise, easy to use, and accurate information that fits in their busy schedules,” said Larry Sherwood, President and CEO at IREC. “IREC-developed courses can be taken on a lunch hour and then used in the field that afternoon. This will help local officials safely and efficiently approve clean solar energy installations that benefit the entire community.”
Beyond the traditional “click and review” approach to online learning, IREC’s industry-vetted training is based on a series of widely accessed classroom-based courses and provides real-world practice. Learners evaluate actual residential solar PV system plans as they complete interactive activities. They can choose to complete courses on topics specific to their job function, or they can complete the entire series and review a full permit application.
“Code officials play a critical role in ensuring that the latest energy-based technologies are deployed safely,” said Ryan M. Colker, ICC’s Vice President, Innovation. “The International Code Council is pleased to continue our collaboration with IREC to deliver the training and professional development resources that our members need to remain current in these areas.”
The CleanEnergyTraining.org website provides professionals interested in emerging clean energy technology with clean energy educational resources and training courses with the opportunity for free CEUs. A Certificate of Completion must be submitted to IAEI and ICC for CEU credits for the code official training courses.
The new courses build on IREC’s extensive work assisting local government officials with timely and efficient permit approvals for solar PV projects. For example, the IREC-led SolSmart program developed simplified permitting guidelines for local officials, and IREC offers online training on the new SolarAPP+ automated permitting platform.
Solar Automated Permit Processing (SolarAPP+), a free software tool aimed at automating residential solar permitting, was launched in July of 2021 and adopted by several pilot cities. In recent study it was found that SolarAPP+ reduces project times an average of 12 days.  SolarAPP+ is now being piloted in several cities for permitting energy storage projects. Installers can learn more about its use in the online IREC training courses.
IREC has developed these courses under the EMPOWERED funding program, a collaborative effort across DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Solar Energy Technologies Office, Building Technologies Office, and the Vehicle Technologies Office to develop training programs and resources for professionals interacting with new energy technologies, such as solar PV, energy storage, electric vehicle infrastructure, and grid-enabled and advanced building systems.
The courses are available on IREC’s online learning management system. Click here to register.

Borrego will utilize Powin’s battery energy storage systems for both its utility-scale, standalone storage projects and its hybrid solar-plus-storage projects across the US, and the company has more than 490MWh of projects under contract in design, construction or operation.
“We’re thrilled to partner with Borrego as they advance their robust solar and energy storage pipeline across the US,” said Powin Senior Vice President, Danny Lu. “This supply agreement provides Borrego and its customers the confidence they need to execute on projects, knowing Powin has the ability to backstop our commitments.”
The agreement raises Powin’s contracted pipeline of storage supply to nearly 10GWh of energy storage systems globally over the next three years.
The bulk of that supply pipeline came to be in February, when Powin announced major supply deals covering a 5.8GWh pipeline of energy storage projects in the US and Taiwan. Of those 5.8GWh, the company shared that the majority will use Powin’s Centipede product.
Powin’s Centipede consists of pre-integrated modular units containing batteries, thermal management equipment, and other safety features. According to Powin, Centipede requires half the time to procure and deploy – and uses 30% less space – than rival modular storage systems, while also reducing lifecycle costs.
The product integrates multiple Powin Stack750E battery energy storage system units, which are designed for two-to-four-hour applications, and support more than 200MWh of energy-storage capacity per acre. The third-generation battery module was updated with new thermal controls, a change Powin said will create an anticipated 80% reduction in service times.
In addition to the two aforementioned supply agreements, Powin also shares that the company has closed on more than 2GWh of contracts for the Centipede from multinational independent power producers and utilities.
Prior to announcing the 5.8GWh agreement but spurred in part due to an already-high volume of demand, Powin has come to terms on a partnership with manufacturing and supply chain business Celestica, so that the Centipede lithium-ion battery systems can be fabricated in Monterrey, Mexico, closer to the company’s Oregon headquarters.
