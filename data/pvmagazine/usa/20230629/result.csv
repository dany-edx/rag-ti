Morgan Stanley Renewables and Santander Corporate Investment and Banking and combined for a $520 million investment in the project portfolio, with each contributing $260 million. Santander CIB is providing a construction and term loan facility, and Morgan Stanley acting as a tax equity investor.
Energix said the total tax equity contribution could be higher based on the project companies’ investment tax credit eligibility. The funds acquired through these transactions are expected to be used to support six large utility-scale solar projects in Virginia and Pennsylvania with a combined total capacity of 416 MWdc.
The funding brings Energix’s total investment in U.S. energy infrastructure to nearly $1 billion. The latest transaction also marks the third tax equity deal Energix has closed with Morgan Stanley. The prior two deals were closed in 2020 and 2021 and were associated with eight projects in Virginia totaling about 200 MWdc.
“Energix is thrilled to announce this new collaboration with Santander CIB. This partnership opens up exciting avenues for Energix to expand its footprint and harness Santander’s extensive network and resources,” said Itamar Sarussi, country manager, Energix US.
Energix Renewables entered the U.S. market in 2016 and has quickly scaled to a large player in utility-scale solar in the Mid-Atlantic region. The company has stated a commitment to identifying community partners, hiring local contractors, and investing in American-made equipment.
To date, Energix Renewables owns, operates, and maintains nine utility-scale solar facilities with a capacity of 224 MWdc across the Mid-Atlantic. With the additional investment from Morgan Stanley and Santander CIB, Energix is projected to have 640 MWdc of operational projects by the end of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/29/roof-integrated-solar-takes-44-less-time-to-install-on-new-construction/,"RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 29, 2023",Roof-integrated solar takes 44% less time to install on new construction,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted a time-motion study on solar contractors installing roofing integrated photovoltaics (RIPV) on residential solar projects at several California sites. The researchers published their findings in a publication titled “Observations and Lessons Learned From Installing Residential Roofing Integrated Photovoltaics.”
The study primarily highlighted that new construction RIPV installs very quickly. However, the time required for retrofit RIPV is still comparable to that of standard solar installations. The installation times are still higher for retrofit RIPV, at least in part, due to the application of new techniques and the continued evolution of supply chains.
This analysis was prompted in part by the fact that building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have not kept up with forecast price declines. This is despite the fact that investing in BIPV during the retrofitting of roofing, siding or windows can reduce or eliminate the need for separate solar components. Even when these hardware and labor costs are factored in, the expense of BIPV installations still tends to surpass that of conventional installations.

To further understand why costs remained higher than anticipated, NREL interviewed industry experts and performed time-motion studies at various RIPV residential installation sites.
The research compared the time taken for RIPV installations with that of standard residential solar installations. In the U.S., 32% of the installation costs are attributed to racking and mounting, 32% to electrical work, 20% to meals, breaks, cleanup, and delays, and 16% to travel and installation preparation. Overall, the study found that standard installations required 6.9 worker-hours per kW installed.

NREL conducted its analysis by monitoring two distinct RIPV reroof sites, with each site using a different product. They also observed RIPV installations on new homes at nineteen additional construction sites in the vicinity.
The three field visits were conducted in Central California:
NREL divided the RIPV installation process into four main steps. The process begins with pre-installation tasks including staging, unloading and preparing the roof. This is followed by the placement of fire-resistant underlayment, a task typically performed by roofing material companies, not solar installers. The third step involves the installation of flashings and solar modules, and the final step is the installation of wiring and monitoring.
The most time-consuming reroof step was the installation of flashings and solar modules, which took approximately 2.4 worker-hours per kW and accounted for 60% of the process time of an average installation. On average, the total installation process took about 6.4 worker-hours per kW at reroofing sites, and 3.5 worker-hours per kW at new construction sites.

NREL researchers found that the normalization of retrofit RIPV solar projects in the installation process could speed up installations. The team noted several delays caused by different suppliers delivering materials to project sites, exacerbated by limited product availability and contractors not maintaining sufficient stock. These factors led to unnecessary time wastage for the onsite installation team.
The two reroof projects highlighted that various RIPV systems require differing amounts of time for various tasks, each presenting a unique learning curve. While the NREL report didn’t specify which products were used, it appeared that Reroof A might be a more complex Tesla Solar Roof, whereas Reroof B could be a standard solar shingle product.

The installation complexity of the Tesla Solar Roof has been a known challenge, particularly due to the number of custom pieces required for assembly.
NREL also had the opportunity to observe new solar installations on pristine rooftops. These projects, on average, required a total of 13.2 worker-hours to install an average of 3.4 kWdc of solar, amounting to roughly 3.8 worker-hours per kW installed. This time frame was notably 45% less than the 6.9 worker-hours per kW necessary for a typical retrofit installation.
Inconveniently located vents and oddly shaped roofs often present frustrating challenges for solar designers.
Despite having a clean slate with plywood roofs free of shingles, crews working on new construction suggested that installation efficiency could be improved if architects and solar product manufacturers collaborated more. According to their feedback, aligning roofing materials’ dimensions more closely with those of solar products could increase solar module coverage on the roof, and accelerate solar solar product development by reducing the need for on-site customization.
Looking at specific characteristics, NREL found that projects installed on a single roofing plane were significantly less time-consuming. As expected, electrical work proved to be considerably quicker and easier on homes with bare frames already designed to accommodate specific solar hardware, as compared to retrofit projects involving fully constructed structures.

EV sales at the global level are expected to rise from 10.5 million in 2022 to almost 27 million in 2026, according to the BloombergNEF Electric Vehicle Outlook 2023. The report notes that the EV share of global new passenger vehicle sales will grow from 14% in 2022 to 30% in 2026. Shares in some markets are much higher, with the report estimating that EVs will reach more than half the sales in China and 42% in Europe.
In the United States, as a result of incentives offered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), electric vehicles will make up nearly 28% of passenger vehicle sales by 2026, up from 7.6% in 2022.

This projection is about 20% off from the Biden Administration’s goal for electric vehicles to make up 50% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030, but perhaps the goal will be met with four years of additional growth.
The IRA provides incentives for buyers of new and used EVs that are made in North America. While there previously was a limit of 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer that could receive the incentive, the cap was lifted with the IRA. Also in 2023, new auto pricing and buyer income caps apply; however, if a taxpayer does not qualify, they may transfer the credit to the dealer, who can then offer a rebate to the customer.
According to SAFE, a group dedicated to accelerating the deployment of sustainable transportation and energy solutions of the U.S. and its sister organization, the Electrification Coalition, EVs must also meet critical mineral and battery component requirements to qualify for the maximum credit available. The IRA also stipulates that battery minerals and components come from North America or from countries with which the United States has free trade agreements.
The U.S. government is also helping to meet its own goals by increasing procurement of electric vehicles for the federal fleet. According to a White House report, government agencies in this fiscal year have acquired five times as many EVs as last year, and are on track to meet the goal for 100% of new light-duty federal vehicles to be zero emission by 2027.
The BloombergNEF report notes that electrification is spreading to all types of vehicles, with light commercial EV sales expected to rise sharply. Municipal bus fleets are increasingly electric and are expected to reach 36% of sales by 2026.
While the trajectory of EV sales is impressive, the BloombergNEF report cautions that faster progress is needed in order to reach net-zero road transport emissions by 2050. The IRA has gone a long way to promote the adoption of electric cars in the U.S., but heavy trucks are still lagging behind in the trajectory and should be a priority focus, according to the report authors.
Other challenges inherent in an EV buildout remain, including the need for a strong network of charging stations. The Biden Administration set a goal of establishing a national network of 500,000 EV chargers. While ambitious, a recent report from Wood Mackenzie forecasts that 18 million chargers will be installed across the U.S. by 2027.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/29/companies-making-moves-in-ev-charging/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 29, 2023",Companies making moves in EV charging,"The electrification of transportation is well underway. Roughly $860 billion has been raised globally to support the build out of EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure. Nearly one fourth of this investment is represented by the United States, which has at least $210 billion in major automaker and infrastructure projects planned.
According to the inaugural North American EV charging infrastructure monitor from Wood Mackenzie, President Biden’s goal of building out a national network of 500,000 EV chargers will be far exceeded in four years.
While the majority will be residential chargers, the report forecasts that 18 million chargers will be installed across the U.S. by 2027.
In addition to decarbonizing transportation, electric vehicles show great potential for their ability to balance the grid and by storing and dispatching locally generated electricity from solar.
Below are four recent developments in the EV charging space.
Enel X Way / Grid Alternatives
Enel X Way and Grid Alternatives are partnering to pilot a new EV charging program designed to bring access to low-income communities through added incentives.
Qualifying low-income customers in California who have recently purchased or leased an EV are offered a free JuiceBox home EV charger, installation services, and up to $2,000 in electric service panel upgrades. The incentives can be stacked on top of existing incentives and rebates, including the federal government’s 30% tax credit on home charging stations, the $7,500 credit for purchasing EVs, and California’s $2,000 cash rebate for eligible EV buyers.
“As automakers introduce more affordable EV models that appeal to a wider swath of consumers and income levels, new EV drivers will need a convenient and reliable place to charge up their electric vehicles,” said Chris Baker, head of Enel X Way North America.
Polestar / Tesla
Polestar, a Swedish electric performance car brand, announced it has signed an agreement with Tesla to enable access to Tesla’s network of EV Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada.
From 2025 onward, Polestar EVs will be able to access Tesla charging stations. Existing Polestar vehicles can be outfit with an adapter to access the Tesla ports.
“With 12,000 charging points today, a number that will only keep growing, this move will greatly increase the rate of EV adoption in a key automotive region,” said Thomas Ingenlath, chief executive officer, Polestar.
PowerFlex
PowerFlex, provider of EV charging stations for commercial fleets, announced it introduced a new controls software to manage charging.
The software, PowerFlex X, will control the nearly 4,000 charging stations currently in development for California utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).
Approximately 11% of PG&E’s fleet of about 9,200 on-road vehicles are powered by alternative fuels, including electricity. As outlined in its Climate Strategy Report, PG&E has committed to electrifying 100% of its light duty fleet, 50% of its medium-duty fleet, and 20% of its heavy-duty fleet by 2030.
“Our software platform provides unique benefits that help meet the growing EV demand, while minimizing the impact on the existing grid. The PowerFlex team and our customers understand the importance of reliable fleet charging through sustainable methods for EV growth,” said Raphael Declercq, chief executive officer, PowerFlex.
SolarEdge
SolarEdge, a major provider of solar inverters and battery energy storage, introduced a new software platform for the management of solar-attached EV charging facilities for the commercial and industrial segment.
The software manages and optimizes EV charging for projects that require dynamic load management and have numerous EVs on site. Apartment buildings, workplaces, and public charging locations are among some of the applications the software is designed to serve.

SolarEdge said its charging manager is built on AI-based predictive algorithms that incorporate real-time data and consider solar production, electricity price fluctuations, and tiered charging schedules. It integrates with SolarEdge’s energy management system, orchestrating interactions between the facility’s solar generation, battery energy storage, and large-scale EV charging, taking into account local infrastructure and grid conditions and limitations.
“As more companies are taking active measures to electrify their car fleets, combining solar PV and EV charging is a cost-effective and sustainable way to manage these fleets,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer, SolarEdge Technologies.
Wevo Energy, a startup focused on EV charging management software, developed the platform. SolarEdge is an investor in the company.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/29/199000-job-years-await-pjm-approval-of-167-gw-of-solar-storage-and-wind/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,ILLINOIS,INDIANA,OHIO,UNITED STATES,VIRGINIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 29, 2023","199,000 job-years await PJM approval of 167 GW of solar, storage and wind","Almost 200,000 job-years could be created by the 167 GW of large-scale solar, wind and storage projects awaiting interconnection studies by PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, said the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) in its report Power Up PJM.
A lack of transmission capacity due to “insufficient” transmission planning is a “root cause of the unprecedented backlog” of interconnection requests across grid operators nationwide, the report says.
Virginia, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana have the greatest number of job-years awaiting PJM action, as shown in the nearby bar chart from the report, which also shows the states fully or partly served by PJM. ACORE counted only direct and indirect construction, operation and maintenance jobs, not induced jobs due to increased economic activity in the region.
The 167 GW of pending renewables and storage projects are “eligible for PJM’s transition cycle,” the report says, referring to PJM’s plan, approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to expedite interconnection studies for pending requests through early 2026, while closing its interconnection queue to new requests in the meantime.

ACORE pointed to a sharp decline in renewables projects in the PJM region reaching commercial operation, falling from 20.3% of renewable capacity entering PJM’s queue between 2011 and 2016, to 2.7% of renewable capacity entering PJM’s queue in the fifteen months starting January 1, 2017, citing data from Berkeley Lab.
The recent low success rate for renewables projects in PJM is largely due to “low spending on large-scale, high-voltage transmission” within the PJM region, said Noah Strand, an ACORE policy associate and the report’s author, on an ACORE webinar, citing a study from the nonprofit group RMI.
“It’s good to see PJM going in the right direction” said Brendan Casey, deputy director for economic analysis at the American Clean Power Association, in an apparent reference to PJM’s announced transition to cluster studies, which are more efficient than first-come, first-served studies, speaking on the webinar.
Yet he added that as the industry is currently building about 30 GW of renewables and storage capacity per year, “if we want to have a net-zero grid by 2035, we need to be building more like 90 to 100 gigawatts. And this means speeding up the interconnection processes, not just in PJM but across the country.”
The ACORE report recommended that PJM speed interconnection through transmission planning, accelerating transmission upgrades, additional staffing and automation.
ACORE also recommended that FERC require grid operators to consider grid-enhancing technologies and advanced conductors in the interconnection study process, and set “a more just framework” for allocating transmission upgrade costs associated with interconnection.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/29/green-hydrogen-the-scaling-challenge/,"HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 29, 2023",Green hydrogen: The scaling challenge,"Green hydrogen, also called renewable hydrogen, is generated by using renewable electricity to electrolyze water. Although touted for decades as the magic clean energy carrier molecule, green hydrogen has only picked up momentum in the past few years.
In the world of hydrogen, colors have come to signify the method of production, and currently, Clean Energy Associates estimates more than 99% of the market for hydrogen is still served by the grey or black/brown variety, which uses fossil fuels for its production, emitting vast amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
CEA estimates approximately 100 million tons per year of fossil-derived hydrogen are used in refining, fertilizer, chemical and other industries. To achieve global carbon reduction goals, these quantities should be decarbonized as soon as possible.
In parallel, new, more challenging uses of green hydrogen are being developed, which could decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors such as the steel industry, long-haul transportation, shipping, aviation, and even long-duration energy storage.
Fossil-derived hydrogen is very low-cost; therefore, lowering the cost of green hydrogen—both via innovation and subsidies—is a top priority. For newer hydrogen applications, the cost pressure is even greater. For green hydrogen to compete with fossil-derived hydrogen and replace fossil-fuel-powered uses, scale is of the essence. Achieving scale in green hydrogen production will require subsidies and policy support, at least in the early years.
Scaling-up scenarios
The International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emission scenario calls for 720 GW of cumulative electrolyzer development by 2030 and 2,100 GW by 2050. IEA’s Announced Pledges Scenario assumes that all aspirational goals announced by governments are met in full, and calls for 260 GW of cumulative electrolyzer capacity by 2030.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts 240 GW of cumulative capacity by 2030. My company, Clean Energy Associates, forecasts that manufacturing capacity will reach 113 GW by 2030, based on applying discounts on announced manufacturing capacity expansions globally.

More than 100 GW of shipments are forecasted by the end of this decade, in stark contrast to just 1.3 GW of electrolyzers shipped in 2023. Shipments must scale up by almost two orders of magnitude within a few years, a formidable challenge.
Global manufacturing capacities
China currently dominates global nameplate capacity, but shipments lag behind due to underutilization. While the U.S. and Europe anticipate rapid growth in capacity, Chinese suppliers have aggressive expansion plans as well, and are projected to hold approximately 50% of the global capacity through the end of the decade.

China is supporting the electrolyzer industry by planning very large green hydrogen/ammonia projects, mostly by state-owned enterprises, where the big players have opportunities to win bids and establish a track record. At this point in the development of the industry, no supplier has experience commensurate with the multi-GW projects planned within the decade.
Main electrolysis technologies
 There are four main electrolyzer technologies:
Alkaline has the lowest cost. This is particularly true in China, where suppliers have developed very mature supply chains with low costs over the years, which they can now take advantage of as they scale up. CEA’s forecast (see chart below) of the electrolyzer technology mix shows a predominance of alkaline technology through the end of the decade.

Electrolyzer system cost
The total CapEx of a complete electrolyzer system, including the electrolyzer stack, balance of plant, and engineering, procurement, and construction cost for various system sizes, is shown below. CEA calculated the figures below for China; CapEx costs are expected to vary significantly in other regions.

Although PEM technology allows simpler system design and has lower EPC cost, the very high cost of the PEM stack leads to a very high total cost for the system. The high cost of PEM is due to the usage of iridium and platinum, as well as titanium, to protect the components against the very acidic conditions in the stack.
Iridium usage in the current PEM stacks is around 0.56 g/kW. The current global iridium supply of eight tons a year can only support 14 GW of PEM annual production, even if all world’s iridium were to go to PEM electrolyzers. Given the momentum behind PEM electrolysis, meeting iridium supply challenges will be essential to achieving hydrogen production targets worldwide.
Green hydrogen cost
The levelized cost of hydrogen is a rather complex calculation with three main factors. One is the cost of electricity. When green hydrogen is produced, clean electricity is required, which is chiefly solar and wind — and these sources are variable.
The second factor is the utilization rate (which depends on the capacity factor of the solar and/or wind producing the electricity).
The third is equipment CapEx. The following charts show CEA’s analysis of the interdependence of capacity factor and electricity cost at different CapEx levels.


Green hydrogen must compete with fossil-derived hydrogen, which costs between $1/kg-$2/kg (and is marked as the lower green region in the charts). We can observe that the high cost of the PEM system limits the green area to even higher capacity factors and lower electricity prices.
It is obvious then that the most suitable locations for market-competitive green hydrogen production are those where renewable energy can be available with a good capacity factor and at low cost. In other regions, subsidies and policy support are necessary until the technology scales and costs decline.
Renewable energy plants may need to be overbuilt to achieve such high capacity factors. However, clean energy transported via the grid, under tight regulatory restrictions, could be allowed to feed electrolyzer systems at high capacity factors.
The amount of clean energy that will be needed to produce green hydrogen is staggering: 100 million tons would require 5,000 TWh of renewable energy for its production, which is about 100 times the annual electricity consumption of Greece. It is therefore paramount to avoid the “cannibalization” of existing renewable energy capacity to produce green hydrogen, as this could lead to the increased use of conventional fossil power and may actually worsen global carbon emissions.
To this purpose, the additionality principle is expected to be applied in most regions, where dedicated renewable energy would be fed to each electrolyzer system. Europe has pioneered relevant regulations, and other regions are expected to follow—especially if they plan to export green hydrogen or green ammonia.
Competitive in next few years
Renewable energy is already very inexpensive and will keep getting cheaper; therefore, the industry should focus on reducing the other two cost drivers of LCOH: CapEx costs and utilization. However, scaling up the production of electrolyzers is a challenge, especially for technologies like PEM, which is more expensive due to the need for rare, expensive metals.
Green hydrogen is a promising solution for decarbonizing various industries, but there are still challenges that need to be addressed to make it commercially viable. While there is no clear timeline for when green hydrogen will become competitive with fossil-derived hydrogen, in most regions, it is expected to happen in the next few years if everything falls in place.
The industry should focus on reducing the costs of electrolyzers while increasing their efficiency, and siting projects where renewable clean energy is plentiful and available at low cost.
