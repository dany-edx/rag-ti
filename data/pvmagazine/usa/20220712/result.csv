The total cost of the project is valued at over $1.6 million.
Peak Power will install the V1G chargers across several mixed-use developments in Ontario, Canada. Peak Power provides battery energy storage systems that use its software, Peak Synergy, which enables the chargers to draw energy from the grid when it’s most widely available and avoid times of peak demand.
“I’m pleased to be announcing the deployment of over 100 Electric Vehicle chargers across Ontario with Peak Power,” said Julie Dabrusin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources and to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and Member of Parliament for Toronto-Danforth. “This $765,000 investment by the Government of Canada will allow folks in Toronto and across the province to access the infrastructure they need to drive an EV while fighting climate change. Happy #EVWeek!”
As part of ZEVIP, the project supports the federal government’s goals of accelerating the electrification of Canada’s transportation sector. The 117 chargers should reduce “range anxiety” for EV drivers and encourage additional adoption of EVs.  One benefit to Peak Power’s software, the company reports, is that it allows more capacity from the grid without requiring major infrastructure upgrades.
“Limited access to EV charging infrastructure in high-density mixed-used environments remains a key barrier to widespread EV adoption,” said Carter Li, CEO of SWTCH. “SWTCH’s partnership with Peak Power and Signature Electric to deploy V1G technology to these settings will enhance coordination between energy utilities, building operators, and EV drivers to improve building energy efficiency and access to EV charging infrastructure.”
Peak Power is working with SWTCH Energy in co-developing the software for the EV chargers with Peak Power, while Signature Electric will install the hardware and supporting infrastructure.
“We’re thrilled to support the Canadian government’s electrification goals through smart EV charging,” said Matthew Sachs, COO of Peak Power. “The funding from NRCan will enable us to provide drivers with more options for EV charging, while the smart nature of our Synergy tech in the chargers means grid operators don’t have to worry about capacity restraints when EVs are plugged into the grid. ZEVIP is critical to greater electrification of the country’s infrastructure, and we’re proud to support the initiative.”
Canada has invested a $1 billion since 2015 to make EVs more affordable and chargers more accessible for Canadians. Not only are the funds going to increase the number of EV chargers on Canada’s roads, but federal rebates of up to $5,000 help encourage more residents to drive electric.
An additional $1.7 billion is provided in the 2022 budget to extend the government’s purchase incentive program until March 2025 and to expand the types of vehicle models eligible under the program, which would include more vans, trucks and SUVs. Natural Resources Canada also received another $400 million to extend ZEVIP to March 2027, complemented by $500 million that Canada’s Infrastructure Bank will invest in large-scale ZEV charging and refuelling infrastructure. This is all in support of the government’s objective of adding 50,000 zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) chargers to Canada’s network, and another step toward reaching Canada’s target of ensuring all new passenger vehicles sold in Canada are zero-emission by 2035.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/12/massachusetts-bill-would-eliminate-clean-energy-choice/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 12, 2022",Massachusetts bill would eliminate clean energy choice,"Massachusetts residents’ rights to opt-in to alternative electricity suppliers that provide renewable energy may be stripped away in the newly introduced S.2842, a climate change focused bill. Proponents of this provision in the bill say that it will reduce predatory contracts, but opponents say it eliminates their personal choice, and hands monopoly control back to utilities like Eversource and National Grid.
In 2021, nearly half a million Massachusetts households shopped for electric suppliers other than their default utility company. The new bill proposes language that would close this market and ban competition in the state’s energy market.
This month, a petition signed by over 1,000 Massachusetts residents expressed that the bill would take away personal choice, reduce competition and innovation, and reduce renewable energy development and support.
Currently, three-quarters of the products offered in the program are 100% renewable energy contracts. Massachusetts law currently only mandates utilities to supply 51% renewable energy, meaning the bill could stand in the way of clean energy goals for the state.
“I have used alternative electricity sources under this program for 4 years. Pricing and service have always been quite competitive. Why would the Legislature want to end such a successful program and return Massachusetts to the age of monopolistic energy supply?” said David B. of Dover, Mass.
“Not only should we get to shop suppliers, but also delivery as we pay more for delivery than supply. Current rate I am paying is $0.06/kWh less than Eversource would charge. That would add 25-35% more per month to an already high electric bill,” said Ethan E, East Sandwich, Mass.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has been expressing concern about the energy choice program since her office launched an investigation into reports of deceptive contract practices. The report found that from July 2015 to June 2018, net losses for Massachusetts customers totaled $253 million.
In some cases, customers intentionally pay more to ensure they are supporting a 100% renewable energy supply, but in others, promises of savings were not met, and complex, predatory contracts were signed. Healy’s report said that low-income households and communities of color are disproportionately affected by higher bills under the program. In 2017 to 2018, low-income households lost an average of $166 over the course of the year.
“I’ve used 100% clean energy for years, and, since it’s totally optional for customers, I don’t understand why you would shut off this important option to consumers. If there are issues with some energy providers being bad actors, it’s best to regulate or deal with them and not totally close down the options to choose clean energy,” said James F. in Waltham, Mass.
“For those of us who are committed to buying 100% renewable energy, closing the market would be a HUGE step backwards for Massachusetts,” said Daniel J. of Beverly, Mass.
An online survey of 800 Massachusetts residents conducted on behalf of Clean Choice Energy found that residents overwhelmingly support the option to choose alternative suppliers. The survey found 83% of respondents want the freedom to choose clean energy for their homes, 79% want to be able to choose their supplier, and 73% would be interested in 100% clean energy contracts if given the option. Alternative energy suppliers are more popular than rooftop solar, with 74% of respondents voicing interest in the option, versus 50% of respondents saying they are interested in rooftop residential solar.
“Nearly 500,000 Massachusetts households already voted with their wallets, and most are accelerating the purchase of renewable energy – an option that Senate Bill 2842 (S. 2842) would take away,” said Christopher Ercoli, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Energy Advancement League. “When retail energy suppliers compete for your business, they have the incentive to offer better rates and service – not treat you like a captive ratepayer who pays whatever the utility mandates.”

East Point Energy currently has a 4.1 GW pipeline of early to mid-stage battery storage projects.
“The acquisition of East Point Energy represents Equinor’s entry into the US power market through flexible assets. It will enable Equinor to further unlock the potential we see in the renewables space in the US, capturing value from volatility in the power markets and providing reliable services to the grid,” said Olav Kolbeinstveit, senior vice president for power and markets within Renewables at Equinor.
Battery storage is key to Equinor’s strategy of supporting its portfolio of offshore wind, upstream oil and gas, as well as future opportunities in the hydrogen and renewables space. Last year Equinor invested in Noriker Power Limited, a battery storage developer in the United Kingdom. Equinor sees these acquisition as key to “lifting the return on our renewable portfolio while at the same time lowering the portfolio risk.”
East Point Energy will become a subsidiary of Equinor with its team continuing to develop the business, as well as adding capabilities to own and operate energy storage projects in the near future.
“We look forward to working together with East Point Energy to build a portfolio of battery storage assets in the US. This strengthens and diversifies our existing renewable energy offerings in the US, which includes substantial offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind,” said Siri Espedal Kindem, senior vice president for Equinor Renewables US.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/12/ev-battery-recycling-startup-claims-95-recovery-yield-using-10-times-less-energy/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 12, 2022",EV battery recycling startup claims 95% recovery yield using 10 times less energy,"SiTration, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) spinoff startup company, announced it raised a $2.35 million pre-seed funding round led by Azolla Ventures. The funds are expected to accelerate hiring and support development of its novel conductive membrane technology for the recycling of critical materials in electric vehicle batteries, including lithium, cobalt, and nickel.
SiTration said its filtration membrane technology can reduce the energy used for recycling by as much as 10 times, while recovering over 95% of the critical materials in the battery.
“Our vision is to minimize impact and maximize circularity in the life cycle of critical materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Brendan Smith, co-founder and CEO of SiTration.
The conductive membrane technology has been under research and development in MIT for several years. It is now preparing for commercialization, boosted by the seed funding round and the MIT-affiliated E14 Fund.
The process replaces conventional chemical and thermal separation methods with an electrified approach. SiTration said the technology has broad applicability across several different global industries, and it views the critical materials supply shortage for producing lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles as the most pressing need. Annual global EV sales are expected to increase from three million units in 2020 to more than 60 million by 2040, creating a significant need for the efficient reuse of rare-earth metals.
“To meet automaker’s existing electrification plans, lithium supply must increase 15 times over – and even if more supply weren’t an imperative, vehicle makers are required by regulation to responsibly retire batteries at end of life,” said Matthew Nordan, general partner at Azolla Ventures and member of SiTration’s board of directors. “SiTration is poised to deliver a cleaner and more efficient recycling technique that will unlock low-cost reuse of critical battery materials.”

“Assuming natural gas prices remain high,” the value that regulators set later this year for community solar projects built in 2023 will rise, “providing an incentive to install more solar and reduce customer exposure to gas,” said John Farrell, a director with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, in a post.
Utilities are passing on to their customers the higher prices they pay for natural gas, Farrell said, citing a Minnesota example. The price of natural gas, which ranged between $3 and $5 per million British thermal units in recent years, is now above $5, he said, citing US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, and noting that EIA predicts that the price will remain high through year-end.
Minnesota calculates the value of community solar projects based on five components, shown below with their weightings for projects built this year:
Because avoided fuel cost is the second-largest component of the total value, higher natural gas costs this year will be reflected in the state’s value of community solar next year. That will incentivize the installation of solar projects, Farrell said, and reduce price volatility for all electricity customers.
“The more that solar energy can displace the use of gas-fired energy, the less price volatility will impact customers,” he said.
The largest component of the value-of-solar calculation, avoided environmental cost, reflects the value of avoiding local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil generation with solar.
Minnesota’s value-of-solar approach assumes that natural gas is both the marginal fuel and the marginal generation capacity, said Gabriel Chan, associate professor at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, in an interview highlighted in Farrell’s post. But Chan said the region’s grid operator MISO reports that coal is the marginal fuel for over 50% of the hours in both summer and winter.
“Coal generation has become expensive on a marginal basis, and that’s pushed it in our wholesale markets to be a marginal fuel,” Chan said.
Minnesota currently has 837 MW of community solar.
