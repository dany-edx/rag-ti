That coupled with the increased frequency of long power outages is pushing more Americans to consider solar.
Homeowners are challenged to stretch their budgets now with inflation, supply chain challenges, and rising interest rates. Rocket Solar’s study asked homeowners which home essentials they are spending more on today than a year ago, 61% said electric power—second only to food (85%) and ahead of commuting (39%).

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in May of this year, the average U.S. household paid $o.1492 kWh for home electricity service, or an average increase of 5% over 2021. The increase was substantially higher in some parts of the country, such as New Hampshire, which saw rates shoot up about 50%.
While paying the electric bill is now a serious concern for many, having an unstable grid is another concern. The EIA reports that in 2020 the average U.S. electricity customer experienced just over 8 hours of power interruptions, the highest since it began keeping records in 2013. As of mid-July 2022, 44% of homeowners had already experienced at least one power outage this year, with an additional 4.9% saying they expect to have one but have not yet. Of those, 64.8% had at least two or more outages in 2021.

“Power outages impact my family greatly because we have a nine-month-old,” said one homeowner. “If the electricity goes out, I get very worried. We live where the heat index reaches 100 degrees and I can’t have my baby living in those conditions.”
Nearly three-quarters of the homeowners surveyed said they believe solar would decrease their electric bill, and nearly 30% said they would consider installing solar if their electric bills keep rising. It is becoming even more appealing to the study respondents as electric rates increase along with solar costs decreasing. An added incentive is the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act that increases the investment tax credit to 30% for the next ten years.
Aside from cost savings, just over 17% cited the environment as a reason to go solar. For about 10% of the respondents another reason to go solar is the potential increase in their home’s value.

The survey was conducted in July, when the company surveyed 1,560 single-family homeowners. The sample was controlled and divided equally among a combined sample of Gen Z and millennials, Gen X, and baby boomers. To make sure the participants had a clear understanding of their electric bill, those who weren’t individually responsible for their electric bill or didn’t have a significant other responsible for their electric bill were excluded from the study.
Rocket Solar is part of the Rocket family, which includes Rocket Mortgage, Homes, Loans and Auto. Rocket Solar teamed up with Palmetto, which leverages proprietary platform technology and energy intelligence solutions to accelerate the sale and adoption of clean energy. Palmetto connects homeowners with local sales and installation specialists to advance the clean energy economy in communities across the United States.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/25/landfill-solar-project-to-cover-63-of-south-portlands-municipal-electricity-needs/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MAINE",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 25, 2022",Landfill solar project to cover 63% of South Portland’s municipal electricity needs,"The City of South Portland has furthered its commitment to renewable energy, installing a 4.7 MW, 12,746 panel solar facility atop a landfill. The project is expected to offset 63% of the city’s municipal electric needs and save taxpayers over its 40-year expected commercial life.
“Thanks to this extraordinary collaborative effort, solar energy now powers the vast majority of municipal operations—a win for both the environment and taxpayers,” said City Manager Scott Morelli.
The project was financed via power purchase agreements managed by ReVision Energy. There was no upfront cost to the City of South Portland to initiate the project. Calibrant Energy, a distributed energy-as-a-service company, paid the upfront cost and the City will pay for the power generated by the project at a rate lower than utility-provided power.
With the project complete, more than 80% of South Portland’s municipal electricity needs are met by solar. The new 4.7 MW array is expected to offset 4,100 metric tons of annual carbon emissions, according to EPA statistics.
“Because the cost of solar technology has plummeted by 90% over the past two decades, the City of South Portland and its citizens will derive a strong economic and environmental return on this solar investment. And perhaps best of all, the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will further reduce clean energy costs in 2023 and beyond, making solar power, heat pumps, battery storage and electric vehicles the most attractive options for homeowners, businesses, nonprofits and municipalities.” Phil Coupe, co-founder of ReVision Energy.
The three-phase project began in 2017 with a 1 MW array, which was the largest municipal project in Maine at the time it was completed. In 2022, the project was expanded with a 474 kW Landfill East and 3.2 MW Landfill West. According to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, the combined projects represent the largest landfill solar project in the state.
ReVision Energy
“Delivering sustainable solar energy with flexible financing will provide economic and environmental benefits to the area for decades to come,” said Thomas Biddinger, director of partnerships at Calibrant Energy.
After seven years, the City has the option to purchase the system at a discount and own all the power generated by the system for the remainder of the 40-year commercial operation period.
The project employed local electricians, electrical apprentices, engineers, and other solar professionals during development and construction. The collaborative partnership for the multi-phase project began planning in 2013.
“Transitioning society from fossil fuels to renewable energy and clean technology is the biggest infrastructure project in the history of humankind, and one of the greatest wealth creation opportunities of the 21st century. The City of South Portland’s clean energy leadership is already saving taxpayers money while significantly reducing local carbon pollution,” said Coupe.
ReVision Energy is a 100% employee-owned solar company with offices in Portland and Montville, Maine; Brentwood and Enfield, New Hampshire; and North Andover, Massachusetts. The certified B-corp has over 350 employee co-owners, 10,000 installations, and 19 years of experience.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/25/50-states-of-solar-incentives-florida/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,FLORIDA",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 25, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Florida,"Florida has done well to establish itself as a large market for solar PV. The industry employed nearly 12,000 people in 2021 in the state, and it is home to 378 solar companies, the majority of which are installers and developers. In 2021, the state achieved 41% year-over-year growth in added rooftop solar capacity and surpassed 1 GW of cumulative installed rooftop solar.
Through Q2 2022, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports it has a cumulative 9.5 GW of capacity installed to date. This is enough electricity to power 1.1 million Florida homes.
However, for a state of over 21 million people, and one rich in sunlight, Florida could make even more strides in solar deployment with supportive policies. Currently, it has no established renewable portfolio standard and does not allow third-party power purchase agreements. These are two policies that have successfully driven solar buildout in other states.
Despite these policy shortcomings, Florida is expected to deploy significant amounts of solar at the utility-scale. SEIA projects it may install as much as 11 GW of solar over the next five years.
Incentives
Perhaps the most important policy for residential solar installations is net metering. The process allows homeowners to sell excess solar production back to the grid in exchange for bill credits. The two major utilities, Duke and FPL, both offer net metering programs.
Typically, when you add value to your home, it is reflected in your property tax assessment. But in Florida, as in many other states, residential solar installations are property tax exempt.
Solar is also sales tax exempt in Florida, as established by the CHP Sales Tax Exemption, reflecting a 6% savings.
Florida installations are also eligible for the federal solar Investment Tax Credit. The credit was recently extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 at 30% for the next decade. The tax credit applies to both solar and energy storage either combined or as standalone technologies.
Homeowners interested in learning about solar installers in their area can visit Solar Reviews for customer testimonial. The website also provides a calculator for estimating system size and expected bill savings.
Policy battles
Over the last year, a policy war was waged in Florida, under which environmentalists and rooftop solar supporters worked to block a bill that was set to phase down the value of net metering credits to near-zero. Following months of advocacy and political pressure, Governor Ron DeSantis bucked expectations and vetoed House Bill 741.
Had the bill been signed by Gov. DeSantis, starting in 2023, payments to solar customers would have regressed from a retail rate to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a minute fraction of the current retail rate. The phase out was set to slash payment rates to solar customers by 50% in four years and would drop further still to the avoided cost rate by 2029. The bill would have also allowed for fixed charges to grid connected solar customers starting in 2026, with no limit on the fixed charges outlined in the bill text.
The bill was founded on “cost shift” rhetoric, claiming that those using their own energy are raising the cost of service to those who don’t, usually in an economically disproportionate fashion. However, only about 90,000 of the 8.5 million electric customers in Florida are topped with solar. The utility argues that this 1% of Floridians are creating significant costs for the other 99%. Studies completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar.
In his veto, DeSantis described House Bill 741 as a burden itself, one that would “contribute to the financial crunch that our citizens are experiencing.”
SEIA president Abigail Ross Hopper celebrated the outcome. “Florida is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the country with new businesses popping up all across the state. This veto signals that Florida’s energy economy is open for business, and that the rights of state residents should be placed ahead of monopoly utility interests,” she said.
Notable project
This summer, Duke Energy Florida announced it completed construction of the Fort Green Renewable Energy Center, a 74.9 MW facility that will serve the utility’s Clean Energy Connection plan, which allows Duke customers to opt-in to sourcing a designated amount of capacity from the project on their monthly bill. The installation is the first in a 750 MW solar deployment plan by Duke.
The facility was built on about 500 acres of land, consisting of 265,000 panels mounted on a fixed-tilt racking system. At peak energy production, it is expected to produce enough power for roughly 23,000 homes.

Residents and small/medium businesses may join its new Clean Energy Connection “community” solar program. Applicants will be randomly selected to become subscribers to solar energy produced by the utility’s PV.
Under the program, customers can subscribe to kilowatt blocks of power, which are charged at $8.35/kW. The utility said a customer with an average usage of 1,000kWh a month could subscribe to about 5kW to cover their energy needs.
The bill credit rate tied to the solar production of a customer’s kW “block” will be $0.04/kWh for the first 36 months of the program, and then starting with the 37th month of continuous enrollment, the bill credit rate increases by 1.5% each year. This bill credit amount varies each month with the actual solar energy produced, meaning customer savings is tied to the successful production of the utility-owned solar facility.
Community solar offers an option to be connected with a carbon-free energy source for those who do not have a suitable roof space for PV. Generally, community solar projects are smaller than utility-scale plants, and are attached at the local distribution level, rather than to large-scale high voltage transmission infrastructure. This program, the Clean Energy Connection, supports the development and construction of Duke Energy Florida-owned solar, said the utility.
“Bringing cleaner resources onto the grid is important to our customers and our company,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida president. “By subscribing to the Clean Energy Connection program and supporting solar sites like this one, our customers are joining a community that is helping drive Florida to a cleaner energy future.”

Instead, Central plans to replace its share of about 1.1 GW of capacity from retiring coal units through power purchase agreements, utility-scale batteries, distributed energy resources, and participation in future power plants built in the state.
Central described utility-scale batteries as “a technology proven to be technically possible and currently being pursued by utilities all over the country.”
Distributed energy resources, Central explained, are “batteries, generators and demand-side management programs, all aggregated to represent a utility-scale solution.” When aggregated, the resources “become utility-scale and can be counted on as predictable generation capacity. These resources would grow out of FERC Order 2222, which has accelerated their advancement to utility scale.”
Central is a generation and transmission utility that aggregates power supply for 20 electric distribution cooperatives serving 860,000 customer accounts. The cooperative owns community solar and peaking generators but obtains most of its power through long-term purchase agreements with Santee Cooper, Duke Energy Carolinas, and the Southeastern Power Administration.
“There was not a meaningful cost difference in the top options that are available,” the cooperative said in a statement, saying that its analysts “supplement cost considerations with broader strategic goals and include independent risk assessments. Central’s members say they want competitively priced wholesale power costs, reliable delivery of energy, and, increasingly, they want supplier and fuel diversity.”
“I think there were several members of the staff and certainly a number of our board members who were surprised” at the decision of the cooperative’s board, said Robert Hochstetler, Central’s president and CEO. “But we went where our requirements and the opportunities took us. The solution had to be affordable, the power supply had to be reliable, and we needed to be ready by 2029,” when the last coal unit near Georgetown is set to retire.
With Central’s board having approved the overall plan, the utility will develop a detailed plan over the next year, Hochstetler said.
Coordination agreement
Central has already sourced solar power directly, rather than through a joint arrangement with Santee Cooper, by entering contracts with solar developers.
Direct sourcing was made possible by a 2013 coordination agreement between Central and Santee Cooper, which allows Central to opt out of any proposed Santee Cooper generating unit, and to independently meet its power needs that would otherwise have been met by its share of Santee Cooper’s proposed generating unit.
Central now receives about 70% of its wholesale power supply from Santee Cooper, and beginning in 2029, it will still receive more than half of its power from Santee Cooper, the cooperative said, “continuing the long and significant relationship the companies have benefited from for decades.”
Joint resource planning with Santee Cooper has identified the need for additional solar generation to economically meet the needs of the Central-Santee Cooper system, the cooperative said, adding that it “looks forward to the opportunity to participate in that process.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/25/solar-plus-storage-kept-the-lights-on-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-fiona/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,PUERTO RICO",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 25, 2022",Solar-plus-storage kept the lights on in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona,"Sunnova Energy International reports that its solar and battery storage systems powered the homes of over 30,000 customers in Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona, from September 18 to October 1, 2022, while the centralized power system was down.
During those two weeks most residents in Puerto Rico were without power, Sunnova reports that its SunSafe  solar-plus-storage systems generated a total of nearly 2 GWh of energy total with 3.4 million hours of aggregate back-up power, or an average of 128 hours of power generated per household.  These customers averaged 5.3 days of solar-plus-storage battery backup with many residents remaining dependent on their Sunnova system for more than 10 days.
“We’re proud of our long history and commitment to Puerto Rico that includes an investment of more than $1 billion in building residential solar and storage systems on the island. That investment meant 30,000 customers were able to keep the lights on and their families safe,” said John Berger, CEO of Sunnova. “We believe this demonstrates that in times of an emergency, a solar + storage system provides homeowners the peace of mind that comes with producing and storing their own power. As the largest provider of distributed residential solar power on the island, Sunnova is committed to providing Puerto Ricans with clean, resilient and affordable energy services backed by the best service in the industry.”

“Out of our more than 30,000 Sunnova SunSafe systems in Puerto Rico, only 59 required repair in the two weeks following the Hurricane, and Sunnova dispatched crews immediately to repair or replace non-performing systems, whether they were leased or owned,” said Michael Grasso, chief marketing and growth officer of Sunnova. “Looking ahead, we see an opportunity for distributed power to play a larger role in Puerto Rico by networking our solar + storage systems into powerful virtual power plants that would complement the centralized electric system and drive increased grid resiliency.”
Fiona was not the only hurricane to wreak havoc on Puerto Rico in recent years. In 2017 Hurricane Maria struck, wiping out power to some villages for months, giving rise to localized microgrids such as one set up in the village of Castañer, developed by the community in collaboration with The Solar Foundation and the Microgrid Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez. Since that time, Puerto Rico’s utility, PREPA, has been developing its integrated resource plan, which will include microgrids going forward.
In April 2019, Governor Rosselló signed legislation to move the island to 100% renewable energy. And understanding the need for backup power, last year the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority issued a request for proposals for a total of 3.75 GW or renewables and 1.5 GW of energy storage, which resulted in project bids for 800 MW of utility-scale solar and 220 MW of storage that were forwarded the Puerto Rico Energy Board for approval.  Just this month a second round of a tender scheme was issued, designed to allocate 3.75 GW of renewables capacity and 1.5 GW of storage.
