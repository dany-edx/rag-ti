DuraMAT has awarded $30 million to high-impact projects, and in 2021 was given an additional $36 million by SETO for six more years of funding. The funds will help the consortium continue to develop solar module materials science in pursuit of a 50-year life for PV.
“We are trying to shift into a reliability research mode where we’re directly targeting modules that last 50 years,” said Teresa Barnes, DuraMAT director. “We’re very focused on high-energy-yield modules and making those in a sustainable way. We know there are going to be big material and energy impacts from ramping up deployment as fast as we need for the energy transition. But our question is, ‘How can we do that in a way that’s environmentally sustainable and in a way that our supply chain can keep up?’”
Five Core Objectives
The consortium has five core objectives. First, it seeks to act as a central data resource, collecting and disseminating solar module reliability data, and applying the data to create insights. The DuraMAT database is a centralized source with the ability to ingest, curate, combine, analyze, and manage diverse datasets.
Second, DuraMAT provides fielded module forensics, quantifying and characterizing module failures in outdoor exposures and recording environmental effects. It said one of the biggest hurdles to studying degradation or failure in fielded modules is that frequent absence of a “reference” or control module. This core objective is designed to provide better understanding of PV material durability, and to generate practical, multi-modal data that guides next steps in materials and module design.
As a third objective, the team develops a multi-scale, multi-physics model to accelerate testing and quantitatively assess material degradation. ““We are now shifting our emphasis towards predictive testing and modeling methods that will enable us to assess reliability more quickly and more accurately in new technologies,” said Barnes.

Fourth, it provides module materials solutions, in which the consortium designs, develops, de-risks innovative materials and module architectures to address PV reliability issues. The group has worked to characterize failure modes, develop crack tolerant metallization, and design recyclable backsheets. It has also developed technical requirements and materials guidelines that have enabled thin-film module development.
And as a final core objective, the consortium uses disruptive acceleration science to test materials. Using aggressive conditions like pressing modules with rings to simulate bending, or with sound waves to mimic the warping effect of wind, the consortium stress-tests modules to see how they would perform in the toughest conditions and over long stretches of time.

“If solar is going to expand and become this ubiquitous technology that we have across our power system, on our houses—and be responsible for 40% of our electricity generation—old technologies are not enough,” said Barnes. “PV modules need to be made more efficient, less expensive, and more sustainably at much larger scale. But we also need to know that these new modules—whether they’re new module designs or new cell technologies like bifacial or tandem cells—will perform predictably in the field.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/15/rfp-alert-500mw-of-pv-for-indiana-michigan-power/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA,MICHIGAN",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 15, 2022",RFP Alert: 500MW of PV for Indiana Michigan Power,"Indiana Michigan Power (I&M), a portfolio company of American Electric Power, issued a request for proposals (RFP) for 500MW of solar capacity and 800MW of wind. The request comes as a first step in implementing the utility’s Next Tomorrow Plan, which calls for 2GW of renewable energy capacity to be added to the utility’s generation mix.
Currently, the utility owns five solar facilities and buys power from four Indiana wind power plants. The company said it generated over 80% of its energy emission-free in 2021.
I&M said it expects some renewables spurred by this RFP to be online in 2024, with the remainder of the 1.3GW online as early as the end of 2025. The RFP is open and non-discriminatory, opening the door for bidders to incorporate changes like battery storage, emerging technologies, and other resources to supplement the portfolio and provide optimum performance and affordability.
“These new resources will combine with I&M’s existing generation to provide an even more diversified and flexible generation portfolio that will stabilize energy costs over time, stimulate economic growth, reduce emissions and take advantage of new technologies,” said Dave Lucas, I&M vice president of regulatory and finance.
The RFP calls for projects located in Indiana or Michigan, and preference will be given to projects that demonstrate local impact or encourage the use of local resources.
Bids are due April 21, and contracts are expected to be awarded this year. The selected projects will be subject to approval by state regulatory commissions. Charles River Associates is serving as independent monitor for the RFP process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/15/school-and-municipal-solar-project-complete-in-new-york-state/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 15, 2022",School and municipal solar project complete in New York State,"Four individual ground-mount solar arrays that total 11.52MW were recently completed for members of the Tri-County Energy Consortium,  a New York-based intergovernmental cooperative of schools and municipalities created for the procurement of renewable energy generating facilities for its members. The solar installations, owned by Standard Solar, will serve 28 school districts and municipalities.
Some of the challenges during the installation included changes to New York’s solar policy, clean up on site, as well the pandemic. Before the installation could begin, a fairly significant cleanup took place on the land, which had been used to store cars, car parts, and other debris, according to Mark Richardson, CEO, U.S. Light Energy, the project’s developer.
“It wasn’t exactly a brownfield,” said Richardson, “but it required working with the landowner on a significant cleanup project.” The project took about five years to complete and in that time New York went through various changes in policy, compensation mechanisms, and more. Also this project is connected to a higher-than-normal voltage system, so that provided some additional challenges–but, working with National Grid, U.S. Light Energy was able to come up with “interesting and unique” solutions, Richardson said.
“This project’s success is underscored by the variety of challenges the team had to overcome,” said Mark Richardson,
The approximately $7.6 million project received more than $1 million in funding from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) through NY-Sun, the state’s signature $1.8 billion initiative to advance the scale-up of solar and make solar energy more accessible to homes, businesses, and communities. Each participating school district and local government will receive savings on their electric bills in proportion to the percentage of electricity they use out of the total for all participants.
“Members of the Consortium will collectively save between $400-$500/K annually from the arrays,” said John Warneck, Executive Director of the Tri-County Energy Consortium.
The project moves New York one step closer to its goal of achieving 50% of the state’s electricity supply from renewable energy sources by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/15/concentrating-solar-power-with-heat-storage-could-compete-with-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 15, 2022",Concentrating solar power with heat storage could compete with batteries,"Concentrating solar power plus thermal energy storage (CSP+TES) could be cost-competitive with battery storage for achieving a least-cost 100% renewables grid in the continental US, researchers have found.
For seasonal storage, power-to-gas-to-power had lower costs than CSP+TES.
Researchers used a simple model of the grid that assumed free lossless transmission across the continental US. They said their results could guide future studies using more detailed models, and expected that a model realistically representing transmission would not fundamentally alter the relative roles of the generation and storage technologies they evaluated. The study was published in the journal Advances in Applied Energy.
With CSP, mirrors direct sunlight onto receivers containing a heat transfer fluid, and the heat is used to run a steam turbine. Adding thermal energy storage allows electricity to be generated later.
CSP alone costs more than solar PV, and when researchers ran the model without TES, it selected no CSP. But TES costs less than battery storage, and when TES is added to CSP, the technology combination becomes competitive with batteries, the study found. The system cost savings of adding CSP+TES to a system with batteries was slight, at only 0.07 cents/kWh.
For increased uptake of the combined technology, cost reductions for CSP would be more important than cost reductions for TES. Yet ongoing cost reductions for batteries, as projected by NREL, would counter increased uptake of CSP+TES.
With power-to-gas-to-power (PGP) technology, renewable power is used to generate hydrogen from water, using electrolyzers. The hydrogen is later used to generate electricity using fuel cells, in the approach modeled by the researchers.
Seasonal storage needs in a 100% renewables grid were met with PGP storage capacity reaching 89,000GWh, the model showed. Short term-storage, typically with daily cycling, was met with far less capacity: 620GWh of thermal energy storage capacity, supplying 0.6% of total electricity supply, and 350GWh of battery storage capacity.
Demand response was represented in the model by allowing the system to supply less than the historical use profile “by paying a high cost.” Efforts to increase demand flexibility “could minimize the value” of CSP+TES, the authors said.
When methane gas units at varying percentages of generation were permitted, in a sensitivity analysis, the model selected batteries when methane gas generation was reduced to 5%, selected PGP with methane gas at or below 2%, and selected CSP+TES with methane gas at or below 0.1%.
The open-access article presents all cost elements for the generation and storage technologies considered, and is titled “The role of concentrated solar power with thermal energy storage in least-cost highly reliable electricity systems fully powered by variable renewable energy.”
