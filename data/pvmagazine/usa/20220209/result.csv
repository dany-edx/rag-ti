In October of last year, Fluence acquired AMS’ software and digital intelligence platform for renewables and energy storage. The platform is designed to improve revenue of energy storage assets in wholesale markets. AMS’ technology uses artificial intelligence, advanced price forecasting, portfolio optimization and market bidding to ensure energy storage and flexible generation assets are responding optimally to price signals sent by the market.
The way the Fluence IQ Bidding Application works is it recommends bids into daily and hourly auctions for energy and grid services, anticipating opportunities using advanced forecasting to take advantage of favorable pricing, while minimizing exposure to unfavorable pricing.
Fluence said its AI software supports over 6GW of contracted or operating assets globally. “Our software-as-a-service model enables us to rapidly integrate with customers’ assets, scale across geographies and technology types, and ensure superior performance as markets change,” said Seyed Madaeni, Fluence SVP and chief digital officer.
“By implementing and utilizing cutting-edge automated bidding software for our projects, we will be able to improve grid reliability and efficiency while also supporting our customers’ green energy transitions in a safe and reliable way,” said Leo Moreno, AES clean energy president.
The Fluence IQ Bidding Application is available in two markets: the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market and the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). In Australia it is used by energy asset owners in Australia to optimize approximately 20% of all grid-scale wind and solar energy assets bidding into the NEM.
Fluence reports that as of September 30, 2021, it has more than 3.6GW of energy storage deployed or contracted in 30 markets globally, and more than 4.7 GW of wind, solar, and storage assets optimized or contracted in Australia and California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/09/another-anti-circumvention-case-filed-against-southeast-asian-countries-said-roth/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,ASIA,CALIFORNIA,CAMBODIA,CHINA,MALAYSIA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022","Another anti-circumvention case filed against Southeast Asian countries, said ROTH","Another round of anti-circumvention cases have been filed against Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and now Cambodia, reports ROTH Capital Partners in an industry note. US-based panel assembler Auxin Solar added its name to the petition.
This comes just months after the Commerce Department tossed out an earlier similar request by an anonymous group of solar companies that sought tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules. About 80% of US crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. Auxin claims Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to these countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
ROTH said under this case, all crystalline-silicon modules from each of the four countries could be subject to a tariff. Unlike the first case, this one is designed to be focused on entire countries, rather than specific companies. This new petition adds Cambodia, as Auxin claimed Chinese companies were moving operations to the country in anticipation of tariffs. Historically, Cambodia contributes less than 3% of all US C-Si module imports.
Thin-film modules are exempt in this petition. The ROTH note said the new filing “cures all the deficiencies” of the first anti-circumvention case. It said that this filing was a numerically based decision.
The note added that the Department of Commerce is expected to take on the case. The Biden administration may not have the same ability to block the tariffs as in Section 201, as there are procedures in place to prevent interference, it said.
Even if the case is denied, ROTH said there is significant risk of other strategies being taken by the petitioners. In a webinar, ROTH explained how the America COMPETES Act could be used in a similar fashion to achieve the group’s goals.
This latest filing may come as bad news for US utility-scale solar developers. The dismissal of the earlier anti-circumvention case was celebrated by Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), which vigorously opposed the 2021 request by American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) for anti-dumping and anti-circumvention tariffs. In a statement, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called the decision to reject the petitions a “major victory for America’s 231,000 solar workers.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/09/the-new-terrasmart-and-its-vision-for-the-future-of-us-renewables/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,QUALITY,RACKING,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022",The new Terrasmart and its vision for the future of US renewables,"In November 2021, Gibraltar’s RBI Solar, SolarBOS, Sunfig and TerraSmart legacy brands announced that they would be unifying under a single brand and identity, Terrasmart, to deliver seamless solutions across the solar project lifecycle, in order to mitigate risks, streamline development, and create unified solutions for customers, according to the company.
However, laying out goals and actively working and making progress on achieving them are two different things all together, so pv magazine sat down with Terrasmart President, Ed McKiernan to discuss the implications of the integration, ideas behind the new identity, and his company’s vision of their role in the US’ transition to renewable energy.
“Customers need options,” said McKiernan. “They need options to figure out what the right solution set is. And then once they figure that out, they need sort of a box of Lego bricks that’s flexible enough that they can fit it one way or another, because they’re not going to do the same cookie-cutter project every single time. That’s what led us to even start thinking about acquiring other companies to add together.”
This idea of options, and more so one centralized offering that can bring all of the different services that the Terrasmart brand now offers into one experience, has been part of Gibraltar’s long-term vision of their place in the US energy landscape since long before the idea of consolidating and unifying their brands was proposed.

Gibraltar first entered the solar space in 2015 when it acquired RBI Solar, a mounting solutions provider for commercial, utility-scale, and carport solar projects. That acquisition was followed by the 2018 purchase of SolarBOS, an electrical balance-of-systems company. The company kicked off 2021 by acquiring Sunfig, a project software services company, for $3.75 million. A short time later, Gibraltar paid $220 million for TerraSmart, which provides screw-based, ground-mount solar racking technology, and the pieces for what would soon become the new Terrasmart were all put into place.
These acquisitions all provided an opportunity for Gibraltar to expand its footprint in the U.S. market by becoming an end-to-end, turnkey provider of ground-mount infrastructure, tracker tech, and design software, but the solution still needed identity.
Why Terrasmart?
If you’re four brands, then the first message you’ve given your own employees is hold on to that legacy identity,” said McKiernan. “Just changing the logo, just changing the name, that is not sufficient, the rest of it goes to aligning your employees around the strategy, helping them to understand why we’re making that change, and then looking at our daily operating behaviors, and changing so that when customers look for that experience, we can support it.”
Part of the decision came down to the idea that, even if these legacy brands were all inter-operating and working with the same customers, the landscape of different teams and identities, to customers, would feel the same as working with four entirely unrelated companies.
“If we had stayed as we were before, we would just be misaligned with our strategy and not giving our customers what they wanted,” asserted McKiernan. “It’s the power of changing the brand that’s on your email, the halls of the building you walk through, the clothing you wear, the products you sell, changing everything. What we do individually doesn’t matter as much as what we do collectively.”
Terrasmart, the brand’s chosen identity, comes with a dual meaning. The first is a literal translation of the name Terrasmart — earth smart — which is how the company sees solar: a smart solution, not just for customers and energy buyers, but for the planet. A smarter choice in energy for the earth.
The way the company looks to present this value outwardly is through its broad, technology-agnostic portfolio of hardware and services. The company’s paramount goal is to be able to plug and play whatever solution is required for the best solution on every site – no matter the condition.
Since the initial rebranding, McKiernan has identified another meaning behind the name, a natural extension of the first’s philosophy: not just doing smart things for the earth, but with the earth. According to McKiernan, this comes down to getting the most out of every project site and variable condition that they can, in order to deliver an optimized project to the customer.
Their products interact and have a relationship with the earth, and the vision is to utilize the land they have to the fullest, in order to deliver the cleanest solution possible.
Areas of innovation
For Terrasmart to achieve its goal of being a one-stop solution provider of solar projects for its customers, McKiernan shares that Terrasmart has targeted four areas of development and focus: developing and innovating its tracker platform, advancing its balance of systems wiring solutions, developing additional intelligent operation options for trackers, and starting work on some of the company’s futuristic ideas, which include hybrid approaches combining elements of trackers and fixed-tilt racking, as well as reducing the amount of steel the company uses in its solutions.
The aspect of steel usage is an interesting one for Terrasmart, as the company fabricates its own steel structures in house. The reason is that this allows Terrasmart to switch up their operations “on a dime,” as McKiernan puts it, in order to accomodate design and timeline changes for customers.
Sourcing the steel to enable this process, however, has become more challenging.
“In today’s environment, being able to buy steel from the right people is very hard to do,” said McKiernan. “There’s not any excess capacity in the steel industry. If you’re on the outside looking in, you might have to go halfway around the world to get your steel. That would be a big problem between duties and freight to get it. And then of course, your ability to react to changing project schedules, if that’s where you’re pulling your steel from, is very challenged.”
Operating in the US
Despite the size of the company and scope of operations, Terrasmart has and will continue to dedicate its efforts in the US renewable energy space, driven by the company’s “Power of Focus” philosophy and the idea that less is more.
“If you look at RBI Solar, and the legacy TerraSmart businesses that were started in the late 2000s, they are massive in the racking space,” explained McKiernan. “They are truly founders in the space and feel a lot of responsibility that we can’t take our eye off the ball in the US to go figure out how to execute internationally.”
Could the company expand to offer its services across the Atlantic or Pacific, sure, but what’s harder to establish overseas is the start-to-finish solar system experience that the company is developing. Moving internationally, the company would become a step in the development process. When the vision is to become the process, stepping out of that framework because singular opportunities arrive here or there weakens the overall mission.
“The customers that have brought us to this point are here in the US,” said McKiernan. “They demand a lot from us and we take those obligations very seriously. Our strategy is to grow with them, and we think that, you know, we would be penny wise and pound foolish by chasing opportunities on foreign soil.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/09/xcel-energy-to-add-2-5gw-of-solar-by-2030/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,MINNESOTA",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022",Xcel Energy to add 2.5GW of solar by 2030,"Regulators in Minnesota have voted unanimously to issue an order in Xcel Energy’s 2020 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), directing the utility to procure 2.5GW of new solar by 2030, establish a stakeholder group to address energy equity, and require distributed energy resources like solar to be included in the company’s future resource plans.
Alongside these renewable commitments, the decision also includes no capacity for new gas plants, a considerable win for renewable energy advocates, as the utility had, at one point, proposed three new gas plants in a draft of the IRP.
Influential in driving this decision was the testimony of Vote Solar, The Institute for Local Self Reliance, Cooperative Energy Futures, and the Environmental Law and Policy Center, as those organizations advocated for the necessity of widespread distributed solar during the proceedings. The groups submitted written testimony which showed that investing heavily in local solar power is the lowest-cost path for Xcel to meet future electricity demand while also creating local jobs, cleaner air, and more affordable energy bills for Minnesota families.
Under the equity provision of the order, regulators called on Xcel to develop energy efficiency and clean energy programs that ensure equitable access to low income and Black, Indigenous, and communities of color across Minnesota. Xcel has also been directed to work with these communities to ensure that future energy planning advances equity in energy service delivery, workforce hiring, and community benefits.
“Black and brown communities have shouldered the heaviest burdens of our aging fossil fuel infrastructure for far too long,” said General Manager at Cooperative Energy Futures, Timothy DenHerder-Thomas. “As we move forward into a clean energy future, it’s essential that we’re centering the needs of these communities and ensuring that the benefits of renewable energy are distributed equitably.”
As for what this scope of solar means for Xcel’s greater energy portfolio, past reports have outlined that Xcel’s largest single-site solar plant in Minnesota is the North Star project, with a capacity of 100 MW. The state’s largest source of solar power is its Community Solar Garden program, which has 789 MW of capacity across 400 sites.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/09/acore-calls-for-quick-elimination-of-an-anti-renewable-rule-in-new-england/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022",ACORE calls for quick elimination of an anti-renewable rule in New England,"ACORE has flagged that a proposal by New England transmission grid operator ISO-NE to remove the “minimum offer price rule” from its capacity market in 2025 represents a two-year delay from ISO-NE’s plan last May to end the rule in 2023. 
The rule, known as MOPR, applies only to new generation resources on the grid. It sets a minimum price for new resources to offer capacity on the forward capacity market. Existing generation resources can box out new resources from the capacity market by bidding capacity at a price below the MOPR minimum.  
In New England, renewables and storage make up 96% of proposed generation but only 10% of existing generation.  
Extending the MOPR rule for New England capacity markets will “keep clean energy from competing in the regional capacity markets for another two years,” said ACORE President and CEO Gregory Wetstone. He said the “anti-renewable” rule should be “quickly removed.”  
ISO-NE announced it will file its plan to extend MOPR through 2025 with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the coming weeks. 
While solar alone may have a modest year-round capacity value in New England, when both solar and storage are present on a regional grid, each increases the capacity value of the other, said an ACORE report last November. Proposed storage additions in New England nearly match proposed solar additions. 
FERC Chairman Richard Glick said at a conference last year that transmission system operators should be allowed “to come up with an approach that’s different on the current MOPR rules around the country…but to the extent they don’t come up with something, I think we have an obligation, under the Federal Power Act, to act where rates and terms of these markets are unjust and unreasonable.” 
In the 13-state region served by transmission system operator PJM, the MOPR rule increases PJM’s market clearing price for capacity, costing electricity consumers at least $1.1 billion per year, as estimated in a 2020 study by consulting firm Grid Strategies. 
ACORE’s membership includes renewables developers and manufacturers, institutional investors, corporate offtakers, and “the country’s most forward-leaning utilities,” says the group’s website.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/09/water-based-electrolysis-for-green-hydrogen-earns-funding/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022",Water-based electrolysis for green hydrogen earns funding,"Verdagy, a company that is developing a water-based electrolyzer for green hydrogen production, announced it achieved funding to scale its technology. The $25 million funding round was led by TDK Ventures, Orbia, BHP Ventures, Doral Energy, Tech Ventures, Kholsa Ventures, Shell Ventures, and Temasek.
The technology is designed to provide hydrogen fuel for heavy industrial applications, a sector responsible for about one third of global emissions. The electrolyzer can reduce its carbon impact by being supplied with sources like solar and wind.
Verdagy spun-off from chemical company Chemetry in May 2021, developing a novel design to water electrolysis. The company’s device splits water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules through an electric current. The membrane-based technology uses large active area cells, high current densities, and broad operating ranges to deliver hydrogen at scale.
The company said its industry-largest cells operate at energy densities ten times higher than traditional alkaline water electrolysis. The company said it has a load shedding ability of 95% to reduce energy costs maximize production.
Analysts are now predicting that the global green hydrogen market will reach $89 billion by 2030, said Verdagy. Rising demand and falling costs has led to both renewable energy and electrolysis prices falling 50-60% every five years, said the company.
Verdagy operates a pilot plant in Moss Landing, California, a hotbed for large-scale energy storage and solar development.
“We believe that green hydrogen at the right scale and cost is key to decarbonizing industrial processing of steel, aluminum, cement and chemicals—and in combination with captured CO2, enables the production of other chemical feedstocks and liquid fuels for marine and aviation applications,” said Sameer Bharadwaj, CEO of Orbia. “Orbia hopes to contribute to Verdagy’s success with its expertise in basic and advanced materials, large-scale chemical processes and a keen focus on decarbonization technologies that support a sustainable future.”
Orbia said it is simultaneously investing in food security and growth, water management, infrastructure development, data access, health advancement and sustainable energy, energy storage and decarbonization alongside hydrogen electrolysis.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/09/t-mobile-nexamp-partner-on-community-solar/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 9, 2022","T-Mobile, Nexamp partner on community solar","T-Mobile has entered into a long-term agreement to participate in Nexamp’s New York community solar program, as a part of T-Mobile’s broader efforts to achieve its science-based carbon emissions targets.
Under the terms of the deal, T-Mobile has subscribed to 10 separate Nexamp solar farms representing more than 50MW of total project capacity across Maine, Massachusetts and New York.
10 projects broken down by state, total size and utility:
T-Mobile is an offtaker on each of these projects, with the remainder of the project’s power allocated to residential customers in their respective utility zones.
While T-Mobile will realize significant savings through discounted credits applied to its electric bills in three different utility zones, having such a large anchor tenant guaranteeing the viability of 10 projects will allow local electric customers interested in participating in clean energy to subscribe to the projects and receive discounts on their electricity bills.
Back in 2018, T-Mobile was the first wireless provider to commit to the RE100 goal of sourcing 100% of its total electricity use with renewables by the end of 2021, and in early 2022 the company announced that it had done it. To achieve that benchmark, T-Mobile developed a renewable energy strategy that includes virtual power agreements, retail agreements, a Green Direct program, unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates, as well as subscriptions to community solar installations.
This recent agreement is similar to one Nexamp came to with Walmart in New York, when the retail giant agreed to be the anchor subscriber supporting support 129 MW of community solar projects across the state. Walmart subscribed to a total of 23 projects, representing roughly 50MW of capacity.
In August 2021, Nexamp closed a $440 million senior secured credit facility for a 380 MW portfolio of solar and energy storage assets. The portfolio covers five states and includes some 100 community solar projects, including energy storage capacity totaling 120 MWh. MUFG Union Bank served as the lead arranger for the syndicated financing, which included a group of lenders. At the time, Nexamp said it has nearly 300 new solar and storage projects in its development pipeline.
NRG served as the RFP consultant for T-Mobile, and Nexamp will be the long-term owner of the projects.
