https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/31/nova-scotia-power-net-metering-fee-may-stall-industry-in-its-tracks/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Nova Scotia Power net-metering fee may stall industry in its tracks,"Nova Scotia Power recently announced a proposal to charge fees to customers who sell renewable power back to the grid. According to a report by The Canadian Press, Nova Scotia Power president and CEO Peter Gregg  said that without the fee, homeowners who generate their own electricity using solar panels are currently being subsidized by other customers. Gregg justifies the fee, saying that it will ensure fairness for all customers.
Nova Scotia Power, a subsidiary of Emera Inc., applied to the provincial regulator last week to charge solar customers about $8 per kilowatt of electricity. For a typical 10kW net-metered installation, the fee would amount to $960 per year, essentially doubling the payback period for solar customers who currently take in about $1,800 in annual savings.
“Nova Scotia Power is acting like it just found out it has to get off coal, and now they want Nova Scotia residents to foot the bill,” says Tynette Deveaux with Sierra Club Canada Foundation’s Beyond Coal Atlantic campaign. “They’re treating clean renewable energy as a luxury that the company can’t afford—and we know that’s not true.”
Nova Scotia’s solar industry is in its early stages, with only about 4,000 installations to date. Opponents of this proposal say it could decimate the industry before it’s even started, and it is not in alignment with the Sustainable Development Act passed in 2019. The Act calls for carbon levels in 2030 that are 53% below what they were in 2005; and net zero by 2050. Since then, the provincial government announced commitments to power all government offices with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and to close coal plants by 2030.
“This announcement makes it very clear we need to work together to break Nova Scotia Power’s monopoly and make it possible for municipalities and individual homeowners and businesses to participate in a rapid transition to clean renewable energy—without being penalized,” said Gretchen Fitzgeral, Sierra Club Canada’s National Program Director.
In a media release issued on Friday, “Time to Break Up with Nova Scotia Power“, Sierra Club Canada announced its Power to the People campaign, calling on Nova Scotians to demand energy democracy.

Operations of the joint venture are expected to begin this year. Initial investment in the venture included an evenly split $650 million from the three parties.
Lack of publicly available EV charging infrastructure for commercial fleets, especially in long-haul operations, remains one of the most significant hurdles to the electrification of trucking, said Daimler. The parties shared plans to deploy a network of charging station routes along the east and west coasts and in Texas by 2026. The plans call for leveraging existing infrastructure and amenities while adding greenfield sites in anticipation of a rising customer base. The first phase of construction is planned for 2023, said Daimler.
The project will initially focus on medium- and heavy-duty battery EV, followed by hydrogen fueling stations. The sites are also planned to be accessible to light-duty passenger vehicles.
NextEra Energy Resources, a global solar and wind generator, has significant investments in EV charging infrastructure, and will bring experience in optimizing renewable energy, resiliency and grid integration. The group of three said it seeks to invest over $9.5 billion in total commitments across 350 solar and wind projects, as well as battery energy storage and charging infrastructure.
Daimler plans to begin the production of the battery electric freightliner eCascadia and eM2 in 2022-23, and additionally builds walk-in vans, school buses, and other fleet vehicles. The automaker partnered with Portland General Electric to build the nation’s first public charging site for commercial electric vehicles.
Investment manager BlackRock has over $65 billion in client commitments. Its renewables arm is one of the largest renewable power equity investment platforms globally. “The commercial transportation sector is a significant contributor to carbon emissions and we firmly believe that decarbonization of transportation will be a critical societal focus for the next decade.,” said David Giordano, head of BlackRock’s Renewable Power Group.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/31/maxeon-to-offer-adhesive-back-contact-solar-panels-in-us/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Maxeon to offer IBC solar panels in the US,"Maxeon Solar Technologies announced an expanded push in the US commercial and industrial (C&I) solar market, entering an agreement with performance and protection plan provider Omnidian. The company will sell its integrated back contact (IBC) solar panels with an attached performance assurance product from Omnidian. The move builds on Maxeon’s current presence in the US as a utility-scale solar developer.
The IBC solar cells feature back contact energy conversion, allowing the entire front of the cell to absorb sunlight without any shading from metal ribbons like the ones found PERC cells.
Seattle-based Omnidian said it will bundle one year of its Shield plan for commercial systems larger than 250 kW sold by Maxeon, with the option to extend coverage for multiple years. The partnership is expected to facilitate access for Maxeon to reach Omnidian’s C&I customers.
“With responsibility for the oversight of over 1,800 Megawatts of U.S. solar capacity, Omnidian is a formidable and pioneering force in the industry and has gained extensive expertise in protecting and accelerating investments in clean energy,” said Jeff Waters, CEO of Maxeon Solar Technologies.
The Omnidian Shield plan includes system protection, preventative maintenance, covered corrective maintenance, monitoring, and a 95% forecasted energy cash-back guarantee. The support included 24/7 monitoring, intelligent system diagnostics, and real-time symptom detection. The company said its cash-back guarantee shifts risks away from the solar asset owners and helps address uncertainty with weather.
Omnidian CEO Mark Liffman hailed Maxeon’s product reliability upon the partnership. “An in-depth analysis of the degradation of Maxeon IBC panels revealed a significantly lower rate of degradation relative to other manufacturers enabling us to offer plans with lower degradation under this partnership,” he said.
Headquartered in Singapore, Maxeon designs and manufactures both Maxeon and SunPower brand solar panels, with operations in over 100 countries. In November, the company’s chief revenue officer Mark Babcock joined pv magazine to announce the launch of its pencil-thin adhesive back contact Air panels in Europe. The lightweight panels are designed for the large number of low-load commercial and industrial roofs on older buildings throughout western Europe.
Babcock also said the company was mulling a potential US cell manufacturing facility, but the company is waiting on a handful of policy changes first. He said a 3 GW cell fab would depend on the approval of a US Department of Energy loan, the passing of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, and the possible passing of the climate portion of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act. Pending these conditions, Maxeon said it may begin producing cells in the US as soon as 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/31/microgrid-project-using-vanadium-redox-flow-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Microgrid project using vanadium redox flow battery,"San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) and Sumitomo Electric (SEI) completed a zero-emissions microgrid pilot project using a vanadium redox flow (VRF) battery.
Microgrids, mini power grids that can operate independently of the larger grid and keep critical facilities powered during emergencies and power shut downs, are becoming more important in states like California that have seen a dramatic increase in wildfires, critical weather events, and other causes. Just last week about 6,000 SDG&E customers were without power due to unknown causes.
The 5-year demonstration project is located in the Bonita community in south San Diego County. The 2MW VRF battery at the heart of the demonstration project can store 8MW hours of energy,  potentially enough to power the equivalent of about 1,000 homes for up to four hours. In one of the test runs the 2MW/8MWh VRF battery powered 66 residential and commercial customers for close to five hours.
“Climate conditions increasingly threaten the continuity of essential services that our customers expect and deserve from us, which is one of the many reasons we are so focused on innovation and technology,” said SDG&E CEO Caroline Winn. “There is a critical need to develop breakthrough solutions like zero-emissions microgrids to not only minimize disruptions, but to also support the transition to a cleaner, safer and more reliable energy grid of the future.”
Different from more prevalent stacked lithium-ion battery cells, VRF batteries consist of tanks of liquid electrolytes and pumps that charge and discharge electrons to the grid. According to the U.S. Energy Department, VRF technology has several upsides including the potential to store MWh of power in simple designs, the ability to discharge power for up to 12 hours at a time, and the fact that VRF batteries do not present a fire hazard and use no highly reactive or toxic substances, can sit idle for long periods of time without losing storage capacity, and more. Downsides include the fact that VRBs generally have lower energy densities than other battery types (although increased energy density would help reduce costs and broaden applications), the standby current drain can lead to power loss, the technology’s  small operating temperature window requires the use of air conditioning systems that can result in significant energy losses, and the cost of the vanadium electrolyte.
During the pilot, the batteries charged when solar energy was abundant and discharged during peak hours to meet demand.
The microgrid demonstration project was completed late last year and included two successful tests. One was a seamless transition in which customers did not experience any loss of power when they were transitioned to the microgrid for electric service. The other was a black start, where microgrid operators established and sustained service after a complete loss of power. Customers experienced a momentary outage before they were transitioned to the microgrid, which operated in island mode separate from the power grid. The microgrid provided energy service as expected, even on a cloudy day when solar power output was not optimal.
SDG&E began operating the first utility-scale microgrid in America in 2013 in Borrego Springs and is currently in the process of upgrading it to run on 100% renewable energy. The utility is building four additional microgrids and is on track to integrate about 145MW of utility-owned energy storage with the local grid in 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/31/indiana-utilitys-net-metering-calculation-overturned-in-court/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Indiana utility’s net metering calculation overturned in court,"It has been nearly five years since Indiana Senate Bill 309 was signed into law as Senate Enrolled Act 309 (SEA 309) by Gov. Eric Holcomb in May 2017, a law which significantly reduced the rates that the state’s net metering customers received and which contributed to the relatively limited rooftop solar and larger distributed generation (DG) market within the state.
SEA 309 phased out retail rate net metering and replaced the former 1:1 kilowatt-hour bill credit with a much smaller credit based on 125% of the utilities wholesale rate. That change in compensation resulted in a bill credit that is approximately 70-80% lower than what customers receive for retail rate net metering.
While this changed the level of compensation that solar homeowners would receive, it did not change the method by which the compensation rate would be applied. Homeowners would still be credited at that rate, multiplied by the kWh difference between the electricity that they imported from the grid and the electricity they exported to the grid.
One of the state’s investor-owned utilities, CenterPoint, attempted to change how the bill credit was calculated on customers’ monthly bills by eliminating this netting altogether, replacing it with a tariff provision that charged DG customers the retail rate for every kWh delivered by the utility and credited customers at the much lower 125% of wholesale rate for every kWh of energy delivered by the customer to the grid.
This change was initially approved by Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, but was challenged in the Indiana Court of Appeals by a broad coalition of solar companies, environmental and consumer advocates, led by the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor. On January 28, the coalition won their appeal, and the decision was overturned.
CenterPoint’s proposed calculation had the potential to be approved and become the calculation methodology used by all investor-owned utilities within the state. Advocates argued that if the approval was achieved, the tariff provision was expected to drastically slow down rooftop solar adoption in the state.
“Fair, accurate compensation is the key to expanding residential solar,” said Vote Solar’s Regulatory Director of the Midwest, Will Kenworthy, who served as an expert witness in the proceeding. “CenterPoint’s proposal was neither fair nor accurate, and I’m glad the court recognizes that. Monthly netting makes sense and is a win for Indiana ratepayers who use their hard-earned money to add more solar to the grid.”
With nearly 1,350MW of solar in all forms installed in the state thus far, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, Indiana has been by no means a national leader in supporting the resource, but is one of the handful of states to have more than 1 GW of installed capacity. Over the next five years, however, the state is expected to add 5,971MW of new solar, good for 4th in the nation over that period, though the vast majority of these additions are expected to come on the utility-scale side, as the state’s utilities begin to retire their expansive coal fleets.
To date, the state’s residential solar market has been relatively tame, as illustrated by the graph below, and Indiana’s newfound love for large-scale solar likely won’t reflect an increased commitment to installing DG.
While the recent CenterPoint decision prevented further harm to the state’s DG industry, advocates have pointed out that there is still considerable work to be done if that industry hopes to achieve the same success that large-scale solar has found in the Hoosier State.
“This decision comes at a critical time for the Indiana solar industry,” said President of Indiana Distributed Energy Alliance, Laura Ann Arnold. “Solar companies testified that CenterPoint’s proposal would have a devastating impact on both solar/DG providers and their customers. Because there are other similar tariffs already approved or pending, this decision has potential statewide impact much larger than SW Indiana where CenterPoint operates.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/31/the-panel-and-the-city/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 31, 2022",The panel and the city,"Scientists from Arizona State University have conducted research to evaluate how urban settings affects the performance of PV systems and, conversely, how PV systems affect their surrounding urban environment.
The researchers explained that solar modules are sources of radiative heat for all structures beneath them and, at the same time, are convective heat sources that can considerably increase the temperature of the ambient air in cities, contributing to the so-called urban heat island (UHI) effect, which occurs when cities absorb and retain heat, due to a high concentration of pavements, buildings, and other surfaces.
Their analysis was based on a review conducted on 116 scientific articles for review, through which seven different types of PV-urban climate interactions were identified. For the impact of the urban environment on the PV system, it considered urban air temperature, urban air pollution, the partial shading of the PV system, and soiling. To evaluate how the solar array affects the urban environment, it took into account urban air temperatures, building heating and cooling loads, and outdoor shade.
Impact of urban environment
The scientists found that all analyzed parameters have a “non-trivial role” in affecting PV power generation, although the impact of the elevated temperatures caused by the UHI is difficult to quantify, as it varies seasonally and diurnally.
Air pollution was described as one of the main factors reducing PV performance in urban environments, with power yield spanning from 5 to 15%. “Particle deposition on PV panels results in absorption and backscattering of insolation, reducing the transmittance of the panel surface,” the academics explained. “While this effect is most notable in highly polluted urban environs, it can also manifest itself in rural installations downwind of urban and industrial pollution sources.”
As for the effect of soiling, the scientists said that cities often have impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and buildings, which are not detrimental to PV power generation, as these are less prone to high atmospheric loading of particulates from soils. “Nevertheless, other sources of soiling in urban environments, including soot from vehicles and industry and dust from construction activities may significantly contribute to soiling of PV,” they further explained. “However, research suggests that periodic cleaning of PV surfaces, either from precipitation or from routine maintenance can maintain the generation penalty of soiling at less than 10%.”
The shading effect, which for PV systems in urban environments is often unavoidable, is described in the study as the most significant issue affecting PV system performance in dense urban areas. “The average effects of this penalty can be on the order of 20%,” the researchers emphasized. “However, careful design of urban installations, accounting for current, and potential future shading, can greatly reduce this issue.”
Impact of photovoltaics
The analysis of how PV impacts the urban environment showed conflicting results and highlighted the need for further studies, although it confirmed that solar panels have an influence on urban energy balance and affect urban air temperatures.
Their thermal and electrical characteristics are key parameters to assess this influence. The shadow that the panels can produce on the surrounding areas and air gap between the panels and the surface beneath them, which results in convective heat transfer from both surfaces of the PV panel to the air, were identified as two main factors increasing air temperature. “Further controlled empirical studies and validated modeling efforts are needed, particularly because the conflicting studies differ not simply in magnitude of their projections, but in terms of the sign of the anticipated impact of PV on air temperatures,” they further explained.
Their analysis also showed that current scientific literature is also divided on how rooftop PV positively affects the energy performance of buildings by reducing the need for cooling at night, taking into account that solar panels can cool down faster than the roof cover or other architectural elements. “The magnitude of this savings depends significantly on the assumption of the albedo of the roof surface being shaded, the level of building insulation, and other building construction and operation characteristics,” the also stated.
“As our synthesis suggests, photovoltaics in urban settings offer many benefits, but also are fraught with challenges — both in terms of how the urban environment affects their performance and how they can adversely affect the urban environment and energy consumption for air conditioning,” they concluded. “These complexities are often difficult to convey to the general public or to local/regional decision-makers who are typically seeking simplified summaries regarding the evaluation of technologies.”
Their findings were presented in the paper “Photovoltaics in the built environment: A critical review,” published in Energy and Buildings.
