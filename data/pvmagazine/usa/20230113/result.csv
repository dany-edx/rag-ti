https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/13/500-mw-compressed-air-energy-storage-project-in-california-secures-offtaker/,"ENERGY STORAGE,CALIFORNIA,CANADA,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 13, 2023",500 MW compressed air energy storage project in California secures offtaker,"Central Coast Community Energy in California has executed a 25-year power purchase agreement with Hydrostor, valued at nearly $1 billion, for 200 MW/1600 MWh energy storage from a planned 500 MW compressed air energy storage system.
Hydrostor’s storage technology can cost-effectively store up to eight hours of energy, the company says, using no fuels, on a footprint significantly smaller than a comparably sized pumped hydro storage facility. The 500 MW project will require less than 100 acres.

The California project is one of four energy storage projects that Hydrostor is developing worldwide, after completing two pilot-scale projects.
A Hydrostor video says its technology stores energy by first using electricity to run a compressor, producing heated compressed air, and capturing and storing the heat using a thermal management system. The compressed air is then sent underground through a shaft, and stored in purpose-built caverns that are initially full of water. In the process, the compressed air forces the water up a shaft into a closed loop reservoir on the surface.
When power is needed, water from the reservoir is allowed to fill the underground caverns, driving the stored compressed air up a shaft to the surface, where it is heated with stored heat and then expanded through a turbine to generate electricity.
Central Coast Community Energy (3CE) said its 200 MW share of the project will help the agency meet its goal of providing 100% clean and renewable electricity by 2030 to its 447,000 customers between Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara counties. The project is located outside Rosamond in Kern County, and known as Willow Rock.
“Retiring fossil fuels requires tremendous amounts of energy storage and that will require developing new technologies and improvements to existing technologies,” said Robert Shaw, chief operating officer of 3CE. “In pushing the envelope, we are clearing the path toward reliability and reduced emissions.”
3CE has executed 19 power purchase and energy storage agreements since its formation in 2017. The agency currently has commitments for 856 MW of clean and renewable generation and 285 MW of energy storage capacity. Five of these projects came online last year, currently serving 22% of the agency’s load.
Hydrostor said the Willow Rock project will charge using surplus renewable energy and discharge to the grid at times of higher demand, reducing the need for new peak-demand generating facilities and deferring the need for “costly, difficult-to-permit” transmission lines.
The company expects the project to employ up to 40 full-time operators, and to have no performance degradation over a 50-plus year lifespan.
As Hydrostor’s technology employs “proven components” from the hydrocarbon sector, the company says it “delineates a clear pathway for skillsets and expertise from the fossil fuel industry to play a central role in the global energy transition.”
Toronto-based Hydrostor said that offtake discussions are ongoing with several parties for the 300 MW balance of the 500 MW project. Formed in 2010, the company calls its technology Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage, or A-CAES.
On January 10, 2022, the company received a $250 million equity investment from the private equity group of Goldman Sachs, with a further $25 million investment from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in April.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/13/orsted-to-commence-construction-on-471-mw-texas-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Ørsted to commence construction on 471 MW Texas solar project,"Ørsted, a utility-scale renewable energy developer with a large footprint in Texas, announced it will break ground this month on the 471 MW Mockingbird solar center. The project is Ørsted’s largest solar facility and ranks seventh on PV Intel’s largest projects to begin construction within the last year.
The facility is expected to produce the equivalent of 80,000 Texas homes’ electricity demand, interconnecting with Texas utility Oncor. The project will create at least 200 jobs during construction and will require long-term staffing for operations and maintenance. Project construction is slated for January 2023 and is expected to be completed in 2024.
The project will inject an estimated $215 million new revenue into the tax base, promoting local economic development in Lamar County, and providing long-term financial support for North Lamar and Chisum Independent School Districts.
As part of the project, Ørsted announced it is collaborating with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to protect nearly 1,000 acres of native tallgrass prairies in Texas. The company will purchase and transfer the land to TNC this year. Less than one percent of the original tallgrass prairies of Texas remain today, and less than five percent has survived nationwide. The collaboration will mark the largest conservation of tallgrass prairies on record. The Mockingbird project will occupy 4,900 acres, which stretches into the Smiley-Woodfin Native prairie grassland, the largest contiguous remnant of a rare and threatened type of native prairie found in only a few counties in north Texas.
“We need to deliver green energy for this generation while protecting natural habitats for the next,” said Daniel Willard, biodiversity specialist, Ørsted. “Drawing on both internal expertise and outside guidance, we will continue to look for opportunities to protect the prairie and ensure that native plants and pollinators thrive.”
The transaction is part of the solar developer’s stated goal of being net-positive to biodiversity by 2030. Ørsted’s global biodiversity platform includes programs that range from regrowing coral and monitoring crustacean habitat, to seagrass restoration and oyster reintroduction.
Ørsted has a total U.S. land-based capacity of 5 GW across wind, solar and storage resources. The company was the first to develop offshore wind in the United States, and has a 5 GW active offshore wind development pipeline.
No state has more solar capacity on the way than Texas in the coming years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects as much as 36 GW of solar capacity will be added in the next five years, adding on to the 16 GW installed thus far and leapfrogging the Lone Star State over California in terms of installed capacity.
To date, the state has enough solar capacity to power the equivalent of nearly 2 million homes. Over 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that over $19 billion has been invested in the technology through Q3 2022. Nearly 5% of Texas electricity is generated by PV. Most of this capacity is being built at the utility-scale, with a large band of projects occupying the drier, sunnier western half of the state.

The campus will be located within walking distance of the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) campus.
NexCore secured a long-term lease with the state of Colorado on 9.3 acres to develop the Glo Park campus in 400,000 square feet of building space .
The developer said the campus will feature an open space and collaborative design to provide NREL partner tenants with access to NREL’s laboratory, including advanced research and testing resources, computing equipment, and globally recognized research and innovation team.
The plan was approved by the state of Colorado and is part of the Governor Polis agenda to establish the state as a world leader in renewable energy research and commercialization.
Construction is expected to commence in late 2023. The campus design includes an outdoor amphitheater and tenant commons area. NexCore said the project will uphold the most progressive standards for sustainability and well-being by utilizing the most advanced green design and building technologies available.
“Building an innovative, clean energy ecosystem begins with building a community of collaboration partners. The State of Colorado has proven its willingness to lead the way in becoming the global epicenter of climate innovation,” said Todd Varney, chief development officer, NexCore.
Placed between the NREL campus and Pleasant View Community Park at Camp George West, the Glo Park will offer nearly 40 acres of open space, nature trails, multi-use sports fields, and recreation facilities with views of Colorado’s scenic mountain ranges. Sky bridges, outdoor plazas, and a network of trails and sidewalks will physically connect the campus.

The company said it designed the system at the request of customers demanding the energy efficiency and fast installation benefits of its existing 1P-1Row Genius Tracker system with the lower cost afforded by having one controller manage two rows.
The 1P-2Row Genius Tracker comes standard with preassembled components including the elimination of all washers. The industry’s leading module install speed is also available with this system capturing the benefits of the company’s proprietary preassembled SpeedClamps™.
“The system is a cost-effective and optimal solution for certain projects and countries,” said Derick Botha, chief commercial officer at GameChange Solar.
In November of last year the company announced the MaxDensity system, which is a fixed-tilt racking system for ground-mounted projects. It has a 5-degree or 10-degree east-west landscape configuration. The system is designed to maximize the number of modules packed onto a site, with a ground coverage ratio of up to 98%. It can be installed in blocks of up to 7 MW, in configurations of up to 12,000 modules. It supports all commercially available framed modules, according to the company.
GameChange manufactures in the United States, and last month announced that it is increasing domestic manufacturing to 24 GW annual capacity. The company has both expanded existing facilities and established new factories, and reports that it now has manufacturing facilities in in Michigan, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky.
In 2021 the company announced BifacialReflector, patent-pending technology designed to boost power production by 15-20% for the its Genius Tracker when using bifacial modules. According to the company, the BifacialReflector is a highly reflective (.95 albedo) surface up to 4 meters wide that reflects light from just above ground level to the back of the bifacial modules. The solution is self-cleaning and has a 40-year life expectancy.
In December 2021, GameChange Solar Holdings Corp., received an investment of $150 million from Koch Strategic Platforms (KSP), a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group. The preferred stock investment, if converted, would represent a minority stake in the company. In addition to capital investment, the two are exploring further synergies across Koch Industries, including KBX, a global transportation, logistics, and technology arm, and Koch Engineered Solutions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/13/massachusetts-1-9-mw-rooftop-solar-array-deployed-on-recycling-facility/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,MASSACHUSETTS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Massachusetts 1.9 MW rooftop solar array deployed on recycling facility,"Parallel Products, a consumer products recycling business, recently completed a 1.9 MW rooftop solar array on a 150,000 square foot warehouse in New Bedford, Mass. The solar facility provides power to the company’s recycling center and additional technology development buildings, located on a 130-acre campus in southern Massachusetts.
Parallel Products processes and recycles more than 50,000 tons of glass and 3,700 tons per year of aluminum and plastic containers per year through Massachusetts’s bottle deposit program. Since a bottling facility closed in 2018, the state was left with limited solutions for glass handling, providing Parallel Products an opportunity to open a full-service recycling facility in New Bedford.
The facility has increased solar capacity by 1.9 MW, part of Parallel Products’ goal of deploying 4 MW of solar generation on the 130-acre campus. Located at a former Polaroid camera warehouse, the company repurposed the dormant industrial site, and with the addition of rooftop solar is now generating clean power for consumer recycling.
Parallel’s processing facility features a standing seam metal roof. Local contractor ECS Electric decided to use S-5!’s PVKIT, a direct-attach rail-less solar racking system, to install CSUN solar modules without drilling. The rooftop system uses the PVKIT and S-5-V Mini clamps to secure the solar panels to the metal roof, as well as Solectria inverters.

Formed in 1979, Parallel Products is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 2016 purchased the 130-acre campus and facility in New Bedford, Mass., with plans to renovate the campus over the coming years. The original Polaroid facility had the capacity of 76 vehicles per day, while Parallel Products expanded the campus to accommodate up to 498 vehicle deliveries per day as a regional recycling facility.
In 2018 the Ardagh Group closed a recycling center in Milford, Mass., leaving the state constrained on consumer recycling options. Rather than send materials out of state, the commonwealth solicited Parallel Products to renovate the New Bedford campus.
Besides glass, plastic and aluminum container recycling, Parallel Products also converts expired and unsold soda beverages and other beverage products into ethyl alcohol or ethanol, which it then processes for use as hand sanitizer and other substances derived from ethyl alcohol.
The company has an internal rail, trucking and logistics business that facilitates regional input and delivery of recycled materials in six states it operates.
In 2018, Parallel Products acquired Beaumont Solar, a New Bedford-based solar EPC business that filed for bankruptcy and subsequently went out of business. Parallel operated Beaumont Solar, and manager Phil Cavallo developed commercial, industrial and municipal solar projects in southern New England.  State filings refer to Parallel Products Solar Energy, LLC as the solar business that was acquired.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/13/green-mountain-power-launches-solar-program-for-low-income-residents/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,VERMONT",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Green Mountain Power launches solar program for low-income residents,"Green Mountain Power (GMP) Green Mountain Power is a utility in Vermont that serves more than 270,000 residential and business customers with electricity that’s 100% carbon free and 78% renewable. It is the first utility in the world to get a B Corp certification, meeting rigorous social, environmental, accountability and transparency standards and committing to use business as a force for good. With the launch of two new programs, GMP aims to bring clean energy to income-qualified customers.
The Shared Solar Program (SSP) unlocks incentives in the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to create a qualified low-income program that saves participants money. The other program, the Affordable Community Renewable Energy (ACRE) Pilot, will use a state grant to help eligible customers take part in new Vermont solar projects, providing them discounts for five years.
The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed in August 2022, is hailed as the most important piece of climate legislation in U.S. history. One of the most significant provisions in the IRA is something the industry had been calling for for a long time: a long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit. It also includes adders for things like electric vehicles, energy storage, and using U.S. -made products. Green Mountain Power’s Shared Solar Program aims to help customers put the tax credits to good use by helping them to invest in clean energy.. GMP will also look to add energy storage to the projects to create more benefits for all customers, increasing resiliency, strengthening the grid, and further lowering costs.
“These projects will help thousands of Vermonters who are low income reduce their monthly energy statements by unlocking financial benefits in the federal Inflation Reduction Act, all while boosting local solar energy,” said Candace Morgan, director of corporate and legislative affairs at Green Mountain Power. “We’re looking forward to seeing strong proposals from local solar developers to make sure we can connect our customers with cost-effective solar energy, and to partner with them to add storage to these projects too.”
The monthly savings for qualified customers will be in addition to discounts that customers can already receive through GMP’s energy assistance program (EAP). The funding from the federal and state programs allows GMP to provide discounts to participants while adding new solar at no increased cost, which GMP says further enhances the equity of these programs for all customers. GMP plans to start enrolling customers for solar savings as soon as this summer with projects starting to generate power by the end of the year.
“We know these new GMP solar programs are so important because they increase equity for those who need it most and serve a need that is currently unmet. We see this every day in CVOEO’s GreenSavingSmart Program in which our Financial Energy Coach works with Vermonters to navigate green energy choices available to them. Often, Vermonters who face financial challenges can’t go solar because they don’t own a home, or they have credit issues. GMP’s initiative will change that in a meaningful way,” said Paul Dragon, CEO of CVOEO.
GMP opened its request for proposals (RFP) from solar developers for the Shared Solar Program in December 2022, and the window to file proposals closes January 26, 2023. GMP received the ACRE grant award notice from the state of Vermont in December. GMP filed plans with Vermont regulators for both the Shared Solar and ACRE programs this week. Combined, the two programs equal at least 40 MW of new solar, or enough to power about 11,000 homes for a year.  Each program provides a path for federal funds that are intended to incentivize expansion of renewable energy production to directly benefit low-income customers.
“We are grateful for the leadership Green Mountain Power is providing to ensure low-income Vermonters can save money while also strengthening our local economy through the deployment of new renewable energy sources supported by the Federal Inflation Reduction Act,” said Jim Merriam, CEO of Norwich Solar, which plans to submit site proposals for the programs.
More information for solar developers interested in participating is available in the “What’s New” section of GMP’s Regulatory page.
