https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/17/solar-gazebo-provides-up-to-4-3-kw-of-backyard-generating-capacity/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 17, 2023",Solar gazebo provides up to 4.3 kW of backyard generating capacity,"Just in time for the summer barbecuing season, Arka Energy is debuting the PowerGazebo to residential solar installers and consumers across the United States. The outdoor gazebo provides 2.4 kW to 4.3 kW of solar power via monocrystalline PERC mounted solar tiles. The backyard solar system offers a functional solution for households seeking a home generating solution, who may not have adequate rooftop space for conventional rooftop solar.
Utilizing 14 watts per square foot of solar capacity, the PowerGazebo can be ordered in 180 or 312 square foot configurations. According to product specifications, Arka Energy’s solar gazebo is installed with a 25-year solar tile warranty, while its assembly is rated to withstand storm winds of 120 miles per hour.
The mono PERC solar tiles are 77 to 97 watts power capacity with a 22% cell efficiency and utilize a 10-bus construction. The tiled panels are mounted at a 7 degree to 14 degree slope to allow for optimal daily sunshine.
Additional features of the PowerGazebo include auxiliary power outlets for lights and electronics, a wooden-finished roof, 8-watt ceiling lights and optional IP-65 rated peripheral LED lights. The company says the gazebo system can be shipped in more than 10 configurations by size and features.
Arka Energy will be shipping the product from its Allen, Texas warehouse facility. Solar installers can order the PowerGazebo this week, with deliveries starting in late May 2023. The company also announced the full commissioning of a PowerGazebo demonstration in Union City, Calif., for interested installers or residents in northern California.
In addition, Arka offers solar financing on the ARKA 360 platform to finance the installation of the system.
“The commercial availability of the Arka PowerGazebo in the U.S. marks the beginning of a new segment in residential solar solutions,” said Surya Potharaju, chief executive officer of Arka Energy.  “Moving away from deploying conventional PV modules originally developed for utility and industry applications, Arka’s products deliver more than just energy savings for homeowners – they deliver increased home value, extended outdoor living spaces, and uncompromised aesthetics,” Potharaju said.
Arka Energy was founded in 2020 in Union City, Calif., and its management team has previously held senior management roles at Enphase Energy, ReneSola and SunEdison.
Installers can order the unit and join Arka’s Value-Added Installer Partner (VIP) program. The PowerGazebo will also be on display outside the RE+ Conference exhibition hall in Las Vegas, taking place September 11 to 14, 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/17/50-states-of-solar-incentives-arizona/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARIZONA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 17, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Arizona,"In the Southwest, the state of Arizona shares the reputation as one of the top five sunniest states and has huge potential for its solar market. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) ranked the state fifth in the U.S. for solar deployments at the beginning of 2023, and the state continues to shine with a robust growth pipeline of 7.27 GW of solar projects to be installed over the next five years.
While the Grand Canyon State has shown tremendous growth opportunity in recent years, due to public debates about the benefits of solar, imposition of a net metering charge in 2014 and the elimination of incentives, Arizona’s solar market has been a bit rocky like a North Rim hike into the Grand Canyon.
The American Clean Power Association cites Arizona as the 19th strongest U.S. market for solar, wind and storage project development, with 3.55 GW of installed capacity, even though the state’s power mix is just 11.6% generated from renewable energy.
Incentives
In December 2016, regulator the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) voted to replace a statewide net metering framework with a “net billing” mechanism, in which new customers who install rooftop solar will be credited at an avoided cost rate for excess energy put into the grid from residences.
Since October 2021, net billing is available to utility and electric cooperative customers who generate excess energy at an avoided cost of $0.094 per kWh in Arizona Public Service territory, $0.0781/kWh in Tucson Electric’s territory, and $0.093/kWh in UNS Electric service territory. The rate was effectively lowered by one penny since the rules first changed in 2016.
Commercial and industrial companies in Arizona Public Service territory, as well as medium and large commercial customers in Tucson Electric Power and UNS Electric territory may still participate in a retail rate net metering framework across the state.
On March 7, 2023, the ACC issued a community solar policy statement that takes into account few, if any, stakeholder suggestions for a shared-access program to consumers. The policy does not spur any community solar project development across the state in its current iteration, said advocacy groups Vote Solar and Institute for Local Self-Reliance.
UNS Energy offers a utility-designated shared solar program where interested customers can sign up at a rate of $3 per monthly bill cycle to procure power from a collocated local solar project under the utility’s “Bright Arizona Community Solar Program.”
The utility sources power for its own program from a 1.22 MW elementary school deployment, 500 kW Kingman, Ariz. solar array, and four other projects.
Despite the curbed market for unlocking the full value of residential solar and community projects thus far, the residential solar market has proliferated after the Covid-19 pandemic, with more than 375 MW of cumulative residential installations through early 2023.
The utility solar market continues to see strong growth with projects faring in the range of 250 MW to 400 MW on average. A handful of solar projects such as the 600 MW Jove Solar project in La Paz County continue to the push the boundaries for the title of largest U.S. solar farm. The 174 Power Global-developed Jove project is on track for commercial operations by early 2027 and at 3,495 acres, is situated on Bureau of Land Management federal land.
Notable installation
An early trailblazer in the utility solar market, the Mesquite Solar facility (150 MW), built in 2013 near Arlington, Ariz., is one of the state’s first large photovoltaic (PV) projects that didn’t use the concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, a reflective solar technology where solar energy is passed through a central tower.
The original Mesquite 1 Solar phase consisted of 800,000 Suntech Power modules installed by Zachry Holdings, an engineering contractor.
Mesquite Solar has seen additional phased additions in the same proximity of the first desert solar farm through 2017 by developer Sempra Energy, while the additions have ranged in size from 16 MW, 52.5 MW to 150 MW across the sprawling 4,000 acre complex.
Developer Sempra Generation signed a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with California utility PG&E for the procurement of the 150 MW first Mesquite project phase.

ASU will lead a multi-institution collaboration called Electrified Processes for Industry Without Carbon (EPIXC).
 The industrial sector accounts for more than 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Process heating accounts for 63% of all energy use in manufacturing, and as such EPIXC will target carbon-free methods to process heating. Among other industries, ASU will target innovation in iron and steel, chemicals, petroleum, food and beverage, forest products and cement.
“Fossil fuel-driven process heating — from pasteurizing milk to melting steel — is the most significant contributor [to greenhouse gas emissions],” said Sridhar Seetharaman, vice dean for research and innovation of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU and director of the EPIXC program.
The university will establish a public-private partnership, conducting innovative research, development, demonstration and deployment of relevant technologies. It will also engage in relevant workforce development for the emergent technologies.
“Our commitment extends beyond technological advancements as we also anticipate fostering the growth of a new generation of engineering leaders who will drive the necessary technology innovations in an equitable fashion to achieve the greatest possible benefit to the communities we serve,” said Kyle Squires, vice provost of engineering, computing and technology and dean of the Fulton Schools of Engineering.
ASU will be joined by University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Pennsylvania State University, Stanford University, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Tuskegee University, North Carolina State University, Navajo Technical University, Idaho National Laboratory, the National Energy Technology Laboratory, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. KB Science provided strategic guidance for the proposal development. EPIXC joins DOE’s six other Manufacturing USA Institutes.
EPIXC is funded through the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization Office.
A recent study by Northeastern University found that solar mounted on industrial rooftops could meet 35% of the electricity demand of manufacturing processes. On-site sources of renewable energy are currently supplying less than 0.1% of industrial electricity demand in the U.S., according to the report. 
Heat battery
Bill Gates-backed Rondo Energy recently announced the release of two models of its Rondo Heat Battery (RHB), an energy storage system that dispatches both heat and electricity for industrial applications. The battery is made of readily available materials such as bricks and iron. 
The company’s so-called “brick toaster” heat battery stores intermittent generation from renewable energy resources like solar and wind, able to hold stored heat energy at temperatures up to 1,500 degrees Celsius for hours or days at a time. The zero-carbon solution supports manufacturing processes such as steel, cement and chemical manufacturing, as well as low-temperature food processing. 
“The Rondo Heat Battery will help companies in industries such as cement, fuels, food and water desalination to begin leveraging the falling costs of renewables without modifying their facilities,” said Carmichael Roberts, Business Lead and the head of Breakthrough Energy Ventures’ investment committee. 
The RHB batteries can store more than 1 MWh per square meter, a high level of density that preserves area use at industrial facilities. RHB batteries offer continuous power with a 95% annual capacity power while operating on input power as low as 15% capacity factor, or four hours of dispatchable power generation per day.

Renewable energy plays an important role in bringing energy justice to disadvantaged communities as clean energy can bring relief in many forms, including community and residential solar as well as energy storage. Many groups and policy makers are working toward bringing energy justice to low- and middle-income residents.
Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) explore what it would mean to link techno-economic research with energy justice, and to link energy justice with grassroots visions.
The paper Equitable deep decarbonization: A framework to facilitate energy justice-based multidisciplinary modeling introduces an “Equitable Deep Decarbonization Framework” for mapping the tenets of energy justice to the practice of large-scale deep decarbonization pathways modeling. The paper Frontlining energy justice: Visioning principles for energy transitions from community-based organizations in the United States provides a review and thematic coding of visions for a just energy future from frontline communities captured in over 60 documents. Both publications are published in open-access form in the journal Energy Research and Social Science.
Large-scale, deep decarbonization models are often used to understand the monetary impacts of different technologies used to mitigate and adapt to climate change. However, the authors contend that models should consider the vulnerability of those affected, and thus the modeling needs to be reoriented around restorative justice. In the “Equitable deep decarbonization” paper, the authors provide a new framework that maps the steps of model development to the tenets of energy justice, with the restorative justice tenet providing a foundation to each of the steps. The authors say that the result is a model that centers energy justice.
The framework is organized in three steps, as shown above. Each step results in decision points in modeling decarbonization pathways, and each involves a process component supported by energy justice.
The authors place restorative justice as a critical piece that informs all three steps. It calls for a repair of harms done to communities and the environment. This is a departure from traditional framework used in decarbonization pathway models that focus on economics and greenhouse gas mitigation metrics. The authors see those models as ignoring the injustices done to underserved and overburdened communities. As an alternative, the modeling approach offered is rooted in energy justice.
Frontline visions
In the second study, researchers looked at over 60 “visioning documents” authored by non-profits and frontline community members in the U.S. These documents contain concrete policy recommendations and connect context, history and place to energy and climate policy. The authors of the “Frontlining energy justice” paper state that the fact that so many of these visioning documents exist points to the insufficiency of current policy approaches. The authors argue that “energy policy has perpetuated cycles of social harm and lacks the transformative approach necessary to address climate change and its uneven impacts.”
 
In the paper the authors identify six principles of a just energy future: (1) place-based, (2) addressing root causes and legacies of inequality, (3) shifting the balance of power in existing forms of energy governance, (4) creating new, cooperative, and participatory systems of energy governance and ownership, (5) adopting a rights-based approach, and (6) rejecting false solutions. They discuss how these principles can advance the energy justice literature and be applied across areas of energy policy intervention and geographies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/17/puerto-rico-cannot-afford-to-repay-any-of-utility-prepas-debt-says-analyst/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PUERTO RICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 17, 2023","Puerto Rico cannot afford to repay any of utility PREPA’s debt, says analyst","Puerto Rico’s utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), has a narrow path to meet future capital and operational needs in rebuilding its grid with renewables, said Tom Sanzillo, director of financial analysis for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, in testimony to the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.
Given PREPA’s financial needs to rebuild the grid, and the electric rates that Puerto Rico’s economy can support, “there is no headroom” to support repayment of PREPA’s legacy debt through increased rates, Sanzillo testified.
PREPA, which is in a bankruptcy proceeding, has “more than $9 billion in unpaid bond debt and other obligations,” Sanzillo said in a statement. The district court is evaluating a proposed “plan of adjustment” submitted by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico that would raise electricity rates to repay bondholders.
The Financial Oversight and Management Board’s (FOMB) plan would increase Puerto Rico’s electrical rates by double digits, Sanzillo said, with the goal of repaying bondholders $5.68 billion “over the next decades.” Puerto Rico’s rates are now more than twice the U.S. average, he said, “and the island’s median income is less than half of the poorest U.S. state.”
A “rapid transition” to renewable generation is “instrumental” for PREPA to achieve fiscal balance and stability by reducing fuel costs, Sanzillo testified, as 97% of PREPA’s electricity is generated from imported fossil fuels, and fuel costs “recently have risen to more than 60% of operating costs.”
Based on studies by the Puerto Rico Department of Housing and PREPA, he said there is a need for “at least $6 billion in capital expenses” to rebuild the grid, beyond existing federal commitments.
To transition to renewables, Sanzillo said in an emailed statement that investments could include the development of one or more distributed generation initiatives “to support the rising number of resident-initiated rooftop solar investments,” and bringing the various tranches of solar energy solicited in RFPs “through the process to commercial operation.” These measures “should result in a substantial drop in fuel costs over time.”
“The purpose of a bankruptcy proceeding is to provide a fresh start,” Sanzillo said. The FOMB’s plan of adjustment “is not a fresh start; it is the same old quagmire wrapped in different paper.”
Sanzillo, who formerly served in senior management roles at the New York City and New York State Comptroller’s Offices, submitted his testimony on behalf of Puerto Rico’s Union of Electrical Industry and Irrigation Workers. The pension funds of union members who work for PREPA are at risk of financial loss in the bankruptcy proceeding.
Hurricane survival
Agustin Irizarry-Rivera, a professor of power system engineering at Puerto Rico University’s Mayaguez campus, also challenged the FOMB’s proposed plan in an expert report prepared for eight citizens groups in Puerto Rico plus the Sierra Club.
The fixed component of the FOMB’s proposed rate increase would be “an immediate solar tax of 2.1 cents per kWh,” he said in the report. The FOMB’s plan “is designed to make ownership of a rooftop solar PV system far more expensive than it has to be” and would “impede the ability to survive hurricanes in Puerto Rico,” which is “squarely in the hurricane path of the Caribbean Sea.”
Irizarry-Rivera cited a case study on a solar-plus-storage system that operated uninterrupted for 101 days while the grid’s electric service was not available following Hurricane Maria in 2017.
Puerto Rico’s 100% renewable energy law prohibits solar taxes, and trade group the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA-PR) has worked to defend that aspect of the law for several years.
Grid defection
Irizarry-Rivera added that “significant” grid defection could result from the FOMB’s plan for rate increases, given customers’ ongoing deployment of rooftop solar and storage; the projected cost reductions for both technologies; and Puerto Rico’s already-high cost for electricity.
Distributed solar systems have been deployed by 80,000 customers across Puerto Rico, totaling more than 500 MW, according to data from transmission and distribution system operator LUMA Energy, which Irizarry-Rivera cited in his testimony.

Distributed storage systems have reached close to 70,000 customers and almost 1 GWh of storage capacity, Irizarry-Rivera said, based on LUMA Energy data.
Irizarry-Rivera reported results of his analysis showing that electricity from the grid, which costs 28.4 cents per kWh prior to the FOMB’s proposed rate increase, “is already more expensive than grid defection” for a customer using distributed solar-plus-storage. His analysis also considered projections for lower future costs for distributed solar and storage that were developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Irizarry-Rivera’s expert report is available at this site by clicking on “Dockets,” entering the number 3414 under “Docket Numbers,” and then choosing “All Docs” at the right.
The district court is expected to conduct a hearing on the FOMB’s proposed plan of adjustment in July.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/17/maryland-becomes-the-23rd-community-solar-state/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MARYLAND",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 17, 2023",Maryland becomes the 23rd community solar state,"Maryland Governor Wes Moore (D) has signed the state’s community solar legislation, HB 908 into law, effectuating a state framework to provide clean energy to the state’s residents, including low- and moderate-income (LMI) households.
With Moore’s signing of HB 908, Maryland becomes the 23rd U.S. state to implement a shared-access community solar framework.
To help the state achieve its clean energy goals of deploying 100% renewable energy by 2035, community solar projects represent a solid component to the Mid-Atlantic state’s goals.
In an August 2020 report by the Governor’s Task Force on Renewable Energy Development and Siting, up to 33,033 acres of farmland in Maryland will be needed to host small to mid-sized solar installations, representing up to 1.7% of all agricultural land in the state, and up to 2.9% of what the task force characterized as “prime” agriculture land in the state.
Nautilus Solar Energy, a Summit, N.J.-based community solar developer, has an active portfolio of projects across the Mid-Atlantic region and heralded Governor Moore’s signing of HB 908.
“As a leader in the Maryland community solar pilot program, Nautilus Solar is excited to continue working with our network of development partners to bring clean energy and financial savings to subscribers across Maryland,” said Eric Paul, vice president of development, Nautilus Solar.
Eric LaMora, executive director of community solar, Nautilus Solar, said: “With an early focus on providing LMI households with discounted solar energy, we are completely supportive of the 40% LMI requirement of the permanent community solar program. We hope to exceed that in our many future Maryland community solar projects.”
Nautilus was an early participant in Maryland’s community solar pilot program and opened the state’s first project in Kingsville, Md., with 51% of the energy dedicated to LMI residents. The company currently owns and manages more than 85 MW of operational and late-stage development projects in the state, providing clean energy to tens of thousands of Marylanders.
John Finnerty, director of business development at Standard Solar, based in Rockville, Md., said: “The bill’s significance extends far beyond Maryland and will be a model for others. Harnessing the power of locally generated energy and seamless accessibility, community solar holds the key to a multitude of benefits for all communities.”
Standard Solar, a Brookfield Renewable company, has installed 31.2 MW of community solar projects in Maryland.
Patrick Corr, chief strategy officer of Empower Energies, based in Bethesda, Md., said: “This is an exciting development from Maryland and a critical step as the nation progresses toward a clean energy future.  Maryland is a leading solar market and this is further cemented with this new legislation. We look forward to working with local landowners to develop community solar projects and expand clean energy access in our home state.”
Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said: “We are grateful to Governor Moore for signing the community solar bill and Chairman Clippinger and Senator Brooks for sponsoring the bill. As Maryland marches towards its goal of achieving 100% clean energy by 2035, the community solar program will increase the availability of solar energy, reduce costs for those who most need the cost savings, and create jobs and apprenticeships.”
“This bill has the potential to reduce the energy burden on thousands of low- to moderate-income (LMI) Maryland households while generating clean and renewable solar power on developed land, such as rooftops and parking canopies in our cities and towns,” said Coble.
HB 908 was penned by state delegate Luke Clippinger and state senator Benjamin Brooks, who announced in April the passing of the legislation through the state’s offices.
The legislation, cross-filed with SB 613 from Brooks, will replace Maryland’s existing community solar pilot program with a permanent, less restrictive, and more equitable community solar program, according to a Coalition for Community Solar Access statement.
Maryland’s formal community solar framework eliminates an arbitrary cap on community solar projects at 580 MW, and allows community projects to be a permanent distributed generation option for consumers, alongside net metering.
Community solar projects are small- to mid-scale solar facilities typically sited on private land, commercial rooftops, landfills, industrial sites and other preferred areas in proximity to the utility customers they’re intended to serve. Currently about 75% of Maryland households lack the ability to deploy rooftop solar systems based on inadequate roofing or shade conditions, as well as rentals or condominiums prohibiting access to solar systems, according to the Sierra Club.
The new law propels Maryland’s solar market away from limits associated with the types of projects that can be developed and instead incentivizes the development of projects on a greater variety of sites, including commercial and industrial  rooftops, brownfield sites, as well as using agrivoltaics on farmland.
