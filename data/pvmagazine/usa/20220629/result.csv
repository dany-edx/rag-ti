Solar incentives in Delaware
Delaware benefits from a few solar incentives in addition to the federal solar Investment Tax Credit, which offers a credit to taxes for 26% of the cost of the equipment installed.
The state offers a full retail rate for net metering, which means the utility will pay homeowners for their excess solar-generated electricity the same rate that homeowners pay for grid-supplied power.
Customers of Delmarva Power are eligible for a cash rebate from the utility of $0.70 per watt of solar generating capacity installed up to 50 kW, up to a maximum of $6,000. The average solar array in the United States is about 8.5 kW.
Customers of Delaware Electric Cooperative can receive $0.50/W of solar power installed (up to 5 kW), and $0.20/W for any additional solar capacity.
A complete list of solar incentives available to Delaware residents can be found here.

The financing includes $58.5 million in Green Loan construction financing from Wells Fargo, MUFG and Silicon Valley Bank and secured an additional $62.5 million tax equity commitment from J.P. Morgan, with $50 million of that tax equity commitment set to come once the project is operational.
“We are pleased to have secured financing for the Rabbitbrush facility, which will be Leeward’s first financing for a solar and BESS facility,” commented Chris Loehr, Leeward’s chief financial officer. “This is the first of many LRE solar and BESS financings to come as we build out the contracted pipeline in 2022 and 2023. We appreciate the strong support from our offtake partners and participating financial institutions, and we look forward to working together throughout the lifecycle of the Rabbitbrush project.”
The commercial operation date is expected to be reached this August. Construction on the project has been underway since Oct. 2021, according to a construction update offered by McCarthy Building Companies in Jan. 2022. The project will consist of more than 415,000 First Solar thin-film photovoltaic modules, as well as a 20 MW, 50 MWh battery energy storage system, and construction is expected to create some 300 new union jobs, with additional long-term operations jobs to come after completion.
According to the company, McCarthy and its partners are working closely with area groups, including the native Tejon Indian Tribe, to ensure respect for the area and its people is maintained throughout the construction process.
Central Coast Community Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy both signed on to purchase generation from the project via 15-year power purchase agreements.
Leeward originally acquired the Rabbitbrush project from First Solar, as part of a deal where the module manufacturer sold Leeward its 10 GW utility-scale solar project platform in a $261 million transaction.
The deal includes the Rabbitbrush, Madison, Oak Trail, Horizon, and Ridgely projects, which are expected to start construction in the next two years, and the 30 MW Barilla Solar project, which is operational. The project pipeline includes projects in the California, Southwest, and Southeast markets. Sale of the platform is a result of a strategic review First Solar announced last year, said CEO Mark Widmar. The sale is part of a transition that is intended to enable the company to focus on scaling, developing, and selling module technology.
As part of the deal, Leeward also agreed to buy 650 MW of First Solar’s Series 6 PV solar modules for its additional development opportunities. Leeward’s acquisition includes purchase orders for 888 MW of Series 6 modules for the five development projects.
Leeward is a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, an investment arm of OMERS, one of Canada’s largest benefit pension plans.

According to CleanCapital, BQ Energy will continue operations as a wholly owned and independently operated subsidiary, and CleanCapital will fund the development of projects in BQ’s substantial long-term project development pipeline. BQ said its pipeline is comprised of more than 300 MW of late-stage development solar projects, bolstered by over 700 MW of mid-stage development solar projects, comprised of community solar, commercial & industrial (C&I), and utility-scale assets on landfills and retired industrial sites including refineries, steel mills, coal plants, and mines.
“CleanCapital prides itself in leading the investment community into new clean energy segments,” said Thomas Byrne, CEO of CleanCapital. ”BQE finds land left in environmental disrepair and gives it new life with on-site clean energy projects, doubling the climate-related impact of these assets. We are excited to welcome their exceptional team into the CleanCapital family.”
The deal also represents action on CleaCapital’s evolving philosophy on its place in the renewable energy transition, as it looks to move from acquiring operating solar assets to a more expansive approach including development and construction of solar and storage assets.
According to CleanCapital, the acquisition was enabled by the $300 million investment that Manulife made in CleanCapital in 2021. That same investment also enabled CleanCapital’s Feb. 2022 acquisition of a 39-project, 65.3MW portfolio of solar assets spanning 12 states from BR Group Holdings.
The 39 projects outlined in the acquisition are spread across 91 total sites, ranging from 0.2 MW to 6.5 MW in size. The portfolio includes a number of projects providing solar energy to schools, including 20 carport assets serving California’s Stockton Unified School District and 16 sites serving the Hawaii Department of Education. The portfolio also includes 11.5 MW of Minnesota community solar projects with various C&I off-takers.
To date, CleanCapital has successfully acquired and managed 200 projects in 24 states totaling more than 300 MW.
BQ Energy is one of the developers of a 52 MW solar project is set to be installed on a former landfill site in Houston, Texas. Most of the project, 50 MW, will be utility-scale electricity, delivered by Centerpoint Energy, and owned and operated by BQ, as well as fellow developer, Wolfe Energy. The remaining 2 MW will be dedicated as community solar projects.
The project is expected to bring 100 jobs to the local community, create enough power for 5,000 to 10,000 homes with clean, locally generated electricity, and offset 54,432 metric tons of carbon emissions each year, the equivalent of the carbon output of 43,000 gas-powered cars on the road annually. It is slated to break ground in early 2023 and reach commercial operations in July 2023.
Rocky Mountain Institute said there are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the country, offering an opportunity for solar development. It developed a comprehensive report, “The Future of Landfills is Bright,” designed for elected officials, policymakers, planners, and developers, to learn how landfill solar can be part of a broader clean energy and land-use strategy to achieve ambitious community-wide climate, sustainability, and environmental justice goals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/29/large-standalone-battery-added-to-texas-to-stabilize-grid-electricity-prices/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 29, 2022","Large standalone battery added to Texas to stabilize grid, electricity prices","Jupiter Power announced it achieved commercial operations for its 200 MW / 200 MWh Crossett Power Management battery energy storage system. Placed in Crane County, Texas, the storage system will support grid reliability and the massive buildout of utility-scale solar in west Texas and the large capacity of wind power in the northern band across the state.
The company said the storage facilities can “time shift” or store low-cost, off-peak energy, and discharge it during periods of high demand. Battery energy storage can provide additional support to electricity grids to manage demand through ancillary services, managing load, congestion, and resiliency.
At the 2022 RE+ conference in San Antonio, solar and storage developer 8minute Energy shared that 95% of revenues in a two-hour duration battery occur in the first hour of discharge in Texas. Designed around these market signals, the Crossett Power Management system is configured to one-hour duration.
The service is increasingly important for the Texas grid, which operates on a wholesale energy market basis that experiences steep rises in electricity prices when peak demand reaches levels that challenge power supply. David Kinchen, chief operating officer for Energy Ogre, said prices have gone up sharply, nearly doubling since last year. Part of this is due to a dwindling supply of reserve power, said Kinchen.
“The direct correlation is natural gas setting that marginal price unit and causing prices to double,” said Kinchen. “Say we get to an event and we need large amounts of natural gas. We can only pull so much out of production. A lot of that has to come out of storage. As you can imagine, when you get to these very brief periods of high demand, having that sitting there in storage ready to go has a lot of value. When that number’s not sitting there in storage, it has to come out of production.”
Looking ahead, the state has 28 GW of solar projects with signed interconnection agreements in hand and a projected commercial operation date (COD) through the end of 2024.
This massive buildout of renewable energy will likely be followed by battery energy storage to support it, but 8minute Energy argued stronger market signals are needed to support it, including pre-defined revenue streams like the capacity-based markets that exist in California’s CAISO market.
Currently, nearly all large-scale solar projects in California are co-located with energy storage, while only 28% of the 120 solar projects in ERCOT with completed interconnection agreements are solar + battery projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/29/how-a-ferc-decision-could-unleash-solar-and-storage-deployment/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 29, 2022",How a FERC decision could unleash solar and storage deployment,"Since 2004, the US solar industry has grown from 58 to over 121 GW of total installed capacity. Growth is increasing rapidly, with thousands of solar and other renewable energy projects in the planning stages. But too many of these projects are stalled by long interconnection queues, where they face an average timeline of three+ years to get connected to the grid. Because of these delays, about 75% of projects drop out before completing the interconnection process.
This unacceptable interconnection situation has been recognized for some time as a significant barrier to deploying renewable energy projects. Until now, efforts to address the issue were regional and uncoordinated. That’s set to change with the notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on June 16. FERC’s proposed reforms are intended to address interconnection queue backlogs, improve certainty, and prevent undue discrimination against new technologies.
What’s in the FERC proposal
This action by FERC is exciting and appropriate. The NOPR offers common-sense changes that are essential for the expedient deployment of new clean energy resources that our country desperately needs to meet our climate and energy goals. As electricity needs in the United States increase with population growth and expanding electrification and more regions experience blackouts, we need to ensure an affordable and reliable supply of clean energy and energy storage.
If FERC adopts the proposed rules, they will be instrumental in ensuring we can achieve our country’s clean energy and climate goals while meeting our energy needs. Appropriately, the NOPR focuses on speeding up interconnection with these key proposed reforms:
The NOPR also calls for simplifying the process for studying interconnection requests related to the same state-authorized or mandated resource solicitation. It allows more than one resource to co-locate on a shared site behind a single point of interconnection and share a single interconnection request (a bonus for solar + storage projects) and allows interconnection customers to add a generating facility to an existing interconnection request under certain circumstances. It also proposes modeling and performance requirements for non-synchronous generating facilities, which is pertinent to inverter-based solar systems.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has outlined several guiding principles for interconnection reform: interconnection processes for solar and storage must be detailed and transparent, with clear timelines and processes; interconnection rules must be rigorously enforced; and infrastructure upgrade cost estimates must be reasonable, directly related to the project and durable. FERC’s proposal goes a long way in addressing these principles and making the needed reforms.
The path to removing interconnection bottlenecks
Interconnection reform enjoys bipartisan support, fueled by a widespread recognition that interconnection delays are significant deterrents to deploying renewable energy and energy storage. FERC’s vote on its proposed decision was unanimous.
The decision is still subject to change. The NOPR is now open to comments, which are due 100 days after its publication on June 16, with reply comments due in 130 days. It’s possible that the decision could change substantially during that time. But the strong support for the proposal so far, coupled with the consensus on the need for reform, suggests that key provisions are likely to remain in place.
Standard Solar supports this effort. It’s essential for interconnection reform to move forward. By the end of 2021, there were more than 1,400 GW of energy generation and storage projects in interconnection queues around the country — a volume that has more than tripled in just five years. FERC’s proposal could open up this interconnection backlog and pave the way for solar and storage projects to be completed more quickly. This would result in much more solar and storage being deployed.
As an industry, we know that this is solar’s time. Solar energy is cost-effective, and commercial- and utility-scale energy storage is becoming increasingly viable. To meet our climate and energy goals, we need to deploy large amounts of solar and energy storage at speed and scale. That means it’s time for major interconnection reform.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/29/aerial-inspections-of-solar-plants-goes-mainstream/,"MONITORING,QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 29, 2022",Aerial inspection of solar plants goes mainstream,"Solar asset managers such as SMA, the German company known for its smart solar technology, are finding that aerial inspections using drones and manned aircraft are the optimal way of managing and maintaining large solar installations.
SMA has O&M contracts for over 1,000 sites, from small commercial of 30 kW and up to large-scale installations of over 600 MW. The company has been managing assets since 2015 and since then much has changed in terms of the technology and techniques used.
Today they are using drones and manned aircraft to conduct thermal and visual inspections of modules, looking for defects or modules or strings or groups that may be offline. In the course of inspection, they may see, for example, strings, modules and sections offline because an inverters not running, but the majority of the time the imaging is finding broken modules or hot spots on modules.
pv magazine spoke with Mark Culpepper, general manager solar solutions with DroneBase, a global company that specializes in data captured through aerial imaging. DroneBase serves a range of industries including wind energy, insurance, construction, real estate, and more—but the solar industry has increasing become a focus as solar assets increase across the globe.
Aerial inspections have great benefits in the solar industry not the least of which is speed. An unmanned drone can inspect about 20 MW per day per drone operator for on-demand thermal inspections or spot checks, while manned aircraft can capture over 500 MW in a 4-hour period. SMA uses both unmanned drones and airplanes to complete its inspections, finding aerial imaging far superior to “the old way” of doing things, which was manual inspection.
What’s the difference between the two? “It comes down to picking the right tool for the job,” says Culpepper. “Drones are the best tool for spot checks of solar energy systems. We use manned aircraft for two reasons: for annual health scans of systems and to capture images of large projects and portfolios.”
DroneBase recently announced its North American Solar Scan program, which flies each spring and fall and cover every major solar market in both Canada, including Ontario, and the United States, including California, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Massachusetts, and more.
Manual inspection required an inspector to go into the field and, using an I-V curve tracer, the inspector would go inside each combiner box, check every string while it’s operating, check every string after they pull the fuse out and see where it’s sitting, etc. Jamie Mordarski, Director, O&M Americas at SMA America, told pv magazine USA that the problem with manual inspection is time.
“It takes anywhere between 15 to 25 minutes per combiner box and if you have a site that has a combiner box with say 1200 combiners boxes, that’s 400 man hours.” He added that in addition to the time it takes, manual inspection doesn’t tell you what the problem is or what module it is. The inspector would have to isolate the string to figure out which module it is.  With a thermal aerial scan, a 600 MW site can be done in 5 hours.
Mordarski said that seven years ago when SMA started using aerial imaging it was not something that every solar asset owner was doing. When he saw what aerial imaging companies like DroneBase could do and how beneficial it was, he knew it was better than going out into the field with a meter. “As people are starting to see more aerial inspection, they realize it’s better, cheaper, quicker, easier,” said Mordarski. “Doing it the old way just doesn’t make sense.”
To conduct its inspection, SMA uses a combination of drones and manned aircraft. Many of the inspections they can do with their own pilots and drones/airplanes, and for very large or highly concentrated portfolios they hire DroneBase. Even when SMA does its own inspections, it supplies SMA’s raw data to DroneBase to complete the analysis.
Technological advancements
Dramatic changes have occured in the technology in the seven years that SMA has been conducting aerial thermal imaging inspections. Mordarski said that there were not off-the-shelf drones back then, and the inspection companies that SMA was working were getting custom built drones from Europe and adding off-the-shelf thermal images that weren’t really made for drones. Some were even using GoPro cameras that they’d strap to the drone. Now drones are made with high-resolution thermal imagers on them natively so you don’t need two separate cameras. They are also capable of doing automated patterns, where you draw a box on a map, set your parameters and off you go. “It does it by itself,” said Mordarski.
Inspections of solar assets by manned aircraft is also becoming more common. It used to be that the drones got better resolution because they fly closer to the solar installations than planes, which have to fly higher. Mordarski pointed out that today you can get the same resolution from the plane as from the drone as long as you’re flying at the right altitude. “The technology has improved, speed has improved, quality has improved, and the cost per engagement has gone down.”
From niche to mainstream
In just a few years, aerial inspection of solar assets has gone from a niche application to mainstream use. Technology has advanced dramatically in the intervening years, and cameras and imaging continues to advance, along with new ways of analyzing the data. For example, DroneBase recently acquired India-based AirProbe, a specialist in drones using artificial intelligence in its analytics. As a result of these new capabilities, DroneBase is expanding its offering to include construction progress monitoring, serial ID mapping, and advanced shade analysis. Overall, aerial inspection has gotten to the point where “everyone has to do it,” said Mordarski. The bottom line, according to Mordarski is that using aerial thermography and high-resolution visual inspection is somewhere between 10x lower cost and 30x as fast as doing it by manually. For SMA, there’s no going back.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/29/faster-lower-cost-interconnection-by-combining-ercot-miso-pjm-approaches/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 29, 2022","Faster, lower-cost interconnection by combining ERCOT, MISO, PJM approaches","“What’s so striking” about the amount of renewable generating capacity added across US grid regions last year “is that ERCOT interconnected about 6,000 MW of renewables, while PJM interconnected only about 2,000 MW,” even though PJM is more than twice as large as ERCOT, Johannes Pfeifenberger, a Principal with The Brattle Group said in a presentation.
ERCOT’s process “is so much faster than some of the other processes,” Pfeifenberger said, because ERCOT “pretty much” follows a process known in the UK as “connect and manage,” as opposed to the “invest and connect” approach followed by most US grid operators. The grid operators are shown in the nearby map from Sustainable FERC Project.

The UK generator interconnection process only considers local upgrades needed to make the injection point “robust enough,” he said, and any network constraints or congestion “are then dealt with through an operational management process like congestion management, curtailment, or network upgrades if planned on a regional basis.”
ERCOT manages network constraints through market dispatch, Pfeifenberger said, “which imposes high congestion and curtailment risks” on interconnecting generators, in part due to “ERCOT’s insufficiently proactive grid planning.”
He believes that generator interconnection that’s “more focused on the local needs will be more timely and cost-effective if combined with proactive regional transmission planning.”
To illustrate that point, Pfeifenberger gave two examples from the MISO and PJM grid regions. MISO has proposed a $10 billion portfolio of six transmission projects that would support interconnection of 53 GW of renewables, and reduce other costs by $37 to $68 billion. PJM identified $3.2 billion in upgrades that would support interconnection of 75 GW of offshore wind, or just $40/kW, which compares to a cost of $6.4 billion PJM previously identified for incremental upgrades for 15 GW of offshore wind.
By being proactive about regional transmission planning, Pfeifenberger said, “…you can really speed up the generator interconnection process quite tremendously.”
In a side note, the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions are “quite behind in terms of renewable demand versus project development,” he said. Both regions have a large gap between renewables projects at an advanced stage of development, and the renewables targets of the states in those regions, he said, citing a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report.
