https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/19/borgwarner-announces-two-u-s-battery-and-ev-charging-factory-expansions/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MICHIGAN,MICHIGAN,SOUTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 19, 2023",BorgWarner announces two U.S. battery and EV charging factory expansions,"Battery producer BorgWarner made two announcements of significant expansions to its manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and its home state of Michigan.
BorgWarner announced it will invest $42 million in the expansion of its Seneca, South Carolina facility. In addition to upgrading existing factory capacity, the investment will help fund the expansion of 3 GWh of new battery pack production lines.
The company expects to add 122 new jobs across production, technical support, manufacturing, engineering, maintenance, and supporting function roles over a three-year span as a result of the investment. Expansion projects are slated to begin in Q2 2023, with expected completion in the first half of 2024.
The battery producer said it worked closely with the State of South Carolina and Oconee County for approval of the expansion. Volker Weng, vice president and general manager, said the expansion moves the company closer to its goal of enabling lower-emissions transportation.
On the same day as the South Carolina announcement, BorgWarner released a report that said it will invest $20 million to expand the capabilities of three of its existing Michigan facilities, while also adding a new electric vehicle service center. An additional 186 jobs are expected to be created as a result of the investment.
The Michigan Economic Development Corporation granted the company $1.86 million for the project via its business development program.
BorgWarner said the project will accelerate development, manufacturing and testing of EV products and EV charging infrastructure. This includes battery modules and packs, DC fast chargers, and microgrid control and operations devices.
The investment will be split across the three facilities. An Auburn Hills facility will add new electrification labs that will house testing equipment and new research and development areas. The Dearborn facility will expand its footprint by about 7,000 square feet, adding a DC fast charging wing. The new enhancements are expected to double the facility’s production and enable a second shift schedule.
“On top of creating more pathway jobs in the community … we intend to use the grant to expand BorgWarner’s manufacturing capability and presence, enhance volume capacity and grow our cross-functional departments,” said Frédéric Lissalde, president and chief executive office, BorgWarner Inc.
BorgWarner posted a full year 2022 net sales of $1.5 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 10.1%. It expects earnings to range $1.6 to $1.75 billion in 2023, with a similar adjusted operating margin.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/19/new-jersey-warehouse-operator-provides-community-solar-access-to-700-residents/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW JERSEY",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 19, 2023",New Jersey warehouse operator provides community solar access to 700 residents,"New Jersey politicians, clean energy and environmental justice advocates and news media convened at an Earth Day week community solar event organized by project developer Solar Landscape to highlight a regional warehouse and logistics business providing solar energy to some 700 local residents. 
On Wednesday, pv magazine USA toured a 1.1 MW (dc) rooftop solar system of RPM Warehousing and Transportation in Avenel, N.J., where Brendon Shank, executive vice president for engagement, Solar Landscape, introduced seven statewide speakers who discussed the shared benefits of equitable solar generation hosted on commercial and industrial rooftops.  
Thomas Connery, chief operating officer of site host RPM Warehousing, told pv magazine USA that after the owner, operator and lessor of 10 warehouse facilities first installed a 480 kW rooftop solar array to offset its Edison, N.J. headquarters’ energy consumption in 2017, its management team saw the benefits of providing its “hundreds of thousands of square feet” warehouse roof space to provide clean energy to local residents. 
Connery said RPM now generates 4.3 MW of solar energy from two of its warehouse facilities in Edison and Avenel, N.J., which is available to local residents, and the logistics business plans to install a third rooftop solar array of about 3.5 MW to 4 MW on a 480,000 square foot facility at a site within a few miles of its Edison home base. 
The logistics executive said having on-site solar generation has offset 100% of the company’s own energy consumption, and over the last two years it saw traction in the New Jersey community solar market taking off to provide clean power access to local residents, many of whom are in low-to-moderate income households. In the early stages of providing community solar to Garden State residents, Connery said combined its facilities have saved local residents about $150,000 per year in energy savings and removed 3,600 tons of CO2 emissions from being burned by conventional power plants.  
pv magazine USA (Michael Schoeck)
Solar Landscape’s Shank said RPM’s first 3.2 MW facility in Edison, N.J. is nearly fully subscribed, while its second facility (1.1 MW) is nearing completion. John Bruno, a Solar Landscape rooftop installer, said the 1.1 MW facility is using about 2,300 Hanwha QCells modules on its rooftop, equipped with SolarEdge inverters. The installation took about one month to assemble. 
Bruno said he received solar installation training over a week-long training course held at a GAF Energy training center in Asbury Park, N.J., and finds the new career exciting, while in a nascent market “creating thousands of jobs along the way.” 
“Solar jobs are booming in New Jersey thanks to community solar,” said Tony Staynings, business community liaison, Edison Job Corps, a career training program for young adults.  “We are training our students to become part of the green energy workforce of the future and build projects like the one we are touring today.”
After neighboring state Maryland put out official plans for a long-term community solar platform earlier this week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is in the mid stages of seeing the state’s pilot community solar framework become a long-term platform. The New Jersey Board is receiving public stakeholder feedback at an April 24 public hearing, taking place at 1 p.m., while stakeholders have a May 15 deadline to send feedback to the regulator for or against the community solar framework, said Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, a clean energy advocacy group. 
“New Jersey is the Saudi Arabia of rooftops,” said O’Malley about the Garden State’s many adaptable rooftop areas suitable for commercial and industrial solar systems.
Just 20 years ago, New Jersey had just six solar installations under its belt. Now the state has 4.41 GW of aggregate solar installations and provides enough clean energy to more than 705,165 households, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. 
Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez, who represents the state’s 19th legislative district in Perth Amboy, N.J., was in attendance at the event and commended Solar Landscape for installing “shared access” power systems that provide clean energy to low-income residents across her district.   
“Whether it’s local composting, recycling, or now shared community energy access, we’re building a future for a time to come,” said Matilde Montalvo, a local community solar subscriber who signed up to procure power from a community solar project over the last year. 
Formed in 1981, RPM Warehousing is a public warehousing and transportation company with 1.5 million square feet of food-grade and general warehousing space along the East Coast at 10 facilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/19/50-states-of-solar-incentives-wyoming/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WYOMING",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 19, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Wyoming,"Through the end of 2022, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that Wyoming has installed a cumulative solar capacity of 146 MW. This is enough solar to power nearly 23,000 homes and represents about 0.5% of the state’s energy mix.
While solar does not yet have a strong presence in Wyoming, it is expected to grow. SEIA estimates that 232 MW will be added in the next five years, more than double the cumulative capacity to date.
Wyoming has invested an estimated $173 million in solar, and the industry currently employs about 150 people across 13 companies, 10 of which are installers.
Incentives 
From now through 2032, Wyoming residents who install solar panels are eligible for the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit. The credit now has a transferability option, meaning if the customer does not have tax liability, they can elect sell the tax credits to someone who does have tax liability to receive the 30% credit as a cash payment.
Wyoming also offers solar customers net metering, the process by which excess solar production that is exported to the grid is credited on the customer’s monthly utility bill.
Net metering is currently valued at a retail rate, meaning that customers are offered a one-to-one value for exported power, though that is coming under threat. Current legislation being evaluated may reduce the retail rate for net metering to an “avoided cost” rate, a fraction of the price paid for retail electricity. If this legislation passes, Wyoming residents will likely have to either size their system small to avoid value losses from overproduction or attach a battery to capture their solar generation.
Another piece of legislation, SF0092, may end net metering in Wyoming. The proposed legislation first renames “net metering” customers as “small generators.” This appears to be an attempt to reclassify behind-the-meter rooftop solar power owners as power plant owners, thus opening them up to a new raft of potential regulations and costs. The law specifically notes that these parties are not “public utilities.”
The law states that Wyoming will develop a new set of regulations to compensate these small generators by April 2024, and that they will be structured to “prevent rate subsidization of customer‑generators by other customers of an electric utility.”
Notable project 
About two-thirds of Wyoming’s total solar capacity comes from the Sweetwater solar project, a 98 MW installation by SOLV Energy, developed by Clenera, an Enlight Renewable Energy company. The installation consists of Trina and Longi panels, Sungrow inverters, and NEXTracker single-axis tracker mounts.
Covering roughly 700 acres, about the size of Central Park in New York, the project generates enough power to serve the equivalent of 12,000 homes each year. Most of the project is located on federal lands.
Development tool
In the interest of preserving those unspoiled lands, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has developed a Brightfields Energy Siting Initiative (BESI) tool specifically for Wyoming, with the intention of guiding new energy development to previously disturbed areas or “brownfields.” By siting solar and wind on land previously used for fossil fuel development, the goal of the initiative is for Wyoming to diversify its energy mix without compromising the state’s iconic wildlife and natural areas.
The BESI tool identifies areas where new energy development is unlikely to encounter significant land use conflicts, permitting delays and cost overruns. It can locate sensitive places to avoid as well as provide information down to an individual project site. For example, it can determine if a potential site would risk conflict with a known mule deer migration route, a location with an abundance of cultural resources nearby or a golden eagle nesting area. It can look at habitat and can flag it as a site that would be better for restoration rather than the site of a new energy facility.

While the North Carolina-based hardware chain has not been topping lists as a corporate solar user, the company has a long history of environmental awareness. Lowe’s won eight consecutive Energy Star awards from 2003 to 2010, including four Energy Star Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency.
Now Lowe’s will embrace solar, with installations on stores and distribution centers. The company selected Connecticut-based Greenskies Clean Focus to provide the solar solution for deployment across a substantial portion of Lowe’s California operations. Under the partnership, Greenskies Clean Focus will design, construct, finance, own and operate rooftop solar energy systems on 52 retail stores and two distribution centers in California. The initial production for the combined 48 MW portfolio is projected at 76 GWh per year, providing 90% of the energy usage at each location.
“Greenskies is proud to support Lowe’s sustainability commitment to fifty percent renewable energy by 2025,” said Stanley Chin, president and CEO of Greenskies Clean Focus. “These projects exemplify how large, multi-site organizations can deploy customized renewable energy solutions at scale to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonize operations.”
Greenskies is a vertical integrator for commercial, public sector and utility energy users, while Clean Focus is the financial arm that finances and owns the systems. Founded in 2009, the company has constructed and is operating 310 MW of renewable energy facilities across 578 sites in 19 states.
Lowe’s will receive renewable solar energy to power the California locations under 20-year, fixed-price power purchase agreements. Greenskies Clean Focus reports that the solar energy will cost less than prevailing utility rates and include environmental attributes, enabling Lowe’s to move closer to its sustainability goals.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association Solar Means Business report, U.S. businesses are increasingly embracing solar power. The report tracks solar and energy storage adoption by businesses across the United States, and its ninth report, released in 2022, finds that nearly 19 GW of solar capacity has been installed with commercial and corporate offtakers and nearly half of that has come online since 2020. Top companies in the retail space include Walmart, Target, Home Depot, IKEA and Macy’s. Lowe’s was not on the list, but the tide is turning.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/19/lawsuit-could-redirect-femas-13-billion-to-rebuild-puerto-ricos-grid-toward-solar/,"ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PUERTO RICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 19, 2023",FEMA’s $13 billion for Puerto Rico’s grid could shift to solar if lawsuit succeeds,"Eight Puerto Rico organizations and the Center for Biological Diversity have sued the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security over their plans to rebuild Puerto Rico’s grid “back to the fossil fuel status quo” instead of investing in “the distributed renewable energy Puerto Ricans need,” according to a statement.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, says that FEMA, in pursuing those plans, has violated the National Environmental Policy Act. The lawsuit says that while FEMA has approved about $12.8 billion for the Puerto Rico utility PREPA to rebuild the grid, based “on information and belief,” so far only “a small fraction of that money has been spent,” and even less has been spent on “permanent works.” The Center for Biological Diversity has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with FEMA asking for detail on its expenditures.
The rebuilding comes after Hurricane Maria caused catastrophic damage to Puerto Rico’s electric transmission and distribution lines in 2017, causing an extended blackout in which thousands died. Puerto Rico also suffered blackouts from Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Fiona in 2022.
The plaintiffs cite multiple studies, from the Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and others, showing that rooftop solar and solar microgrids can address Puerto Rico’s grid problems, largely because they do not depend on “large-scale” transmission lines.
The plaintiffs cite a 2021 study that found that a 75% distributed renewable energy grid for Puerto Rico is feasible and would be less expensive than the current grid. Plaintiffs say the study found that equipping every home in Puerto Rico with 2.7 kW of PV and 12.6 kWh of battery backup could provide 2.7 GW of capacity.
The plaintiffs also noted Puerto Rico’s Act Act 17-2019, which set requirements for PREPA to obtain 20% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050. A 2020 energy plan from Puerto Rican experts and community organizations “centered distributed renewable energy systems” to achieve the targets, the lawsuit says, adding that in 2022, Puerto Rico reached only 3% renewable generation.
“Despite these findings,” the plaintiffs say, FEMA’s focus has remained on rebuilding Puerto Rico’s “outdated, centralized electrical grid,” with most generating capacity on the south of the territory’s main island and large transmission lines extending north over mountainous terrain to the most populous areas.
The lawsuit claims that FEMA has violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in five distinct ways in pursuing its Puerto Rico grid projects. The plaintiffs asked the federal court to order FEMA to prepare a “full-blown” environmental impact statement (EIS) for these projects, explained plaintiffs’ lead attorney Augusta Wilson with the Center for Biological Diversity. “That would force FEMA to finally consider rooftop solar and other distributed renewable resources as a primary source of electricity.”
In addition, with a full EIS, FEMA “would have to disclose the numerous environmental harms of its current plans,” Wilson said. “If FEMA is forced to take those steps, the agency will have no choice but to conclude that investing in clean, resilient distributed renewable energy is the right choice.”
$8.2 billion to PREPA
Early this year, the Center for Biological Diversity sued FEMA to compel the agency to comply with the Center’s late 2021 Freedom of Information Act request, which asked FEMA to disclose how much disaster response funding it has spent nationwide for fossil fuel infrastructure, and how much for renewable energy resources.
FEMA responded with a spreadsheet listing thousands of projects across the U.S., said the Center’s attorney Wilson, but provided few details on those projects. One line item showed $8.2 billion for PREPA for hurricane-related expenses, Wilson said.
The Center submitted another FOIA request to FEMA in February requesting more detailed information about its spending for energy resources in Puerto Rico, Wilson said, but the Center has not yet received any records in response to that request. “FEMA should not be dragging its feet on disclosing how much taxpayer money it’s investing in fossil-fuel projects in the midst of a climate emergency in one of the most climate-fragile places in the world,” she said.
The Department of Homeland Security, also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, is responsible for the supervision, management and control of FEMA’s activities.
While not mentioned in the lawsuit, six U.S. national laboratories have described in a report how Puerto Rico could reach 40% renewable electricity by 2025, as mandated by Puerto Rico’s Act 17.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/19/most-solar-wont-qualify-for-inflation-reduction-act-hydrogen-incentive-per-iea-data/,"HYDROGEN,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 19, 2023","Most solar won’t qualify for Inflation Reduction Act hydrogen incentive, per IEA data","Many assume that solar is clean enough to get any incentive. However, when we look at solar used in the production of hydrogen, it may prevent the hydrogen from qualifying for the hydrogen incentive in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
A recent analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that most silicon-based solar photovoltaics, which is what is generally used in clean hydrogen production, may not qualify for the IRA’s $3 per kilogram incentive for clean hydrogen production. This is due to the fact that the manufacturing emissions for most crystalline silicon solar modules might potentially exceed the 0.45 kilograms of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) per kilogram of hydrogen produced, which is the limit for the highest value IRA hydrogen incentive. In this context, CO2e refers to the lifetime emissions generated during the manufacturing process of solar panels, accounting for all greenhouse gasses in terms of their global warming potential.
According to HydrogenInsight, the IEA said that without further guidance from the IRS on the hydrogen incentive, it was premature to definitively state whether solar-derived hydrogen would or would not qualify.
The IEA analysis, “Towards hydrogen definitions based on their emissions intensity,” examined various energy sources and determined that only nuclear, onshore wind, some solar, and resources that capture emissions would qualify for the full $3/kg incentive.

Source: IEA
The rationale for this conclusion is based on the IRA’s definition of clean hydrogen in ‘Section 45V – Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen’, which defines the base incentive of $0.60/kg of clean hydrogen. This price increases to $3/kg if the installation meets prevailing wage standards.
The IRA then categorizes ‘clean’ hydrogen incentives into four groups based on the estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of each kilogram of hydrogen produced, each receiving a percentage of the $0.60/kg:
The IEA examines hydrogen production via solar-driven electrolysis driven by solar electricity to determine emissions. A cutting-edge electrolyzing technology that has not yet been released aspires to consume 40.4 kWh of energy for each kilogram of hydrogen produced. The Department of Energy suggests a value between 44 and 51 kWh/kg for hydrogen produced in an electrolyzer.
The IEA states:
Based on lifecycle analysis, the production of solar PV modules, for example, is currently associated with emissions of 18-50 g CO2-eq/kWh, which would result in an emissions intensity of hydrogen production of 0.9-2.5 kg CO2-eq/kg.
Using this calculation, solar-powered hydrogen would receive 25 or 33.4% of the $0.60/kg incentive. Solar modules would need to have approximately 9 g CO2e/kWh to reach the 0.45 kg CO2e/kg value required to qualify for the full $3/kg incentive.

Source: Fraunhofer
An analysis by Fraunhofer, A Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Silicon PV Modules: Impact of Module Design, Manufacturing Location and Inventory, found the range of embodied emissions to be at the lower end of the IEA’s estimations. The study examined the country of origin’s power grid emissions, and the materials used in manufacturing to differentiate between solar modules. Glass-glass solar modules generally exhibited lower lifetime emissions, primarily due to their extended lifetimes, despite the resource-intensive nature of glass manufacturing.
Research published with support from First Solar shows that the company’s Series 6 solar modules emit 16.6 g CO2e/kWh.
Since solar power plant embodied emissions are primarily concentrated in the manufacturing of solar panel’s polysilicon, it is logical for this analysis to focus on the solar panel. However, to accurately determine the emissions per kilogram of hydrogen produced, it is also necessary to consider the capacity factor of the deployed solar power plant. This value is significant because it can vary considerably, with rooftop solar installations operating at capacity factors in the low teens, while single-axis tracker facilities in desert regions  may approach 30%. This means that the same solar panel, when deployed in different regions, could generate nearly three times as much electricity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/19/ascent-boosts-production-with-acquisition-of-15-mw-swiss-thin-film-producer/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,COLORADO,SWITZERLAND",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 19, 2023",Ascent boosts production with acquisition of 15 MW Swiss thin-film producer,"Ascent Solar Technologies, a Colorado-based manufacturer of copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin-film solar modules, announced the closing of its acquisition of Flisom AG, a Swiss manufacturer of thin-film solar modules with 15 MW of production capacity.
Ascent will continue to be headquartered in Thornton, Colo. where it has a research and development center and 5 MW nameplate production facility. It will commence manufacturing  immediately from its new roll-to-roll thin-film manufacturing facilities in Zurich, Switzerland.  As a result of the deal’s closing, Ascent will triple its production capacity from its 5 MW of existing nameplate capacity production.
The transaction reflects a significant milestone in Ascent’s turnaround plan by delivering new committed contract revenue, increased production capacity and an international foothold as European and Asian governments adopt legislation to increase solar energy production and domestic manufacturing capabilities, a company statement said.
The Flisom acquisition is expected to provide Ascent with a new revenue stream in the luxury goods and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) markets. The company intends to use its new European presence to provide in-region support for Euro Zone driven net zero initiatives and to support new demand for thin-film arrays in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Modern equipment of the Swiss facility supports Ascent’s focus on operational efficiency and optimization. The Zurich facility is capable of roll-to-roll thin-film outputs up to 3.2 feet in width and 3,200 feet in length.
Ascent’s management anticipates the EBITDA-positive operations of the Swiss assets as early as the second half of 2023 providing a boost to the company’s bottom line earnings profile over the year ahead.
“Since coming aboard the company in September 2022, my priority has been to execute an aggressive turnaround plan and to re-establish Ascent as the leading provider of high-performance, flexible thin-film solar modules for use in scenarios where traditional rigid panels don’t work,” said Jeffrey Max, chief executive officer of Ascent.
“We are seeing a global push for more solar power production and we have identified unmet demand for alternatives to traditional rigid panels that can be used in scenarios where land, form-factor, or weight constraints exist, particularly in Europe and Asia,” Max added.
On December 20, 2022, Ascent raised $50 million in equity from two institutional investors, with Bryan Garnier & Co. acting as financial advisor on the capital raise.
Ascent’s modules have been deployed on space missions, airborne vehicles, agrivoltaic installations, industrial/commercial construction and consumer goods applications.
Founded in 2005 and a public company since 2006, Ascent manufactures its thin-film PV product using a process called monolithic integration (MI). MI enables modules and arrays to have a specific footprint and power output with custom options for voltage and current. The architecture of the module allows it to continue to operate if damaged and in cloudy or overcast conditions, the company said.
The company’s shares traded at $0.37 per share today, down from $2.42 per share on December 19, one day before it disclosed its equity raise.
