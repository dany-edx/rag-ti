KeyBank led the construction and term debt, with U.S. Bank investing the tax equity for the portfolio, in the fourth transaction amongst the three parties since 2017.
The majority of the 13 projects that make up the portfolio will reach commercial operation this year, with the balance occurring in the second quarter, 2023. Three of the projects will incorporate DC-coupled energy storage and will be dispatched by the Amp X optimization and management platform, which allows the assets to autonomously optimize the battery output to maximize their fixed SMART program revenues, while participating in the ISO New England wholesale markets.
“This latest round of financing into community solar transactions pushes Amp’s total tax equity and debt raised past $500M over the last few years in the U.S. community solar market”, said Jared Donald, EVP and Head of Amp’s U.S. Operations. “We’re pleased to have once again attracted top tier institutional financing with KeyBank and U.S. Bank, which speaks to their deep understanding of the market as well as the knowledge and diverse skillset of the Amp team.”
This strategic portfolio of solar-plus-storage assets continues Amp’s investment in the community solar markets in New York and Massachusetts. In other recent news, Amp and EDF Renewables North America, unveiled two new community solar farms for the communities of Verona and Vernon, New York. The two solar farms, named Quiet Meadows Solar Farm 1 & 2, with a combined size of 13.3 MWdc, were developed by EDF Renewables and sold to Amp in late 2021. Following the sale, EDF Renewables remained as the EPC Contractor for both sites. The 5.8 MWdc Quiet Meadows Solar Farm 1 project is located in Verona, New York on approximately 32 acres, while Quiet Meadows Solar Farm 2 is a 7.5 MWdc project located in Vernon, New York and spread across approximately 42 acres.
Last month, Amp and EDF Renewables held an opening ceremony at Quiet Meadows Solar Farm 2 to celebrate the completion and commercial operation of the two projects.
“This project enables us to generate steady, additional income from the farm, and continue our operations without disruption,” said Howard Regner, the hosting landowner. “With the pre-existing infrastructure, we weren’t able to make much money growing crops on this site. The project will help us financially to keep the farm, while providing green energy for the local community. I like to call it sustainable agriculture.”
Combined, the projects will produce enough clean energy equivalent to 2,106 household energy use in one year, 156,000 trees planted, and 12,444 metric tons of annual CO2 emissions avoided.
Amp reported that its U.S. operations, formed in 2016 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, saw its real assets business surpass 200 MW of operating and in-construction assets this year, with a further 500 MW to be built over the coming 2 to 3 years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/25/solar-industry-was-held-back-in-the-first-half-of-2022-but-now-the-floodgates-are-opened/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 25, 2022","Solar industry was held back in the first half of 2022, but now the floodgates are opened","The solar industry hit some obstacles in the first half of 2022, as deployment slowed due to module supply issues. The technology ranked third in the first six months of the year, installing 4.2 GW, trailing natural gas (4.3 GW) and wind (5.2 GW), according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
However, the United States is now on a path for record solar deployment, as the EIA expects the technology to reach 17.8 GW of additions to the grid by year’s end. These “high probability additions” would exceed year’s end totals for natural gas (9.2 GW) and wind (11.2 GW). Energy storage notably may achieve 6.2 GW of deployment by the end of 2022, said EIA.
Much of this less-than-desirable deployment level for the first half of 2022 can be attributed to module supply issues, which stem from a few different causes. One cause is the ongoing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent ripple effects through the global economy, including factory shutdowns, component shortages, and steeply increased shipping and materials costs.
Another significant impact was the Department of Commerce’s investigation of alleged antidumping violations by four Southeast Asian countries that are responsible for 80% of the U.S. supply of polysilicon solar modules. The threat of tariffs under the investigation could be as high as 50-250% of the cost of the modules, leading many developers to cancel or delay projects.
EIA said about 20% of utility-scale solar projects, sized 1 MW and up, were delayed in the first half of 2022. Reports show solar installations were delayed by an average of 4.4 GW each month, compared with average monthly delays of 2.6 GW during the same period last year.

EIA said it surveyed project developers and found most of the projects that will come online in the next 18 months are currently under construction. About 1.9 GW of solar capacity installations are projects currently under construction that have met delays but are still scheduled to come online in 2022; and another 1.7 GW under construction have been delayed to 2023.
Legislation to supercharge deployment
In June, President Biden took executive action to create a moratorium on solar tariffs related to the investigation, thereby clearing the uncertainty in the industry and advancing deployment in the nation. The administration also invoked the Defense Production Act to expand domestic production of solar goods. Any determination that Commerce makes on the anti-dumping investigation will apply after the 24-month moratorium, buying the industry time to deploy projects that were already planned. It was announced this month that any determination will not be made until November at the earliest.
These actions alone would have been a big boost to solar deployment, but U.S. lawmakers were not done yet. This month, the landmark legislation Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was passed, opening the floodgates for a decade of deployment.
The IRA is loaded with incentives that the solar industry has been requesting for years. Chief among them may be the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit at 30%. The 30% applies to both business and residential projects, including projects installed in 2022, and will last until the end of 2032.
For projects smaller than 5 MWac, interconnection costs will also be included in the tax credit. For projects of more than 1 MWac and above must pay attention to employment requirements. By default, the tax credit is 6%. To be eligible for the additional 24%, laborers and mechanics installing solar power projects must be paid prevailing wages and must be part of an electrical apprenticeship program. These tax credits will begin to apply to projects in 2023.
Solar power projects eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10%, up to 40% in total, by purchasing domestically produced hardware. Per the document, 100% of steel and iron must be manufactured in the United States. For manufactured goods – like solar panels, inverters, and electrical gear – the goods must initially be 40% U.S. manufactured, though this percentage will increase in the future.
Projects that are located in former ‘energy communities’ can earn an additional 10% tax credit. Energy communities are first defined as brownfields, and secondly as locations associated with fossil fuels over the last generation.
If a solar power project meets the prevailing wage requirements, it will receive a tax credit of 2.5 cents/kWh for the first ten years of a project’s life in the form of a production credit. If a project does not meet prevailing wage standards, it will earn only 0.3 cents/kWh before adjustment for inflation.
Additionally, there is a 10% adder for solar power projects that sell their electricity via community solar projects to low-income individuals.  Added to all the other tax credit opportunities, the credit could reach as high as 60%.
The Act also includes heavy incentives for boosting U.S. manufacturing. While this won’t have a direct impact on the near-term wave of solar installations, it is an important step in securing a stable supply of solar components for the long term.
All told, reopening solar supply and heavily incentivizing the technology should dramatically boost something that was already in high demand. In a report made by a consortium led by Princeton University called the REPEAT project, it is estimated that solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW a year to 50 GW a year by 2024. By 2031, that number may reach as high as 100 GW per year, according to the REPEAT study.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/25/to-ptc-or-itc-that-is-the-financial-question/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 25, 2022","To PTC or ITC, that is the financial question","Since the late 2000s, the federal government has supported the solar industry – first through a grant, and later through a tax credit that offset the up-front costs of solar power. In parallel, the wind industry was given a Production Tax Credit (PTC). A PTC works much like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), since both credits offset tax liability, dollar for dollar. The main difference between the credits is that while the PTC generates credit for each kilowatt-hour produced, for the first ten years of a project’s lifetime, the full value of the ITC is provided up front, immediately offsetting the project’s installation costs.
Now that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has passed, the new law of the land allows the solar industry to choose between the ITC and the PTC for its own projects, starting in 2023.
The base value of the PTC is 0.3¢ per kWh for projects greater than 1 MWac. If your project pays prevailing wages, that value increases to 1.5¢ per kWh. The PTC is then inflation-adjusted by the IRS. For 2022, that value comes to 2.6¢/kWh.
The question now becomes – which tax credit is more valuable? 30% up front, or 2.6¢/kWh for a decade?

 
Showing off their financial analysis skills, CohnReznick Capital tweeted out this Inflation Reduction Act: Tax Credit Monetization Analysis, which answers whether PTC or ITC will provide a greater tax credit monetization.
Fundamentally, the answer comes down to the upfront cost of a project versus how much electricity a system can actually produce per watt of rated capacity (net capacity factor). If a project is a large-scale facility, with a highly efficient installation technique and great pricing (due to scale), the 30% tax credit is ‘smaller’.
For example, a residential solar project that costs a total of $3.00 per watt to install, will receive a tax credit of $0.90/W. Whereas, a $1/W utility scale facility will receive ‘only’ $0.30/W. Of course, the residential incentive is almost equal to the utility scale price per unit!
The second factor to consider is the quantity of electricity actually generated per watt of solar module capacity. Utility scale projects, without a doubt, have a massive advantage here. The best single axis tracker, bifacial projects in the deserts are near 30% capacity factor. For comparison, the capacity factor for residential solar in the northeast is a little over 10%.
With that, the first chart from CohnReznick Capital (above) shows a comparison of cost and capacity factor. Higher up-front costs, and lower capacity factors (in blue) should go with the ITC. Higher capacity factors, with lower up-front costs, show up as orange, and would benefit more from selecting the PTC. For projects with no clear advantage either way, financial analysts and asset owners will have to make a judgment call based on their perceived opportunity costs.
Cohn notes, “ITC is determined upfront, and may give investors comfort for tax planning and exit timing”, while the, “PTC Tax Equity structure may result in more efficient depreciation monetization (~2x) from a larger TE starting capital account, and no basis reduction.”

CohnReznick Capital also says that if the asset owners can immediately make use of larger, up front tax credit, then that tax credit becomes more valuable. This shifts the blue area in the chart above roughly 10%, toward the top right region, favoring the ITC.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/25/california-to-ban-gas-powered-car-sales-by-2035-2/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 25, 2022",California to ban gas-powered car sales by 2035,"The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is set to vote today to pass a law banning all sales of new internal combustion engines by 2035. Under the law, Californians can continue to drive gas-fueled vehicles and purchase used ones after 2035. The plan also allows for 20% of sales after 2035 to be plug-in hybrids that can run on batteries and gas.
California makes up 10% of the U.S. car market but represents 43% of all plug-in vehicles in the nation, said CARB.
The new law is set to spur demand for infrastructure to support an electric-powered transportation sector, including solar and electric vehicle charging stations. Currently, there are about 80,000 charging stations in California, well short of the goal of 250,000 by 2025.
Massachusetts, Washington and New York are among states that have announced goals to electrify their car markets or have committed to following in the footsteps of California’s rulings.
“The climate crisis is solvable if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to stem the tide of carbon pollution,” said Governor Gavin Newsom.
Transportation is responsible for roughly 30% of carbon emissions. However, carbon emissions reduction goals cannot be met if this new era of electric vehicles are charged by a dirty grid characterized by natural gas and other hydrocarbons. As such, environmental groups are calling for Governor Newsom to step in and alter the state’s rooftop solar policy.
Regulators from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a comprehensive report outlining the state’s path to carbon neutrality, and chief among the recommendations was support for solar, specifically rooftop solar. However, regulators from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have been developing policies that are set to slash the value of rooftop solar in the state.
California’s rooftop solar industry represents over 1.4 million homes, small businesses, and other structures topped with PV. The state accounts for 50% of rooftop solar installations in the United States, and of the 230,000 people employed in the solar industry, as many as 68,000 jobs are supported by the state’s rooftop solar business.
Based on California’s clean energy goals, as much as 28.5 GW of rooftop solar needs to be installed through 2045, according to Environment California. If all this capacity were instead installed on land, 148,000 acres would be needed to support it, an area about half the size of Los Angeles.
However, current policies under development in the state, namely the Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 policy, are set to lower the value of solar in the state. NEM 3.0 slashes the payment made to homeowners for their excess solar energy shared to the grid to a fraction of what it is under today’s net metering program.
The NEM 3.0 proposed decision introduced “non-bypassable charges,” which would add $0.05/kWh to a solar customer’s bill. For context, most Americans pay less than $0.15/kWh for electricity in total. These non-bypassable charges would apply to the electrons generated by the customer’s rooftop solar array and delivered to their own homes. Market conditions and zoning regulations make it very difficult, or even illegal, to disconnect from the grid entirely in many areas in California.
This means that even if the customer completely self-consumes solar energy and doesn’t use utility-generated power, the utility will profit from the homeowner’s system via non-bypassable charges.
“The ambitious plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars is exactly the kind of climate solutions California and the rest of the country should be adopting,” said EWG President and Bay Area resident Ken Cook.
“But it will require the state to dramatically ramp up investments in residential and commercial solar that will be needed to charge the millions of electric vehicles in the coming decade,” said Cook. “I don’t see how Gov. Newsom can achieve what his administration would like to do on clean transportation without the most robust rooftop and community solar programs the state can support.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/25/to-facilitate-a-high-der-grid-california-explores-how-distribution-grids-should-be-operated/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 25, 2022","To facilitate a high-DER grid, California explores how distribution grids should be operated","A California proceeding aims to “modernize” the electric distribution grid for a “high distributed energy resources future.”
The proceeding is designed to consider “new and improved approaches” to electric distribution planning and operations, “to accommodate the anticipated high growth of distributed energy resources in California,” said Darcie Houck, a commissioner with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), on a CPUC webinar.
Regulators will evaluate how various models for distribution operators may facilitate a high level of distributed energy resources (DERs), and also “unlock” economic opportunities for DERs to provide grid services, limit market power, reduce ratepayer costs, increase equity, support grid resiliency, and meet state policy objectives.
Essential roles for the reliable operation of a distribution grid could be met in various ways under various models for distribution operators, said consulting economist Lorenzo Kristov, on the webinar. He said one possibility is that the distribution grid would be operated by an entity other than the distribution grid owner, which owns the wires and transformers.
The CPUC has launched a public engagement process as part of the proceeding “to ensure that all of California is able to benefit from the energy transition,” said Houck. “DERs, particularly load flexibility and electric vehicles, are going to be a huge part of that, and we have to make sure that we’re working with everyone to achieve these goals.”
“The rulemaking is not attempting to put our finger on the scale of what we think is the right amount of DER,” said Gabriel Petlin, a supervisor with the CPUC’s energy division. “We are agnostic as to the levels of DER adoption, but we recognize that it is a wave of increasing penetration that is going to happen.”
On a parallel track, the California Energy Commission (CEC) has launched an investigation on the role of DER in California’s energy future that is focused on “maximizing the potential of DER,” said Tom Flynn, a senior electrical engineer with the CEC’s energy assessments division, on the CPUC webinar. The CEC proceeding will explore policy options to “grow DER,” said Flynn, and aims to “capture the full range of potential benefits that DER brings.”
The CPUC and CEC are working collaboratively on the CPUC proceeding, Houck said.
The CPUC webinar follows a March 2022 white paper titled “Evaluating alternative distribution system operator models for California,” prepared by Gridworks, whose website says it is lead facilitator of the CPUC’s “high DER” stakeholder process.
Eleven groups jointly responded to that white paper, challenging the proposed community engagement process, in a slide deck provided as an attachment to the CPUC’s webinar notice.
