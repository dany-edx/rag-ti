The most common solar technologies deployed to date are crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe), the costs of which have dropped markedly in recent years. The US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) said in order to meet 2035 targets, solar deployment has to double in the next three years, and ultimately ramp up to 100 GW by 2035.
While most development will use silicon and CdTe, SETO sees potential in nascent technologies like halide perovskites.
SETO finds that the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of halide perovskites (over 25% in single-junction cells and over 29% in tandem cells with silicon) show promise. One advantage of perovskites is that they can be easily manufactured in high volume. However, significant technological challenges must be addressed before perovskites are ready for commercial power sector markets.
In a recent Energy Focus report, SETO covers the critical technical barriers, the commercialization pitfalls and opportunities, and efforts to overcome barriers and challenges to commercialization. It also references SETO-funded projects, which can be viewed in the Solar Energy Research Database.
Barriers to commercialization
One of the major barriers is cost. In order for perovskite to be commercially competitive, its levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) must be competitive with that of other technologies. And with the cost of silicon and CdTe modules dropping while warranty times are increasing, it will be a steep challenge for perovskite to compete on an LCOE basis.

Evidence of system reliability will also be needed in order for financial institutions to support projects that use perovskite modules. A schematic of these challenges is shown in Figure 1.
“As researchers continue to develop perovskites, there are lessons to be learned from the fates of other photovoltaic technologies. SETO is focused on helping perovskite photovoltaic companies to avoid those pitfalls and spurring innovation in order to get this technology market-ready and accelerate the deployment of solar energy.” Dr. Lenny Tinker, photovoltaics program manager, Solar Energy Technologies Office, US Department of Energy.
Module and cell durability
Durability is the largest technological risk for perovskite PV. For LCOE metrics to approach SETO’s 2030 goals of $0.02 kWh, perovskite PV will have to last at least 20 years in the field, which will require improving its ability to withstand various environmental conditions. Much testing is required, yet today’s tests are geared toward commercialized PV technologies (Si, CdTe, etc.) and are unlikely to capture all the failure modes relevant to perovskite modules in the field.
Existing tests may also be excessive or promote irrelevant or uncharacteristic modes of perovskite device failure. SETO has published some minimum durability performance targets which, if realized, would provide strong evidence that a prototype perovskite PV device is ready to enter an initial production stage. To this end, SETO funds considerable perovskite durability work as well as development of test standards.
Efficiency at scale
Efficiency, often considered a strength of perovskite PV, requires significant improvement for large-area devices before they are ready for the commercial arena. While standardized cell and module form factors have yet to be finalized for perovskite PV, standards will be a crucial prerequisite to scaling the entire industry beyond initial demonstration projects.
To encourage industry standardization and communication, SETO is promoting collaboration among academia, the national laboratories, and industry—intended to bring diverse perspectives and expertise to bear on common problems, accelerate cycles of learning, and facilitate transfers of knowledge and skills. Industry consortia like PACT and the US Manufacturing of Advanced Perovskites (MAP) consortium allow companies to connect and share best practices within this industry.
Manufacturing
The final major technical hurdle to commercialization is achieving high production yield, with narrow distributions in module efficiencies. Barriers related to process control and manufacturing yield are often underappreciated, and perovskite solar cells have not yet demonstrated broad process flexibility in the lab. Cost-effective deposition processes will need to tolerate small variations in factors such as deposition tooling conditions, deposition environment, and ink compositions.
SETO has emphasized process control in perovskite projects across its portfolio, ensuring that changes in performance or efficiency are statistically significant and robust from a process standpoint, while funding the development of processes which, when scaled up, might be easier to control.
Bankability
The ability of perovskite PV technologies to secure investor financing with low interest rates, may be even more significant than the technical challenges to perovskite PV commercialization.
Financing will be necessary for scaled manufacturing lines and deployment projects. Bankability is directly related to the confidence financers have that (1) the technical challenges have been solved, (2) the financed assets will perform long enough to deliver a desired return on investment, and (3) the liability of product failure and warranty claims is low. Ensuring bankability and durability standards are met is a SETO priority.
Future opportunity
These challenges faced by perovskite technology makes it uncertain as to if and when it can achieve gigawatt-scale deployment. In the meantime, there are many different applications that can support higher dollar-per-watt costs and durability issues including transportation, building integrated PV, military operations, aerospace, and Internet of Things. Substantial capital will be needed to scale the perovskite industry, which will come only once investors and financiers have confidence in the profitability of perovskite manufacturers and the long-term durability of perovskite module technologies.
Sustainable growth of the perovskite industry depends on avoiding these pitfalls and requires patient and careful investment that corresponds with the timeline and magnitude of progress needed to adopt this technology into products.
SETO has supported a wide range of perovskite startups in various stages of development, through different programs, as SETO can support sustainable investment in the perovskite PV space by providing nondilutive capital to promising early-stage commercial entities. Startups further along in the product development cycle and closer to pilot manufacturing are encouraged to apply for funding through SETO’s Incubator program.
Overall, the opportunities for perovskites as a solar technology are great. It has the potential to develop into a high-efficiency, low-cost module technology for commercial power sector deployment, with throughput rates and energy payback times superior to state-of-the-art PV technologies. SETO calls for members of the perovskite community increase device size, demonstrate relevant outdoor durability, and make processes robust in order to tap the potential of perovskite in the solar energy sector.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/19/common-energys-vision-for-the-future-of-community-solar/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 19, 2022",Common Energy’s vision for the future of community solar,"Earlier this month, community solar provider Common Energy announced one of the largest investments ever made in the community solar space. It secured $16.5 million from S2G Ventures for the purpose of expanding consumer access to local, community solar projects across the country, scaling Common Energy’s energy management platform, and growing the company’s management and operating teams. 
Looking to dig more into the specifics of Common Energy’s business growth and platform enhancement goals, pv magazine sat down with company CEO and Founder, Richard Keiser, who also took some time to expand on his vision for the future of community solar’s role in the U.S. energy transition, and where Common Energy fits into that role.
Like other community solar providers, Common Energy operates as a two-sided marketplace, with a software platform that connects two different parties: energy users who want to support community solar projects, and independent power producers (IPPS), who own and operate the projects. Common Energy’s platform has two aspects to meet the needs of each of these parties: a consumer facing aspect, which enables members of the public to sign up and enroll; and a developer facing aspect, which is geared toward project management.
Common Energy said the financial and collections visibility provided by the platform results in higher project ROI for its clients. The platform can also be customized to facilitate reporting and accounting. 
“There are different aspects of the platform for each different constituent,” said Keiser. “[For energy users,] you want to make things as easy as possible to enroll, so we’re constantly looking for innovation and improvement to facilitate an easy customer journey. With respect to developer tools, you really want to have good visibility into the project performance, project collections, and into reporting, to make it easier for developers to see what the return is on the project, see how well it’s subscribed, and see how well it’s collecting. We’re constantly investing in those two areas of the platform to serve both of those constituents.”
According to Keiser, Common aims to partner with well-financed developers that have an existing track record of delivering a large number of projects or large number of installed MW, citing Standard Solar as a client who fit the bill. These and other similar companies approach Common with a portfolio that they need help executing. Usually, they partner on a collection of projects in one geography – Keiser used hypothetical examples of a 20 MW portfolio in Illinois and a 30 MW portfolio in New Jersey – and Common fills in the demand gap by securing customers to purchase the energy generated by each project within the portfolio.
As Common Energy evolves, aided especially by S2G Venture’s investment, Keiser says the name of the game is growth and platform execution in what he believes will become a rather consolidated market for community solar solutions providers.
“First priority is growth of the team,” he said. “You want to get more talented people on board, and when you do that, then they build great products. So, in terms of focus, it’s growing out our team, investing in the platform and securing more volume… Servicing these projects is complex, because instead of having one offtaker, each project might have 300 to 1000 different offtakers. That means you’re keeping track of the accounting for 300 or 1000 subscribers per project each month; collecting money for from them each month and depositing that money into developer accounts each month. This is among the most complex servicing businesses out there, so we believe that a number of players will have difficulty scaling that operation and delivering the performance that matters for developers.”
Keiser sees this potential consolidation in the community solar management realm as net positive for the entire industry, not just his firm. In his view, community solar will be insulated from the typical stagnation in market development and innovation that occurs when competition is consolidated, because the market for developers and demand for project will still be as diverse as ever.
“Without question, large scale renewables are the fastest way to decarbonize,” Keiser said. “However, community solar plays a very important role in that, the consumer needs to take the step to educate themselves just to enroll and get personally involved with the subscription. Large scale renewables can happen completely invisible to the consumer, whereas community solar involves the consumer directly in supporting the project. When they do that, they feel and experience a much deeper connection to what is actually happening, because the project is locally built, it’s near where their home is, they can drive to it, see it. That plays an important role as a catalyst for the consumers mindset.”

The 75 MW project is planned for San Bernadino County, California, and Electrify America is signed on for all the estimated annual production of 225,000 MWh for 15 years. The company entered into a virtual power purchase agreement, which allows a business to source renewable energy from a remote location to power its operations.
The project is expected to break ground in late 2022 and is planned to reach commercial operations in mid-2023. Though the project will not be activated until next year, Electrify America is already backed by 100% renewable generation through the purchase of clean energy certificates from other existing generation sources.
“Electrify America’s business model and purpose have always been at the forefront of efforts to reduce emissions through enabling electric mobility,” said Giovanni Palazzo, president and CEO of Electrify America. “Our commitment to customers and to a sustainable future go hand-in-hand, which is why we are investing in renewable energy generation to commit to a net zero carbon footprint associated with the energy delivered to our customers.”
In addition to purchasing off-site renewable energy, the company invests in on-site solar at its charging locations. It has invested $2 million in 30 Level 2 charging stations in rural California that are fully off-grid. Each station includes a sun-tracking solar array that can charge two vehicles at a time, with a maximum rate of 3.5 kW. It can charge during any weather condition or time of day thanks to the attached energy storage on the off-grid system.
It also installs on-grid solar on canopies at its EV charging stations. Its Baker, California station has DC fast chargers on-site. To illustrate the charging power difference between AC and DC fast charging, a Level 2, 7.2kW AC charger can take one hour to deliver about 27 miles of EV range. A 50 kW DC fast charger can deliver the same 27 miles of range in about ten minutes.
“In aggregate, these 100% renewable energy commitments address Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions for all energy delivered to our customers, and amount to an estimated 2 million metric tons in avoided CO2 emissions over 15 years – comparable to the carbon sequestered by planting nearly 40 million trees,” said Jigar Shah, head of energy services at Electrify America.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/19/li-cycle-opens-its-third-north-american-spoke-facility/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,ARIZONA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 19, 2022",Li-Cycle opens its third North American Spoke facility,"Li-Cycle, currently the largest capacity lithium-ion battery recycling company in North America, said the company’s previously announced Arizona Spoke facility located in Gilbert, Arizona has commenced commercial operations.
The facility is LiCycle’s first located West of the Mississippi, chosen due to its proximity to California, an early adopter of energy storage projects, and thus will be the site of the first large wave of retiring storage systems. The facility is als located close to the company’s existing battery and manufacturing scrap supply network in the Southwestern United States, which Li-Cycle shares will optimize logistics and other efficiencies for recycling services.
“The launch of Li-Cycle’s innovative battery recycling facility bolsters Arizona’s already robust EV supply chain and sends a signal that Arizona is the place to be for electric batteries,” said Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. “Sustainable industries have found a home in Arizona, and few companies represent the innovation and possibilities that brings like Li-Cycle. We are proud to see Li-Cycle’s facility up and operational.”
For Li-Cycle, a ‘Spoke,’ facility is one which produces a ‘black mass’ from spent lithium-ion batteries. This material is then sent to a ‘Hub’ facility, a wet chemistry/hydrometallurgical plant that will refine battery-grade materials from ‘black mass.’ Li-Cycle’s Spoke facilities use proprietary technology that processes full EV battery packs without dismantling them manually, making recycling of those battery packs safer, sustainable and more labor efficient. The company’s long-term commercial goal is that a handful of regional Spoke plants will produce ‘black mass’ for a regional Hub plant to then refine, rather than having to ship black mass all the way across the country.
Li-Cycle’s first regional Hub plant was planned to open earlier this year in Rochester, New York, however the company announced in December 2021 that it would be expanding the input processing capacity of its Rochester, New York Hub facility due to rapidly-growing demand. The company estimates that the Hub will require a total capital investment of approximately $485 million, and will push back the facility’s targeted completion date until some time in 2023. Li-Cycle expects that the Hub will be capable of processing 35,000 tonnes of black mass annually.
Individually, the Arizona site will be able to process up to 10,000 metric tons of manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries per year.
Alongside the Hub, the Rochester location also houses a “spoke” facility, which was completed in December 2020. The Rochester spoke has the capacity to process up to 5,000 tons of spent lithium-ion batteries per year, which brings Li-Cycle’s total recycling capacity to 10,000 tons/year through its two North American Spokes. The company also has a Spoke facility in Kingston, Ontario.
Li-Cycle’s nextSpoke plant, currently under construction in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, which is of the same design as the Arizona Spoke, is scheduled to be operational in the third quarter of 2022. When both the Arizona and Alabama Spokes are operational, Li-Cycle will have a total processing capacity of 30,000 tons annually. By the end of 2023, the company expects to have a total of 65,000 tons of lithium-ion battery processing capacity annually, across its Spokes in North America and Europe.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/19/house-of-representatives-joins-growing-opposition-to-solar-anti-circumvention-investigation/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 19, 2022",House of Representatives joins growing opposition to solar anti-circumvention investigation,"The latest in a series of political and industry leaders calling for the Department of Commerce to swiftly end its investigation into the alleged anti-circumvention violations of Chinese solar panel exporters comes from the House of Representatives, as 85 members signed a petition to President Biden.
In the petition, the House expressed “grave concern for the economic and environmental impacts” of the inquiry, which could lead to tariffs on solar goods ranging from 50 to 250% or more. About 80% of the US supply of crystalline silicon solar panels comes from the four Southeast Asian nations that house operations under investigation.
In 2017 to 2018, similar inquiries resulted in major solar suppliers being issued tariffs exceeding 90%. The ones levied on Trina Solar were 92.5%, Risen Energy 100.79%, Canadian Solar 95.5%, Jinko Solar 95.5%.
This level of risk is untenable, and it has already led to widespread project cancellations and delays. This year’s probe has essentially halted utility-scale solar buildout, and the Solar Energy Industries Association cut its deployment forecast for the year by 46%.
The petition reads: 
A recently released survey of over 700 solar companies found that 83% of respondents were experiencing delays or cancelations from their CSPV suppliers. A project-level survey found that more than 50 gigawatts of new solar projects are currently canceled or delayed because of the Commerce inquiry. Modeling suggests that these cancellations and delays could cost the industry more than 100,000 jobs and increase CO2 emissions by an additional 364 million metric tons of CO2 between now and 2035, which is the equivalent emissions of 97 coal-fired power plants.
The petition continued that the signees are strong supporters of the domestic solar manufacturing sector, but that this inquiry would not benefit the industry, outside a few select firms. It noted that the majority of US solar manufacturing jobs are involved not in creating modules, but in producing mounting, racking, trackers, and other balance of system components, so the probe does little help to boost existing US companies.
The petitioners suggested that instead conducting of this investigation, which likely won’t meaningfully benefit domestic manufacturing, enacting legislation like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act and a long-term extension of the solar investment tax credit would pave the way for a US supply chain.
The note concludes by commending President Biden for setting targets of 100% clean energy by 2035 and net-zero economy-wide emissions by 2050, but highlights the fact that the current investigations threaten to completely derail progress towards those goals.
“We therefore respectfully request that the Department of Commerce take steps to expeditiously reach a preliminary determination as soon as duly possible, and that this determination take into account the larger impact on American jobs and your administration’s ambitious climate goals, in so far as is possible under the law,” concludes the letter.

Trina Solar’s energy storage unit officially launched the Trina Storage Elementa grid-scale energy storage system at the Smarter E event in Munich last week, featuring its proprietary lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells.
The 2.1 MWh DC All-New Elementa is a modular LFP battery cabinet with a plug-in concept to connect multiple units. The standardized design and factory-installed configuration purportedly reduces installation times by up to 70%. The system is designed to make on-site installation simpler, cutting capex by up to 8%, said the manufacturer.
Elementa has fully integrated battery management systems and thermal runaway and safety features such as a bi-directional liquid cooling system, gas sensors, and heat and smoke detectors. On the back of improved LFP battery cell performance, Elementa is able to provide up to 10,000 cycles, which according to Trina, is 25% more than the Tier 1 market average.
Furthermore, the manufacturer claims that its grid-scale storage solution cuts the total cost of ownership by 25% per MWh compared to Tier-1 market average. While massive in size, the system can fit into a shipping container.
Elementa was first unveiled in October last year as part of Trina Storage’s debut at Intersolar Europe. Trina Solar’s storage division was founded in February last year. In the meantime, the business has already supplied its first project, 50 MW/56.2 MWh fully integrated battery storage system in Burwell, England, for energy infrastructure provider SMS plc to provide balancing services to the UK National Grid. The system was commissioned in February.
Unlike some other major PV manufacturers that have decided to step into the battery storage arena, Trina is producing all battery components from the bottom up. “We control the supply chain ourselves,” Ken Rush, Trina Storage’s head of product and engineering, told pv magazine.
Nonetheless, demand is ramping up so fast that Trina Storage is struggling to keep up. The business already has more than 100 customers throughout the world. As Rush told pv magazine, Trina Storage is sold out for the year and continues to scale up production as we speak.
Current order waiting times are around six to seven months and a “large portion” of Trina’s 3 GWh LFP capacity in China’s Jiangsu province, is in production and will be scaled up in the near future. The business has also set up an integration base that enables a customizable battery energy storage system design with an annual capacity of 5 GWh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/19/michigan-utility-adds-two-solar-projects-with-enough-power-to-supply-150000-homes/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MICHIGAN",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 19, 2022","Michigan utility adds two solar projects with enough power to supply 150,000 homes","Consumers Energy, a utility serving 6.8 million residential customers in Michigan, announced it entered agreements to add two 150 MW solar projects to its portfolio, enough to power 150,000 homes. 
The projects are expected to reach commercial operations by the end of 2024. When complete, Consumers would purchase power from Confluence Solar project in Genesee County and Heartwood Solar project in Hillsdale County. Both agreements are under review by the Michigan Public Service Commission. Ranger Power will own and operate the two sites. 
The $200 million Confluence Solar project is expected to create up to 250 jobs and generate over $25 million in new property tax revenues over the lifetime of the project. The Heartwood project is valued at $150 million and expected to bring a similar amount of jobs, and about $19 million in tax revenues. Local townships, schools, airports, libraries, and transportation authorities are expected to benefit from the added revenues. 
“Providing 300 MW of clean energy for our customers is a commitment to our planet, the people of Michigan and contributes to the prosperity of communities where solar projects are sited,” said Timothy Sparks, Consumers Energy’s vice president of electric grid integration. 
Today, Consumers Energy purchases solar from 18 sites located across the state. It has set high solar procurement goals, targeting 8 GW of utility scale solar power by 2040, including 1.1 GW by 2024.  
If the utility achieves 2040 goal, it will power roughly 60% of its operations with carbon-free electricity. This would equate to the removal of 63 million tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to removing 12.4 million gas-burning passenger vehicles from the road for one year. 
Seeking land for development
Currently, Consumers Energy is gathering information and requesting submissions for ideal sites for solar projects.
These sites include farm fields, brownfield sites, and publicly owned properties ranging from 500 to 900 acres, often comprised of multiple neighboring landowners, said the utility. A good solar site is characterized as flat, open, and treeless with direct access to sun and proximity to existing transmission infrastructure.
Participating landowners may sell the property or create an ongoing revenue source by entering into long-term easement agreements.
Consumers Energy targets utility scale projects around 100 MW in capacity, and said its projects will likely require between five to ten acres per megawatt of electricity.
“We need support throughout Michigan, especially in rural and agricultural areas, and we want to work with landowners and local leaders interested in siting solar power plants to deliver environmental and economic benefits for their communities,” said Dennis Dobbs, vice president of Enterprise Project Management and Environmental Services.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/19/energy-sector-should-be-better-prepared-for-cyber-attacks-said-dnv/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 19, 2022","Energy sector should be better prepared for cyber attacks, said DNV","Energy is one of the top three industries reporting cyber attacks, according to DNV, an independent assurance and risk management provider operating in more than 100 countries. Last year a ransomware attack shut down the Colonial Pipeline, a major supplier of transportation fuel consumed on the East Coast of the United States. The attack by the group Darkside led to soaring prices and panic-buying at the fuel pump until the payment of $4.4 million was made in Bitcoin. How did it happen?  It was simply a stolen username and password from the virtual private network that didn’t use multifactor authentication, according to a Bloomberg report.
The Cyber Priority report, released today by DNV, surveyed 948 energy professionals and found that while IT environments are protected, energy businesses need to boost security for its operational technologies (OT), which are the computing and communication systems they use to manage, monitor and control industrial operations. The survey found that fewer than half of the respondents (47%) believe that their OT security is as robust as their IT security and less than one-third of those working with OT believe their company is making securing their supply chain a top priority.
Energy companies have been tackling IT security for several decades. However, securing operational technology (OT) – the computing and communications systems that manage, monitor and control industrial operations – is a more recent and increasingly urgent challenge for the sector. As OT becomes more networked and connected to IT systems, attackers can access and control systems operating critical infrastructure such as power grids, wind farms, pipelines and refineries. Our research finds the energy industry is waking up to the OT security threat, but swifter action must be taken to combat it. Less than half (47%) of energy professionals believe their OT security is as robust as their IT security, said Trond Solberg, Managing Director, Cyber Security, DNV.
The lack of security is not because they are not aware of the possibility of cyberattacks. Four-fifth of the respondents believe a cyberattack on the industry is likely to cause operational shutdowns (85%) and damage to energy assets and critical infrastructure. Three quarters (74%) expect an attack to harm the environment while more than half (57%) anticipate it will cause loss of life.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only heightened the concern for and awareness of the threat. Six in ten C-suite level respondents acknowledge that their organization is more vulnerable to an attack now than it has ever been. However, it appears that some companies are taking a wait-and-see approach before taking action. One explanation for this approach may be that fewer than one quarter (22%) suspect their organization has had a serious breach in the last five years.
“It is concerning to find that some energy firms may be taking a ‘hope for the best’ approach to cyber security rather than actively addressing emerging cyber threats. This draws distinct parallels to the gradual adoption of physical safety practices in the energy industry over the past 50 years,” said Solberg.
DNV recommends that the first step to strengthen defenses is to shore up the supply chain. The Cyber Priority survey reveals that investing in vulnerability discovery must include companies they partner with and procure from.
“Our research identifies ‘remote access to OT systems’ among the top three methods for potential cyber-attacks on the energy industry. We would urge the sector to pay greater attention to assuring that equipment vendors and suppliers demonstrate compliance with security best practice from the earliest stages of procurement,” said Jalal Bouhdada, Founder and CEO at Applied Risk, an industrial cyber-security firm acquired by DNV in 2021.
Balance investment between training and technology
When where their organization is most mature in their cyber security efforts, more than half (59%) pointed more to upgrades to core IT systems and software than they did to training (41%) or the introduction of cyber security expertise (25%). It can be concluded that less focus is dedicated to developing a workforce skilled in understanding and identifying threats, and in detecting and containing attacks.

Despite emerging cyber security threats, DNV’s research reveals that less than a third (31%) of energy professionals assert confidently that they know exactly what to do if they were concerned about a potential cyber risk or threat on their organization. This finding points to a need for energy companies to invest in training employees to spot instances of criminal attempts to gain access to their systems
“A company’s workforce is its first line of defense against cyberattacks. Effective workforce training, combined with ensuring you have the right cyber security expertise in place, can make all the difference to safeguarding critical infrastructure. Our research shows a clear need for companies to carefully evaluate their investments in keeping their people well informed of how to identify and respond to incidents in a timely manner,” said Bouhdada.
In the United States, the US Department of Energy (DOE) working to shore up the solar industry’s resilience to cyberattack. In a speech at the State Department in early February, President Joe Biden announced an “urgent initiative” to improve US capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is continuing its effort to shore up the solar industry’s resilience against cybersecurity threats. SEIA and the Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) hosted a half-day virtual summit on the state of cybersecurity in the industry, with emphasis on how these threats must be taken into account from the initial design phase. SunSpec and the Sandia National Laboratories lead a distributed energy resource (DER) Cybersecurity Workgroup to create an industry standard for cybersecurity from the competing frameworks. Interested companies can join the working group to contribute to the development of these critical industry standards and best practices.
