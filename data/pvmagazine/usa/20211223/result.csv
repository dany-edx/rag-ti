The project is valued at about $120 million.
Azimuth will continue as an active partner in the development of the site. Upon completion of development, Scout will procure, construct, and operate the project. 
The project has an active request in the AECI interconnection queue, with the agreement expected to be made in Q1 2022. The facility will interconnect directly into AECI’s grid via a 69kV KAMO Power substation.
The facility is planned for commercial operations in 2025, and is expected to deliver 200,000 MWh of electricity, enough to power 15,000 Missouri homes.
“There is increasing demand for renewables across the US and in particular in Missouri,” said Michael Rucker, CEO and founder of Scout Clean Energy. “Importantly, the partnership with Azimuth Renewables means that Scout will be able to work hand in hand with an experienced team of developers to bring this important project to market as safely and efficiently as possible.”
Once operating, the project will be owned and operated by Scout. Scout is a portfolio company of Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, an Australian-headquartered specialist global investment firm in renewables, storage, and grid infrastructure. Quinbrook also holds U.S. development firm Primergy Solar as a portfolio business. Primergy is developing the 690 MW solar, 1400 MWh storage Gemini solar facility in Nevada.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports Missouri’s total installed PV capacity as 361.6 MW, ranking it 33rd in the nation. SEIA estimates 2,522 solar jobs in the state, and a total investment of $924 million. The state is projected to install 937 MW over the next five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/23/nem-3-0-erodes-solar-value-makes-batteries-essential-and-weakens-grid-flexibility-in-california/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 23, 2021","NEM 3.0 erodes solar value, makes batteries essential, and weakens grid flexibility in California","Proposed changes to California’s net-metering program, the process by which the utility credits a customer’s bill for exporting excess solar production to the grid, is expected to harshly erode the value of rooftop residential solar without the aid of battery energy storage.
Payments to customers for their excess energy could be reduced by as much as 80%, reports the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA). Customers of PG&E, who normally would be paid about $0.224/kWh, would now be paid an estimated $0.049/kWh. Homeowners with solar attached to the grid could also face monthly charges as high as $75 a month. Bloomberg NEF estimates the change would extend battery-less solar system payback periods to 11 years, up from six to eight years.
Commercial customers would be charged “grid benefits charges”, monthly charges based on size of system. For example, in PG&E territory, a 750 kW system would pay $5,595 a month, and an agricultural systems sized at 500 kW would pay $4,805 a month.
Bloomberg NEF’s forecast for solar installations in the state would shrink if the currently-proposed rule passes, even if the federal solar tax credit is extended another ten years.
“We believe the solar-customer fixed fees averaging about $700 per year are in violation of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). If adopted, the proposal will cost tens of thousands of jobs, especially among the thousands of solar companies unable to offer battery storage solutions due to supply shortages. The proposal is contrary both to what Californians have clearly said they want and to editorials in all major California newspapers. Finally, the proposed reduction to grandfathering for existing customers is an outrageous violation of trust and undermines the Commission’s stated interest in consumer protection.” Ed Fenster, co-executive chairman, Sunrun.
With these potential fees looming, Californians are preparing for the future and adopting battery energy storage. With a home battery, a customer does not need to rely on the net-metering to unlock the value of their solar system. There are several incentives in state for batteries, and having one helps customers avoid the monthly fixed charges in addition to avoiding value losses from net metering. But even so, on balance the payback period for residential solar is expected to be longer for NEM 3.0.
A battery does come with important benefits, like providing power in the case of a blackout. This offers increased resilience in an age of a changing climate and increased wildfires. A survey by SunPower of prospective solar customers in the U.S. indicated that about 40% of respondents said that they worry about outages on a monthly basis. One in five said that they were concerned about losing their power every week. One third of this group said they see high-profile outages, such as those in Texas this past February, as a central reason to shop for backup power sources. Of those considering solar, 70% said they plan to include a battery energy storage system.

However, batteries would not be used the way they should be to maximize energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and unlock savings for California homeowners. Ed Fenster, co-executive chairman, Sunrun, said that California may mimic earlier stages of energy storage development in Hawaii, where homeowners would self-consume storage to avoid the monthly tariff, foregoing exporting to the grid and to their neighbors in demand-response programs.
Such power dispatch programs are studied to have benefits for grid reliability, lessening blackouts. They also use electricity more efficiently and lessen the need for energy storage capacity. A study by the University of Otago in New Zealand connected batteries over several neighborhoods, and aggregated them in a demand-response export system. The results found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% or peak shaving. This method of electricity use represents a lower-carbon way to operate the grid.
The proposed NEM 3.0 could take effect as soon as January 27th, 2022, as the California Public Utilities Commission is set to vote.

Largest among these proposed projects is the $93 million, 65 MW Paddock Solar Project, which is expected to begin construction in 2022 and wrap up toward the end of 2023. The project will be installed on about 468 acres of land, located off Highway 213 in Beloit, Wisconsin, right on the Illinois-Wisconsin border, southwest of Milwaukee.
All that stands between the project and construction beginning is application review and subsequent approval from state regulators, which project developers expect by June. The Paddock Solar Project is part of a 115 MW project portfolio sold to Alliant Energy by Capital Dynamics.
Also included in that portfolio is the 50 MW Albany project, though no development updates have been offered for that project and it is not included in the three-project, 165 MW portfolio that Alliant is advancing.
In the Town of Fulton, almost due west of Milwaukee, construction has begun on the $62 million North Rock Solar Project, a 50 MW installation which saw construction begin in August. According to a construction update, installation is over 40% complete, with 55% of all piles and 5% of trackers installed. Non-solar construction and site efforts, including road construction and site grading, is nearly complete, and electrical cable installation is roughly 50% complete.
The project is anticipated for completion and commercial operation in the first half of 2023.
Finally, another project awaits regulatory approval in summer 2022, the $78 million, 50 MW Green County solar project, being developed on 400 acres in the town of Decatur, located in the same general region as all the previously-referenced projects.
As was true with the aforementioned projects, Alliant expects the project to achieve operation in early 2023.

The project, which will power approximately 15,000 households, is being developed by Canada-based Innergex Renewable Energy Inc.
The State of Hawaii has a goal of producing 100% renewable energy by 2045, an effort to reduce reliance on expensive, imported fossil fuels. SEIA estimates that the State is currently getting just over 17% of its power from solar. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approved the 25-year power purchase agreement with Innergex in 2019 to deliver electricity to Hawaiian Electric from the project at $0.08/kWh, which is among the lowest cost energy sources on the Island. The project will also generate nearly 20% of the Island of Hawaii’s baseload electricity requirements, resulting in avoided fossil fuel consumption of over 500,000 barrels of oil over 25 years.

The project is expected to break ground in early 2022 with a commercial operation date planned for the end of 2022. The solar and battery storage facility will consist of 30MW AC of PV panels on single-axis trackers plus 120MWh of battery energy storage across approximately 300-acres, located near Parker Ranch’s industrial park, off of Mamalahoa Highway. Innergex is currently developing its community benefits package and conducting outreach to local non-profit organizations.
“This project aligns with our mission to support our beneficiaries and improve the quality of life in our community,” said Dutch Kuyper, President & CEO of Parker Ranch Inc.
Paniolo Power Company LLC, a subsidiary of Parker Ranch Inc., was established in 2014 to pursue community-based and reasonably-priced clean energy for the Waimea and Kohala communities as well as for Hawaii Island.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/23/air-force-lab-demonstrates-key-element-for-beaming-solar-power-from-space/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 23, 2021",Air Force lab demonstrates key element for beaming solar power from space,"The Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) and Northrop Grumman’s Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR) Project announced that it is one step closer to collecting solar power in space and beaming it to Earth using radio frequency (RF).
In the first end-to-end demonstration of key hardware for the Arachne flight experiment, a team used components for the “sandwich tile” to convert solar energy to RF. Arachne is a flight experiment conducted as part of an AFRL project that aims to develop technologies for a space-based solar transmission system that can power a Forward Operating Base on the ground.
To power a base, solar will be collected by Arachne using high-efficiency solar PV cells that is converted to RF energy using the sandwich tile. The power will be beamed to a receiving station at the base on the ground, and the energy is collected by a rectifying antenna or “rectenna” that will rectify and convert the RF into usable power. The sandwich tiles are key to the process and the design eliminates the need for heavy power banks.
The demonstration of the sandwich tile is one important step in the process. The tiles are comprised of photovoltaics to collect solar energy and RF tiles to emit RF energy, along with electronics that enable solar-to-RF conversion. The sandwich tile has been under development since 2018 as a part of a contract awarded to Northrop Grumman by AFRL.
“The successful conversion of sunlight into RF energy in a lightweight and scalable architecture is a significant step forward in delivering the technology building blocks to achieve the Arachne mission,” said Jay Patel, vice president, remote sensing programs business unit, Northrop Grumman. “We are helping to deliver a pioneering capability that can provide a strategic advantage to our forces around the globe.”
The ground demonstration used a solar simulator to illuminate the PV side of the tile and begin the Solar-to-RF conversion process.
Successful testing of the individual tile for the Arachne payload provides a building block for a square meter panel of tiles – a threshold that has not yet been met by any other solar-to-RF experiments. Arachne is anticipated to launch in 2025.
