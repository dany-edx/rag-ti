https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/10/solar-generated-7-of-u-s-electricity-in-april/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 10, 2023",Solar generated 7% of U.S. electricity in April,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) has issued its latest Electric Power Monthly update, which provides data through the end of April. The update reveals that solar photovoltaic generation rose by 16.6% from April of the previous year, accounting for just over 7% of total U.S. electricity generated that month, up from 6% in 2022.

Solar has produced 5% of all electricity so far this year. Comparing data for the whole year through April, solar energy production has seen a 14.2% uptick.
Solar growth rates in 2023 are projected to be less robust than in prior years, due to a decline in total capacity deployment in 2022. Total solar power deployed in 2022 was down 16% versus 2021, at 20.2 GW. With the dip in deployment in 2022, the total installed solar capacity in the U.S. rose to 141 GW by year’s end, as per data from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie Renewables & Power, an increase of just over 16.9%.
For 2023, a significant increase to approximately 30 GW deployed is anticipated, setting a new annual record. This increase would raise the 2022 year-end value to 171 GW, an increase of 21% on the total capacity deployed in the nation. The EIA reports that small-scale solar contributed to 2.2% of all generation in April, while utility-scale generation made up 4.8%. As expected, these percentages vary considerably by state.
Total U.S. electricity consumption for the month – at 278,350 GWh – decreased by 1.9%. Year-to-date, total U.S. electricity usage has declined 2.75% from last year.
In April, wind and solar power combined generated just under 21% of the month’s electricity, marking a modest increase of 0.3% compared to the same period last year. To date, these two renewables have accounted for 17.86% of all electricity generated this year. For wind energy, April’s share in generation mix shows a decrease to just under 14% of all electricity compared to last year’s 14.9%.

April’s total emission-free generation (comprising nuclear, wind, hydroelectric, solar PV, and solar thermal sources) reached 45.28%. Nuclear power led all emission-free sources, providing 18.39% of all electricity. Wind power contributed 13.95% and hydroelectric made up 5.83%. For the month, total emission-free generation has just barely increased from last year’s 45.27%.
In absolute terms, total emission-free generation for the year-to-date has ]fallen 0.44% from the previous year. So far, emission-free sources have generated 43.3% of all electricity, showing an increase of 2.5% compared to last year’s 42.2%. The reason total emission-free generation increased is because total electricity demand has decreased.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/10/a-new-public-utility-for-maine-would-speed-clean-energy-say-advocates/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MAINE",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 10, 2023","A new public utility for Maine would speed clean energy, say advocates","Maine voters will decide in a referendum on November 7 whether to create a new nonprofit, the Pine Tree Power Company, that could purchase the transmission and distribution assets of one or both of the state’s two investor-owned utilities, Central Maine Power (CMP) and Versant Power. Pine Tree Power would purchase the assets only if the Maine Public Utilities Commission finds either or both utilities “unfit to serve.”
Of the eight fitness measures described in the referendum, one relates to each utility’s ability to place the state’s climate goals “ahead of the desires of shareholders to earn a profit.” Maine has a renewable portfolio standard of 80% by 2030.
The referendum calls for creating Pine Tree Power as a customer-owned nonprofit corporation, with one of its eight purposes being assisting the state in “rapidly meeting or exceeding” the state’s climate action plan goals.
The nonprofit group Our Power, formed to promote the ballot initiative, says on its website that “the key to a carbon-free economy is clean electricity” and that “a nonprofit consumer-owned utility will get us there quicker.”
Both CMP And Versant, Our Power says, “often fail to cooperate with solar energy providers seeking interconnection agreements,” while “CMP has a well-documented history of fighting renewable energy initiatives and legislation.”
In its campaign for the ballot measure, Our Power also takes issue with CMP’s and Versant’s cost of electricity, reliability, and customer service. The referendum’s first three “fitness to serve” criteria reflect those three concerns.
If the referendum passes, the Maine Public Utilities Commission would evaluate each utility’s fitness to serve, beginning in 2025. If that evaluation were conducted today, both CMP and Versant would be found unfit to serve, said Lucy Hochschartner, deputy campaign manager for Our Power’s campaign to pass the referendum.
A public utility would save Maine residents money, the campaign says, citing an analysis by economist Richard Silkman, the CEO of Competitive Energy Services. Savings would result largely because a public power company could borrow money at a lower rate than a utility’s regulated rate of return on investments, the analysis says. Silkman said the Maine Turnpike Authority and similar public authorities nationwide issue billions of dollars of revenue bonds each year at low interest rates.
Maine resident and referendum campaign leader Bill Dunn said on a campaign video that “Maine has the worst electric reliability in the whole country and the lowest customer satisfaction. We can do a lot better. Pine Tree Power can help us do that.”
Steve Weems, executive director of the Solar Energy Association of Maine, said on the video that “The main driving force” for the investor-owned utilities “is maximizing shareholder value, and under Pine Tree Power, the main focus would be on creating the best possible service for the customers, because the customers will be in charge.”
The referendum reached the November 7 ballot after campaigners for Our Power secured nearly 70,000 valid signatures in support of the measure. Our Power counts 40 organizations as part of its coalition supporting the referendum. Six Maine residents initially launched the referendum effort.
CMP’s parent corporation Avangrid and Versant’s parent corporation Enmax have funded a campaign to defeat the referendum, and have outspent referendum advocates by a ratio of 17-1, according to reporting by the Portland Press Herald.
Transition process
If passed by voters, the referendum would require the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC), beginning January 1, 2025, to evaluate the transmission and distribution utilities CMP and Versant for their fitness to serve, and to require the sale of a utility found to be unfit within 24 months.
The fair market value of either utility’s transmission and distribution assets would either be negotiated or determined by a refereed process. Neither CMP nor Versant owns generating assets. To purchase the assets, Pine Tree Power would issue debt secured by its future revenues.
Prior to making a purchase price offer for any utility assets, the Pine Tree Power board would be required to adopt bylaws, retain expert professional staff and consultants, secure initial financing, conduct due diligence, and develop a transition plan and a business plan for the company.
Pine Tree Power would select at least one qualified nongovernmental entity to operate the utility, through a competitive solicitation. The “operations team” would be required to retain all workers of the purchased utilities.
The company and the operations team would submit to the PUC within 18 months a 5-year plan to meet initial goals relating to affordability, reliability, decarbonization and internet connectivity. Pine Tree Power would be required to include a program to make “rapid investments” in the distribution grid to upgrade reliability and improve capacity for interconnection of new renewable generation and storage.

For countries limited in land availability, like many island nations in Southeast Asia, FPV may represent a path forward to an emissions-free economy. 
The U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission for Asia to evaluate the technical potential for FPV for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has set a target of 35% renewable energy installed capacity by 2025. 
The NREL report estimated technical potential for 10 ASEAN countries and is coupled with a data set available through a solar data explorer tool. 
“FPV arrays are situated on water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs, or water treatment ponds, where they can be installed alone or in combination with hydropower dams,” said NREL.  
NREL said FPV is particularly attractive in locations where hydropower infrastructure is planned or already in place and increased frequency or severity of drought may raise pose reliability concerns for hydropower production. Southeast Asia is particularly exposed to this hydropower underproduction risk as it has a strong network of established facilities.
“Additionally, much of the region is covered by rainforest ecosystems,” said Evan Rosenlieb, a geospatial data scientist at NREL. “Siting PV on water can be a way to increase renewable energy generation without deforestation.” 
Southeast Asia is also a hotbed for the growing practice of aquaculture, or raising fish, crustaceans, and aquatic plants in a controlled water body. These sites are targeted as another potential match for floating PV. 
“This emerging combination of aquaculture and photovoltaics, commonly referred to as AquaPV, can allow countries to co-locate energy and food production on existing natural or artificially created water bodies while minimizing the overall environmental impact of both sectors,” said Prateek Joshi, NREL energy engineer.
Joshi and the NREL team said aquaculture and solar may help boost food security in the region, offering dedicated, resilient energy production to critical food sources.
The data accompanying the report are publicly available as a resource for developers interested in learning more about the technical and economic potential of FPV in the region.
“This data will lead to more discussions and can inform decisions on the potential role of FPV in the region. It wouldn’t have been possible without all the existing work of previous FPV studies and previous RE Data Explorer tool development,” Sika Gadzanku, the NREL energy technology and policy researcher.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/10/utility-ordered-to-repay-customers-for-illegal-community-solar-metering/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 10, 2023",Utility ordered to repay customers for illegal community solar metering,"Pepco, a utility serving ratepayers in Washington D.C. and surrounding areas, was ordered by the D.C. Public Service Commission to repay its customers roughly $800,000 for violating state law on the administration of community solar programs.
Under a community solar program, customers opt-in to enroll in a portion of a solar facility’s on-site generation, receiving a credit on their monthly utility bills for the project’s contribution to the grid.
Pepco was found to be under-counting community solar generation, leading to lower-than-expected savings and higher electricity bills for their customers. The utility was also found to be unreasonably slow in its payment to facility owners for solar generation that exceeded customer account subscription capacity.
What’s more, about 5,000 of the 6,200 residents participating in the community solar program are below 80% of the area’s median income. These customers were promised to have their electricity bills cut in half for 15 years, and instead have been stuck with underpaid and late credits.
Pepco was found to undercount generation in the Solar For All community program by over 5 GWh between January 2020 and September 2021.
Liz Veazey of nonprofit consumer protection group Solar United Neighbors warned that community engagement and trust is a critical component in launching successful community solar programs, and the utility’s negligent billing practices may damage the trust solar providers are trying to earn with their customers.
“Thousands of people in these programs were not seeing the bill savings every month that they should have been seeing,” said Veazey. “If people don’t think that these programs work and they’re skeptical of them and they’re not actually seeing the credits on their bills, that’s a big problem.”
The Office of the People’s Counsel and the D.C. Attorney General, representing the aggrieved ratepayers, jointly filed a complaint with the commission in March.
Pepco argued that it had the right to install its own meters at community solar facilities and base crediting off those internal meters. The Commission found that the practice would violate state law. Pepco has been found in violation of solar generation undercounting in multiple cases in the past, according to the complaint.
The utility admitted that it had some problems with billing and will begin to remove some of its meters. Pepco spent about $800,000 on the installation of the meters, which in turn were passed on to their customers in the form of bill increases. Now, the utility will be required to pay that sum back to its customers, reimbursing its customer base for the illegal meters it installed at over 300 community solar installations.
“We gave Pepco the benefit of the doubt that its flawed reading of the law and our regulations was not a deliberate attempt to undermine them,” said the Commission.
However, the Commission ordered repayment so that Pepco does not dump “the consequences of the company’s error onto the backs of ratepayers.”
The Commission noted that it may revamp its community solar laws to make sure similar utility disruptions do not occur again. Washington D.C. has a goal of 100% clean electricity and 100,000 Solar For All community solar subscriptions by 2032.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/10/how-california-employers-can-reimburse-ev-drivers-for-charging-at-home/,"BUSINESS,EV,GUEST POST,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"JULY 10, 2023",How California employers can reimburse EV drivers for charging at home,"If you are not reimbursing fleet drivers in electric vehicles for charging at home you are putting your company in legal jeopardy.
Having employees bring electric fleet vehicles home at night to charge can save a company thousands of dollars a year in electricity costs and employee time, but failing to adequately reimburse those employees for their electricity use is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen ― potentially costing a company millions. In California, such lawsuits have become increasingly common rather than exceptional due to the stringent regulations outlined in Section 2802 of the California Labor Code. If you have yet to implement a fair, precise, and legally compliant reimbursement program for vehicle charging, your organization may already be exposed to significant risks.
California labor code 
The IRS provides guidance on which expenses are considered reimbursable business expenses for federal tax purposes. In addition, many states have their own regulations that are equally important for companies to comply with. One of the most notable when it comes to vehicle-related reimbursements is CA Labor Code Section 2802 (CA 2808).
California Labor Code section 2802 was first enacted in 1937 and requires employers to “indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties.” Subdivision (c) of section 2802 defines “necessary expenditures or losses” as including “all reasonable costs.” In other words, employers are legally obligated to reimburse employees for all the reasonable expenses they incur related to work.
In 2005, in the case of Gattuso v. Harte Hanks Shoppers, Inc., the Supreme Court of California clarified that CA 2802 covered driving reimbursement expenses, noting that “if an employer requires an employee to travel on company business, the employer must reimburse the employee for the cost of that travel under Section 2802.” For internal combustion engine vehicles, those costs include gas. For electric vehicles, that includes the cost to charge.
A related provision, section 2804, expressly prohibits employees from being able to waive their section 2802 rights, meaning even if they agreed in a contract (or practice) to not be reimbursed by their employer they are still entitled to fair compensation under the law and can be part of a class action down the line. Legally, the employer’s obligation to cover these expenses remains.
Calculate and compensate
In the Harte Hanks Shoppers, Inc. case, where the company ultimately had to pay $7 million to the wronged employees, the company was not disputing that they owed the employee reimbursement money. Instead, they were arguing that those costs were already covered in the form of higher compensation. The court disagreed.
The landmark decision established that reimbursement expenses must be separated from other forms of compensation. The decision went on to outline all acceptable practices available for companies for calculating and reimbursing employees for 2802-related vehicle expenses, including:
A lump sum payment
Mileage reimbursement using the published IRS reimbursement rate
Mileage reimbursement using an agreed-upon rate between employer and employee (as long as that rate covers the true costs)
Actual expenses (fuel, maintenance, repairs, insurance, registration, and depreciation) paid separately
Each of these methods comes with benefits and challenges, which the employer should consider carefully before making a decision.
Lump sum payments 
In a lump sum payment, or flat allowance, model, every employee is reimbursed the same amount. The upside for the company is that it is easy to administer. The drawbacks are significant. First, the chance that the reimbursement amount will reflect the real cost of charging at home is virtually zero, which means to be in compliance with Harte-Hanks, a company must overcompensate employees to protect themselves from litigation. As utility rates can vary wildly even within a relatively small geographic territory, ensuring every employee is being fairly compensated can be costly. The second issue with this method is that the payment is considered taxable income for the employee, a point the Harte-Hanks explicitly calls out as a warning to employers and employees alike. Finally, this method does not encourage employees to charge at home, where electricity is usually 2 to 3 times less expensive, which can compound fleet reimbursement costs for the company.
Mileage reimbursement 
The IRS sets a mileage reimbursement rate employers can use to cover the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business purposes for employee reimbursement. In 2023, this rate is 65.5 cents per mile. The IRS explicitly notes that this rate applies to electric and hybrid-electric automobiles. This IRS-compliant rate works for individuals driving their own electric cars for work, but not for those driving company-owned assets and charging them at home. It is worth noting that the published IRS rate is generally more than what the fair calculated rate would be for fleet drivers using their own vehicles for work by several thousands of dollars, which is why the fixed and variable rate method (FAVR) program became popular. Electric vehicles are even less costly to run than gas cars, so this method will be a significant overpayment to the employee. In addition, for fleet drivers using a company car and charging at home, there is no set IRS rate for pure kWh reimbursement.
Actual expenses 
The Harte Hanks case notes that  the “actual expense method is the most accurate, but it is also the most burdensome for both the employer and the employee.” The court was correct in that until recently, figuring out the actual cost of the electricity used for charging at home was extremely difficult. Several solutions have emerged in the last few years, including installing dedicated chargers at employees’ homes (expensive), or manually separating out charging events from an employee’s utility bill (labor intensive) and doing the calculations manually. The difficulty of administering a program that uses either solution at scale is compounded by the wild variation in employee vehicle types, locations, and living arrangements. Today, ReimburseEV™ makes reimbursement simple by providing a solution that can analyze both charging and rate data to create an itemized receipt employees can submit for home charging reimbursement. The benefits of this system are that it is simple, accurate, IRS-compliant, and the reimbursements are not taxed as employee income.
CA 2802 lawsuits can be quite costly. For example, Radioshack had to pay $4.5 million to employees for only reimbursing employees who followed specific expense reporting procedures (Stuart v. Radioshack Corporation). Crossmark, Inc., settled for $1 million with employees who claimed they were not fairly reimbursed for travel and business-related expenses. Companies with employees in California and across the country need to take notice, as many states have similar provisions that open them up to potential risk of class action liability.
While there has been no class action yet related to failure to reimburse for charging at home, the risk for companies not reimbursing for this business expense correctly is clear and present. In the 2014 case of Cochran v. Schwan’s Home Service, Inc., the court held that under CA 2802, employers must reimburse employees for work-related phone calls made on personal cell phones. They used the phrase “fair portion” as the standard, but also noted that liability for failure to reimburse for cell phone use can be “determined without an inquiry into the specifics of each class members’ cell phone plan.” They found that failure to have an adequate policy or practice of reimbursing employees is enough for the court to certify a class. Replace “personal cell phone” with “personal electric vehicle charger,” and a judge might determine the same principle applies.
Reduce risk
Our country is moving to electric vehicles. Companies that move their fleets early or encourage employees to make the switch have so much to gain. But this new EV landscape also brings new risks to employers. Failure to reimburse employees properly for charging at home can have serious consequences. Employers must have a policy or practice in place to reduce their risk. Take the practical measure to reduce risk by offering employees an IRS-compliant program that accurately reimburses employees for charging their vehicles at home.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/10/ballasted-racking-from-powerfield-energy-sees-its-first-utility-scale-installation/,"INSTALLATIONS,PRODUCTS,RACKING,UTILITY SCALE PV,PENNSYLVANIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 10, 2023",Ballasted racking from PowerField Energy scales up to utility-scale installation,"An idea that began with PowerField Energy co-founders David Flory and Paul Burdick tinkering in a garage is now a growing company scaling up in production, funding and project pipeline. Both Flory and Burdick came from solar backgrounds and aimed to find a simple, low-cost racking solution. That tinkering led to development of the PowerRack, which is an injection-molded high-density polyethylene container that can be filled on site and used to mount solar panels of almost any size, no tools required.
pv magazine USA spoke with Drew Bond, co-founder and chief executive officer, Patrick Fleming, chief operations officer, and Corbin Abshier, director of business development, on the history of PowerRack. One of the first PowerRack installations was at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colo., where they set up a two-year test model. To date, the company has installed PowerRacks supporting more than 4 MW of solar in residential and commercial as well as portable installations, like the one at this year’s Coachella music festival.
In seven years, the Virginia-based company has scaled production several times, has raised $1.3 million in funding and now is raising a Series A for $5 million to scale sales, manufacturing, and product development for global distribution.
In 2022 the company landed its first utility-scale contract for an installation in Brodheadsville, Pennsylvania where the developer, Endless Energy, had run into challenges around site conditions and environmental concerns and the developers couldn’t get the project across the finish line. The developer had already sunk a lot of money into the project, so they needed a solution that would get the project up and running as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Once the contract was signed, it was delayed for a year due to permitting issues, but once approved, the PowerRacks were installed, and modules mounted in four weeks. The project is at a ShopRite store, where 8,800 PowerRacks hold 4,400 Hanwha Qcells 480 W solar modules in the 2.1 MW system, powering more than 85% of the store’s energy needs.
According to Fleming, the site had underground water table issues and there was exploratory well equipment on the site that had to be avoided, so penetration with a traditional racking system was not going to work. The developer had already sunk a lot of money into the project, so they needed an inexpensive solution. The PowerRacks met their needs, and while the project was ten times larger than anything PowerField had done previously, they said they only needed to have one field employee on site to get the job done.

The racking is brought on site as empty 15-pound plastic containers, which are filled with any dry loose aggregate material such as gravel or crushed rock. The solar modules slide easily onto the racking and are held in place with clips. Clips are attached by hand, with no tools needed. When it’s time to decommission the solar installation, the modules are removed, the racking is emptied, and they can be removed from the site and recycled.
PowerRacks were also used to set up a temporary solar installation to power lighting the Coachella music festival held in April in Indio, California. Overdrive Energy Solutions chose the PowerRack after seeing them at a trade show and thinking their portability would meet their needs. Neel Vasavada, founder and president of Overdrive said a crew of four installed 15 kW of solar divided across ten locations.
“And we had never used the product before. We were down to 10 min. a location – less time than it takes to fuel a gasoline generator,” he said.
Once the festival was over and it was time to disassemble the temporary solar installation, Vasavada explained that “disassembly” doesn’t apply in the same manner as other products here.
“We used PowerRack specifically because there isn’t any disassembly of the racks themselves, except for picking up the plastic locking pieces after the panels are lifted off,” he said.
With the PowerRacks being portable and sitting above the ground, installers have a few options when it comes to handling the wiring. Fleming noted that there is a channel in the rack where the cabling rests along the sidewalls of the rack and up under the modules, just as it would with any system. The wiring can be run above ground with cable hangers or messenger cables, or the site can be trenched if that works better for the installation.
To date, PowerField has sold their racks in 38 states, with customers ranging from electric utilities to do-it-yourself homeowners. The company recently expanded its manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand and PowerField is developing future versions of the PowerRack to accommodate ever-larger modules, different pitch angles and other unique customer requirements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/10/u-s-clean-hydrogen-roadmap-too-ambitious-says-analysts/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JULY 10, 2023","U.S. clean hydrogen roadmap needs work, say analysts","Since releasing the U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap on June 6, Wood Mackenzie principal analyst Hector Arreola suggest that the Biden-Harris administration should address cost and scaling roadblocks if they hope to meet the framework’s ambitious goals.
The roadmap aims to accelerate the deployment of clean hydrogen by laying the foundation for a strong and productive partnership between the public and private sectors, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “It will guide government and industry to realize the full potential of this incredibly versatile energy resource.”
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) estimates that almost 100 million tons of fossil-fueled hydrogen are used in the refining, fertilizer and chemical industries each year. Clean-hydrogen, made from electrolyzing water with solar or wind energy, can help lessen emissions from industrial sectors like heavy-duty transportation and chemical production. It also reduces air pollution by supporting the expansion of renewable energy to power cars and trucks.
The United States hopes to scale domestic clean hydrogen production to 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) annually by 2030, 20 MMT annually by 2040, and 50 MMT annually by 2050, significantly minimizing dependence on fossil-fueled hydrogen. However, Arreola asserts that a slower decline in capital expenditures for electrolytic hydrogen related to renewable power costs and electrolysis load factor scaling might make meeting such production targets difficult.

“The market has yet to move at the necessary pace to fully capitalize on the production potential outlined in the Strategy,” Arreola said.
Fossil-fueled hydrogen costs between $1/kg and $2/kg, almost half the current clean hydrogen production costs: $3/kg to $6/kg. While the Biden-Harris Administration has provided significant investments to advance clean hydrogen technologies, George Touloupas, senior director at CEA suggests the global industry as a whole will need continued financing through innovation and subsidies to meetgoal of scaling enough to compete with and replace fossil-fueled hydrogen.
Increasing the number of cost-effective electrolyzers used to produce green hydrogen is also essential. And their dependence on solar and wind energy is an excellent opportunity for key stakeholders to collaborate on planning and building infrastructure to sustain electric cars, homes and buildings.
Fusion Fuel, a Portuguese modular solar-to-hydrogen facility provider, and Electus Energy, a hydrogen fleet-fueling and power infrastructure developer, announced they would be constructing a 75 MW green hydrogen facility in Bakersfield, California. The project would function as a solar-to-hydrogen site, producing up to 9,300 tons of hydrogen fuel per year to power heavy-duty trucks.
And with 191 days of sunshine each year and only 138 miles from the ocean, Bakersfield presents a competitive advantage with regard to locations suitable for green hydrogen and solar energy production.
But while proximity is one way to ensure renewable energy is readily available at a lower cost, land-locked regions with less sunshine must receive subsidies and policy support until technology and scaling costs decline, Touloupas said. So the DOE should continue to work with key stakeholders as they advance funding to strategize and scale clean hydrogen domestically.
