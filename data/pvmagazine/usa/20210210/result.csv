John Carney, D-Del., signed into law S.B.33, which raises Delaware’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for regulated utilities to 40% by 2035.
Sponsored by Sen. Stephanie Hansen, and Rep. Ed Osienski, both Democrats, the bill passed the legislature in late January. Carney signed the bill into law February 10 during a virtual event attended by the sponsors and other state officials.
The new law raises Delaware’s previous RPS goal of 25% renewable energy by 2025. The RPS solar carve-out also will nearly triple from 3.5% by 2025 to 10% by 2035.
“Delaware is the country’s lowest-lying state, and climate change is already having a very real impact,” said Carney in a statement. “This legislation will help accelerate Delaware’s transition to renewable sources of energy, which is good for our economy and our environment.”
When the bill passed in January, Sierra Club welcomed the state’s goal to boost its RPS. However, the environmental group argued the new 40% target was too low and left Delaware “behind virtually every state in the region,” most of which have targets 50% or higher.
In addition to raising the RPS, the bill sponsors said S.B.33 will settle a dispute over cost caps for renewable energy credits by establishing a maximum price and alternative compliance payments, should the cost of these credits rise unexpectedly.

ODP eliminates the plan check phase in permitting and issues a permit immediately, as long as the proposed project meets minimum requirements. Solar systems rated less than 10 kW with optional energy storage systems less than 47 kWh are eligible for this type of permit.
Once the system has been installed and is undergoing project inspection, City Building and Safety staff will verify that the project has met permit terms.
The city said that building a vast network of distributed energy resources is an important step toward ensuring energy resilience and reliability, citing California’s recent history of destructive natural disasters and rolling power shutoffs as challenges that need to be addressed.
This move to streamline distributed generation permitting by the City of Santa Barbara mirrors Hawaiian Electric Co.’s new Quick Connect program. Customers on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii islands installing new systems can now have the standard approval process be handled after the system is built and turned on.
The key differences are that Hawaiian Electric’s program does not include residential storage and caps out system size at 25 kW in capacity, with Santa Barbara’s cap being a much lower 10 kW. Hawaiian Electric’s program is also only set to run for a year, with the possibility of expansion later, while Santa Barbara’s appears to be indefinite.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/10/top-10-u-s-corporate-renewable-energy-buyers-of-2020/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Top 10 U.S. corporate renewable energy buyers of 2020,"Amazon was the No. 1 U.S. corporate buyer of renewable energy in 2020, procuring more than 3.16 GW. Utility-scale solar power also was the most sought-after renewable resource among the country’s major corporations.
That’s according to the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), a member-based organization that represents and advocates on behalf of many of the nation’s largest corporate energy purchasers.
In its second-annual Deal Tracker Top 10 report, REBA found that U.S. corporations once again showcased their resolve and commitment to renewable energy with a record-breaking 10.6 GW of contracted capacity.
REBA CEO Miranda Ballentine said, “It is remarkable that the business community announced nearly 100 new deals while managing the impacts of a global pandemic.”
REBA’s group members accounted for 97% of the procurements tracked in 2020. Of the 98 deals reflected in the full report, 72% were for utility-scale solar projects.
Kara Hurst, vice president of sustainability at Amazon, said the company is making “big investments in wind and solar energy because it can help to quickly decarbonize our business operations.”
Amazon is on a path to run on 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original target of 2030. Building on Amazon’s procurements last year, the company has continued making solar deals in 2021.
“We believe all companies have a role to play in protecting the planet,” said Hurst. “To inspire collaboration, we co-founded The Climate Pledge–with signatories committing to reaching net-zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.”
REBA said the companies in its report–half of which represent first-time energy buyers accounting for 25% of total announced volume–navigated market barriers through innovative contracting structures and collaboration with key stakeholders, including utilities, energy transaction parties, local communities, and industry leaders.
Although the information technology (IT) sector continued to represent the highest procurement by volume, the industrials and materials market was the top sector for new buyers, which REBA said indicates the importance of decarbonization of industrial supply chains.
According to REBA, 2020 was also the first year that multiple U.S. corporate energy buyers announced procurements including battery storage, aligning with broader industry trends as storage technology becomes more accessible.
Looking ahead, REBA said significant potential remains to grow the U.S. renewables market and economy through key federal policy priorities.
In January, the group helped lead more than 30 corporations–including Amazon, McDonalds, Pepsi Co., Walmart, and Facebook–to call on the Biden administration to help pave the way for a zero-carbon U.S. power sector.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/10/national-grid-aims-to-expand-community-solar-access-for-low-income-customers/,"COMMUNITY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",National Grid aims to expand community solar access for low-income customers,"National Grid has filed a proposal to expand access to solar energy and provide annual bill discounts to up to 20,000 low-income customers in Massachusetts through Community Shared Solar projects.
Part of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program, Community Shared Solar enables customers to lower their bills through local projects without having to install solar panels on their property.
Marcy Reed, president of National Grid in Massachusetts, said all customers should be able to share the benefits of distributed solar “no matter their income level.”
The utility’s proposed Solar Access Initiative, which is under review by the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), aims to expand access by eliminating the need for customer credit checks through a new Solar Simplified Billing program.
According to National Grid, owners of many community solar projects screen applicants by using credit scores to reduce the risk of late payments. This can limit the pool of customers who qualify to participate. National Grid said Solar Simplified Billing would eliminate the need for credit checks by guaranteeing on-time payments to project owners.
The utility also said it would launch a Solar Enrollment Program, designed to offer low-income customers a month-to-month subscription, no sign-up or cancellation fees, and an electricity bill discount of around $240 per year.
If approved by the DPU, the initiative would go into effect in early 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/10/enphase-energy-closes-2020-with-a-strong-q4/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Enphase Energy closes 2020 with a strong Q4,"Enphase Energy reported a 67% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in Q4 2020, driven by what it said was strong demand for microinverter systems across all regions.
It also reported success of the Enphase Encharge storage system, shipments of which increased roughly 35% in Q4, compared to the Q3.
In total, Enphase reported revenues of $264.8 million in Q4 and $774.4 million for all of 2020. The performance improved on  what was a difficult Q2 for the company. The company reported Q2 revenue of $125.5 million, and a GAAP gross margin of 38.5%.
The company said that $217.5 of its Q4 revenue came from the United States, up from  $139.9 million during Q3.
Ephase also reported what it said was record microinverter system sell-through from distributors to installers during  the fourth quarter, resulting in lower than usual channel inventory at the end of the quarter. The sell-through rate led to Enphase shipping almost 2.3 million microinverters in Q4, representing around 762 MWdc.
(Read “Is Enphase poised to challenge SolarEdge’s inverter lead?“)
Also recognized on the earnings call was Enphase’s recent acquisition of Sofdesk Inc., a provider of design software for residential solar installers and roofing companies. The company also mentioned its recent agreement to acquire the Solar Design Services business of DIN Engineering Services.
The company said these acquisitions are expected to enhance the company’s digital platform capabilities, simplify the sales process, and improve the buying experience for homeowners.
Fueled by a second straight quarter of higher engineering and sales headcount, non-GAAP operating expenses rose to $34.2 million in Q4. That was up from $29.6 million reported in the prior quarter. Overall, Enphase hired 105 new employees in the last three months of 2020. Enphase’s non-GAAP figures do not include the $16.5 million in tariff refunds on U.S. microinverter imports from China.
Enphase predicts that revenue will range between $280 million to $300 million. GAAP operating expenses are expected to range between $64.0 million to $67.0 million, including $22 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortization. The figures include the Sofdesk acquisition, but not DIN’s Solar Design Services business.
The company also forecast a production ramp for its Encharge storage system during the first quarter. There was, however, no word on if the company expects to expand its Enphase Energized AC modules in markets beyond France and the Netherlands.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/10/sunrise-brief-novel-approach-boosts-organic-solar-cell-efficiency/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Sunrise brief: Novel approach boosts organic solar cell efficiency,"Researchers said they notched an 18.07% power conversion efficiency from a plastic solar cell, also known as an organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell.
The team achieved what they said was a record conversion efficiency with a design strategy that improves the cell’s open-circuit voltage, short-circuit voltage, and fill factor.
Improving all three metrics—which represent how efficiently a solar cell converts sunlight into electricity—is difficult to do, they said. This is because of constraints related to using two components to create the binary donor-acceptor blend in an OPV cell’s light-absorbing layer. Changing a single component to improve one metric can negatively affect another, leading to performance trade-offs.
Researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that using four components in an OPV device’s active layer could better balance the microstructure and electronic function of the cell’s absorber layer. The strategy was described in a Nature Communications article.
OPV materials are semiconductors made up of common organic elements like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, fluorine, oxygen, and sulfur. They are man-made molecules and polymers that can be synthesized in a chemistry lab. Their raw materials are typically cheap and abundant; the manufacturing processes for creating them have been used in industries that make household items like plastic wrap and Tupperware.
The research team said that OPV blends are handled in liquid form and sprayed or coated onto rigid or flexible surfaces. The number of potential applications is broad, yet OPV’s have only been intensively researched since the early 2000s, after a relatively new molecule called a fullerene (its discovery led to a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996) was incorporated as the acceptor component in OPV cells. A second Nobel Prize in 2000 recognized the discovery and development of conductive polymers.
Battery maker Enevate said it secured $81 million in Series E funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Co. The funding is intended to provide the company with new resources aimed at accelerating global adoption of the company’s silicon anode-based lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Existing investors Mission Ventures and Infinite Potential Technologies also participated in the round.
With this latest funding round, Enevate has raised $191 million to date.
The company said its technology is designed to provide EV owners with a five-minute charge. It holds a portfolio of 350 patents related to silicon Li-ion cell technology, including anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator, formation, cell design and cell architecture.
The Heritage Group and Heritage Environmental Services launched a new division, Heritage Battery Recycling (HBR) to focus on demand for lithium-ion battery recycling.
In collaboration with Romeo Power, HBR said it will develop a battery reuse and recycling facility in the southwestern United States. The collaboration opens a market opportunity that includes commercial truck manufacturers, commercial fleet managers, and other business owners. In late January, Romeo and Republic Services agreed to develop Romeo’s battery technology for use in Republic’s future fleet of electric garbage trucks.
Heritage also partnered with Heritage-Crystal Clean, a fleet services provider, that gives HBR access to customer locations, power units, and facility locations across North America.
Highview Power closed its Growth Capital round of funding with more than $70 million, bringing its total amount of funding and grants to more than $145 million. The round includes a previously announced $46 million investment from Sumitomo Heavy Industries and additional investments from Janus Continental Group and TSK, along with a $5.5 million contribution from the original and founding investors.
This round of funding enables Highview Power to continue its global expansion and moves additional long-duration energy storage projects into the commercialization phase. Highview Power said it has a late-stage pipeline of more than 4 GWh of projects in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. It also has 700 MWh of projects currently under development.
Highview Power’s energy storage facilities are based on its cryogenic energy storage technology, which the company said can offer multiple gigawatt-hours of storage. The company said that when paired with renewables, its facilities are equivalent in performance to thermal and nuclear baseload power.
