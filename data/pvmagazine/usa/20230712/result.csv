Further pv magazine USA industry checks show that modules made with Astronergy (Chint) polysilicon have been detained and are under review under UFLPA.
The UFLPA places the burden of proof on importers to show that the supply chain has no traces to forced labor practices. China has consistently denied allegations of forced labor of the Uyghur population in Western China, a Muslim minority group.
Prior to the exclusion of these goods, any imports sourced from the Xinjiang province of China, responsible for a little less than 50% of global production, would be barred from entry. However, it was unclear whether other Chinese suppliers outside the region would face similar scrutiny and market bans.
(Read: “A moral trilemma for U.S. solar procurement“)
The ban of Tongwei polysilicon-supplied Longi panels may mark a “de facto ban on Chinese polysilicon,” warned a pv magazine USA industry contact. Tongwei was the world’s largest polysilicon provider in 2022, producing over 345,000 MT, and has no presence in the Xinjiang province.
This is a dramatic negative development for the supply of solar panels in the United States as China produces “a share of 89% in the global output of solar-grade polysilicon in 2022, and expansion continues unabated,” according to Bernreuter Research.
Longi is expected to appeal the import exclusion, but the process for appeal may take several months, drying up module supply in the meantime.
To be in compliance with UFLPA, show that a product has no inputs from Xinjiang. To show this, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping.
While the U.S. moves to onshore its solar supply chain, doubts persist that the industry can move fast enough to manufacture a steady supply of components to build towards its clean energy goals. Wood Mackenzie expects the U.S. solar market to triple in size over the next five years, bringing total installed solar capacity to 378 GW by 2028.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) shared that while module assembly has a strong presence today in the U.S., ingot, wafer, and cell production plans have not kept pace, and no plans for greenfield polysilicon plants have materialized.
CEA forecasts the U.S. to reach 17 GW of polysilicon production, 3 GW ingots, 3 GW wafers, 18 GW cell manufacturing, and 40 GW module manufacturing capacities by 2027, suggesting that the U.S. will continue to rely on energy imports for years to come. However, the recent UFLPA enforcement developments may pose a serious challenge to finding suppliers.

A midwestern utility retiring the 1.95 GW R.M. Schahfer coal generation facility in Indiana is contributing to that growing trend.
Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) activated a 465 MW solar portfolio consisting of NIPSCO’s first two utility solar projects, Dunns Bridge I Solar in Jasper County, Ind., and Indiana Crossroads Solar in White County, Ind.:
Dunns Bridge I and Indiana Crossroads are partly funded through tax equity investments from a tax equity investor, while the projects are expected to incur tax benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act as well.
“The addition of our first solar parks to our electric generating portfolio represent meaningful investments in the state of Indiana and a direct benefit to our customers,” said Mike Hooper, president of NIPSCO. “These completed projects are a crucial step in advancing our long-term energy transition plan, providing sustainable, reliable and cost-effective energy now and into the future.”
NIPSCO’s energy transition to a decarbonized generation fleet includes plans to retire all its remaining coal-fired units. The company plans to be coal-free by 2028, driving a reduction in carbon emissions by more than 90% by 2030, compared to a 2005 baseline.
The utility’s clean energy portfolio consists of 2.4 GW of wind, solar and storage assets in operation or under construction and includes:
As previously announced, NIPSCO is working with developers on other wind, solar and battery storage projects in various stages of development. For those projects not already approved, NIPSCO has requested to add those projects to its supply portfolio in filings with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC). Further details on NIPSCO’s renewable energy portfolio can be accessed here.

A National Renewable Energy Laboratory study found that the cost-optimal strategy to reach a 100% renewables grid would involve energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings of about 60%, along with oversized renewable generation and long-term energy storage.
Adoption of the most recent building energy efficiency codes would yield $138 billion in customer savings over a 30-year period, according to a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory study cited by DOE, and also avoid emissions of 900 million metric tons of CO2.
“To realize these immense cost-saving and public health benefits, it is critical that states and local governments update their building codes based on the latest technologies and construction practices and support their successful application,” DOE said in a statement.
“However,” DOE added, “two out of every three communities in the U.S. have not adopted the latest building codes, in part due to a lack of available resources to support their implementation.” DOE’s grant awards are designed to support implementation.
Improving energy efficiency in homes and businesses can also make communities more resilient to extreme weather events, DOE said.
DOE plans to award further grants with the remaining $135 million of the $225 million authorized for the program over five years, under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. DOE will release remaining funding through the same competitive selection process used for the newly announced grants, said a spokesperson.
America’s 130 million residential and commercial buildings are responsible for 35% of the nation’s total carbon emissions, DOE said.
Grants were awarded to states, cities, tribes and nonprofits for activities that will support energy code updates and implementation, including workforce development, community engagement, research and data collection, energy, equity and environmental justice, and increased support for compliance and enforcement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/12/florida-municipal-solar-project-expands-to-600-mw/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,FLORIDA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 12, 2023",Florida municipal solar project expands to 600 MW,"The largest municipal electric utility owned solar asset just got much larger, as Origis Energy announced it will expand a 150 MW project to 600 MW. Aptly named the Florida Municipal Solar Project, the facility will become large enough to serve the equivalent of about 120,000 Florida homes.
In conjunction with the Florida Municipal Power Agency (FMPA) and 20 municipal electric utilities, developer Origis Energy will deliver the projects.
Two projects, Taylor Creek Solar in Orange County and Harmony Solar in Osceloa County, are operational and combine for 150 MW. The municipalities’ solar exposure will be quadrupled over the course of two subsequent project phases.
Phase two will entail two more solar facilities, Rice Creek Solar in Putnam County and Whistling Duck Solar in Levy County. The former will be completed this year and the latter is slated for commercial operations in 2024. Together the two will double the project capacity, adding another 150 MW.
Phase three will entail another doubling of total capacity, adding another 300 MW and bringing the total to 600 MW, making it among of the largest groupings of solar projects in the United States and the largest municipal project. This phase will add four additional sites across Columbia, Levy, and Bradford counties, reaching activation throughout 2025 and 2026.
Upon completion of the projects, over 1.8 million solar panels across eight facilities will be providing low-cost, clean electricity to municipal customers across Florida.
“By partnering with our municipal electric utilities members and Origis Energy, we are able to take advantage of a great opportunity to increase the volume of our low-cost, reliable solar generation at a time when solar costs have been escalating,” said Jacob Williams, general manager and chief executive officer of FMPA. “Expanding the Florida Municipal Solar Project will also enable us to serve several new communities that haven’t had access to solar before.”
A total of 20 Florida municipal electric utilities will purchase power from the project: Beaches Energy Services (Jacksonville Beach), Bushnell, Clewiston, Fort Meade, Fort Pierce Utilities Authority, Green Cove Springs, Havana, Homestead, JEA (Jacksonville), Keys Energy Services (Key West), Kissimmee Utility Authority, Lake Worth Beach, Leesburg, Mount Dora, New Smyrna Beach, Newberry, Ocala, Orlando Utilities Commission, Starke, and Winter Park.
These cities are member-owners of FMPA along with 13 other municipal utilities. The 33 members of FMPA serve more than 4.2 million Floridians and employ more than 4,700 people.
Headquartered in Miami, Origis Energy is a leading U.S. player in renewables development, financing, engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and operations, maintenance and asset management. The company has developed 170 projects worldwide totaling more than 5 GW to date of developed solar, energy storage and clean hydrogen capacity.
Origis has been active in procuring solar modules and financing to support its large book of projects, including multi-year supply deals with Boviet Solar, Maxeon, and First Solar.

To assist with that transition, it partnered with the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC), a Vermont-based non-profit organization that helps companies and organizations become more energy efficient and less dependent on fossil fuels. As an island, Martha’s Vineyard (MV) gets its fossil fuels from the mainland, so by going electric, with buses charged by solar, the VTA is creating a more sustainable transportation system for the island.
The VTA purchased its first electric buses in 2018 to serve the nearly 1.3 million residents and tourists that use the MV transit system each year. A solar canopy at the charging station became operational in 2021, and the fleet has more than doubled. The next step to ensure reliability was to turn the charging station into a microgrid that could island when the grid goes down, and battery storage was added.

To manage the microgrid, the VTA turned to PXiSE Energy Solutions (pronounced ‘Pice’) for a microgrid controller to automate the integration of multiple distributed energy generation resources, including a 466kW solar array, a battery storage system and 16 bus charging stations. The microgrid controllers enable the charging centers to stay up and running for several hours in the event of a power outage, and they also they provide real-time forecasting that provides additional functions such as real-time asset control and tight ramp-rate control. The microgrid controllers ensure connectivity to virtually any device on the grid, according to PXiSE, and they aggregate power from the solar and battery systems, creating a single virtual power plant that can operate off grid.
PXiSE Energy Solutions recently announced that Rove Charging, a California-based company that designs and builds EV charging centers, will use its microgrid controller with battery storage and onsite solar. Rove’s EV charging centers are designed to host more than 40 direct current fast chargers (DCFC), an onsite market, car wash, 24/7 lounge, dog walk and restroom facilities. For Rove’s centers, the PXiSE software solution will manage the point of interconnection with the utility to a net-zero export, while also managing the facility’s generation capability
“This advanced controller will allow us to better leverage renewable energy from the California grid and Rove’s onsite solar to provide more affordable, sustainable, and reliable charging to Rove customers,” said Nathan McDonnell, chief executive officer of Rove.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/12/ericsson-solar-plus-storage-microgrid-to-power-texas-5g-station/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,NET METERING,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,SOFTWARE,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JULY 12, 2023",Ericsson solar-plus-storage microgrid to power Texas 5G station,"Telecommunications company Ericsson turned a new page in its sustainability book after debuting the first phase of a telecom tower microgrid, which uses a 2.4 kW solar array plus 14.4 kWh battery storage at a 5G center in Plano, Texas.
An Ericsson spokeswoman told pv magazine USA that the company is using six bifacial 400 W solar panels assembled with three company-supplied lithium-ion battery packs on a corporate facility rooftop. Using ample eight to nine hours of north Texas sunlight, the site is capable of operating off-grid for up to 24 hours, she said.
The 5G site includes an ultra-lightweight mid-band Massive MIMO AIR 6419, RAN Processor 6651, which transmit high-speed wireless phone services, along with an enclosure which comprises the company’s Solar shelf 6670 paired with lithium-ion Batteries 6612, and energy management controller 6610 for hybrid energy operation.
“Ericsson’s smart site solutions for hybrid energy sources are designed to help operators control costs and increase profitability – especially in rural or remote areas or private networks, where traffic volumes are lower and power consumption needs to be especially efficient,” said Ed Gubbins, principal analyst at Global Data. “Using a variety of tools to increase energy efficiency and sustainability – including solar power, lithium-ion batteries, and advanced software features – can be helpful for improving operator profitability.”
Additional features of the telecom microgrid include load shifting, peak shaving, and demand response, which enables the site to effectively utilize batteries when electricity rates are high and recharge the batteries when electricity rates are lower. This power dynamic strategy allows for multiple daily cycles, ensuring optimal cost efficiency by taking advantage of the most favorable electricity prices.
The second phase of the Plano, Texas 5G project will involve deploying additional clean energy resources, such as hydrogen-based generators, as an alternative to on-site diesel generators. It will also explore interoperability with power grid vendors, using other local energy generation and consumption to sell back to the grid with net metering.
Network operators under the Ericsson Network Manager framework can utilize the Plano site’s policy-based Battery Saver, where the users can switch off specified radio frequencies to reduce daily energy consumption and meanwhile increasing network resiliency.
The Plano telecom microgrid has the potential to serve as a demonstration for trial radio hardware and software solutions that improve energy efficiency in conjunction with smart-site solutions. The project could be used by utility companies in areas such as grid frequency, voltage regulation, and demand response energy trading.
Ericsson debuted the Texas microgrid with a three-minute video clip overview of the facility:
In 2022, Ericsson’s Net Zero report titled “Breaking the Energy Curve” detailed plans for the expansion of distributed energy solutions such as solar and energy storage systems to offset energy costs and reduce operating expenses of high density networking operations such as in Plano, Texas.  The multinational company has set a goal of its operations becoming net zero by 2040, with the first step of reducing 50% of emissions across its network upgrading to 5G by 2030. The company’s research shows global mobile networks use 0.6% of global electricity usage.
