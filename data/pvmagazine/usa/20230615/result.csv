More than 90% of emissions from cement production are from the kiln where limestone and silica (shale and sand) are heated to create the material called “clinker” necessary in making cement. Of those emissions, 60% comes from “process emissions,” or the chemical decomposition of limestone in kiln. The other 30% comes from the combustion of fossil fuels to reach the high temperatures required to continually make cement, according to the Department of Energy.
Today global industrial companies are taking a more sustainable approach to cement production to stamp out the use of fossil fuel energy. Holcim US, the North American division of Swiss-French industrial conglomerate Holcim AG, announced the addition of a 25 MW ground-mounted solar array to be installed this year at a cement plant in the upper peninsula township of Alpena, Michigan.
Holcim plans to install solar on a 100-acre field site on the Alpena property, which produces 2.4 million metric tons of cement per year, including the OneCem brand cement, a low-carbon cement which cuts 10% emissions per year, as well as Types I through III, Masonry Type N and Type S cements.
Combined with existing projects, the Alpena solar facility will help the site self-generate 75% of its power needs with clean energy—an important step toward fulfilling Holcim’s pledge to power all of its U.S. operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030.
Holcim retained NorthStar Clean Energy, a subsidiary of utility business CMS Energy, otherwise known as Consumers Energy, to install the 25 MW solar array. The project will use fixed-tilt bifacial solar panels that generate power on both the front and back sides of the module.
The solar project will reduce the cement plant’s CO2 emissions by 25,000 tons annually. Holcim is expected to receive about 35,000 MWh of clean power from the project per year under a Solar Equipment Service Contract, under a 20-year contract.
Commercial operation of the Alpena solar facility is slated to begin in December 2024.
Renewable energy plays a key role in Holcim’s decarbonization efforts across its building products operations. In late 2022, the company entered into its first virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).
The industrials company has expanded its renewable portfolio to include a co-located 33 MW solar array with a 40 MWh battery storage system in Colorado, 4.5 MW of wind generation from three wind turbines in Paulding, Ohio, as well as an additional 20 MW from in Hagerstown, Maryland and Arkansas. Last week, the company announced its participation in the New York Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) program.
The company says it is evaluating on-site renewable energy at 11 manufacturing sites out of 350 sites in 43 states with 7,000 employees.
The Alpena solar facility follows a recent opening of a Holcim tire-derived fuel (TDF) facility at the  plant. Holcim launched the $7.4 million initiative to recycle 22,000 tons of tires per year into energy to help fuel the plant without the use of fossil fuels, while diverting tires from landfills.
Holcim AG is a $40.5 billion market capitalization producer of concrete, cement, aggregates, roofing and insulation building products in 70 countries.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/15/50-states-solar-incentives-california/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 15, 2023",50 states solar incentives: California,"California, a state that would rank within the five largest economic powers in the world if it were its own nation, is the premiere solar energy market. It was an early adopter and continues to be a solar powerhouse today. 
An impressive 26.6% of California’s electricity is generated by solar panels, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA reports that it has enough solar to power over 11 million homes with a cumulative capacity of 41 GW. Altogether, Californians have installed more than 1.7 million solar projects. 
Over the next five years the state is expected to add 22.6 GW, ranking it second behind Texas over the forecast period. Over $90 billion has been invested in solar and the industry employs over 75,000 people across over 2,000 businesses. 
California targets a 100% clean energy goal by 2045. State planners estimate that it will need 110 GW of new solar to get there. 
Incentives
There are numerous incentives, market-based options, and programs available to solar-ready Californians, and they have changed and evolved over time as the market matures. The most significant development over the last several years for the residential solar market is the change in rates provided under the state’s utilities’ net energy metering (NEM) program.
NEM involves the utility crediting a customer on their bill for sending excess solar production to the grid. As of April 15, 2023, California shifted from NEM 2.0 to NEM 3.0, cutting the value of these credits by about 75%. The controversial move was made as grid operators sought to address the mismatch between daytime solar generation and nighttime electricity demand.
As such, a residential solar project in California can no longer rely on NEM to establish a good return on investment. Instead, customers would benefit from installing undersized systems to avoid export losses, or installed systems paired with batteries to make the most of their investment. A case study on the options at-hand under NEM 3.0 can be found here.
Fortunately, the state has a Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) that can alleviate the cost of battery energy storage. Customers are offered between $850 per kWh to $1,000 per kWh of battery capacity, which the Public Utilities Commission said can cover between 85% to 100% of the cost of a battery. For a 13.5 kWh Tesla Powerwall, the SGIP represents a rebate of $11,475 to $13,500.
Residential solar customers in California may also be offered other local or utility incentives as well, so it’s worth checking with an installer representative or searching the web for programs in your area. For example, customers of the Rancho Mirage Energy Authority are offered a one-time $500 rebate for installing solar.
As in all states, Federal incentives apply to solar projects in California as well. The Inflation Reduction Act established an Investment Tax Credit that covers 30% of the installed system costs. It also covers battery energy storage costs.
Solar installations are property tax-exempt in California, meaning that even though the assessed value of your home will rise with an owned solar array, property taxes will not rise as a result.
Informational site SolarReviews can help residential solar shoppers estimate the value of installing solar on their home based on local rates, incentives, and technology inputs.
Programs and mandates
A major change to the California solar industry is the establishment of a community solar program. While other forms of shared or community solar have been launched with mixed results in the past, the state is now rolling out a more robust program, bolstered by federal incentive programs and equity and environmental justice goals.
Community solar typically involves customers subscribing to an off-site solar facility, receiving a utility bill credit for the power it generates. The Department of Energy estimates community solar subscribers save an average of 20% on their bills. The California Senate recently proposed a $400 million investment in community solar.
AB 2316, the Community Renewable Energy Act, creates a community renewable energy program, including community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes. The law ensures that at least 51% of subscribers are low-income customers, which is expected to make projects eligible for a 10% tax credit adder under provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.
California recently passed Senate Bill 49, introduced by Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo). The law aims to support the buildout of solar above parking lots and along highways throughout California.
The bill includes two main provisions. First, it provides a sales tax exemption for the materials to build solar canopies over parking lots. Second, it requires the state to develop a plan to make its highway rights-of-way available for solar, energy storage and transmission infrastructure. By leasing state-controlled land along highways for solar power, California can earn revenue from lease payments and save money through avoided maintenance costs of leased areas. 
New construction homes and commercial buildings located in viable, non-shaded sites are required include solar in their designs. The mandate went into effect for residential constructions in 2020, and the commercial buildings mandate went into effect in early 2023.
Notable project
Distributed solar installer Aspen Power announced it has completed the initial phase of solar projects for The Michaels Organization, covering a new multifamily housing construction with rooftop PV. 
The Davis, California site is expected to generate 476,000 kWh of electricity in its first year of operations, offsetting an estimated 380 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to avoiding burning 781 barrels of oil. The project will meet an estimated 20% of the building’s electricity needs and is expected to save residents an average of 5% on their Pacific Gas & Electric utility bills.
The installation satisfies California’s Title 24 requirements, which mandates multifamily properties to generate renewable energy on-site.
“By incorporating clean energy technology, we can offer our tenants the dual benefits of environmentally friendly power and reduced energy costs,” said Scott Cooper, vice president, The Michaels Organization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/15/retrofitting-solar-farms-with-pollinators-could-yield-up-to-264-million-in-annual-benefits-for-farmers/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 15, 2023",Retrofitting solar farms with pollinators could yield up to $264 million in annual benefits for farmers,"Researchers have discovered that retrofitting 217 solar farms across the U.S. to accommodate pollinator habitats could generate between $120 and $264 million in annual benefits for farmers. Using a “spatially explicit” analysis, the government teams identified the exact solar facilities, farms, and crops that would benefit from these pollinator upgrades.
This open access research, titled “Valuation of pollination services from habitat management: a case study of utility scale solar energy facilities in the United States,” received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), and was conducted by teams from Sandia National Laboratories and Argonne National Laboratory.

Initially, the research groups established a series of maps showing the locations of solar plants and pollinator-dependent crops. They discovered that the states with the greatest number of pollinator-dependent crops near solar facilities were North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Arizona, and California.
The teams then began to map pollinator influence spheres by creating a circular buffer zone around each solar facility. This zone was determined based on the area of the solar plant and the average foraging distance of pollinators, typically about 1 to 2 miles. The analysis identified the area of pollinator-dependent crops within the buffer zone and assigned values to the crops, yield, price, and pollinator dependence. This data was then formulated into an equation to determine the potential value of pollinators from local solar facilities. Any parcels without definitive crop data were excluded.
The research included 217 solar facilities and determined that 80,000 hectares of farmland would benefit explicitly. The specific farming facilities projected to benefit can be gleaned from this available data.

Currently, U.S. farmers are investing substantial funds to pollinate their crops. For instance, California farmers spend $280 million annually to pollinate 393,000 hectares of almonds. Pollination services from the California-based solar farms could potentially offset 10% of the state’s almond crop pollination costs.
The financial benefits to farmers are likely greater than the estimates provided here.
Many solar facilities were not included in the study’s 217 specified power plants. Some were excluded due to the researchers’ belief that pollinator-dependent crops might be outside the 1- to 2-mile radius foraging area of the pollinator insects. While it was noted that pollinators do occasionally forage beyond that radius, the inconsistency and unpredictability of these occurrences make them unreliable for farmers. Other facilities were not included because they already had a high volume of pollinator habitats in the region, and it was thought that additional solar facilities would not provide substantial benefit.

The authors of the paper noted a caveat: the value created by these pollinators, as indicated in the table, does not account for the costs associated with constructing and maintaining the pollinator habitats.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to release a formal “notice of funding opportunity” this month for a competitive grants program that will allocate $7 billion to as many as 60 grantees, the document says.
Selected grantees will enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from residential rooftop and community solar projects and associated storage. Grant funds may be used either to expand existing low-income solar programs or to design and deploy new “Solar for All” programs.
The grant program was inspired, says the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) on its website, by a “roadmap” to expand solar access for all that was developed by a coalition of environmental and social justice organizations and distributed solar companies.
The program is one of three grant programs under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created by the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA intends to design the grants competition to “maximize impact toward” that fund’s objectives, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants, delivering program benefits “particularly” to low-income and disadvantaged communities, and mobilizing financing and private capital.
EPA has solicited input on its proposed implementation framework for the “Solar for All” program, and is hosting community roundtables to convey the program’s expected impact to “renters, small business owners, local government leaders, schools, and nonprofits looking to save on energy costs” and achieve other benefits, the agency said.
The agency said it intends to make at least one award per state and territory. Approximately one to three awards will be made to serve tribal nations. An applicant may apply to receive funds to serve one or more geographic areas.
The first step in the application process will be a notice of intent. Applicants must later submit both a program strategy and a program administration plan.
EPA expects to award grants for each geographic area based on:
EPA will implement the program in alignment with President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, aiming to ensure that 40% of the program’s benefits flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution.

The module manufacturing plant has a planned output of 20,000 modules per day, totaling 5 GW of annual production capacity. Production is expected to begin in late 2023.
The facility represents a $250 million capital investment in a U.S. manufacturing facility, one of the many announcements in clean energy manufacturing over the past 10 months following the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act.
“Canadian Solar’s new $250 million manufacturing plant in Mesquite will bolster Texas’ status as the energy capital of the world and secure our leadership as a global tech hub,” said Governor Greg Abbott.
Dr. Shawn Qu, founder and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar said establishing the factory is a key milestone for the company as it moves to serve the U.S. market.
“We hope that this is the first of many long-term investments we expect to make in the U.S. as we think strategically about a sustainable and resilient clean energy supply chain,” said Qu.
Canadian Solar is one of the largest global suppliers of Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) solar cell technology. This technology will be implemented in the modules produced at the Texas facility. TOPCon has among the highest efficiencies in the commercial PV market and have high degrees of bifaciality, absorbing and converting light from both sides of the module.
In addition to producing modules in the Lone Star state, Canadian Solar’s subsidiary Recurrent Energy provides utility-scale solar and energy storage project development services. The development business, which has been in operations for 17 years, was acquired in 2021 by the module maker. Recurrent develops utility-scale projects that are among the largest in the nation.

The milestone signifies the completion of a sixteen-week solar training program for 12 individuals from the Chicago area. The program has equipped graduates with the necessary skills and certifications for a career in solar energy and general building trades.
Reactivate’s inaugural cohort was trained in solar installation and design based on the criteria of the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) PV Associate certification. In addition the students were trained in solar technical, electrical applications, and industrial vehicle training, such as skid steer, scissor lift and forklift operations, to ensure they had transferable skills within and beyond the solar industry, Reactive spokeswoman Jeannette Torres told pv magazine USA.
Reactivate launched the Chicago program in February 2023 in partnership with GRID Alternatives, Solar Energy International, Jobs for the Future, and local workforce partners Elevate and Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County (CEDA).
The BEST program offers comprehensive training in solar energy installation and the building trades, encompassing various skills such as solar photovoltaic system installation, OSHA 30 certification, NABCEP preparation and exam, as well as essential skills development in leadership, teamwork, financial literacy, and workplace etiquette.
Reactivate graduate Shuron W. said:
You have given us an incredible opportunity that we did not take lightly. Your passion for solar has given us a whole new perspective, and we now understand that solar is the future. Regardless of the path each of us chooses in the solar industry – whether it’s becoming pro-installers, researchers, electricians, instructors, inspectors, or sales consultants – we are now equipped and prepared for the present and future that revolves around solar.
The BEST program offers paid training with materials provided, assistance with transportation and childcare, tutoring and counseling, bilingual support (English/Spanish), and guidance with job placement and apprenticeship transitioning.
The graduation keynote was delivered by Utopia Hill, chief executive officer of Reactivate, emphasizing environmental justice, inclusivity, and the future of renewable energy careers. Hill highlighted the ecological crisis and the opportunity it presents to create a more equitable and sustainable world by empowering marginalized communities.
Reactivate’s Utopia Hill said:
Graduates, this is your call to action. It’s about recognizing the impacts of pollution, climate change and environmental degradation disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. Let us be the driver of change and let your actions be the embodiment of hope. Inclusive environmentalism recognizes the interconnectedness of social justice and environmental issues and acknowledges that a just transition to a sustainable future must also be must also be a just transition for all.”

Set to kick off in 2025 and run through 2029, Meyer Burger will deliver 250 MW of utility-scale glass-glass solar modules annually.
BayWa r.e. noted that they have a 9 GW pipeline of solar projects in the U.S.
Hints of this partnership were dropped by Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt during an interview with Roth Capital MKM. This contract contributed to Meyer Burger’s decision to expand the facility’s manufacturing capacity from 1.6 GW annually to 2.0 GW.
Meyer Burger, a Swiss manufacturer, has secured agreements for utility-scale module capacity with DE Shaw Renewable Investments and Ikea, alongside BayWa r.e. In the Roth interview, ERfurt suggested that the nature of the U.S. residential distribution model tends might preclude the Goodyear facility’s residential manufacturing lines from long-term offtake contracts.
While full details of the agreements have not been disclosed, Erfurt indicated that the deals with Ikea and the formerly unannounced partner – now known to be BayWa r.e. – establish a closer connection between the companies and the Arizona factory. According to available information, both Ikea and BayWa r.e. have committed to contribute capital to support the facility’s expansion and cover ongoing capital expenditures, including the purchase of glass, wafers, and other essential components.
Erfurt had previously revealed that the DE Shaw contract (and presumably the others) incorporates a floating solar wafer price. This condition protects Meyer Burger from price inflation, while permitting DE Shaw to reap benefits from the downward trend in prices, a current industry reality.
This deal is in line with the industry trend of solar developers taking on manufacturing risk, while manufacturers leverage offtake contracts more aggressively to finance their facilities.
