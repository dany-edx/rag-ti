The deal is for 57 MW of solar coupled with 123 MWh of battery energy storage installed across the three sites. Convergent considers the three locations to be one project, which is expected to enter commercial operation this summer.
The capacity will be enough to power more than 75 Tops stores, while also keeping some in reserve for residential consumers to subscribe to buy power. Tops also agreed to buy the renewable energy credits generated by the projects.
The two entities have not yet disclosed how long the PPA or renewable energy credit purchase agreement will run for, though 25-30 years is typical.
Convergent signed a supply deal in March with GE Renewable Energy for an integrated solar inverter and energy storage system to be used in the project. GE will also provide a 20-year service agreement. Other supplier details were not disclosed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/26/cincinnati-launches-a-group-bulk-buy-campaign-to-boost-residential-solar-access/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,OHIO",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 26, 2021",Cincinnati launches a group bulk-buy campaign to boost residential solar access,"The Cincinnati Office of Environment and Sustainability (OES), with the aid of an equity map developed by Rocky Mountain Institute, hopes to expand rooftop solar access to minority groups and increase distributed generation equity.
To achieve this goal, OES’ Jennifer Zavon and Kelsey Hawkins-Johnson agreed with Solar United Neighbors to set up a solar bulk-buying program. This type of program uses the purchasing power of a large group of people to get price breaks from local residential solar installers. The early sign-up of customers can be used to lower per-project costs, because the installers realize an immediate bump in business.
According to OES, there’s no commitment to sign up for the co-op. Signing up gives homeowners access to more information and the option to have an inspector to determine their home’s rooftop solar potential. Potential customers do not even have to live in Cincinnati to take part.
In 2022, the Cincinnati Electric Aggregation Program will begin receiving 15% of its electricity from solar. A 1,000 acre solar array is being built around 40 miles east of Cincinnati to serve the aggregation program. The array represents one of the largest municipally led solar arrays in the country.
Solarize campaigns were identified by Clean Kilowatts and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as one of the five best ways to close the equity gap in solar adoption, according to a 2020 study. The study also found that these programs work best at the community scale, like this Cincinnati program, rather than at the state or national scale.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/26/sunrise-brief-michigan-aims-to-power-state-buildings-with-renewables-and-solar-by-2025/,"BATTERY,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 26, 2021",Sunrise brief: Michigan aims to power state buildings with renewables and solar by 2025,"State of Michigan office buildings and other facilities will run on renewable energy by 2025, according to a new goal set by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
The state will work with DTE, Consumers Energy, and the Lansing Board of Water & Light to buy renewable energy. Doing so would expand each utility’s renewable energy portfolio, rather than buying existing renewable power.
The state is also launching an interagency team to develop a plan to generate solar power on state-owned land and buildings.
Ozop Energy Solutions said it will supply equipment to support a near net-zero microgrid at a Maryland commercial office location.
The company will supply energy generation, storage, and switchgear equipment. It is the first of several projects the company said it will supply equipment to in the near future.
The microgrid project includes a 700 kW battery storage system, a 350 kW natural gas generator, a 65 kW solar photovoltaic system, two electric vehicle charging stations, a retrofit of the interior lighting and plug loads, high efficiency motor replacements, and new variable frequency drives.
When fully operational, the combined energy efficiency improvements are expected to save more than $4 million over the project’s 20+ year life as well as 1.3 million kWh annually, reducing the building’s overall carbon footprint. The project will enable the building to remain operational in the event of a grid failure and also take part in demand response programs.
On the zero-carbon front, Georgia Power said that hot functional testing has begun for Vogtle Unit 3, one of two new multi-billion-dollar nuclear units the utility is building in Georgia. The utility said the testing marks the last series of major tests ahead of initial fuel load.
Hot functional testing verifies the operation of reactor components and systems and confirms the reactor is ready for fuel load. As part of the testing, the site team will begin running Unit 3 plant systems without nuclear fuel and advance through the testing process towards reaching normal operating pressure and temperature.
Over the next several weeks, operators will use heat generated by the unit’s four reactor coolant pumps to raise the temperature and pressure of plant systems to normal operating levels. The unit’s main turbine then will be raised to normal operating speed using steam from the plant. Hot functional testing is expected to take six to eight weeks.
The utility also said that all modules for both Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4 have been set. A water tank was lifted into place on top of the Unit 4 containment vessel and shield building roof. That placement also marked the last major crane lift at the project site. The tank will hold 750,000 gallons of water that may be released in the event of an emergency to help cool the reactor.
Powin announced a new product –Stack360E — marking its entry into the high-voltage battery energy storage market.
The 1500Vdc Stack360E is a complement to Powin’s 1000Vdc Stack230E, both of which are intended for energy applications of three-hours or longer. The move to a higher operating voltage increases the general power rating of compatible inverters, lowering overall balance of plant costs.
The company said the Stack360E uses a third-generation module design which, compared to the previous generation, provides 10% more energy in the same footprint, reduces cell temperature variance by 50%, and can be swapped in-field 80% faster.
The Stack360E will begin mass production early in the third quarter, with the first deliveries scheduled to take place later in the same quarter. Powin said it has secured more than 500 MWh in contracted orders for the Stack360E.
Based in Oregon, Powin has built over 600 MWh of systems, supporting 54 projects in 10 states and 8 countries.
