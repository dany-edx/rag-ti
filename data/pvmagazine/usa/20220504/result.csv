The proximity to this toxic infrastructure has not only exposed these communities to disproportionate health hazards and higher utility bills, but also made them much more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The environmental justice movement, which began in earnest decades ago, has been led by frontline organizers that have fought tirelessly against the flawed environmental and economic policies and practices that led to these inequities.
As much of the country moves forward on clean energy, we have a responsibility to ensure that the disadvantaged communities, those that have been harmed and exploited by our polluting systems, are at the front and center of the transition and involved in all decisions that impact their everyday lives. This effort will require intentional investments at the state and federal levels, whether it is through carve outs in legislation or new regulations, to ensure clean energy is accessible, affordable, and equitable.
New York’s regulatory pathway
New York has historically been a leader in battling the climate crisis and is moving in the right direction when it comes to energy justice. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019 (CLCPA) committed investments in wind and solar as its transition to a zero-emissions economy. The law also requires a minimum of 40% of all state climate and equity spending to go to frontline Black, brown, and low-income communities.
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the state’s energy regulatory body, released a roadmap in December 2021 detailing the state’s plan to achieve the Hochul Administration’s goal of 10 GW of new distributed solar by 2030. The plan includes $1.7 billion in funding for solar projects, and calls for 1.6 GW of newly deployed solar to benefit disadvantaged communities.
These are worthy goals, but the roadmap still falls short when it comes to economic equity and energy justice. Residents of disadvantaged communities stand to reap only a tiny percentage of the Roadmap’s $1.5 billion budget bill savings. Further, the incentive-based plan fails to include a meaningful commitment to community-led solar projects or wealth building for residents of these communities who sign up for the program.
Community solar, in particular, is critical to the New York City area. New York City residents often don’t own their own homes, but rent, live in multifamily housing or apartment buildings where they may not be able to commit to expensive energy efficiency appliances or rooftop solar panels. 
Illinois leads the way through legislation
Right now, the state of Illinois should be our North Star when it comes to energy justice. Six months ago, the state passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which at its core focuses on the intersecting crises of climate change, racism, and economic disinvestment. The act sets targets for phasing out coal and natural gas in favor of cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar power and prioritizes job training, hiring, ownership, and new business creation for low-income, environmental justice communities. The new law also funds community solar projects to help disadvantaged communities that routinely face higher utility bills.
Perhaps the most significant part of Illinois’ new law lies within its intentions. The state made energy justice a pillar of the legislation: it was not an afterthought, but rather legislators wouldn’t have passed the bill and the Governor wouldn’t have signed it had there not been a serious set of equity commitments in it. Through the drafting and negotiation process, frontline communities were centered and their leads followed. Of course, the work doesn’t end when a bill is signed. Today, advocates across the state are continuing efforts to ensure that CEJA’s provisions are implemented in a way that honors the bill’s intentions and puts equity at the forefront.
Other states making progress
New York chose to tackle energy justice commitments through more of a regulatory lens while Illinois opted for the legislative route to address them. Both of these approaches are acceptable  when it comes to energy justice and highlight a path for other states to ultimately reach this shared goal.
For example, a coalition of environmental and social justice advocates in New Jersey are working to pass the Clean Energy Equity Act, which passed the State Senate in 2020, and it is now being considered by the Legislature for a second time. The bill would permanently establish an Office of Clean Energy Equity to ensure equitable deployment of solar, efficiency, and storage solutions in New Jersey’s overburdened communities. If the bill becomes law, these measures will greatly benefit residents of communities in and around Newark that have long been on the front lines of overlapping health, climate, economic, and racial crises.
In Pennsylvania, Governor Wolf and the state’s Legislative Black Caucus marked the 30-year anniversary of Pennsylvania’s environmental justice movement last year by introducing a package of bills, aiming to ensure that low-income  communities and communities of color who have long been shut out of the energy planning process, will have a seat at the table as the state transitions to clean energy.
Policymakers and advocates need to be intentional about centering the experiences and demands of those impacted by energy injustice for far too long. Legislators, who have been supportive of climate action, must now become champions of environmental and energy justice. Likewise, energy regulators have a responsibility to ensure that everyone reaps the benefits of affordable and accessible clean energy.
Finally, we must encourage more states — red and blue — to take broader action when it comes to a clean energy transition that benefits everyone and leaves nobody behind. As national conversations about the climate crisis increase, states across political leanings are considering action on climate and clean energy — but policy is only sustainable if it’s equitable. A common goal we should all share is one that ensures low-income and environmental justice communities are first in line to benefit from a full suite of clean energy technologies that will reduce their household energy burden and safeguard against the impacts of climate change.

BREAKING: NIPSCO announced today that it is delaying coal plant retirements scheduled in 2023 until 2025 due to the chaos that the Commerce investigation on solar tariffs, which has delayed completion of many of its solar projects in Indiana.

According to NIPSCO, most solar projects that the utility originally scheduled for completion in 2022 and 2023 will experience delays of approximately 6 to 18 months. The utility still anticipates to retire all coal-fired generation by 2026-2028, including the Michigan City Generating Station, with that facility’s retirement schedule being so far unchanged by the investigation. NIPSCO also shares that it is is on track to achieve its environmental goals, including an 90% reduction in scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions, relative to 2005 levels, by 2030, and a 50% reduction from 2005 levels in methane emissions from gas mains and services by 2025.
Indiana was one of 13 states in the Solar Energy industries Association’s most recent publication of its anti-circumvention investigation impact survey to have 100% of respondents share that they were experiencing delayed or canceled module supply. It also joined Idaho as the two states to have respondents report that 100% of the state’s development pipeline has been delayed by the DOC investigation.
Those who responded to SEIA’s survey with specific project data outlined that, so far, 3.6 GW of solar projects have been delayed or canceled as a direct result of the investigation, the fourth-most of any state in the country. According to SEIA data, every GW of cancelled projects represents roughly $1 billion in investment at risk. As of the end of 2021, SEIA projected Indiana to add 6.7 GW of solar over the next 5 years, meaning that over half of that pipeline is already in jeopardy.
In total, NIPSCO’s project uncertainties represent roughly $2 billion in delayed investment, and the only real certainty of the situation is that customers’ bills will be going up in the near future.

Across the US as a whole, 42% of the known utility scale solar development pipeline has been disrupted, meaning that it is increasingly likely that other utilities will have to look to alternative sources to meet the generation needs that were supposed to be fulfilled by now-delayed solar installations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/04/ppa-approved-for-100-mw-canadian-solar-project-in-louisiana/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,LOUISIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 4, 2022",PPA approved for 100 MW Canadian Solar project in Louisiana,"Recurrent Energy, a subsidiary of Canadian Solar, said that regulators in Louisiana have approved a power purchase agreement for the 98 MWac Bayou Galion solar project that the company has planned for construction in Morehouse Parish in Northeast Louisiana.
Projected to both start construction and begin operations in 2024, the Bayou Galion solar project is part of 1803 Electric Cooperative’s recently approved power generation portfolio to supply energy to five Louisiana rural electric cooperatives for the next 20 years. The approved portfolio includes 343 MW of solar energy, including the Bayou Galion solar project. According to the most recent Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie data, current through Q4 2021, Louisiana as a whole has installed just over 202 MW of solar to date.
While Louisiana has historically been a fossil-heavy state, cracks are beginning to show, and more and more solar is beginning to get approved. One such project not just approved but under construction is  the Ventress Solar project, which, at 345MWdc, will be the largest in the state when it is completed some time in 2023. In Louisiana, as has been true other places in the south, the decision to commit to renewables via almost exclusively large-scale solar installations is more about providing low-cost electricity than it is about fighting emissions or climate change.
“Solar energy is the lowest cost new energy resource across the U.S. and we are pleased to support 1803 Electric Coop’s goals to bring lower rates for its members,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar. “We look forward to continuing to advance the development of the Bayou Galion solar project and starting construction in 2024.”
That isn’t to say that Louisiana’s solar commitments are entirely large-scale. In March, New Orleans launched its citywide community solar program, under which the city will construct a series of solar gardens, which interested residents can purchase a “share” of, and receive a credit on their electricity bills for their share of the power produced. Participation is open to all electric customers within the city, even those who participate in other utility-sponsored renewable programs, like net metering. Customers may not subscribe to project shares that would exceed 100% of their annual energy usage, nor can a single customer subscribe to more than a 40% interest in a single project. In 2019, the City Council has approved Entergy’s plan to add 90 MW of solar power to the city via three projects.
Over the next five years, Louisiana is expected by the SEIA and Wood Mackenzie to add 1,170MW of new solar capacity which, while only good for 27th in the nation over that time, is exponential growth relative to the state’s history.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/04/congress-calls-for-end-to-solar-panel-tariffs-in-doe-budget-meeting/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 4, 2022",Congress calls for end to solar panel tariffs in DOE budget meeting,"The dominant story in the US solar industry is the Department of Commerce investigation into alleged Chinese circumvention that could lead to heavy tariffs ranging 50-250% of the cost of polysilicon solar goods. About 80% of the US supply of polysilicon panels come from the four Southeast Asian nations that are suspected of harboring tariff-dodging Chinese goods.
The investigation has had nothing short of a chilling effect on the US solar industry, particularly at the utility-scale. Even before the investigation was formally announced, developer SOLV Energy CEO George Hershman commented, “deployment is frozen” due to the untenable level of risk placed by the investigation.
Congressman Scott Peters of California addressed the issue at the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on April 28, delivering the message to Secretary Jennifer Granholm of the Department of Energy (DOE).
“This case could cost us 100,000 American solar jobs and jeopardize our common clean energy goals,” said Peters. “Already 318 projects are being cancelled or delayed, and if the administration decides to impose tariffs, it could cause solar capacity to fall 75 GW short of the pace needed to reach the President’s solar goal.”
Rep. Peters went on to explain that solar panel supply is key to reliability in his state of California. Almost all new solar projects are paired with battery energy storage systems in the state, and without a panel supply, battery storage deployment is also compromised.
Peters added that in September of 2021, DOE released the Solar Futures Study which argued the US must deploy an average of 30 GW of solar capacity per year between now and 2025 to reach the President’s goal of having solar power 40% of nation’s electricity by 2035. The Solar Energy Industries Association said forecasts for 2022 and 2023 are being cut by 46% due to consideration of tariffs.
“Instead of doubling our solar deployment, we’re cutting it in half.” Representative Scott Peters of California
Rep. Peters then asked the council if the DOE was investigating the potential reliability and climate impacts of the tariffs.
“I share your deep concern about this,” said Secretary Granholm. “As you know, this decision is an adjudicative decision that rests with the Department of Commerce.”
“We sit here in the room the makes the laws,” replied Peters. “We’ve got paperwork that is in the way of policy now… this is the tail wagging the dog.”
Peters said he is fully supportive of the solar industry’s target of manufacturing 50 GW of domestic production annually by 2030. However, he added, even if the US was to pass the necessary incentives to expand manufacturing and offset imports, it would take five to ten years to scale up.
“Investing in manufacturing in the long run cannot be an excuse to stop solar deployment in the short term,” he said.
Sec. Granholm said that acceleration of domestic manufacturing is a key element of the DOE’s budget request. She agreed with Rep. Peters that short-term deployment goals are important as well, but that it is also important for the US not to buy circumvented goods or goods that have potential links to labor from the Xinjiang region of China. The region is under scrutiny for credible allegations of forced labor of China’s Uyghur population.
“We call it an existential crisis,” said Peters, “but we need to act like it’s an existential crisis. The fact that we have these laws that shoot ourselves in the foot and put our planet at risk is of great concern to me.”

The company achieved UL 9540 certification after going through rigorous testing for reliability and safety.
The Stack’d Series LFP batteries are a modular platform that can be scaled in 4.8 kWh increments from 9.6 kWh to 38.4 kWh. The company is vertically integrated, using its own Tier 1 prismatic cells in the composition of the battery.
Lithion said that while many battery providers claim whole home backup capability, central A/C and other large appliances may not be able to start up after an outage. The company’s battery is capable of up to 16.8 kW surge and 14.4 kW continuous power, providing true whole-home backup.
LFP batteries are known for their reduced fire risk due to the elimination of cobalt, which is known to be connected to mining practices that have human rights and environmental concerns. The company said its batteries are designed to be readily recyclable at the end of their lifecycle.
The battery is paired with a low voltage 48 v system, IP55 water and dust resistance, and a proprietary battery management system, all elements of the safety and stability of the battery. A 10-year, 4000 cycle full-refund warranty is included.
Sol-Ark said the battery makes a good match for its inverters, boosting ease-of-install. “With our upcoming Sol-Ark 15K, the Stack’d Series battery will be the only battery on the market to maximize its capability,” said Bhawna Oberoi, COO of Sol-Ark.
Lithion’s modular designs make a “drop-in” solution for replacing lead acid batteries, designing them to be easy to implement without re-tooling efforts. This leads to cuts in purchasing, inventory, and servicing costs, said Lithion. The company is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.
Sol-Ark is a Plano, Texas based company started in 2013 by local US veterans with experience in semiconductors and power electronics. It has multiple production lines for inverter series, including the Sol-Ark 12K hybrid, which makes for a full home backup and off-grid solution when paired with the Stack’d Series batteries.

After some pushback, they shifted the start date to 2025.
The DEQ Stormwater page still carries the two memos (1 and 2) in their ‘Resources’ section. The specific language in the March 29th memo is:
Solar panels are to be considered unconnected impervious areas when performing post-development water quantity calculations using the hydrologic methods specified in the Virginia Stormwater Management Program Regulation.
The change in interpretation, to define solar panels and the land underneath them as impervious areas, can sometimes mean defining the dirt under a solar panel as having the same technical water absorption qualities as asphalt or a building. 
This additional water would thus have to be managed via tools such as a retention pond or drainage infrastructure. First, cost and space that would have been used for solar panels must instead be turned into the aforementioned ponds and infrastructure. The water runoff calculated by the state’s engineers could then be added to tax bills as stormwater fees, depending on each local jurisdiction’s regulations.

One way to mitigate the amount of land that is defined as impervious to water absorption is to store wires above ground in harness systems. This also limits the amount of trenching for said wires that occurs, which disturbs land and is accounted for in water runoff analysis. Some jurisdictions define the impervious area of a solar panel as when it is laid completely flat.
The utility scale solar industry in Virginia recently reached the top five states in terms of capacity installed, and has a nascent medium scale market. But shifting political leadership has recently downshifted the short and medium term trajectory of clean energy in the state.
Other regulatory changes are circulating as well.
For instance, the state legislature introduced House Bill 206, which says if the DEQ finds a potential “significant adverse impact on wildlife, historic resources, prime agricultural soils, or forest lands”, the solar facility would be required to submit a mitigation plan for public comment. The bill states that disturbing more than 10 acres of prime agricultural land, 50 acres of contiguous forest, and registered forest land automatically requires the mitigation plan.
The law does not define mitigation, but leaves it open to be interpreted by various stakeholders. This law only applies to projects smaller than 150 MW.

S12 is a 501(c)3 nonprofit whose mission is to accelerate the transition to carbon-free electricity using research, public education initiatives, and policymaker engagement.
SI2 intends to work on challenges including land use, antiquated rate designs, workforce development and environmental justice, and interconnection roadblocks.
“We largely have the technologies we need to address the climate crisis, but several barriers remain to widespread adoption of solar and storage,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO and the new chair of SI2’s board of directors. “The window for climate action is narrowing quickly, and we must double down on the clean energy research and analysis needed to dismantle systemic challenges that are holding back the solar and storage industry.”
David Gahl, SEIA’s current senior director of state policy, East, has been named as the institute’s first executive director. In addition to Gahl’s role as executive director and Hopper’s role as board chair, SOLV Energy CEO George Hershman is serving as SI2’s board secretary, and Nautilus Solar co-CEO Laura Stern is board treasurer.
“I’m thrilled to take on this challenge and work with a diverse range of stakeholders to solve the most pressing issues facing America’s clean energy sector,” said Gahl. “SI2 offers the solar and storage industry a special opportunity to harness its creativity and use innovative thinking to chart a new path to a carbon-free future and an equitable clean energy economy.”
One of the greatest challenges in the solar industry today is land use, but it can also be seen as an opportunity. Siting clean energy projects requires community engagement and long-term planning that minimizes impact to the environment and surrounding community. Educating community and policymakers is important as well, as solar projects must have access to transmission lines and may require upgrades to grid infrastructure. There are numerous examples of solar projects being slowed, stopped, or altered as the public weighs in on land use. In California, a 500MW project was altered after neighbor expressed concerns over their views. And a Missouri town recently voted to set new rules for utility scale solar after it declared a solar installation a nuisance.
SI2’s first research project will create best practices for solar companies looking to create large-scale solar projects and other resources that will help the industry navigate these challenges.
“Over the last decade the solar industry has been a beacon of innovation, persevering through numerous challenges to emerge as a leading provider of cost-effective energy in the United States,” said Hershman. “A brighter possible, and the formation of SI2 will help establish a direct road map to more efficient solar and storage deployment for generations to come.”
Solar energy accounts for roughly 4% of US electricity generation today, and if it reaches 30% of US electricity generation by 2030, electricity sector emissions would be cut in half. If the industry reaches its Solar+ Decade goals, the solar and storage industry would create more than $800 billion in economic activity and add more than one million well-paying jobs. Significant red tape and supply chain hurdles stand in the way, but 2I2 intends to work with solar and storage businesses to achieve these goals.
SI2 will work closely with SEIA, especially as the new organization gets establishef. As the organization grows and secures additional funding sources, SI2 will build its team and announce additional priorities and initiatives.

The company began in 2011 as a Georgia Tech start-up, then in 2014 Sila moved to headquarters in Alameda, California where it began scaling its material. In 2019, after filing its 100th patent, Sila began a partnership with Daimler. Fast forward to today, and Sila announced the purchase of a hydro-powered 600,000 square foot facility in Moses Lake, Washington where the company will manufacture lithium-ion anode materials at automotive volumes and quality.
Sila reports that it is making its initial investment with the intention of delivering enough silicon-based anode annually to power 10 GWh of cells when used as a full graphite replacement, or up to 50 GWh of cells when used as a partial replacement. Or enough material to power batteries in up to 100,000-500,000 premium electric vehicles and 500 million mobile phones annually.
Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder & CEO, is a Tesla veteran. He was the seventh employee at Tesla Motors where he served as Principal Engineer on the Roadster battery, leading the development of the world’s first mass-produced, automotive lithium-ion battery system.
“Our new Washington state plant builds on that momentum offering the manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of our auto partners on their way to a fully electric future. We’ve been working towards automotive quality standards and scale since our start to ensure longer range, faster charge times, and lower battery cost. With this scale-up, we have a pivotal piece to realize the full potential of next-generation materials at the volumes required to make a global impact,” said Berdichevsky.
The Sila team has industrialized and made commercially available a next-generation lithium-ion chemistry with higher energy density. Sila will be producing the same materials at the Moses Lake facility to power electric vehicles, mobile phones and other consumer electronics. For example, Sila materials are powering the WHOOP 4.0 fitness tracker.
The plan is for production lines at the facility will start up in the second half of 2024, with full start of production underway in the first half of 2025. The Moses Lake facility can be expanded 15X to reach production volumes that could power 150 GWh of cells when used as a full graphite replacement or 750 GWh as a partial replacement, or enough to power 2 to 10 million electric vehicles per year.
“Our energy independence and economic prosperity are tied to our ability to develop and manufacture new clean energy technologies here on American soil. I’m proud that Washington state has been a leader on this issue and even prouder that innovative companies like Sila come here to advance these clean energy solutions. Washington is excited that Sila is investing here and we welcome the transformative impact that building clean energy can have on our world and our state,” said Washington Governor Jay Inslee.
Moses Lake is also home to the shuttered REC Silicon factory, now owned by Hanwha, which has voiced intentions to re-open the facility. BMW, in partnership with SGL Group, is the largest producer of carbon fiber in the world used in manufacturing electric vehicles, and is also manufactured in a Moses Lake facility.
Major Sila investors include 8VC, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Coatue, Mercedes-Benz, In-Q-Tel, Matrix Partners, Sutter Hill Ventures, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.

Israeli solar inverter and battery maker SolarEdge has said it expects its record-breaking run for revenue, including from its solar business, to continue during the April-June 2022 reporting period.
Announcing its first-quarter 2022 figures, the manufacturer said the new high for revenue posted during the January-March period, of $655 million, is likely to be topped by an expected $710 million to $740 million for April to June.
That first-quarter 2022 figure included solar business trade worth $608 million, a record for SolarEdge in the segment. The company expects to have generated $660 million to $690 million during the April-June period.
The company shipped 2.13 GWac worth of inverters in the first three months of the 2022, although its net income slipped 19% from the final three months of 2021 to $33.1 million. No explanation was given for the reverse in the press release issued by SolarEdge to announce the results, nor on the investor slide presentation on the company website as pv magazine went to press. But it could reflect the rising materials and shipping costs which have dogged solar manufacturers worldwide, especially as CEO Zvi Lando stated the rise in revenue was driven by business in the United States and 14 European countries.
Gross margin in the company’s solar business also slipped, from 34.5% in the first three months of 2021, and 32.8% in October-December 2021, to 30.2% in the first three months of 2022. The figure could retreat again during April-June 2022, with SolarEdge stating it could range from 28% to 31%.
Whatever the explanation for the quarterly changes, they do not appear to have affected the company’s bottom line. With SolarEdge raising $651 million on March 17, the cash and bank balances that amounted to $548 million at the end of December 2021 had risen to $979 million by the end of March 2022, the company said.
