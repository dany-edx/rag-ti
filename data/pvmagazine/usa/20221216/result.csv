Produced with net-zero carbon emissions, clean hydrogen will be key in the emerging clean energy economy and will help toward achieving the President’s goal of a 100% clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
“Today’s announcement is yet another exciting step toward lowering the cost of and scaling-up clean hydrogen production, a versatile fuel essential to the nation’s historic transition to an equitable and secure clean energy future,” said Jennifer M. Granholm, secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy. “By investing in the cutting-edge research and development necessary to making market-ready clean hydrogen a reality, DOE is delivering on President Biden’s promise to implement an ambitious climate agenda.”
Clean hydrogen can play a vital role in reducing emissions from some of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors of our economy, including heavy-duty transportation. Clean hydrogen can also provide a means for long-duration energy storage.
Electrolysis, the process that creates hydrogen fuel, requires large amounts of electricity. Therefore, it’s a perfect marriage for solar energy and hydrogen production. Fusion Fuel, a modular solar-to-hydrogen facility provider based in Portugal, and Electus Energy, a hydrogen fleet-fueling and power infrastructure developer, entered an exclusive joint venture agreement to construct a 75 MW green hydrogen facility in Bakersfield, California. The proposed project is a solar-to-hydrogen site that would make use of Fusion Fuel’s proprietary hydrogen electrolyzer technology, called HEVO. The company said the facility, its first in the United States, would produce up to 9,300 tons of hydrogen fuel per year to fuel heavy-duty trucks.
Clean hydrogen can also help reduce harmful air pollution and decarbonize industrial, chemical and other polluting sectors. Reducing emissions in these sectors would benefit disadvantaged communities, because they are often in the most industrialized areas and have suffered disproportionately from local air pollution in the past. The DOE’s National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap and President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative serve as pillars driving the energy justice efforts by Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO) and the Hydrogen Program.
Together with the regional clean hydrogen hubs (H2Hubs), tax incentives in the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, and ongoing research, development, and demonstration in the DOE Hydrogen Program, these investments are intended to accelerate the technical advances and the scale-up needed to achieve DOE’s Hydrogen Shot goal of $1 per kilogram of clean hydrogen within a decade.
Managed by DOE’s Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO), projects funded through this opportunity will address underlying technical barriers to cost reduction, which will open new markets for clean hydrogen. The DOE sees this funding as a way to create more clean energy jobs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthen America’s competitiveness in the global clean energy market.

With the acquisition, Tigo intends to add a prediction platform that provides actionable system performance data from the grid to the module level.
Tigo Energy, founded in 2007, specializes in the development and manufacture of inverter hardware and software solutions as well as energy storage products. For example, Tigo recently announced  a new device that that uses Pure Signal technology that uses its own rapid shutdown transmitters to rapidly shutdown utility-scale solar plants.
FSIGHT was founded in 2015 by Eveline Steinberger, a serial entrepreneur behind Blue Minds, Amos Lasker, and Amrav Investments. As a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, FSIGHT gives utilities, independent power providers, solar assets owners, EPCs and investors visibility into the performance of their solar energy systems, the energy demand served by those systems, and predictive data.
The software platform provides a scalable data analytics infrastructure and prediction engine that Tigo hopes help accelerate the deployment and optimization of distributed energy resources (DERs).
FSIGHT’s infrastructure platform translates behind-the-meter energy insights that can help deploy DERs of all sizes, the company reports. For smart-meter utilities, FSIGHT says it can forecast load, generation and pricing dynamics, as well as portfolio composition and the ability to automate customer clustering.
“Our mission has been to facilitate the energy transition by using data to reinvent business models for a greener energy market of the future, and Tigo’s global footprint allows us to significantly accelerate these ends,” said Evgeny Finkel, chief executive officer of FSIGHT. “Through the support of Tigo and its vast installed base, we will be able to provide even more accurate predictions about customers’ energy systems. I am delighted to join the Tigo team and bring the best of both companies to our customers.”
 The FSIGHT team will join the Tigo Energy team in its Ra’anana, Israel, office.
 “The acquisition of FSIGHT strengthens our leadership position in MLPE by adding both a new layer of sophisticated energy data tools and the opportunity to expand our data services business in solar,” said Zvi Alon, chairman and CEO at Tigo Energy, Inc. “With FSIGHT, AI and machine learning technology forecasts electricity consumption and generation of individual endpoints or aggregated portfolios, which we believe benefits stakeholders all along the solar value chain. We look forward to further evolving our comprehensive digital platform to optimize the solar experience for all parties, from commissioning through operations and maintenance.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/16/testing-prairie-and-pollinator-agrivoltaics-at-a-former-nuclear-power-site/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,GEORGIA,ILLINOIS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Testing prairie and pollinator agrivoltaics at a former nuclear power site,"The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) launched a project aimed at restoring prairie lands and pollinator habitat under solar arrays along a 20-acre plot of land in Sacramento County, Calif.
The Rancho Seco energy project is located at the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant in central California and part of native tribes’ ancestral lands. The project also supports SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. The project is set to run for four years in multiple phases.
Project participants include the University of California, Davis, D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments, NovaSource Power and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.
The project team will create a pollinator habitat under a 160 MW utility-scale solar project and measure changes in energy, soil carbon and management costs at the site. Expected outcomes include the establishment of native plant species promoting pollinator habitats and soil carbon monitoring.

The 160 MW Rancho Seco Solar II project was installed in February 2021 and is operated by D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments, under a 30-year power purchase agreement with SMUD.
The property is also home to Cosumnes Power Plant, an operating combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, nature preserve and recreation area, which is home to the federally protected California Tiger Salamander.
“Successful demonstration could provide the blueprint for future renewable energy projects throughout the country that are restorative not just in their kilowatts, but also for local people and biodiversity,” said Jessica Fox, senior technical executive and conservation biologist at EPRI.
“We’re trying to create a model that other solar developers can follow,” said Rebecca Hernandez, a UC Davis associate professor and director of the Wild Energy Center. “This is an opportunity to stack California prairie with solar energy and begin to restore the 98% of prairie habitat that’s been lost.”
SMUD is part of EPRI’s Power-In-Pollinators initiative. Launched in 2018, the initiative is the largest collaboration of power companies in North America working to understand pollinators.
“We are excited for this project to consider multiple levels of energy including solar power, the energy needs of the biological ecosystem, and the restoration of cultural energy for our communities,” said Kathleen Ave, SMUD’s senior climate and ecosystem strategist and co-chair of the Power-In-Pollinators initiative.

According to the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), pollinators such as bees, butterflies and other insects are critical to supporting about 35% of the world’s food crop production.  Establishing pollinator-friendly plants under and around ground-mounted solar arrays has the potential to provide this critical habitat and benefit both the pollinators and nearby agriculture.
SETO is working to better understand the economic, ecological, and performance impacts of co-locating pollinator habitat and solar arrays.  Its research will enable more solar deployment to help meet the Biden Administration’s goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035.  The DOE notes that providing 1 terawatt of solar power requires 5.7 million acres of land, which is 0.3% of the total U.S. contiguous land area.  The agency stressed the importance of maximizing local environment and agricultural communities for the co-hosting of solar projects.
Argonne National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory noted that approximately 1,350 square miles of farmland in the United States sits in close proximity to current or planned utility-scale solar projects that could benefit from pollinator habitat agrivoltaics programs.
Other projects similar to SMUD’s Rancho Seco property include a a pollinator-friendly solar farm on former President Jimmy Carter’s land in Georgia. This site is one of five solar sites used to study stormwater infiltration and runoff at solar farms. SETO is testing three different seed mixes, including the industry-standard grass, a low-diversity pollinator mix, and a high-diversity planting pollinator mix.
In the Midwest, SETO funded a project led by the University of Illinois to investigate solar co-located with pollinator plantings at large-scale installations, with teams of researchers working at seven separate sites in the Midwest.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/16/lowering-grid-costs-with-voltage-support-from-pv-inverters-at-night/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Lowering grid costs with voltage support from PV inverters at night,"From pv magazine global
Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University in have proposed the use of PV inverters instead of expensive voltage compensators to provide voltage support at night. They said this will reduce costs for grid operators and remove a barrier to integrating renewable energy in loosely connected power networks.
The use of PV inverters instead of compensators might provide additional sources of revenue for PV plant owners, although the supply of voltage support from a utility-scale PV plant would require the addition of an augmented voltage controller to the facility, which would also have to be replaced within the lifetime of an asset.
“There is a good case to be made that PV plant operators should be paid for providing voltage support at night,” researcher Jay Apt told pv magazine. “Without additional compensation, it would not be a good business decision for  PV plant operators to take on the additional costs.”
He said local ancillary services for reactive power could be created, with generators bidding on reactive power capability on an hourly basis – much like regulation ancillary services. An ancillary service would thus create an efficient market for reactive power prices and provide the revenue needed for PV plant operators to recoup their costs.
“With adequate incentives, PV plant operators can add a revenue stream by providing reactive power support at night,” said researcher Yamit Lavi. “PV plant operators already accept approximately a one-year lifetime reduction of their inverters for currently-mandatory reactive power requirements. Providing reactive power at night will reduce their lifetime by only one additional year and increase benefits to the grid, potentially furthering the adoption of PV.”
Voltage compensators are commonly known as static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) or flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS). They cost between $30 million and $100 million, depending on the size and location. PV inverters are also expensive assets, but they remain unused for about 50% of their lifetimes and the usual voltage support such devices provide during the day is not available at night.
“PV providing reactive power at night has been successfully field-tested in East Sussex UK by National Grid and Lightsource BP argue that using a group of PV inverters for voltage support is about 50 times less costly than installing a FACTS device,” the researchers explained, noting that their work involves quantifying the cost of reactive power from a solar PV power plant. “We make the first comparison of the total cost of utilizing a PV inverter as a substitute for a STATCOM to that of a STATCOM, including wear and tear on the inverter and necessary equipment.”
The academics used a model developed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to determine whether PV inverters can prevent night-time voltage excursions. They also compared costs based on a discounted cash flow model.
They found that PV inverters have an average cost of $20.20 per kilovolt-amperes reactive (kVAR), which they said is between $56/kVAR and $269/kVAR less expensive than STATCOMs.
“This difference has a large range due to the large range in STATCOM costs, which are due the STATCOM size, environmental conditions of the location, and the equipment necessary for installation and interconnection,” they said.
The researchers presented their findings in “Using PV inverters for voltage support at night can lower grid costs,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.
“Our analysis showed that operating PV inverters at night is 4 to 14 times less costly,” the scientists concluded. “The cost difference is due to a shorter lifespan of PV inverters as well as a more detailed discounted cash flow model that accounts for controller replacements.”
