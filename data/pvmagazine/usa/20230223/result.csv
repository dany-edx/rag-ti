https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/23/solid-state-battery-design-uses-metal-blend-electrolyte/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,COLORADO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Solid-state battery design uses metal blend electrolyte,"Academics from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and partner Florida State University (FSU) released a blueprint for a solid-state battery technology less dependent on critical metals that are challenging to source due to global supply chain issues.
The report by Berkeley Labs and FSU was recently published in Science, and could advance solid-state batteries to provide more efficient and affordable battery cells that are more readily available than lithium-ion batteries..
Touted for high energy density and superior safety, solid-state batteries could be a game changer for the EV industry. The solid-state technology has proven to be affordable and also conductive enough to provide hundreds of miles of driving range on a single EV battery charge. This has long been a source of friction for EV drivers as it applies to lithium batteries and “range anxiety.”
“With our new approach to solid-state batteries, you don’t have to give up affordability for performance. Our work is the first to solve this problem by designing a solid electrolyte with not just one metal but with a team of affordable metals,” said Yan Zeng, an author of the report and a staff scientist at Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences group.
In traditional lithium-ion battery cells, the electrolyte works like a transfer hub where ions flow with electric charge to power a device or recharge the battery.
Similar to lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries store energy and then release it to power devices. But rather than liquid or polymer gel electrolytes found in lithium-ion batteries, they use a solid electrolyte.
Government, research, and academics have invested in the research and development of solid-state batteries because commercial grade batteries have historically been prone to overheating, fire, and loss of charge risk, mainly concerning the liquid electrolyte.
Current solid-state batteries in production are based on metals that are expensive and unavailable in bulk quantities, with many metals such as cobalt produced from regions of the world with high geo-political risk.
For the current study, Zeng, in partnership with Bin Ouyang, assistant professor in chemistry and biochemistry at FSU, and senior author Gerbrand Ceder, a Berkeley Lab senior scientist and UC Berkeley professor of materials science and engineering, showcased a new type of solid electrolyte consisting of a blend of various metal elements.
The new materials could result in a more conductive solid electrolyte that is less dependent on a large quantity of an individual element.
In experiments conducted at the Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley campus, the researchers demonstrated the new solid electrolyte by synthesizing and testing several lithium-ion and sodium-ion materials with multiple mixed-metals.
Researchers observed that the new multi-metal materials performed better than expected, displaying an ionic conductivity several orders of magnitude faster than single-metal solid state battery materials. Ionic conductivity is a measurement of how quickly lithium ions move to conduct electric charge.
The researchers theorized that mixing different metals together creates new pathways – much like the addition of expressways on a congested highway – through which lithium ions can move quickly through the electrolyte. Without these pathways, the movement of lithium ions would be slow and limited when they travel through the electrolyte from one end of the battery to the other, Zeng said.
To validate blends for the multi-metal design, the researchers performed calculations based on a method called density-functional theory on supercomputers at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). Using scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM), the team confirmed that each electrolyte is made of only one type of material – what scientists call a “single phase” – with unusual distortions giving rise to the new ion transport pathways in its crystal structure.
The discovery enables new opportunities to design next-generation ionic conductors. The next step in this research is to apply the new approach that Zeng developed with Ceder at Berkeley Lab to explore and discover novel solid electrolyte materials that can improve battery performance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/23/rvs-take-shade-under-pv-carport/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",RVs take shade under PV carport,"DSD Renewables and Black Bear Energy announced the completion of a 1.5 MW solar project in Menifee, California, at the Wilderness Lakes campground. Built for Thousand Trails, a recreational vehicle resort company, the solar arrays are mounted atop parking canopies. 
The facility is expected to generate 2.4 million kWh of energy annually, meeting about 50% of total energy use across the campground. The facility has over 500 RV campsites and a common area with a swimming pool, hot tubs, clubhouse, fitness center, and game room. 
The 3,500 panel array is mounted on carports designed for rigs ranging 30 feet to 45 feet in length, covering 82,000 square feet in total. Month-to-month sites are shaded by the array, which also powers the controlled access gates and security cameras. 
“We’re thrilled to have a high-end amenity for guests and members that also highlights our ongoing focus on sustainability, renewable energy and environmental awareness,” said Monica Ferrer, senior director of energy and sustainability for Thousand Trails. 
Solar carports 
The U.S. has roughly two billion parking spots. If 25% of parking spots were outfit with 2.88 kWdc per spot, the capacity of those 500 million parking spots would total 1.44 TW.
Assuming a lower-than-average generation capacity factor of 15% due to sub-optimal angling of the panels, these solarized parking spots would generate 1.89 petawatt hours (PWh) of electricity. The total electrical consumption of the US is currently around 4 PWh per year. 
In late 2022, California Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo) submitted a new piece of legislation with a goal to motivate solar carport installations in California via a tax incentive. The bill, SB 49, states intent to, “provide tax incentives for the construction of solar canopies over large parking lots to boost the local generation of clean electricity in urban and suburban areas while reducing the need for dedicated land in rural areas and transmission to deliver the clean energy into population centers.” 
Senator Becker’s press release notes that, “pavement makes up 35%-50% of the total surface area in cities, and 40% of that pavement is parking lots.” It also cites California-specific solar carport figures. 
For example, Los Angeles County has 101 square miles of parking lots, and contains about 25% of the state’s population. The press release extrapolates these numbers by population, inferring that there should be approximately 400 square miles of parking lots in the state, equivalent to 26 GW of solar canopies.  
The senator also notes that California’s energy agencies estimate that the state needs about 110 GW of new solar power to meet its 100% clean energy target by 2045. An analysis by Yale University suggests that carports in the state could meet about one-third of the state’s electricity demand.
Some states have already put in place incentives for solar carports, offsetting the additional costs of steel, installation and grid connection. These additional costs would normally add as much as $1 per watt versus the price of a typical commercial rooftop installation. Massachusetts’ SMART program, for instance, offers a $0.06 per kWh incentive for 20 years for solar canopies.

Built-environment PV projects like carports and highway-side vertical PV are increasingly growing in popularity in Europe. In late 2022, France passed a law that makes solar carports mandatory for all parking lots greater than 1,500 square meters.

SEG Solar has unveiled a new solar module based on n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPcon) technology. The Yukon 144-cell modules feature M10 (182 mm) N-type TOPCon cells and are designed for ultra-large power stations, it said.
SEG Solar is offering four versions of the panels, with power outputs ranging from 565 W to 580 W. The efficiency ratings range from 21.87% to 22.45%. The open-circuit voltage is between 51.50 V and 52.10 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.89 A and 14.07 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels measure 2,268 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 32.0 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and 2 mm semi-tempered glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0%. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
The manufacturer currently produces its panels at factories in Vietnam and Indonesia.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/23/developers-launch-third-n-j-superfund-solar-facility/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,NEW JERSEY",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Developers launch third N.J. superfund solar facility,"CEP Renewables activated a 17 MW brownfield solar project in the Garden State. Located in Holland, N.J., the CEP announced the conversion of the brownfield project earlier this week with contractor CS Energy and project owner NJR Clean Energy Ventures.
The facility uses fixed-tilt axis solar arrays and was built in two phases on the site of a decommissioned industrial paper mill complex.
NJR Clean Energy acquired the Holland project in 2021 from CEP Renewables, and currently owns 63 commercial solar projects throughout New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Connecticut, with a portfolio of more than 430 MW of installed capacity.
“We’re pleased to leverage our extensive experience with redeveloping Superfund and brownfield sites to turn this previously contaminated property into a source of solar energy, jobs and tax revenue,” said Chris Ichter, executive vice president of CEP Renewables. “We were able to efficiently overcome the unique challenges this site posed by working closely with the property owner and the EPC, CS Energy, at every stage of the project.”
“We are committed to building a clean energy future with projects like Holland,” said Robert Pohlman, vice president of NJR Clean Energy Ventures. “By repurposing brownfields and other underutilized spaces to produce clean, renewable energy, CEV is helping to deliver clean energy innovations that drive emission reduction goals and power a more sustainable future.”
The former paper mill complex was abandoned in the 1990s and fell into disrepair, said the project developer. CEP Renewables was sought out by the property owner to redevelop the land.  CEP’s team reviewed the environmental history and provided critical review and recommendations before completing remediation work at the site.
By doing remediation on its own, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection was able to quickly review and issue a remedial action permit. CEP’s team enhanced the existing engineering controls to be compatible for solar project development, said the developer.
CEP Renewables and CS Energy also overcame several challenges, including the permitting and construction of a second phase of the project overlapping with the first. Additionally, the project had to be built around a historic farmhouse and powerhouse located on a portion of the property.
In December, CEP Renewables and its partners announced the completion of what is the largest recorded North American brownfield solar project, at 25.6 MW in Mount Olive, N.J. Located at the former Combe Fille North Landfill Superfund site, the large brownfield solar project will provide the township of Mount Olive with close to $2.3 million in past tax revenues while creating a future revenue-generating renewable energy asset.
With 10,000 closed landfill sites in the U.S., there has been an 80% increase in the number of landfill solar project developments at brownfield sites in recent years, according to the EPA.
According to New Jersey’s Environmental Protection website, the capped Mount Olive landfill is a 65-acre brownfield site that ceased accepting waste in 1981.
The project was developed by CEP Renewables and CS Energy. Lindsay Precast supplied steel skids for the project and Terrasmart supplied its Glide fixed-tilt, ballasted mounted rack systems. NJR Clean Energy Ventures, a subsidiary of investor-owned utility New Jersey Resources, will own and operate the solar facility under a long-term agreement.
Under New Jersey’s 2019 Energy Master Plan, the Garden State outlined a goal of producing 100% renewable energy assets by 2050 with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2006 levels.  The state identified 30 prospective and development-stage brownfield landfill solar sites at the time of the master plan.
CEP Renewables has constructed 158.5 MW of solar projects to date in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  The Holland, N.J. project is the company’s third New Jersey landfill solar project after the Mount Olive (26.5 MW) and South Brunswick (13 MW) project, which was installed in mid-2018. CS Energy, an American Securities portfolio company, has installed about 197.1 MW of landfill solar projects to date around the Northeast U.S. out of a 1.5 GW operational solar portfolio.
Landfill solar
Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) developed a comprehensive report, “The Future of Landfills is Bright,” designed for elected officials, policymakers, planners, and developers, to learn how landfill solar can be part of a broader clean energy and land-use strategy to achieve ambitious community-wide climate, sustainability, and environmental justice goals.
RMI said there are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the country. It said more than 63 GW of solar power plant capacity could be located at less than half of US landfills, generating 83 terawatt hours of electricity each year across all 50 states. The plants also could generate more than $6.6 billion annually in electricity revenue. 
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, around 428 MW of utility-scale landfill solar across 126 projects had been installed at the end of 2019. Notably, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are home to 73% of all US utility-scale landfill solar projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/23/solar-industry-seeing-results-from-diversity-program/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Solar industry seeing results from diversity program,"In October 2021, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) launched its Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice (DEIJ) Certification Program, which encourages broad participation across the clean energy industries and rewards companies working to create a more inclusive work environment, serve their communities, and attract, hire, promote, and retain diverse talent. In its newly released annual report that chronicles the program’s impact in its first year, SEIA notes that companies across the value chain are using the program’s 34 modules to raise the bar for DEIJ work in the clean energy sector.
In her introduction to the annual report, Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA pointed out that just few years ago the thinking was that because the industry was so young and still growing, they had time to strategize and to “do it right from the start”. But now the solar industry is a $33 billion industry that employs more than 250,000 workers in every state in the country, and the time is now.
“If we want the solar workforce to keep pace with the clean energy boom around the corner, complacency is not an option,” said Hopper. “We cannot expect equity to grow organically, and the actions we take today will impact our ability to reach our goals in the Solar+ Decade. Tools like the DEIJ Certification Program are absolutely necessary to close the gap between talk and action, and we look forward to building on the successes of this important program.”
The 45 companies enrolled in the certification program represent the entire solar value chain, from project developers, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firms, manufacturers, financiers to nonprofit organizations.
Of those 45 companies, 19 organizations achieved Bronze certification, two project developers achieved Silver (Forefront Power and Longroad) and one company, the manufacturer RES Group, achieving Gold. To achieve Gold certification, the company must have taken demonstrated and measurable steps to improve practices and policies.
“The solar and storage industry expects to generate more than $100 billion of annual investment by the end of the Solar+ Decade, and SEIA is laying the groundwork to ensure a diverse pool of stakeholders are uplifted by this wealth-building engine,” said Erika Symmonds, SEIA’s vice president of equity and workforce development.
Previous thinking was that DEIJ initiatives are too costly for small companies to take on. However, SEIA found that that does not seem to be the case. More than 75% of the companies participating in the program have fewer than 200 workers and 40% have fewer than 50 workers.
The report found that all companies enrolled in the certification program are not only doing diversity work internally, but they are all working externally with frontline communities. They also all have written DEIJ communication plans. And all of them have made DEI training available to staff. Half of them are offering unconscious bias training for hiring managers. And one-quarter use “buddy programs” in onboarding.
Companies enrolled in the DEIJ Certification program have access to monthy cohort meetings where they can discuss specific topics with others, and learn through collaboration. Some of the topics include supplier diversity, affinity groups, effective onboarding practices, and more.
SEIA is releasing several new program modules in 2023, including best practices for uplifting LGBTQ+ voices, offering inclusive health benefits, supporting apprenticeship programs, and creating inclusive spaces in the clean energy sector. Earlier in the year, SEIA released new modules about disability inclusion, mentorship and supporting military veterans in the workplace. Starting in Q1 2023, non-SEIA members will be able to enroll in the DEIJ Certification Program.
The DEIJ Certification Program was designed by Diversity Certified Professionals and uses an evidence-based approach to improve diversity practices within companies. The program was also designed so that all companies, regardless of their size, geographic footprint or resources, can achieve the highest levels of certification.

(ONE), announced Aries Grid, a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) utility-scale battery system that can serve as long-duration energy storage.
Founded in 2020 by Apple Inc. veteran Mujeeb Ijaz, ONE was initially known for making batteries for electric vehicles. Earlier this month, ONE announced that it had raised $300 million to fund the first phase of a $1.6 billion U.S.-based battery cell gigafactory. Investors include Fifth Wall, Franklin Templeton, Temasek, and others. The company also received $220 million in grants from the state of Michigan, and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures was an early investor.
“Energy storage is the key to decarbonizing both mobility and the grid.” said Mujeeb Ijaz, CEO and founder of ONE. “With Aries Grid, ONE is servicing a market demand for safer and more sustainable utility-scale energy storage solutions that are, for the first time, cost competitive with fossil fuels, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act.”
The Michigan factory, which is located in Van Buren Township, will begin production of the Aries Grid LFP cells in 2024, and the cells will be offered in 2-, 3- and 6-MWh options to support modular and scalable renewable energy storage.

The lithium iron energy storage system uses a LFP cathode chemistry, which is known as having a minimized fire risk when compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. ONE also reports that LFP is more durable and has double the lifetime energy throughput of the nickel, cobalt and manganese (NCM) chemistries which make up most commercially available stationary energy storage systems in the United States.
With discharge times ranging from 4 to 12 hours, the company reports that the Aries Grid can create a renewable microgrid that provides 24×7 firm capacity baseload to power factories, data centers and communities.
“Aries Grid offers utilities a versatile grid asset while providing businesses with a tool to help decarbonize their supply chains,” said Dr. Deeana Ahmed, vice president of strategy, policy & sustainability of ONE. “With durable, sustainable, Michigan-built batteries, there is a real path forward to increasing renewable electricity across the U.S. and around the world.”
Since the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in August, several battery manufacturers have announced plans to set up shop in the United States. Included in the IRA is over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes $30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing.
