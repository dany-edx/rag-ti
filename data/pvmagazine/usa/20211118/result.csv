The American Battery Technology Company lithium-ion battery recycling facility will consist of three functional building areas with a combined floor space of approximately 100,000 square feet. The the structures will house a battery recycling production building, an office building with laboratories, and a finished goods warehouse. The onsite analytical and process laboratories, along with the pilot bays for validating next-generation technologies, will become ABTC’s global development center, providing the infrastructure and experimental tools to support current and future operations of our battery recycling and primary battery metal extraction technologies.
American Battery Technology’s recycling production building will bring to scale the company’s closed-loop battery recycling process, where battery contents are removed using automated 3-hour process of ingesting materials. The chemicals used in that ingestion are then kept in a “closed system”, cleaned, filtered and reused, before individual metals are separated and purified into battery grade components.
Once the extraction and recycling process has been completed, the company then sells high grade metals including lithium, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, copper, and graphite to OEMs and manufacturers.
When operations commence, American Battery Technology’s pilot plant will be scaled to process 20K metric tons of feedstock per year.
A recent report by Lux Research found that more than 1 million tons of batteries are expected to reach end-of-life and need to be recycled by 2030, a capacity that neither the U.S., nor the world at large are currently able to handle.
Lux said a variety of technologies and further innovation will be needed to meet the demand of end-of-life batteries, and capacity will need to be expanded, and that the development of a clear code for recycling standards could be the first key towards tackling the upcoming wave.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/18/demand-for-battery-recycling-is-growing-but-capacity-and-innovation-lag/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021","Demand for battery recycling is growing, but capacity and innovation lag","By the end of 2020, 17.6 GWh of lithium-ion batteries met their end of life; by 2035, that number may grow to over 140 GWh, said Lux research. Current recycling capabilities lag what is needed to meet this rapid growth in demand.
More than 1 million tons of batteries are expected to reach end-of-life and need to be recycled by 2030, Lux said. Currently, the supply of waste batteries is only about 2-3% of cumulative energy storage demand, presenting an opportunity for more value creation from end-of-life batteries.
The Lux report pointed to several drivers that it expects to help launch this market. One is the development of policies that support battery handling and reuse. Currently, under most jurisdictions, lithium-ion batteries are classified as hazardous materials, and lack specific regulations for disposal and recycling. A clear set of standards will enable faster and more efficient adoption of recycling, Lux said.
Technology developments also will spur growth in this emerging market, the report said. Lithium-ion battery recycling has made significant advancements in recent years, and recyclers now claim lithium recovery rates upwards of 98%. Patent filings for recycling techniques have also occurred at an increased rate, said Lux.
Lux offered a handful of ways that recycling is conducted. Mechanical recycling is the initial step of separating components. In this step, housing, wiring, and circuitry are disposed. Following that, one of three different prevailing recycling techniques is used.
One method is known as direct recycling, which uses nonchemical methods to process materials for reuse in future batteries. An advantage of this method is it derives a product that can be used farther down the value chain. Rather than repurposing the battery back to a raw material and sending it through the entire through the manufacturing process again, direct recycling offers an already-refined product.
A second method is hydrometallurgy, which uses chemical precipitation to gather metal salts or cathode materials, and, in some cases, anode and current collector materials. This method creates refined materials that can quickly be integrated into cathode production and cell manufacturing.
The third type, pyrometallurgy, is less common, but has shown some success in case studies in terms of improving its extraction rates. Pyrometallurgy uses smelters to recover base metals and composite slurries. The method requires further refinement, and essentially restarts the battery production process.

Lux said a variety of technologies and further innovation will be needed to meet the demand of end-of-life batteries, and capacity will need to be expanded.
One barrier to growth is the lack of standardization in EV batteries. The high variability in design makes it difficult to develop efficient and cost-effective recycling processes. Lux said this may benefit hydrometallurgy’s ability to extract value across different battery structures and chemistries.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/18/a-promising-new-design-for-shingled-solar-modules/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021",A promising new design for shingled solar modules,"From pv magazine Global
Shingled modules – where silicon solar cells are cut into five or six strips and interconnected using an electrically conductive adhesive – have been around for a while, and though never a mainstream solution they have kept the industry’s attention thanks to potential for flexibility in the size and shape of modules, better aesthetic appearance and improved tolerance to shading.
Recent interest in building integrated and other applications for PV beyond standard rooftop or ground-mounted modules, as well as concerns over the use of lead and improvements in electrically conductive adhesives, have led to renewed interest in the approach lately.
In October, Germany’s Fraunhofer Insititute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) introduced a new layout for shingled cells, developed in collaboration with interconnection equipment supplier M10, which it calls Matrix Shingle Technology. The approach sees cell strips laid out in staggered rows, similar to how bricks are placed in a wall. Fraunhofer ISE claims that this leads to higher module efficiencies and even better shading tolerance, and is now setting about evaluating the technology’s performance in various installation scenarios.
The institute’s latest work, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, demonstrates that Matrix shingled modules offer a significant advantage in certain shading conditions. The institute conducted lab experiments for various shading scenarios by partially covering modules with black sheeting and then testing them in a solar simulator.
Where shade moves diagonally across a module, and in conditions with random shading, the Matrix modules were shown to perform significantly better. Under diagonal shading, the group recorded up to 73.8% power increase, and under random shading as much as 96.5% more power, compared to a state-of-the-art shingled module using the standard stringing approach.
The group explained that its approach allows more electric current to flow out of the module, without being blocked by shaded areas. “This is caused by currents bypassing the shaded area via the busbar metallization crosswise to the normal current flow. “Besides higher power outputs, this leads to significantly less MPPs where reverse biasing of parts of the module increases the risk of hotspot occurrence.”
While shingled modules are already known to be less susceptible to hotspots thanks to better heat dissipation through the touching cells, the group also found a 40% reduction in the chance of parts of the module being bypassed, leading to an even lower chance of hotspots forming.
The ISE scientists further note that they expect the increased current extraction to improve energy yields for modules in power plant applications that would not have to deal with shading, although they would have to do further work to demonstrate this.
Fraunhofer ISE previously stated that it has a prototype production line for Matrix shingled cells up and running in Freiburg, and now adds that it sees the technology as particularly interesting for building or vehicle integrated PV, and other applications where frequent shading would be inevitable. “Huge potentials for solar power generation meet a huge variety of irregular shading conditions, making shading tolerance a very important aspect,” they conclude. “Above this, matrix modules fulfill other requirements like a highly aesthetic appearance without losing power due to, for example, coloring or printing patterns on the front sheet.”

The trackers were sourced via an Ideematec partnership with Eco Engineering, LightEdison, and Source Renewables. Ideematec’s products were chosen for their resilience in withstanding upstate New York’s extreme weather environments, streamlined installation process, and bankability, according to Osea Nelson, partner at LightEdison.
The trackers feature a two-in-portrait (2P) configuration. Historically, 2P trackers have struggled to mitigate challenges like vortex shedding and torsional galloping, phenomena that occur at lower wind speeds. At greater wind speeds, the trackers face strain from the increased surface area of the 2p configuration. The greater surface area of the orientation and increasingly-larger modules make wind effects even more pronounced.
The companies will first deploy a 25 MW portfolio of community solar projects in National Grid’s service area, all to be registered under New York’s NY-Sun program. The NY-Sun program focuses on funding distributed generation projects and increasing New Yorkers’ access to the benefits of solar energy.
In the last two years, New York has made large community solar capacity additions. According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the state added 549 MW of community solar capacity in 2020, leading the nation. More than 90% of the state’s 2.7 GW NY-Sun incentive-awarded, two-year development pipeline of projects are community solar, comprising more than 800 projects.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the next five years will see the U.S. community solar market add more than 4 GW of total capacity.
Eco Engineering/LightEdison will lead the portfolio’s procurement efforts as a joint venture in partnership with Source Renewables.

The deals cover construction financing, tax equity, land financing, and portfolio-level term debt.
The closings will allow San Francisco-based Intersect to execute on 2.2 GWdc of late-stage solar projects with 1.4 GWh of storage that will be in operation by 2023. The portfolio includes Athos III, Oberon I, and Oberon II in California, and Lumina I, Radian, and Lumina II in Texas.
The arrangements include $1.4 billion of portfolio-level, term debt funding provided by HPS Investment Partners and Co-Investors, along with existing Intersect investors CarVal Investors, Generate and Climate Adaptive Infrastructure.
Bank of America and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as co-lead arrangers and structuring agents on the term debt placement. The term financing facility incorporates structuring and pricing provisions designed to account for the higher proportion of uncontracted revenue in the portfolio. Proceeds from the term facility will support both construction and operation of the portfolio.
The roughly $800 million in construction financing will fund construction of Intersect’s 310 MWdc + 453 MWh BESS Athos III Project in Riverside County, California, east of Los Angeles, and 415 MWdc Radian Project in Brown County, Texas, southwest of Fort Worth.
The five-lender financing was led by co-coordinating lead arrangers, MUFG and Santander Bank, N.A. The group also included KeyBanc Capital Markets, CoBank, and Helaba as Joint Lead Arrangers. The Athos III and Radian projects are under construction and will come online in late 2022.
Intersect also lined up roughly $400 million of commitments from tax equity investors, including Bank of America (for Radian) and Morgan Stanley Renewables (for Athos III). Intersect also executed an offtake structure with Merrill Lynch Commodities to hedge the Radian project.
In July, Intersect Power named Signal Energy as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm for two solar projects totaling 728 MW in Texas and California. The projects will use the NX Horizon smart solar trackers and TrueCapture yield optimization software from Nextracker.
The 415 MW Radian project in Texas and the 313 MW Athos III project in California are expected to begin construction later this year, and will enter service in 2022. Series 6 photovoltaic solar modules will be supplied by First Solar for both projects.
The projects are the second set of utility-scale solar projects that Nextracker and Intersect Power have worked on together in the two states. The earlier portfolio of five projects is under construction, and has a combined installed capacity of more than 1.7 GW. Signal Energy was the EPC firm on three of the five.
Both Radian and Athos III will use Nextracker’s TrueCapture tracker optimization and control software to capture additional energy gain during diffuse light conditions. The technology continuously refines the tracking algorithm of each individual solar array in response to existing site and weather conditions. Nextracker said the software can deliver energy gains from 2-6%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/18/landfills-could-host-more-than-60-gw-of-solar-rmi-says/,"COMMUNITY,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 18, 2021","Landfills could host more than 60 GW of solar, RMI says","The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)  released a report, The Future of Landfills Is Bright, that offers a guide to considering the value of solar power installed on landfills. The report indicates that more than 63 GW of solar power plant capacity could be located at less than half of U.S. landfills, generating 83 terawatt hours of electricity each year across all 50 states.
The plants also could generate more than than $6.6 billion annually in electricity revenue.
The report offers guidance to local jurisdictions for how to take advantage of these resources, including the considerations that must be taken when building on landfills, as well as how to create a financially viable marketplace for the sale of the solar electricity. It covers several necessary bureaucratic structures, and provides guidance on collecting the data necessary for siting projects on landfill.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, around 428 MWac of utility scale (greater than 1 MWac) landfill solar across 126 projects had been installed at the end of 2019. Notably, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are home to 73% of all U.S. utility-scale landfill solar projects.

Roughly speaking, if the projects cost $1.50 per watt to construct, it would cost a little less than $95 billion to build out the capacity that the RMI report envisions. Municipal electricity cooperatives could sell the electricity directly, or community solar programs might buy it, for 8¢/kWh, generating the $6.6 billion in first year revenue.
If the facilities were owned and managed by third parties, and the land was leased by municipalities at $1,000 per acre, then around $217 million a year in revenue could flow to the hosting jurisdictions.
Landfill sited solar capacity would nearly double the Biden administration’s goals to grow community solar sevenfold in five years, while increasing total U.S. solar power capacity by about 58% from 108 GWdc, the capacity reached at the end of the second quarter of 2021.

The report cited a lack of data: The RMI authors were able to locate public information on only 43% of the nation’s 10,000 closed landfills. Naturally, the report’s first recommendation is to broadly collect information about the remaining sites. Of course, once more information is collected, it must also be made available. 
In order to assess the total potential of landfill solar, each site must provide key data. The site’s physical characteristics needed include the state of the landfill cap (the seal to keep the material in), settlement history, site grade, existing infrastructure and operations, on-site electricity demand data, as well as community concerns.
For those jurisdictions hoping to crunch their own numbers, RMI made available the criteria it used to develop its model for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. RMI estimates that solar could utilize 70% of the landfill land area considered, with a solar panel capacity of 9.5 watts per square foot.
Using the U.S. Department of Energy’s PVWatts calculator, both standard and premium panels were assessed and averaged together. The system was designed to be fixed, tilted at 20 degrees, with an azimuth of 180. Inverter efficiency was a realistic 96%, system losses 14%, and the DC to AC ratio was set at 1.2.

To calculate the potential employment opportunities generated by the construction, RMI assumed 11 jobs per megawatt, a figure borrowed from NREL’s JEDI modeling and ILSR’s Equitable Community Solar report from 2020.
Of course, once these pieces of land are recognized and deemed viable for solar projects, the most important piece of the equation will be ensuring that the billions of dollars invested in landfill solar projects have a chance to earn a fair return on the investment.
The report points out that in Massachusetts, certain regions included under the state’s SMART solar program have completely sold out. The program includes bonus incentives for building solar on landfill sites that have above average expenses.
Other RMI suggestions include equitable community solar program designs that take into account the local population when defining labor requirements, as well as local electricity savings. Another technique is to allow the landowning jurisdiction to make use of the electricity via net metering and remote net metering policies. These tend to produce the most efficient financial transactions.
The U.S. will need somewhere between 1,000 to 2,000 GW of solar power to electricity our transport and clean our power grid. Making full use of the 10,000 closed landfills across the nation to generate 10% of our electricity makes good sense.
