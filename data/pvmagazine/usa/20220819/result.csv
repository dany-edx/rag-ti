The utility plans a 6 MW site as part of a larger 50 MW solar portfolio.
Coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal for electricity, is the second largest waste stream behind household trash. It contains toxic chemicals like arsenic and lead and is generally buried in a processing landfill. This facility had been using the ash to produce cement and bury toxic materials in a landfill.
FirstEnergy subsidiary Mon Power will construct the solar facility on the 27 acre site. Another solar facility will be built on a 44-acre reclaimed coal strip mine property.
Mon Power and Potomac Edison are accepting applications to subscribe to a utility-run “community” solar program. The program allows customers to purchase renewable energy credits representing the production of the solar facilities. The credits are used to offset utility bill costs.
Earlier this year, the largest solar project in the state’s history was announced, a 250 MW project to be placed on a former coal strip mining site. To date, the state only has 20 MW of solar installed, so this project will be a landmark in the state’s energy transition progress.

The project is set to be located 3,000-acres of what used to be the Hobet surface mine site in southern West Virginia, according to project officials. Up to 300 workers are expected to be employed during construction, with the total project cost estimated to come in at around $320 million, which is considerably more than the $54 million in total solar investment in the state previously, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The solar array will be developed by Savion, while SEVA WV will lead other developments in a multi-phase project to revitalize the area of the former mine, with additional industry, lodging, hospitality, and recreation investments planned, including  80 miles of new trails as an extension of the Hatfield-McCoy ATV system.
In 2020, the state passed a bill that authorizes electric utilities to own and operate up to 200 MW of renewable generation facilities to help meet the state’s electricity needs. A statement said the addition of new renewable generation may encourage economic development, as a “growing number of companies” require that a portion of the electricity they buy be generated by renewable sources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/19/borrego-makes-its-first-major-push-into-utility-scale-om/,"MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 19, 2022",Borrego makes its first major push into utility-scale O&M,"The signing of two solar operations and maintenance (O&M) contracts for a pair of 50 MWac projects under construction in Ohio signals a new path for Borrego.
In May Borrego announced it was selling its development business to ECP, an energy transition-focused investor with an almost two decades-long reputation in the electricity, renewable and sustainable solutions sector. With it went Borrego’s project pipeline, which contained 8.4 GW of solar and 6.4 GW / 25 GWh of energy storage. ECP rebranded as New Leaf Energy and has continued to grow its presence in the solar and energy storage distributed generation (DG) space.
Now with the two deals signed, which are Borrego’s first utility-scale O&M contracts, the company now focuses on providing third-party O&M services for distributed generation and utility-scale solar plants, further establishing itself in the O&M and EPC market. Under the terms of the contracts, Borrego not only provide preventative and corrective maintenance, but will perform an unlimited amount of vegetation maintenance as well as aerial thermal inspection services. Borrego has also included a 98% availability guarantee for five years in conjunction with these services.
Borrego has upgraded its Operations Center to be North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) compliant and will be able to register as a NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Generator Operator (CIP-GOP). In addition, Borrego O&M continues to add dedicated staff who are focused on growing utility-scale sector portfolio.
“We are very excited to have the opportunity to operate and maintain these utility-scale projects in Ohio. Borrego‘s selection by one of the largest renewable IPPs in the world is a testament to the investments we have made in our O&M utility scale team and systems,” said Mike Hall, chief executive officer of Borrego. “The deals also reflect the recognition by our partners of the benefits of thinking strategically about O&M early in the project life cycle.”
The two Ohio projects are scheduled to reach their commercial operation dates in 2023, at which point Borrego O&M will begin operating the plants. The renewable energy developer and operator of the projects was not named.
Borrego currently manages the performance of over 1.6 GW and 1,050 solar operating assets, the majority of which were built by other EPCs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/19/historic-drought-and-heat-highlight-need-for-rooftop-solar-in-california/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 19, 2022",Historic drought and heat highlight need for rooftop solar in California,"Temperatures in central California are rising steeply, and the increased demand on the grid leads to increased blackouts. More solar power, particularly rooftop solar, can help alleviate this problem, said Environmental Working Group (EWG).
This week, the heat wave has been so intense that California Independent System Operator (CAISO) is requesting that utilities pause any maintenance projects between noon and 10:00 p.m. each day until temperatures drop. On August 14, demand on the grid reached a peak of 45,716 MW, forcing CAISO to set up rolling blackouts.
The intensifying climate is here to stay, but the management of energy for reliability can be improved, said EWG. EWG said state regulators failed to maintain and expand demand response programs that can reduce electricity usage.
The latest heat wave is leading to power supply challenges, highlighting a need for distributed rooftop solar. The drought has led to Lake Mead and Lake Powell to reach very close to “dead pool status,” meaning they may soon be at such a low water level that the hydroelectric dams nearby cannot operate. Under normal circumstances, the Hoover Dam can produce 2080 MW of hydropower, but recently its production has been cut almost in half, producing 1,076 MW.
Unfortunately, as conditions worsen, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) may be hampering the state’s ability to quickly dispatch rooftop solar. Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric want the CPUC to impose a monthly tax on rooftop solar customers, and cut financial incentives that make installing panels and batteries affordable to working-class homes.

Over 1.3 million homes and businesses have gone solar in the state, but if the utility-backed Net Energy Metering 3.0 goes through as proposed, solar will be financially out of reach for millions of families. As proposed, it will slow decarbonization efforts, limit the amount of local, reliable power, and take away personal choice from homeowners.
“The crippling heat waves and historic droughts are here to stay,” said EWG President and Bay Area resident Ken Cook. “These colliding crises should be more than enough reason for state regulators and Gov. Newsom to use every tool at their disposal to ease pressure on the grid.”
“California needs to provide residents with safe, affordable and abundant sources of electricity,” said Cook. “And it can start by rejecting the plot by PG&E and the other power companies to crush the state’s rooftop solar program.”
Analysis by Environment California found that rooftop solar could prevent the development of 148,000 acres of land. This is based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW of rooftop solar through 2045 in order to meet clean energy goals. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles that could be preserved versus a utility-scale-only model.
The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) reports the U.S. solar industry employs about 230,000 workers, and 68,000 or more are employed in California.

While the company has supplied batteries to the electric vehicle industry, ABS is announcing its new Energy Storage System division, branded ABS ESS. The division is unveiling both a new lithium-ion battery energy storage platform and a management control system.
TeraStor, the energy storage platform, is designed for large-scale energy storage projects. Factory assembled and tested, and it arrives on-site, ready for commissioning in just six hours, the company reports.
StorView is its Energy Management Suite of software and control hardware designed to to optimize the performance, market participation, and financial performance of TeraStor. The software has an easy-to-use interface that simplifies set-ups, controls, and operations.
“Leveraging our track record for driving battery energy innovation, and developing and testing new technologies and chemistries with our advanced engineering team, ABS again demonstrates our dedication in support of the energy transition,” said Subhash Dhar, chairman and CEO of American Battery Solutions, Inc. “There is a critical need for both hardware and software intended for stationary energy storage needs, especially following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which intends to fund so much utility-scale storage. We are confident that ABS ESS and its leadership team can bring our products to market and meet the growing demand for energy storage systems.”

ABS is backed by investment from KCK Group and acquired manufacturing and battery pack testing assets from Robert Bosch Battery Systems. The company has assembled a team with deep understanding of high-voltage, automotive-grade battery systems.
The new energy storage platform, TeraStor, was designed and developed by industry leaders Bud Collins, VP and GM, Michael Hoff, CTO, Greg Tremelling, VP of Product Development, and Rick Cwiakala, VP of Operations & Service, who have, collectively, deployed over 1.5 GWh of storage around the globe.
ABS reports that one of its goals is to take the complexity out of large-scale energy storage. TeraStor, which the company says is easy to purchase, install and operate, is engineered to optimize lithium-ion cell life and performance, while minimizing stranded cell capacity. ABS ESS secure online pre-sale sizing and configurators help determine how much storage is needed in a given application. ABS ESS also offers an in-person interactive training to help get the system up and running and to prepare the operator to respond to any contingency.
TeraStor offers more than 7.2 MWh of storage and 3.5 MW of integrated inverter capacity. The storage system is self-powered and requires no auxiliary AC infrastructure, ABS reports. It also features an integrated liquid cooling system, which the company says eliminates the need for on-site HVAC installation. With a reported 60% increase in energy density, ABS says that with TeraStor, ABS ESS can deploy an ultra-high density of 600 MWhs of energy per acre.
