Solar companies raised $34.3 billion in corporate funding last year – the largest amount in a decade, according to Mercom Capital Group’s latest report on funding and merger and acquisition (M&A) activity for the sector.
The overall figure accounts for 160 deals and represents a 42% year-on-year increase from 2022, when $24.1 billion was made across 175 deals.
Funding from private marketing financing reached $7.4 billion last year, a 45% increase from last year and the second highest figure since 2013. Meanwhile, solar companies raised $20 billion in debt financing, a 67% increase from last year and the highest amount in the last decade. Mercom Capital Group said securitization activity was a key contributor, with $3.4 billion in 11 deals.
Funding from solar venture capital activity was down 1% on last year, reaching $6.9 billion across 69 deals in 2023. From that figure, $4.7 billion (68%) went to 42 solar downstream companies. Solar companies raised $1.9 billion, balance of system companies raised $311 million and service providers raised $32 million.
Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu said investments into solar continue to defy expectations.
“Driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, the global focus on energy security, and favourable policies worldwide, solar continues to attract significant investments,” he said.
While funding activity was strong, M&A activity declined 25% year-on-year, with 96 corporate transactions in 2023, compared to 128 in 2022. The largest transaction was by Brookfield Renewable, which acquired Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale commercial renewables business in the United States for approximately $2.8 billion.
“Higher borrowing costs have put a damper on M&A transactions, with cautious investors biding their time for more favourable valuations,” Prabhu said. “Solar projects continue to attract interest, but high valuations and a lower risk appetite, compounded by unpredictable project completion timelines due to interconnection delays, labour shortages, and scarcity of components, have all contributed to a drop-off in project M&A activity.”
There were 231 large-scale solar project acquisitions in 2023, down from 268 deals in 2022. In 2023, almost 45.4 GW of solar projects were acquired in 2023, compared to 66 GW in 2022, down 31% year on year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/19/the-wild-side-of-rooftop-solar/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 19, 2024",The wild side of rooftop solar,"From pv magazine Global
In my experience, people who are interested in renewable energy also tend to enjoy nature. Many of us like birdwatching and spotting creatures in their natural habitat but there’s one place wildlife doesn’t belong: near our solar panels.
The biggest problem? Bird droppings.
Birds and other animals are attracted to solar arrays for a variety of reasons. Some like the shine or the shelter they provide, others enjoy the heat they radiate and many like all of those aspects.
As a result, solar panels can pull uninvited guests toward them like magnets. Not being tutored in proper manners, birds and other animals can defecate all over them. This waste is a big problem since it blocks the photovoltaic cells from accessing sunlight.
Indeed, of all the various kinds of dirt, dust, and debris that can fall on solar panels, one study concluded avian excrement has the most deleterious effect on performance. According to the paper, “Bird droppings accounted for about 46.42% to 89.18% of efficiency loss [in solar panels].”
This waste is also unpleasant to look at and if that’s not gross enough, when it is left to bake onto panels, it can cause permanent damage.
The natural movement of birds and animals can loosen panel wiring. When connections are compromised, it can have a negative effect on an entire system and efficiency can suffer. Squirrels also like to gnaw on the wires, for some reason known only to themselves.
Birds and other animals sometimes decide to build nests or burrows among solar panels. The new residents then constantly move around the system, increasing the risk of poor connections.
A build-up of nesting matter can also interfere with the panel ventilation. The empty space between a roof and the panels mounted on it, as well as between the panels, keeps systems cool. The accumulated material that comes with a bird or other animal infestation can lead a solar system to build up heat.
Electrical fires can result from damaged solar panels, and nests can serve as kindling for an even bigger blaze. With this in mind, bird nests and animal dens also constitute a fire hazard.
Moreover, just as high winds and storms can knock panels out of their brackets, so can the jostling of animals. As solar industry professionals know, the angle at which a panel is set is carefully chosen and depends on particular geographic locations, to maximize energy production. Installers measure this angle with pinpoint precision to ensure panel efficiency. Having a raccoon or other critter come along and push the panel out of position can undo much of that painstaking work.
There have even been cases of dangerous insects, such as hornets and wasps building hives in, under, and around solar panels, presenting an obvious risk to people and pets in the vicinity. Nobody wants to get stung and for those who are severely allergic to stings, just one could be potentially fatal.
The good news is that there are ways to dissuade birds and other animals from approaching your solar array. If they don’t dare go near it, they won’t choose to set up house there.
To frighten birds and other critters away from a solar system, the first thing any owner should do is keep their array immaculate. Regularly scheduled cleaning and maintenance, from professionals, is the best way to ensure this.
A predator decoy can also deter animals from moving in. While inert statues of owls and raptors can serve this purpose, in my experience many creatures will quickly detect they aren’t real and might even start using them as roosts themselves.
Technology that moves and appears lifelike is more effective. For instance, kites in the shape of a predator bird can be hoisted onto rods to fly in any breeze. Robotic birds that flap their wings and make other convincing movements are also available.
The more concerned you are with the presence of wildlife around your installation, the more you might want to consider adding audio components to your predator decoy. Soundtracks of attack cries scare animals away and can be pitched at a frequency that humans don’t hear.
In cases of infestation, more drastic measures may be necessary. For instance, after removing all traces of wildlife, system owners may want to put up netting to prevent critters from returning.
Since netting can be unsightly, and may interfere with panel performance, another solution would be to install an electric fence — the same kind of invisible barrier many dog owners use to ensure their pets don’t escape. If an animal crosses the barrier, they receive a minor electric shock that teaches them to stay away in future.
Spikes can also prevent birds from landing on a roof or near a solar array.
Permitting animals to roost in solar panels can cause a massive headache, which is why it’s best to address the issue before it occurs.
Keep wildlife where it belongs — in its natural habitat, rather than rooftop solar arrays.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/19/largest-solar-and-storage-project-in-u-s-activated/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 19, 2024",Largest solar and storage project in U.S. activated,"Terra-Gen and Mortenson have announced the activation of the Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, the largest solar and storage project in the United States. Mortenson served as engineering, procurement, and construction contractor for the project. 
The project is a true renewable energy behemoth, spanning 4,600 acres, comprised of 1.9 million U.S.-made First Solar panels. It holds a capacity of 875 MWdc solar, and nearly 3.3 GWh of energy storage. It has a 1.3 GW interconnection capacity. 
California’s grid is expected to receive enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 238,000 homes from the project. This leads to an estimated 320,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions abated annually. 
The energy storage is made up of LG Chem, Samsung, and BYD batteries. This feat of engineering required 98 miles of MV Wire, over 361 miles of DC wiring, and 120,720 batteries. 
Edwards & Sanborn is partially located on the Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County, California, a hub for many of the largest solar projects in the United Staes. It represents the largest public-private collaboration in U.S. Department of Defense history. Since 2020, over 1,000 craftworkers contributed to the project, and it was executed with more than a million hours of injury-free labor.
“Only in America can we take barren land, embrace the power of the sun, and create an engineering marvel,” said Brigadier General William Kale, Air Force civil engineer center commander. “So, take the time to reflect, see the great work that was done, and understand the significance of this project and what it can lead to. Hopefully, this is just the spark.”
The active project supplies power to the city of San Jose, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, the Clean Power Alliance, and Starbucks corporation, among others.
The project’s first phase added 346 MWac of solar modules and 1.5 GWh of battery storage. Financing for the the first phase was closed in 2021 and included $804 million senior secured credit facilities. This includes $400 million construction and term loan facility, a $328 million tax equity bridge facility, and a $76 million construction and revolving letter of credit facility. J.P. Morgan is providing the tax equity commitment for the initial phase of the project, with Deutsche Bank leading the construction and term financing.
In 2022, Terra-Gen closed a nearly $1 billion project financing for the second phase of the project. It included $460 million construction and term loan facility, $96 million construction and revolving credit facility, and a $403 million tax equity bridge facility. BNP Paribas, CoBank, U.S. Bank, ING, and Nomura led the funding.
In total, the two financing rounds for the project totaled over $1.7 billion.

Tandem PV, a San Jose, California-based startup company developing mechanically-stacked, four-terminal, perovskite-silicon modules, announced a $6 million venture funding round. The company, which was founded in 2016, said it will use the funds to accelerate towards commercialization, investing in research and development and plans for its first manufacturing facility.
The round was led by existing investor Planetary Technologies, an early-stage venture capital firm, joined by new compatriot investor Uncorrelated Ventures.
The new capital is a validation of the venture’s progress in terms of stability, power conversion efficiency, and module size, according to Tandem PV, CEO, Scott Wharton. “Everyone talks about durability and stability, but we are able to demonstrate it,” he told pv magazine.
“Our indoor tests are showing 80% performance after 25 years equivalent. The encapsulated tandem module’s power conversion efficiency is 26% with conventional PERC cells,” said Wharton, adding that the modules measure 100 cm2, with newer ones at 300 cm2.
The company did not provide more details about the module and cell technology.
Tandem PV is one of multiple teams using the U.S. Department of Energy’s PV Accelerator for Commercializing Technologies (PACT) for independent performance and reliability testing for all varieties of perovskite PV modules and mini modules, including field testing.
To date, the company has raised $27 million in venture capital and government support. It expects the latest financing round to help bring in customer agreements and to begin building the first plant. The next steps for this year are third-party validation of the performance metrics, specifically efficiency and durability, and to take part in outdoor testing programs.
The performance tests are the latest step that seven-year-old Tandem PV is taking toward commercializing its mechanically stacked panels. It has fabricated 100 cm2 panels which have passed IEC 61215 accelerated tests with academic partners, and has received initial data on passing triple-length duration IEC 61215 tests, as Colin Bailie, CTO, told pv magazine in a 2023 interview.
The initial application Tandem PV will target is utility-scale PV.

The company describes the MLPE Mount as a universal, cost-effective method for attaching module level power electronics (MLPE) directly to solar module frames. The MLPE Mount is designed to secure optimizers and microinverters along the underside of the module frame at desired locations. According to S-5!, this simplifies wire management and electrically bonds the equipment together to comply with grounding requirements.
The MLPE Mount can be used with most solar modules as well as with all S-5!’s solar attachments, including in rail-based installations or paired with the PVKIT rail-less solar mounting solution for direct attachment to metal roofs, S-5! reports. A tab feature makes it less likely for the mount to rotate during installation, enabling one hand to position the MLPE device on the frame, while the other hand tightens the bolt to secure it.
“We were looking for a simple and cost-effective way to quickly secure optimizers and microinverters to PV frames for rail-less solar installations,” said Ricardo Barroso, director of research and development at S-5! “With its unique teeth and tab design, S-5!’s MLPE Mount secures MLPE devices to module frames with ease without rotation; then penetrates anodization layers and embeds into the frame for superior grip, electric bonding, and grounding (earthing).”
The MLPE Mount, which is UL2703-certified, is designed for solar developers, EPCs, installers and end-users who are looking for an MLPE mounting device for solar module frames, without attaching to rails.
S-5! is exhibiting this week at Intersolar in booth 3027.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/19/epcs-and-solar-developers-share-top-5-concerns-and-opportunities/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RACKING,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 19, 2024",EPCs and solar developers share top 5 concerns and opportunities,"Unprecedented volatility. Materials shortages. Equipment pricing uncertainty. These dynamics set the pace in today’s solar sector. But reliable partnerships across the value chain can help alleviate some of these supply constraints for EPCs and developers.
We recently sat down with two of our partners to hear their thoughts about thriving in uncertain times. A Northeastern EPC with projects ranging from small engineering jobs to builds exceeding 100 MWs and an integrated developer with construction, ownership, and operation of DG, community, and storage projects in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.
Here they share their top five challenges and opportunities in today’s volatile market.
Top 5 challenges
1.Supply variability
Everyone talks about supply constraints. But according to our partners it’s the fluctuation in lead times, more than availability itself, that makes planning difficult. Procurement lead times can stretch four months overnight, trickling down to affect project interconnect schedules, delaying the start of energy production, and cascading down to erode margins and other financial targets.
Pandemic-related material shortages are still very much an issue, despite reports to the contrary in mainstream media. Trade conflicts between the U.S. and China also are creating pressure, aggravating polysilicon and battery cell supplies.
In some cases, construction of the racking equipment can create long lead times. Or quick material change orders to take advantage of new incentive opportunities like the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content requirements (DCR) might derail schedules. It’s at times like these that a trusted partner can navigate around supply risks to support a seamless experience.
Flexible partners who are ready to pivot when needed can make all the difference. The EPC offered one example when it changed its order to domestically source ground screws to take advantage of DCR tax credits. If a partner can make the shift quickly, it has negligible impact to the schedule. The shift saved the owner from the risk of missing their net energy billing deadline.
2.Materials price volatility
Today’s macroeconomic climate impacts all industries globally with stubborn inflation and ongoing market volatility. The recent 4% jump in the consumer price index affects everything and everyone. This marketplace variability burdens EPCs and developers as they seek to provide a firm, fixed price.
3. Constrained and costly interconnections
Across the board, everyone feels the pain of interconnection and grid reliability. Utilities are trying to transform an aging infrastructure with a patchwork of new lines to connect renewable energy generation capacity while maintaining safe power and still keeping costs down.
In some regions, interconnection queues span out years with resource-intensive feasibility studies, limited visibility into a project’s interconnection, and burgeoning costs. A regional cluster study for a new project pool can result in hundreds of millions of dollars in interconnection upgrades. These costs get allocated to each project — in some cases beyond what DG projects can bear. Some see socializing grid upgrades as a necessary evil that spreads the cost of infrastructure upgrades across all ratepayers, instead of leaving developers holding the entire bill.
4. Execution risks
EPCs tend to be more susceptible to construction risks. They have set schedules and are dependent on their vendors once a project is under construction. As a result, they rely on their partners for precise planning and execution support. A sub-contractor’s ability to deliver on a well-thought-out plan is a huge benefit if done well — or a major detriment if done poorly.
That means it’s crucial to find a seasoned partner with portfolio construction experience and the ability to organize multiple simultaneous projects seamlessly, including mobilizing production teams from one project to another. When the unexpected arises, that same partner must be adept at managing course corrections and work-arounds while maximizing everyone’s time.
“Contingency planning makes a good contractor,” explains our EPC partner.
5. Regulatory risks
Community solar and DG developers do not have the luxury of operating in a singular, national market. Instead, they must juggle a variety of constantly changing laws and regulations across 50 disparate states forming a complex maze of market norms.
Top 5 opportunities
To offset these market challenges, EPCs and developers are leaning more than ever on integrated partnerships to maximize value and profitability. Proactive problem solvers with a design-to-build approach across portfolios help create new opportunities for faster, smarter solar.
1.Solving problems for optimized constructability
EPCs and developers appreciate racking partners with the know-how to innovate new ways to optimize construction. It requires far more than just putting a foundation in the ground. Only in-the-field experience can take things like wire management, field tolerances, and table alignment into account to design the fastest, highest-quality installation possible. Problem solving is key to ensuring PV longevity. For example, how can additional subsurface galvanization ensure reliability across all environments? How can it be done most cost effectively?
“Once you work with a partner that anticipates your needs, you get the quality and safety that is of the utmost importance to us,” said our development partner.
2. Partnerships across portfolios
Portfolio partnerships that encompass developers, EPCs, and racking companies create significant advantages for all players, including pricing certainty and helping to leverage the cost of capital. Master sales agreements across portfolios help stabilize equipment supply risks. Some inventive racking partners are creating mechanisms to share risk with their customers through steel price hedging that is only possible with larger portfolio commitments.
But it’s more than that. When racking designers understand their customers’ long-term goals across project portfolios, additional value can be found through optimization, effectiveness, stability, and long-term quality.
Ultimately, successful owners look for partners who pay attention to details throughout every project across a portfolio.
3. Integrated racking and installation
Ground mount companies that install their own products have both the design and the construction mentality that EPCs and developers want. Having a broad variety of products allows flexibility to work on diverse sites with vastly different installation demands. There are unique advantages to being able to identify whether a site calls for driven piles or ground screws and then being able to deliver the best option quickly and cost effectively.
4. System quality
Racking companies that prioritize research, product development, and field testing for new and existing systems deliver the highest possible quality. For EPCs and developers, innovation is as much about field efficiencies for faster installations as it is about novel products.
Mounting vendors that take the time to have engineering and development teams meet with clients are able to keep on-site issues at the forefront, creating transparency and certainty around things like workmanship and overall warranty periods.
5. Partnership model
Strong partnerships are based on mutual understanding all along the value chain. It’s a two-way street: Vendors want to know what is important to their customers and customers want to know how to be a good partner in tough times as well as in good ones.
The most effective partnerships have a mutual understanding across functions and levels, aligning goals and mentalities through each phase of the project. When transparency and communication are built in on both sides of the organization, the true value of the partnership can be realized.

“America’s energy delivery infrastructure is critical to our overall national and economic security,” said David Crane, the DOE under-secretary for infrastructure. “This funding will drive the development of next-generation cyber technologies that keep our nation at the forefront of innovation while protecting our energy infrastructure from increasing cyber threats. This work could not be more important or timely as our nation transitions to the clean energy economy.”
The initiative will be funded by The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER), which is looking for ways to detect and mitigate cyber threats to DER. The DOE states that CESER will likely award ten proposals, each earning up to $3 million in federal funding. 
Topic areas include: 
This includes components, smart meters, sensors and control systems distributed across unprotected areas. The DOE suggests improving the ability to understand what systems were affected and how data was manipulated or stolen can help decrease the risk of an attack happening again. 
Examples include wind and solar generation technology and energy and battery storage systems. The DOE states that IBRs are becoming increasingly popular for cyberattacks, as hackers can infect a power grid through digital communication systems, according to research published by Washington State University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University USA. The report states that multiple electricity customers can experience long power cuts in severe cases. 
Ensuring secure communications between DERs, DERA and the electric grid at large is critical to guaranteeing grid stability. Potential risks for cyberattacks here could occur if a hacker leveraged ransomware to control several DERs or conducted a supply chain attack on an aggregator to manipulate the operation of DERs. 
As VPPs become more efficient and affordable, it’s essential to continue research, development and demonstration to reduce the cyber risk of hackers breaching these cloud-based systems.
According to DNV, an independent assurance and risk management provider employed in over 100 countries, energy is one of the top three industries reporting cyber attacks.
“Our research identifies ‘remote access to operation technology (OT) systems’ among the top three methods for potential cyber-attacks on the energy industry. We would urge the sector to pay greater attention to ensuring that equipment vendors and suppliers demonstrate compliance with security best practices from the earliest stages of procurement,” said Jalal Bouhdada, Founder and CEO at Applied Risk, an industrial cyber-security firm acquired by DNV in 2021.  
This funding opportunity aligns with the Investing in America Agenda, which intends to build resilient energy infrastructure capable of reaching U.S. 2030 and 2050 targets for clean energy and the climate.
