The acquisition of Spanish solar tracker maker STI Norland by Array Technologies saw net losses for shareholders in the US company almost treble in the second quarter.
Following a net loss of $5.5 million in April-June 2021, shareholders in New Mexico-based Array Technologies had to shoulder a $15 million hit in the second quarter of this year. In its April-June figures, released this week, Array Technologies said business from STI contributed $72.7 million to a quarterly revenue figure that more than doubled year on year to $425 million.
The Albuquerque-based manufacturer highlighted the importance of the passage of Biden‘s Inflation Reduction Act, which concerns clean energy and health care subsidies and measures to pay down the national deficit. The blocking of the original, more ambitious Build Back Better Act by Democrat Senator Joe Manchin (West Virginia) had prompted Array Technologies to predict that $240 million worth of its US solar-project related business would be threatened.
The expected passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – which would spend $369 billion combating climate change and incentivizing clean energy, and would extend the investment tax credit for solar by another 10 years – prompted Array Technologies to state that $240 million will now be safe, even if the projects concerned will not take shape this year.
“The Inflation Reduction Act, when passed, provides meaningful clarity on the long-term incentive structure for the solar industry including investments that aim to tackle climate change,” said Array Technologies CEO Kevin Hostetler. “This clarity allows participants to confidently make decisions on future investments, therein accelerating the adoption of solar energy.”
The company balance sheet published this week showed that its cash pile fell from $368 million at the end of last year to $51 million on June 30. But total assets rose over that period, from $1.14 billion to $1.78 billion, in part thanks to leaps in goodwill and other intangible assets. Liabilities rose from $975 million to $1.5 billion over the same period.
In November, pv magazine reported the STI Norland acquisition would cost Array Technologies €351 million ($360 million) in cash plus €13.9 million in company stock, with STI shareholders entitled to up to €55 million extra this year, based on the Spanish company’s gross earnings in 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/11/about-20-of-utility-scale-solar-capacity-was-delayed-in-the-first-half-of-2022/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 11, 2022",About 20% of utility-scale solar capacity was delayed in the first half of 2022,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said developers across the United States plan to install 17.8 GW of capacity this year. However, through six months, only 4.2 GW has been installed and brought online as module supply challenges led to cancellations and delays.
From January through June 2022, about 20% of planned PV capacity was delayed, said EIA. Reports show solar installations were delayed by an average of 4.4 GW each month, compared with average monthly delays of 2.6 GW during the same period last year. In most cases, reported delays are for six months or less.
In February, the US extended tariffs on imports of polysilicon solar goods from China and raised the tariff-rate quota from 2.5 GW to 5.0 GW. It also excluded bifacial panels from the extension of duties. In April, the Department of Commerce launched an anti-dumping circumvention investigation into solar goods imported from four Southeast Asian countries responsible for 80% of the nation’s polysilicon-based solar goods. This led to a great deal of uncertainty about the risk of tariffs, which then caused a tightened module supply and the delay of projects.
In June, President Biden took executive action to create a moratorium on solar tariffs related to the investigation, thereby clearing the uncertainty in the industry and advancing deployment in the nation. The administration also invoked the Defense Production Act to expand domestic production of solar goods. Any determination that Commerce makes on the anti-dumping investigation will apply after the 24-month moratorium, buying the industry time to deploy projects that were already planned.
EIA said it surveyed project developers and found most of the projects that will come online in the next 18 months are currently under construction. About 1.9 GW of solar capacity installations are projects currently under construction that have met delays but are still scheduled to come online in 2022; and another 1.7 GW under construction have been delayed to 2023.
Deployment is set to ramp up over the coming years as state and federal governments set ambitious climate and energy goals, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is expected to be enacted. Following analysis of the potential impact of the Act, Princeton University researchers said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The Act would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said Princeton. Annual US energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% in 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and industry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/11/dte-energy-to-add-650-mw-of-solar-energy-for-ford-motors/,"BATTERY,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,MICHIGAN",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 11, 2022",DTE Energy to add 650 MW of solar energy for Ford Motors,"DTE Energy, a Detroit-based diversified energy utility, will add 650 MW of new solar energy capacity in Michigan for Ford Motors by 2025. The purchase is a strategic investment in Michigan through DTE’s MIGreenPower program and is the largest renewable energy purchase ever made in the U.S. from a utility, based on according to BloombergNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2021.
“This unprecedented agreement is all about a greener and brighter future for Ford and for Michigan,” said Jim Farley, president and CEO, Ford Motor Company. “Today is an example of what it looks like to lead… to turn talk into action.”
Michigan is currently ranked 24th in the country for solar installations, receiving .64% of its electricity from its 927 MW installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The solar capacity to be added by DTE will increase the total amount of installed solar energy in Michigan by nearly 70%.
Two years ago Ford Motor Company announced its intention to achieve carbon neutrality globally by 2050, with interim targets set. With this 650 MW of solar installed, the company will be able to attribute all its electricity supply in Michigan to clean energy.
Ford is purchasing carbon-free electricity through DTE’s MIGreenPower program, which, to date, has more than 600 businesses enrolled, along with more than 62,000 residential customers. On an annual basis, MIGreenPower customers have enrolled 2.8 million megawatt hours of clean energy in the program, which has the environmental benefit equivalent to avoiding 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
“We want to congratulate Ford Motor Company for its environmental leadership and commitment to clean energy,” said Jerry Norcia, chairman and CEO, DTE Energy. “Ford was the first large industrial customer to enroll in our MIGreenPower program in 2019 and we thank Ford for its continued commitment to using MIGreenPower to help decarbonize its operations and meet its sustainability goals.”
DTE reports that since 2009 its investments in renewable energy have created more than 4,000 Michigan jobs. DTE estimates that the construction of the solar arrays will create 250 temporary jobs and 10 permanent jobs.
“I want to congratulate DTE Energy and Ford Motor Company for taking this significant step to increase our state’s solar energy production and to position Michigan as a leader in climate action,” said Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “Efforts like this are the reason Michigan had the best job growth for energy-sector jobs in the country last year, which will help to advance our state’s decarbonization goals, create good-paying jobs and strengthen our economy. As outlined in our state’s MI Healthy Climate Plan, we must take immediate, tangible steps to mitigate climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so we can achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. Steps like this collaboration between Ford and DTE are helping to move our entire state forward, building on our automotive legacy while protecting clean air and water for future generations.”
In addition to its goal of carbon neutral manufacturing, Ford has added clean energy models to its fleet, and building battery manufacturing facilities to ensure a steady supply. In 2021 the company announced a partnership with SK Innovation, saying they plan to invest $11.4 billion at two sites in Kentucky and Tennessee to produce electric F-Series trucks and the batteries to power future electric vehicles. A $5.6 billion facility in Stanton, Tennessee, called Blue Oval City, was also announced, with plans to serve as a vertically integrated system for Ford to assemble electric F-Series vehicles. It will include a battery plant, suppliers, and recycling.
In February of this year, Ford announced that it had teamed up with Sunrun to enhance home energy management, leveraging the substantial onboard battery capability of the Ford Lightning with Ford Intelligent Backup Power, to give customers the ability to use bidirectional power technology from their all-electric truck to provide energy to their homes during an outage, or to reduce their reliance on the grid when electricity prices are high.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/11/michigan-pledges-to-cover-over-1200-public-buildings-with-solar/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MICHIGAN,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 11, 2022",Michigan pledges to cover over 1200 public buildings with solar,"Consumers Energy and the State of Michigan have announced the two will partner to install rooftop solar arrays on 1,274 public buildings. Together, the distributed rooftop solar resources will add 68 MW of solar capacity to the power grid.
The State of Michigan made a 20-year agreement with the utility to use clean energy at state government buildings across all departments in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The solar arrays are expected to offset the annual carbon emissions equivalent of 20,000 cars.
“Consumers Energy and the State of Michigan are working together to power Michigan’s clean energy transformation,” said Garrick Rochow, Consumers Energy’s president and CEO. “This commitment will accelerate our already industry-leading Clean Energy Plan to develop carbon-free energy sources here in Michigan.”
Consumers Energy’s Clean Energy Plan, first approved in 2019, includes orders to close all its coal-fired plants by 2025 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. The utility plans to install 80 GW of solar by 2040, which would bring the utility’s operations to 90% emissions-free energy sources. It also plans for 550 MW of battery energy storage by 2040.
“Consumers Energy is able to deliver reliable and affordable energy while protecting the planet. This partnership will further support Michigan being a leader in clean energy,” said Rochow.
“As governor, I am proud that the State of Michigan is leading by example to reduce greenhouse gases, protect the planet, and lower energy costs. Today, we are proud to announce that Consumers Energy is joining BWL and DTE in an agreement with the State of Michigan to power state buildings with clean energy. This is a critical step that will help us reach the goal I proposed in 2020 to have all state buildings run on 100% clean, renewable energy by 2025. Let’s keep working together to fight climate change with common-sense steps that will lower taxpayer energy costs and ensure that state operations have the energy they need to succeed.” Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer
Earlier this year, General Motors agreed to power three Michigan production plants with 100% clean energy supplied by Consumers Energy. The automaker made a 20-year, 70 MW renewable energy power purchase agreement with the utility.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/11/pink-energy-files-lawsuit-against-generac/,"ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 11, 2022",Pink Energy files lawsuit against Generac,"Pink Energy, formerly Power Home Solar, LLC (PHS), filed a complaint on August 1 against Generac Power Systems, Inc. for selling what it calls “defective” parts and also for failing to “timely communicate” issues with the product. PHS estimates that Generac’s “faulty and defective component parts” cost PHS tens of millions of dollars in damages.
Pink Energy filed the complaint in the state of Virginia (Case 6:22-cv-00043-NKM) due to the large number of customer complaints and service calls in and around Lynchburg, Virginia and other parts of the Western District of Virginia.
The monetary damages noted in the complaint include costs and expenses for sending service technicians out on over 16,000 service calls to replace defective parts, at an estimated cost of over $1,000 per service call. Pink Energy has also had to hire additional customer service team members to field calls and perform service.
Pink Energy states that it has suffered harm to its reputation and goodwill due to the SnapRS product failure, pointing to an “overwhelming” number of negative reviews and complaints on social media, to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and elsewhere. For example, Pink Energy currently has an average rating of 2.02 on SolarReviews. In June the BBB had removed Pink Energy’s A+ rating an issued a consumer alert. The BBB website currently lists 1,057 complaints against Pink Energy.
Pink Energy estimates that it has lost approximately $155,000,000 in revenue from appointment cancellations and increased cancellations of signed contracts, and that the company had been valued at $1.05 billion in September of 2021, prior to the product issues, but that has dropped to $452 million “as a direct and proximate result of the harm Generac’s defective products have caused…”
pv magazine usa reached out to Pink Energy, which declined to comment as the complaint has been filed and the case is pending. However, in an internal letter to Pink employees that was leaked to the internet, Jayson Waller, CEO of Pink Energy said, “One of the most regrettable realities of this entire situation is that our valuable customers have blamed Pink Energy for this unfortunate situation, rather than Generac.”
Pink Energy points to the defective SnapRS as the crux of the problem but says they have been “exacerbated by Generac’s delays” in developing a replacement and delays in supplying a sufficient number of replacements to meet Pink Energy customer needs.
The complaint states that Generac “represented to” Pink Energy that its PWRcell solar and battery storage system could serve as a full-service solar energy and battery storage system for Pink Energy’s customers, indicating that the electrical components were “safe and fit for the purpose for which they were intended”. The complaint also states that Generac represented that it was “experienced and skilled in designing and manufacturing such products”.
Generac and Pink Energy entered into an agreement by which Generac designed and manufactured its PWRcell system to incorporate electrical components to be used in residential solar energy system. Generac’s PWRcell system includes PV Link String Inverters, SnapRS components and more. The SnapRS is an inline disconnect device designed to rapidly shut down power to individual solar panels, as required by the National Electrical Code.
According to the complaint, in 2021 “PHS discovered a melted SnapRS unit during a service call…”. When Pink Energy informed Generac, Generac said it had not previously known of “any such issues related to is SnapRS units ‘melting’”. Pink Energy contends that Generac knew or should have known because other installers were experiencing high rates of failure with the SnapRS connectors.
After two fires occurred at homes with Pink Energy solar that used the SnapRS unit, Generac provided a firmware upgrade, which Pink Energy said was not received by “a significant number” of its customers because their systems were not connected to the internet, despite Generac having what the complaint says is “knowledge of the same”.
In late 2021, Pink Energy customer complaints increased. Upon investigation the company traced the problems to what the Generac inverter coded as a “PVRSS Lockout” system error. In the complaint, Pink Energy noted a “drastic increase” in customer service calls as well as service visits they scheduled to “replace customers’ defective SnapRS units and to clear PVRSS Lockouts.”
Despite Generac providing the SnapRS 801A, which the complaint says Generac represented as a “fix” to the product defect, Pink Energy contends that “Generac knew or should have known” that the defects continued.
The complaint states that Generac acknowledged a 50% failure rate and “incredibly” implied to Pink Energy that it was positive news because it was not 100% failure. Two months ago, Generac’s CEO responded to an email about continued incidents and, according to the complaint, noted that the latest firmware protection was an “interim solution”. Pink Energy contends that it had been a year since the firmware upgrade had been issued and this was the first it had heard that the firmware upgrade was intended to be interim.
In May 2022, in a letter sent to Pink Energy customers and signed by Keith Marett, president-services for Generac Clean Energy Solutions, he acknowledges that customers have had issues with the SnapRS801 or 801A and says that to address the issues Generac is introducing “our next-generation rapid shutdown device, the new SnapRS802, which has been designed and engineered to the highest safety and reliability standards”.
pv magazine USA reached out to Generac and received the following responses from Tami Kou, director of marketing communications and public relations:
“We are disappointed by the allegations being made by Power Home Solar, which was recently re-branded as Pink Energy.  We have taken notice of recent news reports and articles citing customer concerns with Pink Energy’s marketing practices and service support. We expect all our independent dealers and distributors to act with integrity and meet high standards in providing customer services.” She added that “Generac stands behind our products. As a company, we have and will continue to honor our customer commitments. We can’t comment on pending litigation. We will be reviewing the matter and intend on vigorously defending ourselves.”
 
The eleventh paragraph was amended to correctly name Generac as the party that the complaint said had “knowledge of the same”.
