It is the company’s largest asset acquisition to date and is also the largest solar facility on the island, providing about 6% of the grid’s electricity demand.
The 120,000 solar panel project, called Dandan, has been in operation since October 2015 and serves its generation to Guam Power Authority. The project, large enough to power roughly 10,000 homes, avoids the emission of nearly 40,000 tons of carbon annually into the atmosphere. The project is estimated to offset the consumption of almost two million barrels of residual fuel oil and diesel throughout its lifecycle. It created about 300 local jobs during construction.
Fossil fuel prices are volatile in Guam, and the solar facility helps provide stable-priced clean energy. Guam passed a renewable portfolio standard in 2019, requiring the nation to achieve 50% renewable energy supply by 2035 and 100% by 2045.
“This acquisition affirms CleanCapital’s commitment to making bold investments in the energy transition, especially in regions like the Pacific Islands that are taking advantage of their natural resources to achieve independence from fossil fuels,” said Julia Bell, chief commercial officer at CleanCapital.
As part of the acquisition, CleanCapital will also attain the rights to GlidePath’s development pipeline on the island. “We are thrilled to be the new owner-operator of this significant project and to accelerate the exciting future of renewables on Guam,” said Bell.
K&L Gates and Arthur Clark served as buyer’s counsel on the transaction, and GlidePath was represented by Morgan Lewis, Bockius, LLP, Razzano Walsh, Torres P.C. as seller’s counsel. 
CleanCapital is a commercial asset owner focused on accelerating the energy transition through strategic investments in middle-market solar and energy storage. It has invested more than $900 million to date in projects and companies that align with that mission. In April, the company announced a $300 million commitment from Manulife. The investor has acquired projects totaling more than 360 MW spanning 24 states and one US territory.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/25/researchers-aim-to-scale-organic-semitransparent-pv-manufacturing-for-windows/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MICHIGAN,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 25, 2022",Researchers aim to scale organic semitransparent PV manufacturing for windows,"University of Michigan researchers announced in a Joule magazine post that they have achieved a new technique for manufacturing efficient semitransparent solar cells. The cells are intended to be built inside panes of window glass, turning passive buildings into active energy producers.
Organic solar cells can be transparent, unlike their opaque counterparts in traditional silicon-based solar cells. Silicon cells are widely used for their durability and efficiency advantages, but recent advances from the Michigan lab have achieved efficiencies around 10% and estimated lifetimes of up to 30 years in organic solar cells.
The team set forth to make the semitransparent cells manufacturable at scale. A key hurdle was creating the micron-scale electrical connections between individual cells that comprise a solar module. Conventional methods use lasers for this patterning process, but the laser would cause damage to organic light absorbers.
The solution the Michigan team arrived at is a multi-step peel-off patterning method that achieves micron-scale resolution. Thin films of plastic are deposited and patterned in extremely thin strips. Then the organic material and metals are layered in. Finally, the researchers peel off the strips, creating very fine electrical interconnection layers between the cells.
In the process, eight semitransparent solar cells were connected, each 4 cm x 0.4 cm and separated by 200µm-wide interconnections, to create a single 13 cm squared module. The achieved module achieved efficiency of 7.3%, about 10% less than the individual cells. This material is 50% transparent, making it a good fit for commercial windows. Higher transparency is likely needed for the residential market, though the researchers said that is easy to achieve with organic solar cell material.
The team said its goal is to develop a 50% transparent cell with 10% to 15% efficiency, which Michigan professor Stephen Forrest said will likely be achieved within a few years. “The research we are doing is derisking the technology so that manufacturers can make the investments needed to enter large scale production,” he said. “In principle, we can now scale semitransparent organic solar cells to two meters by two meters, which brings our windows much closer to reality.”
Buildings account for about 40% of global carbon emissions. Buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) like this technology under development are an effective way to bring energy production closer to the point of demand, mitigating the amount of grid infrastructure that needs to be built to support the building’s needs.
The University of Michigan has applied for patent protection and is seeking partners to bring the technology to market. The research was supported primarily by the US Department of Energy, as well as by Universal Display Corporation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/25/california-governor-sets-goal-of-3-million-climate-ready-homes-6-million-heat-pumps-by-2030/,"MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 25, 2022","California governor sets goal of 3 million climate-ready homes, 6 million heat pumps by 2030","California Governor Gavin Newsom sent a letter to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) outlining the new targets for climate-resilient housing. CARB is the lead agency in California for climate change programs and oversees all air pollution control efforts in the state.
In the midst of a heat wave that is gripping almost the entire United States, Newsom hopes to expand access to cooling in homes by setting a target of 3 million climate-ready and climate-friendly homes by 2030 and 7 million homes by 2035, of which 50% or more will be low-income and environmental justice communities – and 6 million highly-efficient electric heat pumps.
“The heat wave gripping the nation this week is further proof that as California warms, all households need access to affordable and efficient cooling to stay safe. We applaud the Governor’s leadership in directing his agency to provide low-income households with heat pump cooling systems, and for establishing a healthy home goal,” said Jose Torres, California director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition. “Done in collaboration with the most affected communities, these holistic climate upgrades will protect California’s working families – especially our most vulnerable residents – from extreme weather, and will keep them healthy, safe, and resilient.”
The Building Decarbonization Coalition and its partners are pushing for investments of at least $1.2 billion for healthy homes, $1 billion for community resiliency centers, and $500 million for school facility upgrades in the California budget, which will be finalized in August.
Throughout most of this month, 28 states, extending from California to New Hampshire, are under “excessive heat warnings and heat advisories,” according to the National Weather Service. Climate-resilient housing and the use of heat pumps for cooling as well as heating can bring relief to Californians facing extreme heat and high energy costs. Implementing Newsom’s plan can also spur domestic manufacturing and increase installation jobs. The new goals will also cut the carbon that’s creating climate pollution and fueling hotter temperatures.
“This landmark directive signals California’s commitment to its climate goals and provides substantial benefits to households and communities struggling with energy, affordability, and extreme heat burdens. Critical to Governor Newsom’s action is his May budget revise, which will provide a down payment to accomplish these goals,” stated Panama Bartholomy, executive director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/25/sanyo-settles-solar-delamination-lawsuit-lawyers-win-big/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 25, 2022","Sanyo settles solar delamination lawsuit, lawyers win big","A class action lawsuit filed against Sanyo and Panasonic was settled last year with the ruling coming down to the solar panels not generating the electricity as projected, due to a physical defect. The panels were manufactured and sold by Sanyo, but later settled by Panasonic via the class action lawsuit in 2019.
The lawsuit suggests that a series of Sanyo solar panels would delaminate on the front side of the solar panel, greatly affecting the electricity generation. The law firm’s press release notes:

The solar panels in question are the model series HIP-xxxBA2, BA3 and BA5. A specification page of the HIP-XXX-BA3 series can be found here. The specification page notes its copyright date is August 10, 2006.
The lawsuit’s website hosts several documents, but the filings note that since the settlement happened behind closed doors, there are no details on the discussions that took place or facts that were revealed. The only technical information describes when delamination counts, and doesn’t count.
Solar panels must show visible “delamination” in order to be eligible for payment under the settlement. This includes one or more adjacent sections of circular delamination where each section is 25 mm or greater and was not caused by external damage. Linear or dot delamination is not covered by the settlement.
To receive benefits, a claim must be received either prior to December 31, 2029 or no more than twenty years after having purchased the solar panels. Panasonic, who owned the Sanyo product line at the time of the suit, can choose to either pay solar module buyers a prorated depreciated dollar amount (based on the original purchase price), or replace the solar panels with new or refurbished products.
Multiple references suggested that the solar panels cost about $700 each when originally sold.

One fact is completely transparent, and that’s who made money from this class action suit. The plaintiff, Richard Ziccarello, the individual who represented the class action lawsuit, was awarded $5,000. Richard can also submit for a refund on the damage to his own solar panel system.
The law firm representing Richard was awarded $1.745 million in attorneys fees and costs.
This was amended on July 27, 2022 as the lawsuit had been settled previously. The information was obtained from topclassactions.com.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/25/first-solar-receives-order-from-akuo-for-500-mw-of-advanced-thin-film-modules/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 25, 2022",First Solar receives order from Akuo for 500 MW of advanced thin film modules,"Akuo, a Paris-headquartered global renewable energy producer and developer, placed an order for 500 MW of First Solar thin film solar modules. Under the agreement, First Solar will supply 200 MW for a utility-scale project developed by Akuo in the United States, with delivery scheduled for the first half of 2024. The remaining modules are expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, potentially for projects in Europe or other regions.
As a renewable energy developer, Akuo has a presence in 15 countries, including the United States, Spain, Greece, and Portugal. At the end of 2021, Akuo had 1.4 GW of assets in operation or under construction and a project development pipeline of over 7 GW. The agreement with First Solar leverages First Solar’s agile contracting approach, allowing Akuo to benefit from the evolution of First Solar’s advanced cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film module technology platform over the span of the agreement.
“The solar industry operates against a backdrop of volatility and uncertainty, and this agreement is part of a broader effort to reduce the long-term supply risks of our global portfolio to actually deliver our projects,” said Eric Scotto, chief executive officer of Akuo. “First Solar’s ability to provide supply chain traceability and its commitment to responsible manufacturing was crucial to us. It leads the industry with its long history of establishing benchmarks in supply chain transparency and the low environmental footprint of its technology, all of which reflects our shared value of responsible business practices. As a European player, we are strongly committed to these values echoing our ambition for the planet.”
Last August, First Solar broke ground on its third manufacturing facility in Ohio. The new 3.3 GW facility is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2023 and represents a $680 million investment. When it is fully operational, the facility is expected to scale the company’s northwestern Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GW, which would make it the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complex outside of China.
A recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) calls for diversifying the global supply chain in order to meet climate goals. One of the downsides in using solar products manufactured in China has been the amount of carbon used to produce products for use in generating clean energy. And for installations outside of China, transportation adds to the cost and total emissions. The report also points to supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, and recommends that countries increase resilience by making the investments needed to boost domestic manufacturing. The IEA report estimates that new solar manufacturing facilities along the supply chain could attract $120 billion in investment by 2030. In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023.
“We’re pleased to welcome Akuo to a growing number of long-term strategic partnerships with experienced global developers that have placed their trust in First Solar and our technology,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer, First Solar. “Developers in Europe are recognizing the risks associated with having a geographically concentrated solar supply chain and are electing to take a long-term approach to supply diversity and security by working with us. Our differentiation rests as much on our ability to help our customers navigate volatility and uncertainty as our technology.”
First Solar recently announced other large orders from solar developers including a  2 GW order from National Grid, a 4 GW order from Silicon Ranch, a 1.5 GW order from SoftBank subsidiary SB Energy Global, and a commitment from Lightsource bp and bp to procure 5.4 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/25/industrial-process-for-mobile-solar-module-recycling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 25, 2022",Industrial process for ‘mobile’ solar module recycling,"From pv magazine global
Flaxres says it has transferred its proprietary technology to an industrial process, and is bringing its pilot solar panel recycling system to market.
The basis for the breakthrough was a successfully completed mass test with the recycling of 7.5 tons of solar modules in the “Flaxthor” production plant, it added. According to Flaxres, more than 200 kg of silicon and 4 kg of silver were recovered, as well as 4.9 tons of glass of the highest quality. The site in Dresden has a potential recycling capacity of more than 1,000 tons per year.
The new site serves purely as a development location, a Flaxres spokesperson told pv magazine. There, the pilot production plant with a maximum capacity of 10 tons per day will be operated to test new and optimized process steps for full automation. The company its pilot plant achieves a cycle time of 10 seconds per module.
Based on this prototype, Flaxres wants to develop mobile equipment that will fit into a shipping container and be rented to customers, he said. “A full-scale stationary plant is rather counterproductive. The issuance of the operating license is advised for the end of 2022,” the Flaxres spokesman added. The plan, he said, is to begin constructing these new “Flaxthor” plants in 2024, and to have them available to customers by 2025.
According to the Flaxres spokesperson, several contracts have already been signed with customers operating internationally. “However, the plants will not be sold, but only leased on a monthly basis with our personnel.” He also said that 100% of the total recycling capacity of the five new plants has already been allocated for 2024.
The plants are suitable for both crystalline and thin-film modules, and can process modules with damaged glass panes. All modules are separated into their main components with a low energy input. The materials recovered are of high quality due to the separation process developed and can thus enable a genuine recycling economy. The company does not rely on chemicals for its recycling process, it added.
The quantities of solar modules generated annually for recycling are still rather small. By 2030, however, a quantity of around 400,000 tons of these solar modules is expected for Germany alone, according to Flaxres. This corresponds to a number of about 20 million individual modules, and many companies and researchers are working on efficient recycling processes.
