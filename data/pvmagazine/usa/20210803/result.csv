The company said it expects volume and margin improvements in its residential business to continue into the third quarter, with volume expected to grow more than 40% compared with 2020.
SunPower also said that during the second quarter it grew its single- and multi-family new homes backlog by 10% from the first quarter to more than 220 MW. It said demand remains high for its SunVault residential storage product with attach rates of 23% in its direct sales channel. The company said it expects SunVault growth to accelerate in the second half given that lead times have returned to normal.
Residential gross margin for the quarter was 23%. That was up 160 basis points from the first quarter and more than 600 basis points year over year. The increase was primarily driven by a lower cost of capital, by supply chain initiatives, and by an ongoing shift from component sales to higher margin full-system sales, which totaled more than 55% of residential installations for the quarter.
The company reported second quarter GAAP revenues of $308.9 million. That was up from $306.4 million in the first quarter and $217.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. It reported GAAP net income of $75.2 million. That was up from a loss $48.4 million in the first quarter and a positive $55.9 million a year earlier.
The results translated to net income of $0.40 a share, up from $(0.28) in the first quarter, and $0.31 in the second quarter of 2020.
SunPower’s CEO Peter Faricy said the company made progress during the second quarter on a number of initiatives to expand its market, including increasing its dealer footprint, expanding its financial platform to include loan servicing, and announcing a strategic alliance with Wallbox. Faricy said the alliance will enable SunPower to offer residential customers a “simple and cost effective integrated solar, storage and EV solution” that will lower energy costs while reducing strain on the grid.
During the second quarter the company’s commercial and industrial business posted a roughly 30% increase in megawatts recognized year over year, bringing the segment’s total installed base to 1 GW. The business segment increased its backlog by 20% year over year and finalized an agreement with California Resources Corp. to develop up to 45 MW of behind-the-meter solar projects.
The company said that demand for its Helix BTM storage solution remained high. It said it now has more than 35 MWh installed and a pipeline in excess of 230 MWh.
Additionally, the company said it is seeing continued success in its front-of-the-meter storage initiatives with more than 20 MWh currently under contract and a pipeline in excess of 500 MWh. The company said its community solar pipeline is now more than 150 MW.
SunPower said it continued to make progress toward its goal of lowering its cost of capital to 5.5%, while also continuing to invest in digital and product initiatives to reduce customer acquisition costs.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, SunPower said it expects volume and margin improvements in its residential business with volume expected to grow more than 40% versus 2020.
The company said it expects third quarter GAAP revenue of $325 to $375 million, GAAP net loss of $10 to $0 million, and megawatts recognized of 125 MW to 150 MW.
For fiscal year 2021, the company said expects GAAP revenue of $1.41 to $1.49 billion, GAAP net income of $40 to $60 million, and megawatts recognized of 540 MW to 610 MW. Residential megawatts recognized are expected to be in the range of 340 MW to 380 MW.

The company now is seeking approval to add another 60 MW of storage, bringing the total to 110 MW in batteries.
Invenergy asked the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) to reopen its decision in May. The PSC is now accepting public comments on the proposal as part of its environmental analysis of the project.
In its application, Invenergy said the impact to the MISO grid by integrating a battery energy storage system at Paris Solar Energy Center will be positive. It said the storage system can act as an “electrical suspension” system for the grid, to smooth abrupt ups and downs in solar production that can occur on partly cloudy days. The battery system can furnish other grid services such as frequency response, voltage support, and output scheduling to potentially shift some afternoon production to later in the day, if needed, to correspond with peak demands, said Invenergy.

The Paris Solar Energy Center, to be located south of Milwaukee, would produce enough power for 60,000 homes and would be among the largest proposed in the state of Wisconsin.
WEC Energy Group, parent company of utilities WE Energies, and Madison Gas and Electric filed a joint application in February to buy the Paris Solar Park for roughly $426 million. The companies are requesting to spend up to 10% more than that figure, and the acquisition process is still underway.
The solar array will feature between 550,000 to 750,000 solar panels rating between 350-550W, and Invenergy is selecting panels from a list that includes Canadian Solar, Hanwha Qcells, JA Solar, Jinko, Longi, Risen, SunPower, and Trina.
Invenergy secured the contracts for more than 2,500 acres of land. Initial designs call for the solar arrays to use 1,400 acres for the array, spacing, fencing, and access roads. The project is scheduled to reach commercial operation in the spring of 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/03/a-look-at-the-forces-working-against-distributed-solar-part-1-national-actors/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"AUGUST 3, 2021",Who is working against distributed solar: National actors,"A host of utilities across the United States have worked with anti-solar groups to undermine pro-solar policies, with varying degrees of success.
In light of these efforts, state legislators, utility oversight boards, and others should resist efforts by utilities and their special interest supporters aimed at limiting the spread of rooftop solar. So asserts a new report released by Environment America, the Frontier Group, and the United States Public Interest Research Group Education Fund.
According to the report, many of the nation’s electric utilities as well as affiliated lobbying groups perceive solar power–and  distributed generation more broadly–as a threat to their business models and profits.
This explains in part why so many state-level battles are fought over issues such as net metering, fixed charges, demand charges, and rate changes, even in areas served by utilities that have publicly committed to procuring and installing utility-scale solar. Objections include arguments that distributed assets are not owned by the utility, do not factor into their profit models, and enable customers to  consume large portions of their energy need without buying it from the grid while also earning compensation from the utility for excess generation.
As a part of the anti-solar offensive, the report said that a national network of well-funded, largely pro-fossil-fuel lobbying groups have worked with utilities to limit the potential of non-utility-owned renewable generation. Here are highlights of what the report found.
The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) has worked with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) to create model legislation to attack net metering at the state level. As the trade group that represents U.S. investor-owned electric utilities, EEI has trained utility executives in how to run advocacy campaigns and has consistently been a major donor to national Congressional candidates and parties, according to the report.
EEI has long been a solar energy opponent, the report said. That opposition began with EEI’s 2013 “Disruptive Challenges” report, which warned of solar’s potential to threaten the utility business model, and net metering’s potential to adversely impact utility investors.
In December 2019, EEI held a weeklong political “bootcamp” for utility executives and government affairs representatives. The report said that during the session, case studies of successful anti clean-energy campaigns were used to train attendees on how to run their campaigns, while also repeatedly pressing on how net metering, renewable energy standards, and other pro-solar policies represented ongoing threats.
The group maintains a Political Action Committee which has spent over $700,000 in each national election cycle since 2010 to advance organizational issue priorities, the report said.
Houston-based Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA), a group which purports to be the “leading voice for sensible energy and environmental policies for consumers,” seems to be anything but that, according to the report. The group’s members (besides state and local Chambers of Commerce and other business groups) include utility and fossil fuel companies, like Ameren Missouri, the American Gas Association, Dominion Energy, the Edison Electric Institute, Florida Power & Light, Georgia Power, the Indiana Energy Association, British Petroleum, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell Oil.
In the past, CEA has supported anti-solar legislation, like Florida’s failed Amendment 1 in 2016. The group has been referred to by Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse as a “fake consumer group” created by fossil fuel lobbyists.
The group has also been accused of misrepresenting petition signatures it has collected, and for generating template emails supposedly from citizens pressing for specific legislative initiatives.
Described by the report’s authors as a “corporate bill mill,” the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a nationwide organization that gives fossil fuel and utility industry lobbyists direct access to state lawmakers. The report said that98% of the organization’s budget comes from outside donors, corporations, and corporate foundations.
ALEC has been used in the past as a vehicle for utilities and corporations to collaborate on anti-renewable legislation templates, which are then sent to ALEC-member state-level legislators, who introduce the legislation in their respective lawmaking body. The report asserts that the ALEC Energy, Environment and Agriculture task force has authored and introduced model bills intended to get rid of or heavily compromise net metering programs.
Recently, a number of the group’s high-profile corporate members, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and Wal Mart – all companies that have invested in solar and renewable energy at large – have cut ties with ALEC, citing the group’s effort to work against measures that would combat climate change.
Koch Industries began as an oil extraction and refining company, and has been consistent in pursuing cuts to environmental regulation. One of the company’s associated groups, Americans for Prosperity, has been used, according to the report, to funnel money to attack solar power, along with other environmental and energy initiatives. The group is active in 38 states and has fought against solar in Arizona, New Hampshire, Florida, Ohio, South Carolina, and Washington.
A separate Koch-backed group donated at least $1 million to promote Florida’s Amendment 1, according to the report. That amendment failed to pass in 2016. Amendment 1 would have given utilities free rein to charge solar customers more in fees and taxes to offset an alleged cost-shift to non-solar customers. The campaign for Amendment 1 raised more than $20 million in donations. The measure ultimately failed to reach the 60% of the vote that it needed to pass.

Stay tuned for the next installment in this series, where we’ll be taking a look at some of the state-specific campaigns that have attempted to limit rooftop solar’s potential and gut net metering programs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/03/crystal-arrangement-results-in-1000x-more-power-from-ferroelectric-solar-cells/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 3, 2021","Crystal arrangement results in 1,000x more power from ferroelectric solar cells","Combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can raise the photovoltaic effect of solar cells by a factor of 1,000, according to researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) in Germany.
Their findings, published in the journal “Science Advances,” described a lattice arrangement of three different layers of ferroelectric crystals (in this case, of barium titanate, strontium titanate, and calcium titanate) that created a powerful solar energy producing effect.
Ferroelectric means that the material has spatially separated positive and negative charges. The charge separation leads to an asymmetric structure that enables electricity to be generated from light.
Ferroelectric crystals differ from conventional silicon cells in that they do not require a pn-junction to create the PV effect. In other words, there is no need to create positively and negatively doped layers within the cell. The researchers said that change could make solar panels easier to produce.
MLU researchers have been experimenting with barium titanate to take advantage of these properties. However, pure barium titanate does not absorb much sunlight; as a result, it generates a relatively low photocurrent. The research showed that combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can significantly increase a cell’s yield.
Researchers added a thin paraelectric layer to the cell. Although this layer does not have separated charges, it can become ferroelectric under certain conditions; for example, in low temperatures or when the chemical structure is slightly modified.
MLU physicist Dr. Akash Bhatnagar and his team discovered that a much stronger photovoltaic effect occurs when the ferroelectric layer alternates with not one, but two different paraelectric layers.

The team embedded barium titanate between strontium titanate and calcium titanate. This was achieved by vaporizing the crystals with a high-powered laser, redepositing them on carrier substrates. The result was a material made of 500 layers that was only about 200 nanometers thick.
The MLU team irradiated the cell with laser light to test the new material, and the results surprised them. Compared to pure barium titanate of a similar thickness, the current flow was up to 1,000 times stronger, despite the proportion of barium titanate having been reduced by almost two-thirds.
“The interaction between the lattice layers appears to lead to a much higher permittivity – in other words, the electrons are able to flow much more easily due to the excitation by the light photons,” Bhatnagar said.
The studies show the effect is also resilient as it remained nearly constant over a six-month test period. Further research is underway to understand what exactly causes this photovoltaic effect.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/03/solar-101-go-solar-but-go-with-your-eyes-open/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 3, 2021","Solar 101: Go solar, but go with your eyes open","By providing CO2-free power without polluting our air, water, or soil, solar is uniquely virtuous among energy industries. But like all industries that involve people, consumers need to pay close attention to protect themselves.
Earlier this year, the California Public Utility Commission published a 24-page Solar Consumer Protection Guide. All homeowners must sign it before they are allowed to buy a solar powered project.
The document’s main purpose is to protect homeowners against aggressive door-to-door salespeople who push for digital signatures on handheld tablets. It advises customers against signing contracts before they have reached a comprehensive understanding of the project and its full implications.
Here at pv magazine USA, we believe the most important step in the Solar 101 series is finding the right contractor for your project. Step #3 of the California guide – “Find a qualified solar provider” – agrees with us.
The document effectively walks consumers through the pros and cons of different types of financing and leasing options. It is peppered with warnings against unscrupulous sales attempts to stretch the truth. It advises consumers to be particularly wary of “free solar power” offers. What does ‘”free” actually mean though?
 
Typically, “free solar” refers to a solar lease or power purchase agreement. In these kinds of arrangements, the homeowner agrees to trade their roof for a 10-30% reduction in electricity costs. The panels are owned and maintained by the lessor (not the homeowner). Keep in mind that your electricity bill will not go to zero if you install one of these third-part-owned systems.
Two other areas covered by the California document include making sure you compare your finance options and understanding how solar savings work.
Note that there are at least two negatives to taking on these “free solar” deals. First, you won’t gain all of the financial benefits that accrue if you actually own the system yourself. You’ll save 10-30% off of your electricity bill , but will lose out on tax credits and any state incentives.
Second, your home’s value won’t necessarily increase with the solar installation, because the system is owned by someone else. In fact, the added complication of a solar lease – including the need for an additional credit check – has the potential to deter some prospective home buyers.
And take note: Both federal and state laws stipulates a three-day cooling off period for those who have purchased products from door-to-door salespeople. Don’t be afraid to exercise your rights if you find yourself getting cold feet.
A second risk of solar power comes with new technology and new companies.
For instance, sometimes the hardware you want isn’t available when you want it, or the price you were originally quoted (and signed a contract for) is no longer valid.
Tesla’s Solar Roof is a beautiful product and its image may eventually represent the residential solar industry. However, the company has had challenges scaling the product for mass deployment, as well as meeting long-standing building material quality standards. This has led to some customers experiencing long wait periods, while others have had their purchases cancelled.
Additionally, some installations have taken weeks – versus a couple of days – to finish, as the company learns how to deploy the product. Lastly, some customers have complained about seeing the price of their project significantly increase, even after signing a contract at a specific dollar amount.
Selling newly minted technologies with innovative business models means that solar companies often take on advanced risk.
For example, this author installed a Solyndra solar panel plus Satcon solar inverter project in 2011. Shortly after installation, both companies went out of business. Fortunately, the hardware has been very reliable over the past decade. However, it has become challenging to find replacement modules when the occasional falling quahog clobbers a solar panel.
What’s more, solar installers can go out of business from time to time. There are thousands of installers across the nation, both large and small. That range of options offers yet another reason to meticulously consider your operations and maintenance contract before signing.
Like any other product, it’s important to pay attention to where your money is going. When accepting offers from door-to-door salespeople, take plenty of time before signing anything. Take time to research the many details involved in your solar purchase. Shop around before you drop thousands of dollars or lease your roof. When choosing companies and hardware, make a concerted effort to identify their limitations and fallibility.
Addressing a comprehensive list of questions on residential solar, pv magazine USA’s Solar 101 focuses on the tools and knowledge which will help consumers confidently answer their solar questions.

Backers said the Revamping Appropriate Incentives for Solar Energy (RAISE) the Roof Act would maximize the positive climate and economic impacts of the next generation of solar energy technology.
Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) introduced companion legislation in the Senate.
Congress first created the ITC in 2006 to spur deployment and economic opportunity in the solar sector. The current 26% tax credit only covers the solar roof tiles, but not other parts of the roof, something the industry sees as an obstacle to attracting new customers. The RAISE the Roof Act attempts to solve this problem by allowing the entirety of an integrated solar roof to be covered by the investment tax credit. It also would allow consumers to expense roof repairs and replacement that is sometimes necessary for solar installation.

The measure could be folded into the Democrats’ budget reconciliation bill, which is expected to carry out some of President Biden’s key climate change measures affecting the electric power sector.
Both Tesla and GAF Energy, among others, manufacture integrated rooftop solar products. GAF Energy is bringing its manufacturing capacity from Asia to a facility in San Jose, California. The company is a unit of Standard Industries, which has its headquarters in Rep. Sherill’s district.
Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy, said in a statement that the bill positions U.S. manufacturing resources “to contribute meaningfully to a resilient path forward in our energy infrastructure.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said, “This legislation will make sure that homes that have solar built into the original design are eligible for the same ITC benefits as any other residential solar installation.”
The legislation also won the backing of the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association, Mosaic, Vote Solar, and Greenwork.

J.B. Pritzker has signed into law HB 644, an act which significantly reduces the influence that community organizations, like homeowners associations, have over their members going solar.
The law both expands the reach of and closes loopholes created by a similar piece of legislation, passed in 2011. Most notably, the law rescinds the ability of community associations to ban members from installing solar on certain areas of their homes. These associations can still determine the specific configuration of said installation, so long as that decision does not lower the system’s annual estimated generation output by more than 10%. The law also expands its protections to include buildings up to 60 feet tall, doubling the former 30-foot parameter, though the law does not apply to condominiums or other buildings with shared roofs.
The law also significantly cuts down the amount of time that association members have to wait for a response once filing their application for approval of a system with their association. Associations now have 90 days to develop a policy on rooftop solar if a member proposes an installation and no such policy is yet in place, down from 120 days. The amount of time for associations to decide on approval has also been cut down to 75 days, where previously it was 90 days.
Those conditions have been lauded as meaningful, as long approval times often muddy project logistics and, generally, the longer a potential installation languishes waiting for approval, the less likely it is to be installed.
While this law, which takes effect immediately, will expand the state’s distributed solar potential, the real effect of that potential will likely remain unseen until the state passes an updated solar incentive program, as the state’s solar market has essentially been frozen since the last program ran out of funds earlier this year.
The commonly-held belief is that, sooner or later,  Gov. Pritzker’s Consumers and Climate First Act, will pass, bringing with it the phasing out of coal-fired power plants by 2030 and gas-fired power plants by 2045. Within these phase-out targets, the bill also includes plant-specific declining caps on emissions that would lead to plant closures and a carbon tax starting at $8/ton and escalating 3% each year. Under Pritzker’s bill, the Illinois Solar for All program would require companies that close coal mines or coal-fired power plants to provide detailed information on their workforce to help the state ease their transition to new work, and to provide two years’ notice of mass layoff or relocation plans.
Pritzker’s bill also proposes to lift the cap on how customers’ monthly bills can be charged to fund renewable energy development. It also includes some significant utility reform measures pertaining with accountability, transparency, and how rates are formulated.

The insurer claimed in a lawsuit filed August 2 that Amazon is liable for the damage because it sold an allegedly defectively designed and manufactured solar-powered portable power station. American Family alleged the online retailer “played a direct role in the promotion and sale of the generator” and received a fee from the homeowner’s 2019 purchase.
According to the Law360 web site, which reported the lawsuit, the question of Amazon’s liability for selling allegedly defective products is unsettled.
For example, the Texas Supreme Court said in June that Amazon is not a “seller” under Texas product liability law. In its decision, the court held that Amazon cannot be considered a seller because it only controls the transaction and shipping and holds no title to the products sold through its platform.
Last November, however, California’s highest court ruled that Amazon could be liable for selling allegedly defective batteries through is online marketplace, even though another court sided with the online retailer a week earlier.
And Law360 said that in an unpublished ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.’s lawsuit over a fire caused by an allegedly defective hoverboard. The Ninth Circuit found that a lower court properly applied Arizona’s liability laws in finding that Amazon only provides services to connect customers to vendors.
In the Minnesota case, a homeowner in November 2019 bought a 400 W Aeiusny-made solar generator through his Amazon Prime subscription. The generator later caused a fire at the residence, and American Family paid more than $75,000 to repair the damage.
The insurer said an investigation showed that three cells in the generator ruptured after experiencing a thermal runaway, which can occur when lithium-ion batteries generate too much heat.
American Family is arguing that Amazon is liable as the generator’s commercial seller because the manufacturer is based in China and not subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota.
The case is American Family Mutual Insurance Co. v. Amazon.com Inc., case number 0:21-cv-01749, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota.

Optimizing a solar array’s performance can add dollars to an owner’s bottom line.
Toronto-based Morgan Solar is introducing a new tool that is intended to provide a continuous stream of data on panel performance and also sync with other sensors. The IV-DAQ and Analytics Portal offers insights into what a solar array is doing and why, as well as analytics that provide insight into what it’s likely to do, said Hugo Navarro, vice president of finance and corporate services. Morgan Solar provided pv magazine with an exclusive pre-release look at the new technology.
The company described the portal as a “comprehensive monitoring and analysis solution” that allows monitoring, diagnostics, and forecasting on DC-side PV plant performance. The IV-DAQ is a cable-free, in-situ IV curve tracer that provides data for PV characterization and high-frequency IV collection, to be distinguished from a simple operating point.
The company said that the tool requires no need to shut down the inverter, combiner box, or string in order to take measurements. The tool also allows for real-time comparisons against the array’s implied warranty; in other words, insight into the warranty performance that would be expected for a module of the same age in that specific environmental condition, as per the manufacturer’s spec sheet.
The tool also helps to validate a panel system’s performance under a range of conditions. For example, thin film companies point to superior performance under low light conditions, which helped drive their adoption in regions of lower direct normal irradiance (DNI). Navarro said the IV-DAQ helps shed light (and numbers) on such claims, as well as on other real-world cases such as high heat and humidity, damp cold, and low light/high diffuse.
Navarro said that the tool is deployed in the field with a thermocouple sensor that attaches to the back of a module. Once attached, the tool provides a clear signal on panel degradation. “You get a true pulse on the health of the module,” he said.
For example, IV-DAQ can be paired with meteorological sensors to measure and quantify spatial effects, bifacial enhancements, shading impacts, and so on. In addition, loss drivers such as soiling, vegetation, and mismatch can be identified and, perhaps more important, quantified to help fine-tune operations and maintenance budgets.
Navarro said that Morgan Solar is currently working with an unnamed independent power producer to create a detailed profile of a bifacial module on a single axis tracker in order to quantify individual performance drivers. The effort is intended to validate business case assumptions and make bankable the boost to overall production that is offered by the bifacial cells.
The ability to work off of actual field data rather than broad marketing claims can help increase debt ratios by 5 to 7 points, Navarro said.
Installing the IV-DAQ on a single panel provides real-time data across the entire string. “It’s not intended to be deployed one per panel,” Navarro said. “That would be overkill.”
Instead, Morgan Solar deploys the tool in a statistically significant scattering across the solar field. For example, a deployment might sample each type of string, in effect creating a digital twin to allow for performance modeling and forecasting.
The tool’s deployment across a field is intended to offer a more accurate understanding of how it is performing and to “nail down performance forecasting so that it becomes financeable,” Navarro said.
As a further refinement, Morgan Solar is exploring working with solar developers to characterize module performance to help in the process of procuring panels. Navarro said that data from IV-DAQ would provide a verifiable picture of how specific panels perform in real-world settings.
