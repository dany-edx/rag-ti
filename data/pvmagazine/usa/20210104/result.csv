The proposal looks to set 210+/-0.25mm as the standard size of silicon wafers in the 210-220mm size range under the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International Photovoltaic Standards (SEMI), while revising the existing module size standards.
For most of the past decade, the traditional wafer size has been 156.75mm, with that size representing more than 90% of the monocrystalline market. Since 2019 however, manufacturers have begun to see benefits in increasing wafer sizes, leading ultimately to modules rated at 500 W+ appearing on the market.
Because these modules are made by multiple manufacturers, the size change has not been uniform, and that can lead to confusion and increased cost, proponents of the standard said.
Besides setting a standard size, the Trina-led proposal also calls for promoting the standard sizes of silicon wafers and modules as follows:
The companies, which include Risen Energy, Zhonghuan Semiconductor, Tongwei, Huansheng Photovoltaic, Runyang New Energy Technology, Canadian Solar and Wuxi Shangji Automation, alongside Trina, argue that standardizing the silicon wafers will allow the solar industry to achieve  scale, and enable all businesses to improve production efficiency, optimize supply chains and drive technological innovation.
The companies also argue that standardization will allow for more competitive manufacturing by decreasing initial investment for new companies and providing some certainty that investments won’t be wasted if a new size becomes more popular.
Trina has been the group’s vocal leader, providing releases supporting the effort, as well as conducting studies to help demonstrate the value and safety of 210mm wafers.
For developers, the companies argue that a 210mm standard will decrease balance of system costs and the levelized cost of electricity for new solar projects.
These balance of system costs refer to large-scale, ground-mount solar projects, the market segment where 210mm wafers are currently practical. With standardization, these larger wafers could be manufactured for smaller-sized modules with a lower power rating. To date, however, they have been utilized in 500W+ modules, which are too large for typical rooftop installations.
In a company release, Trina outlines why 210mm is the group’s preferred size choice by highlighting flux value, the dumpling effect and cost savings delivered by using fewer modules in an installation. (Fewer modules means lower junction box, potting, combiner box, DC cable, installation and construction costs).
Flux value refers to the increase in production capacity brought about by large-size products, reducing the cost of labor, depreciation, and operating, management and financial expenses per unit of output.
The dumpling effect refers to the increase in the amount of auxiliary materials in transportation, such as frame, glass, backsheet, EVA, ribbon bus bars, pallets and packaging materials being less than the increase in module area when using large-size wafers in module production, bringing savings in encapsulation and transportation costs.
The company also offered a cost calculation of 210mm wafers, compared to 166mm and 182mm wafers, across the entire value chain:
In a separate study, Trina addresses one of the most prevalent concerns facing the standardization of 210mm wafer size: the high working temperature of such modules due to their high-current output.
As a module’s operating temperature rises, the open-circuit voltage will decrease, while the short-circuit current increases slightly, leading to decreases in photovoltaic conversion efficiency and cell power. According to the company study, an energy loss of 0.20% occurs for every 1℃ of increase in operating temperature.
The same study, however, found that, under the same installation and cooling conditions, the working temperature of 210mm and 182mm modules are nearly the same. It said that the cells only change the area with the same Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) structure and efficiency.
According to Trina, 210mm and 182mm cells have the same PERC structure and their efficiency is almost the same. With similar packing materials and under the same optical environment, there is almost no difference in the current density of such modules. The increase in current in the 210mm ultra-high-power module is driven by a larger cell, as current is the product of current density multiplied by cell area.
And even though the current is larger, efficiency remains the same with a steady current density and larger cell area. In addition, for the same module efficiency, the amount of unutilized heat – the solar energy which cannot be converted into electric energy – is the same in terms of unit area.
With the same installation and heat dissipation conditions, operating temperatures for 210mm ultra-high power modules and 182mm modules are roughly the same, it said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/04/sunrise-brief-gibraltar-closes-two-acquisitions-aims-at-700m-revenue-goal/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EV,POLICY,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 4, 2021","Sunrise brief: Gibraltar closes two acquisitions, aims at $700m revenue goal","Gibraltar Industries said it is buying both TerraSmart and Sunfig in separate deals worth nearly $225 million.
TerraSmart provides screw-based, ground-mount solar racking technology and was acquired for $220 million, according to a statement. Sunfig provides software solutions to optimize solar energy investments through upstream design, performance, and financial modeling. It was acquired for $3.75 million in cash.
Both acquisitions are intended to strengthen Gibraltar’s position as one of the largest turnkey providers in the domestic solar energy market with a portfolio of ground-mount infrastructure, tracker, and design software.
TerraSmart tracking systems are marketed under the GLIDE (fixed-tilt) and TerraTrak (single-axis tracker) brand names. The company is based in Florida and has field operations in Phoenix and Selkirk, New York, and manufacturing in Columbus, Ohio.
TerraSmart is expected to record 2020 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of around $150-$155 million and $26-$28 million.
Sunfig’s offerings include web-based software that optimize solar project design; APIs that integrate into existing software, tools, and processes; and contract and project development services.
Gibraltar said it expects its solar energy platform within its Renewable Energy and Conservation segment to pass $700 million in organic revenue by 2025 from a pro forma fiscal 2020 revenue base of around $400 million.
Wisconsin regulators plan to 17-year-old rules on customer-owned energy sources. The Public Service Commission in December approved ground rules for revising administrative codes governing distributed generation facilities such as rooftop solar panels, hydroelectric dams and biogas generators. Renewable energy advocates have complained the rules are out of date.
In 2019, Wisconsin had about 100 MW of customer-owned solar, with another 26 MW expected to come online in 2020.
Massachusetts’ governor said that offshore wind, hydropower and the existing SMART solar program will be essential to achieving emissions reductions that are 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, and that the Commonwealth will work to add an additional 2,000 MW of clean energy.
The SMART Program is a solar incentive program sponsored by Eversource, National Grid and Unitil. SMART is intended to support the development of 1,600 MW of new solar generating capacity.
In his New Year’s Eve statement, the governor also said that Massachusetts will join California in requiring that by 2035, 100% of new light-duty vehicles sold in the Commonwealth are zero emission vehicles. Support in achieving that goal will be offered to build charging infrastructure, including consumer incentives for residential EV charging systems.

The goals were included in two year-end 2020 reports – the Massachusetts 2050 Decarbonization Roadmap Report and an interim 2030 Clean Energy and Climate Plan (CECP) – that detail policies and strategies to reduce emissions and combat climate change. As part of the strategy, Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Kathleen Theoharides set an interim 2030 statewide emissions limit of 45% below 1990 levels.
“The costly impacts of climate change are on display in the Commonwealth, making it critical that we take action,” said Governor Charlie Baker in a statement.
The 2050 Roadmap outlines eight potential pathways to Net Zero emissions, including an analysis of potential energy resources, projected energy demand, and the energy supply necessary to meet the demand in all sectors of the economy while meeting the 2050 emissions limit established by the Commonwealth in April 2020.
The Roadmap finds that the most cost-effective, low-risk pathways include a portfolio anchored by a “significant” offshore wind resource, more interstate transmission, widespread electrification of transportation and building heat, and reducing costs by taking action at the point of replacement for energy infrastructure.
(In a related development, Vineyard Wind, a joint venture between Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, said in early December that it selected GE as its preferred supplier of wind turbine generators for its proposed 800 MW Vineyard Wind 1 project, the first utility-scale offshore wind installation in the United States. GE would deliver its multi-megawatt Haliade-X turbines for the project.)
The 2050 Roadmap also finds that achieving net zero emissions will deliver a drop in air pollution, particularly in “environmental justice communities currently overburdened with poor air quality,” and savings in health costs of up to $100 million per year by 2030.
The 2030 CECP will help the Commonwealth meet its 2030 emissions limit of 45% below 1990 levels, which will require a reduction in statewide emissions about 19 million metric tons below current levels.
The Commonwealth will also develop a proposal for a new high-efficiency energy code for new residential and commercial buildings as an option for Massachusetts’ Green Communities, and a new Governor’s Commission and Task Force on Clean Heat.
Sungrow said that its cumulative shipment of inverters in the Americas reached 10 GW at the end of 2020. The company delivered inverters to projects in the U.S., Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Mexico.
North American deliveries totaled 5 GW in 2020, the company said. It also reached a 1 GW milestone in Chile.
Major projects supplied in 2020 include the 200 MW Wright Solar project, one of the largest community solar projects in California. Peninsula Clean Energy has a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wright Solar Park LLC to buy all of the facility’s electricity to power more than 100,000 San Mateo County homes. The solar facility was constructed by Swinerton Renewable Energy and is owned by Centaurus Renewable Energy.
KDC Solar LLC, a unit of CI Renewables LLC, said commercial operations have begun of a 1.6 MW solar carport at CentraState Medical in Freehold, New Jersey. The system will generate around 2.1 million kWh of electricity per year.
Together with a 7 MW ground mount system, commissioned in 2014, and a 3.9 MW solar carport system, commissioned in 2019, CentraState Medical has one of the highest percentages of solar electricity of any hospital in New Jersey. These solar energy systems provide 70% of CentraState’s annual electric requirements. New Jersey-based Altec Building Systems Corp. provided electrical construction support on the most recent project.
