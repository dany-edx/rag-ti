It serves commercial, industrial, public sector and community-scale accounts.
The company posted third-quarter 2023 revenues of $45.1 million, an increase of 48% over Q3 2022 totals. Net income was $6.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $29.1 million for Q3 2023. Net cash from operating activities reached $23.6 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins were maintained at 64%.
For the full year, Altus Power reaffirmed its 2023 EBITDA guidance in the range of $97 million to $103 million and adjusted its margins to the high 50% range.
“Despite challenging market conditions that are affecting large portions of our industry, Altus Power continues to deliver record growth in our adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flows, as demonstrated by our third quarter results,” said Gregg Felton, co-chief executive officer of Altus Power.
In-quarter, the company executed an agreement to acquire 121 of solar assets in the Carolinas, investing over $120 million in the assets. The company is currently progressing towards the completion of about 75 MW of developed assets by the end of the year.
“We continue to drive construction on many assets towards and across the finish line in multiple states and are pleased to see growing engagements with our CBRE and channel-partner sourced enterprise clients move through development and into construction,” said Lars Norell, co-chief executive officer of Altus Power.
The company also recently unveiled Altus IQ, a carbon accounting platform for businesses.
Altus Power’s total installed portfolio is approximately 721 MW as of the end of Q3 2023. Its trailing twelve-month generation tops 730,000 MWh, leading to the abatement of over 517,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for its customers.
The commercial-scale solar developer noted that the rise of community solar presents a large runway for growth ahead.
“Significant portions of our pipeline consist of community solar-eligible assets, and we’re excited to be preparing for even greater flows of these opportunities as more states implement supporting programs,” said Norell.
Altus Power also recently announced a new $200 million financial commitment from Blackstone Construction Facility. The $200 million financing is expected to support the construction of solar assets and fund equipment, labor, interconnection, and development costs.
“Our insurance clients have significant capacity for the high quality long-duration investments that Altus is originating,” said Robert Camacho, global head of asset-based finance, Blackstone Structured Finance.

The 274 MWdc solar and a 91 MW, 455 MWh DC-coupled battery energy storage system generates enough energy to power 57,600 average Nevada homes. The offtaker for the project is the public utility, NV Energy, which signed a 20-year power purchase agreement.
The project is comprised of 623,000 bifacial solar modules with 564 battery segments.
Built by EDF Renewables North America, NV Energy and McCarthy Building Companies, the project began in September 2021, with the solar portion complete in December 2022 and energy storage portion completed this month. EDF Renewables’ Asset Optimization group will perform operations and maintenance services for the life of the Project, and will provide NERC compliance support, remote monitoring, and balance-of-plant management to maximize power production.
McCarthy Building worked with LiUNA and IBEW unions to provide workforce training and skills development for both tribal and non-tribal members. On-site training was provided for all levels of experience, including entry-level. During construction over 450 jobs were created, with 10% filled by tribal members.
“The partnership between our Moapa community and EDF Renewables has been a mutually beneficially one,” said Kage Thompson, Moapa Tribal Council Member. “The project, built entirely on Moapa River Indian Reservation lands, put over 45 tribal members to work during the construction of the project and will continue to provide good paying jobs.”
The project is located on 1,387 acres in the Moapa River Indian Reservation, and in addition to offering jobs for tribal and community members, McCarthy said it is working closely with the Moapa Band of Paiutes to ensure respect for the Tribe’s mission, vision, values, land and its people is maintained throughout the process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/13/nrel-presents-new-gaas-solar-cell-concept-with-27-efficiency/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 13, 2023",NREL presents new GaAs solar cell concept with 27% efficiency,"NREL has unveiled a new design for III-V rear heterojunction solar cells based on GaAs, in order to make PV devices for terrestrial applications.
Solar cells manufactured from GaAs and gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) have long yielded some of the highest conversion efficiencies of any technology. Bringing down production costs to make them viable for mainstream solar applications remains a challenge, despite recent scientific suggestions for various approaches to using GaAs and other III-V materials in solar devices.
The scientists said the novelty of their approach consisted of using dynamic hydride vapor phase epitaxy (D-HVPE), as an alternative lower-cost solution to metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), to synthesize the solar cell. HVPE, on the other hand, uses low-cost elemental group III precursors with high utilization efficiency and very high growth rates.
They also applied an emitter layer of gallium indium arsenide phosphide (GaInAsP), which makes the cell’s heterojunction together with the GaAs absorber.
“For processing, a reflective Au metal contact was electroplated onto the AlGaAs contact layer, and then samples were inverted onto a Si handle, and the substrate was etched away followed by the etch stop,” they explained.
The academics identified an optimum emitter doping density and energy bandgap to maximize the cell efficiency, and said that the size of this varies with the heteroband offsets, as defined by the material choice.
NREL’s Cell and Module Performance (CMP) Team has certified that the novel cell design achieved a power conversion efficiency of more than 27%. The researchers said this is the highest efficiency ever reported for a single-junction GaAs cell grown using this technique.

They presented the cell in “Modeling and design of III-V heterojunction solar cells for enhanced performance,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
“We also show that heterojunctions yield proportionally larger efficiency improvements in lower-quality materials,” they concluded. “Although the modeling was developed and validated using III-V materials, the results are theoretically applicable to materials systems outside III-Vs.”

The projects, which are in various stages of construction, will combine for over 1 GW of capacity once completed.
The projects have led to the creation of over 800 new construction jobs, 200 of which are slated to be equipment operator, mechanical and electrical apprenticeships. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit incentives call for apprenticeship labor and prevailing wage.
“Now with the IRA, there are federal incentives in place to further support apprenticeship programs that create even more good-paying jobs and expand workforce training pathways into these careers,” said Scott Canada, executive vice president, renewable energy, McCarthy Building Companies.
The four projects include:
With the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting an addition of 63 GW of solar capacity additions by the end of 2024, McCarthy and other utility-scale developers are working to support local skilled craft workers, industry veterans, and those displaced from other jobs to meet the rapidly growing labor demand.
McCarthy developed a U.S. Department of Labor-approved and registered apprenticeship program in 2021 to provide on-the-job training and technical instruction. McCarthy has successfully registered its solar apprenticeship programs in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia and Michigan, with registration in additional states in process. The firm has also partnered with unions in Nevada, Illinois, and California to develop complimentary apprenticeship programs.
The company’s apprenticeship program takes two to four years to complete, pairing apprentices with journey workers for the first year of training. The apprentices are required to complete 144 hours per year of related instruction. Upon completion of the apprenticeship, graduates receive a nationally recognized credential from the U.S. Department of Labor and are potentially eligible for a wage increase.
McCarthy first piloted its solar apprenticeship program on the 209 MW project in Livingston, Texas, which is slated to be complete in December 2023.
The project developer is currently constructing or has completed 85 utility-scale clean energy projects in the country, operating since 2010. These projects, once completed, will provide over 9.5 GW of capacity and 1 GW of battery energy storage. The company is 100% employee owned.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/13/doe-seeks-state-backed-clean-energy-projects-for-up-to-80-loans/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 13, 2023",DOE seeks state-backed clean energy projects for up to 80% loans,"After clean energy projects with financial backing from New York State were the first to gain support under an expanded U.S. Department of Energy loan program, Sam Schacht, project manager with the Clean Energy States Alliance, said on a webinar that his organization hopes that many other state programs “will unlock billions of dollars” of loan support from the program.
Solar projects and other clean energy projects are eligible for DOE loan support of up to 80% of project costs under DOE’s Title 17 clean energy financing authority, if the projects first win “meaningful support” from a “state energy financing institution” or SEFI.
DOE has determined that New York State has a state program that qualifies as a SEFI, as do at least seven other states, as shown in DOE’s SEFI Toolkit. Yet most states “would have multiple entities that would qualify as a SEFI,” said Hans Riemer, senior consultant and state and local outreach lead at DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), on the webinar.
A state agency that qualifies as a SEFI may take the lead on identifying solar or other clean energy projects that could qualify for both state and DOE support, Riemer said, for example by issuing a request for proposals to the private sector. He said a state grant or investment of 5% of the project cost would meet the required “meaningful support” threshold.
Or a project developer could take the lead, Riemer said, by first identifying what state agency finances energy projects that reduce emissions, and then talking to state officials about providing SEFI support so the project could then apply to LPO for loan support.
Riemer added that project developers can also work with LPO regarding project planning “in an iterative process to help you put forward the best project.”
A state may “land projects,” Riemer said, by publishing information about its SEFI funding program, so that “projects can find you and you can get multiples of your state investment deploying in the state.”
Because of the “considerable costs” in LPO’s loan application process, most LPO borrowers have determined that LPO support “only penciled” for larger projects in excess of $100 million, Riemer said. As a result, he said “we’re seeing approaches to multi-state SEFI support to help ensure sufficient scale to work with LPO.” Another possibility is that a single state with “a lot of projects that are smaller than $100 million” might seek to access LPO’s capital in order to lend to those projects, he added. “That comes with a lot of requirements, so it comes with an intense level of effort, but there are definitely states where this is the match.”
Riemer described a multitude of other approaches to securing SEFI program loan support, while officials from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, New York’s SEFI, described their state program that backs clean energy projects. The Clean Energy States Alliance posted a recording of the webinar.
The Clean Energy States Alliance has 18 member states plus the District of Columbia, and supports both member and non-member states.
