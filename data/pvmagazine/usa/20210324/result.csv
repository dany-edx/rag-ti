The 2021 Act on Climate bill passed the House by a 53-to-22 vote and will now be reconciled with a Senate version of the bill. Once work is finalized, the reconciled bill will be sent to Gov. Dan McKee. It is unclear where McKee stands on the legislation, though his office told local press that he “looks forward to reviewing this legislation.”
The Act on Climate bill would would build on the 2014 Resilient Rhode Island Act, the first statewide plan to cut emissions. That bill required emissions levels to drop 45% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% by 2040 with a goal of achieving net-zero by 2050.
A plan to meet those goals and address other public health and environmental issues is required by the end of 2025, with additional updates in five year intervals after that.
Developing the plan and implementing strategies to achieve it are tasked to the Rhode Island executive climate change coordinating council, a body comprised of officials from state agencies with responsibility to assess, integrate, and coordinate climate change efforts.
Of the 22 legislators that voted against the Act on Climate bill, the overarching objection was a mandate for Rhode Island homes to be retrofitted with electric heat. One representative argued that this would cost $50,000-$100,000 per home, although a state report estimated that the cost of an electric heat pump and ductwork required to electrify a home would be closer to $5,000.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/24/making-a-case-for-a-standalone-energy-storage-itc/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"MARCH 24, 2021",Making a case for a standalone energy storage ITC,"Nearly 150 organizations appealed to U.S. House and Senate leaders on March 23 to make standalone energy storage projects eligible for the federal investment tax credit (ITC) in the upcoming infrastructure package.
A tax credit would help reduce the cost of energy storage deployment outright, spur investment, and create new jobs in the energy storage industry, they said.
Public interest groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists, the National Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Environmental Law and Policy Center joined forces with solar and storage industry associations to voice their support for standalone storage ITC eligibility.

“We have 3 GW so far,” said Jason Burwen, interim CEO of the Energy Storage Association (ESA). In a report last August, ESA said that it is possible that by the end of the decade 100 GW of new energy storage will be deployed in the U.S.
Securing an ITC for standalone storage is key to achieving that goal because it would “create an investment signal and facilitate a rush of capital” into storage development that would match the demand for storage, the ESA report said.
At the state level, energy storage targets aligned with renewable portfolio standards will also be important tools to prepare the grid for increased renewable penetrations, the report said.
One Senate bill that would grant standalone energy storage ITC eligibility dovetails with Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Debbie Stabenow’s (D-MI) recently proposed American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act, which aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing of advanced energy technologies with targeted investment in rural areas and in areas where traditional energy sector jobs are based.
By creating a domestic supply chain for energy storage, the Manchin-Stabenow bill provides a platform for renewable energy industry growth and economic development, Burwen said.
Also important is long-term policy to grow domestic manufacturing. Stable policies are vital because investments take years to pay off. “Manufacturers want clarity that there will be a strong long-term market,” said Gregory Wetstone, CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
The short-term nature – and piecemeal extensions – of the ITC also make it harder for businesses to plan, he said.
The Manchin-Stabenow bill needs to be paired with a tech-neutral ITC extension and with workforce development and community support incentives, said Suzanne Leta, SunPower’s head of policy and strategy, and a member the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) board of directors.
A project’s economics alone won’t move the needle and spur renewable energy deployment in places where state-level support for renewable energy is lacking or non-existent, she said. She cited Manchin’s home state as a case in point: West Virginia ranks 49th in the U.S. in terms of solar installations.
Unlike other states, West Virginia offers no state-level support for solar; all it has is the federal ITC. For states in a similar position, commercial and residential access to renewable energy like solar is curtailed.
On the ITC, a best-case scenario for the renewable energy industry would be Senator Ron Wyden’s (D-OR) Clean Energy for America Act, which offers a technology neutral ITC, some sources said.
If or when Wyden’s technology-neutral ITC legislation from 2019 is resurrected, its tax credit would apply equally to all forms of generation and storage that contribute to reducing greenhouse gases.
Wyden’s ITC framework may offer other benefits as well, particularly for residential solar.

Where the current residential solar ITC has been designed to phase out completely, the commercial solar ITC has a step-down process that stops at 10% and continues indefinitely. Leta said this policy difference is out of date.
In 2016, when the solar ITC had its last meaningful update, about 70% of U.S. residential solar systems were third-party-owned systems that were leased by residential solar customers; cash and loan-based financing represented the balance.
Today, the breakdown is reversed. That is because the ITC puts money back into the hands of customers who use cash or obtain a loan to get a home solar system. In a leased solar home system, the tax credit goes to the company that owns and leases the home solar system.
A tech-neutral ITC like Wyden’s would create a more level playing field between residential and commercial solar, and would obviate the need to tinker with the tax code to do that, Leta said.
Wyden’s ITC bill also would level the playing field for renewable power compared fossil fuels. By one estimate, U.S. direct subsidies to the fossil fuel industry totaled roughly $20 billion a year, with about 20% allocated to coal and 80% to natural gas and crude oil.
“Today, much of our grid is responsive to the demands of the 1950s,” said Gregory Wetstone of ACORE.

“And that’s without counting additional in-kind subsidies related to the public health and climate costs associated with burning fossil fuels,” ACORE’s Wetstone said.
To get a more reliable and resilient national grid, the U.S. needs to have 21st century technology in use. “Today, much of our grid is responsive to the demands of the 1950s,” Wetstone said.
He said investments are needed to upgrade and expand grid infrastructure, and build an interconnected macro grid that provides more interregional transmission to connect the separate regional grids.
Making those investment would better enable electricity to move more efficiently, at a reduced level of carbon emissions, and save electricity customers tens of billions of dollars.
A national green bank can also help make the U.S. reach its climate goals, said Jeffrey Schub, executive director of the Coalition for Green Capital.

Bills to create a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator that can leverage $100 billion of public funds to finance up to $463 billion in total investment over the next four years – effectively acting like a national green bank – were introduced in the House and the Senate in February.
“As more than a dozen states have proven during the last decade, [green banks] can deploy current clean energy technologies at a fast pace—whether EV chargers, home efficiency upgrades for low-income families or building transmission,” Schub said. He said this is a “proven, no-risk policy” that would put the U.S. on pace to achieve its 2035 goal.
In a February letter, renewable industry and environmental groups asked the Biden administration to prioritize a predictable long-term tax platform for clean energy technologies and a tax credit for domestic clean energy manufacturing.
According to their letter, continued uncertainty around tax equity means that all of the clean energy and clean transportation tax incentives that the industry groups are seeking should be made “refundable” or include a direct pay option.
As Congress considers legislation to address the climate crisis and repair the pandemic-buffeted U.S. economy, officials expect these policy goals to come together as a comprehensive infrastructure package takes shape.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/24/4-steps-mid-sized-companies-should-follow-when-considering-solar/,"ACQUISITIONS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,NORTH AMERICA",,"MARCH 24, 2021",4 steps mid-sized companies should follow when considering solar,"You may think commercial solar is only for large, Fortune 500 companies with enough resources to afford millions of dollars in capital expenditures.
The good news is that this is not at all the case. Middle-market companies can also benefit from solar, and are increasingly expected to do so by large companies seeking to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chains.
Mid-scale companies not only stand to better position themselves with their customers, but also drive significant savings or tax benefits by going solar. Many have done so already: The amount of solar capacity installed across the United States has grown tenfold in the past decade, and some people are already calling the 2020s “the solar decade.”
Even so, many attractive opportunities remain. In the U.S., solar energy installations can help roughly 70% of businesses reduce operating costs and meet environmental goals in the 2020s. Here are a few simple steps you can use to evaluate ROI and begin developing a successful solar energy installation for your business.
First, you should own the property or have control of the roof. If you lease, a landlord-tenant deal can be pursued, but would require additional coordination. Your rooftop should have ample room (typically greater than 50,000 square feet) with direct sunlight for an effective solar energy system to be installed. Most commonly, commercial solar installations are placed on large, flat, unobstructive roof; no shading from surrounding trees or other structures is ideal.

Second, if a rooftop installation does not work, solar panels can also be considered for parking areas. With solar canopies, employee and customer vehicles enjoy the additional benefit of protection from weather and UV rays, and it is straightforward to incorporate additional features such as lighting or EV charging stations.
Third, businesses with underutilized land may also consider a ground-mounted solar panel installation, although environmental studies and trenching may add to the cost of the project.
Before meeting with potential solar vendors, it is recommended that you compile the last year of your property’s utility bills. This includes the monthly kilowatt-hour (kWh) consumption, electricity rates, and total billed amounts.
The average commercial or industrial rate for electricity nationwide is roughly 9-cents per kWh. If your rate is higher, solar could be a good option to realize savings. Even when it’s lower, many variables can still make solar worthwhile.
Keep in mind that solar energy systems are designed to be long-term assets with stable, predictable benefits, and there are numerous benefits beyond financials.
When considering solar, the two obvious benefits are financial and environmental. As consumer and international businesses now consider the environmental impact of their decisions, the line between these two benefits is beginning to blur as markets are likely to reward those who go green.
Image: Safari Energy
Incentives: The Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), historically a 30% credit, is set to provide a tax credit equivalent to 26% of a solar installation’s total costs this year. This is set to further reduce to 10% in 2024 and remain at that level thereafter.
In some circumstances, solar developers can offer businesses “safe harbored” equipment that could be eligible for the full 30% tax credit.
States also individually mandate sustainability goals called Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). Programs are different for each state but typically drive additional incentives for solar, including credits, rebates, bonuses for adding batter storage, the ability to sell Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), and the ability to sell excess electricity generated back to the grid. Solar developers like Safari Energy track these programs closely and can advise on what programs might be applicable for your business.
Environment, Sustainability, and Governance (ESG) Goals: A recent report on supply chain sustainability found that, on average, a major corporation’s supply chain is likely to have 5.5 times more carbon emissions than the rest of the company’s normal operations. This makes mid-scale supply chain companies the target of corporate ESG efforts.
Middle-market companies with sustainability programs have an advantage over those who lack such programs when negotiating with procurement officers and corporate buyers from large corporations that are putting a premium on ESG ratings.
Solar power can be an ideal ESG solution for middle-market companies for several reasons.

First, solar is now the cheapest way to build new electricity generation in history, making it a very cost-effective way to implement ESG initiatives.
Second, solar projects are relatively straightforward to implement and do not require behavioral changes within an organization.
Third, installing a solar array has an immediate impact on ESG goals. Other ESG initiatives might have less-tangible results (for example, issuing a sustainability report or joining advocacy groups). Combined, these factors make solar cheaper, faster, and more tangible than other solutions.
Deciding whether to go solar should be relatively easy for middle market companies. However, getting a project up and running is more involved.
Large corporations and government entities often turn to a tendering or Request for Proposal (RFP) process. However, most mid-size business won’t have dedicated groups to evaluate vendors, proposals and to tackle challenges.
With some due diligence, working directly with a solar developer can be the best way to get a project completed efficiently and effectively. Middle market companies that can avoid expensive, drawn-out procurement exercises stand to benefit the most from this approach.
As skeptics have claimed, commercial solar energy projects typically come with high upfront costs and significant risk on installation quality and performance. When presenting solar as a viable business option, it is best to address these concerns first and ensure stakeholders that you’ve planned to partner with a reputable solar developer.

The paper said that wind generation over-performed compared with expectations and that solar recovered quickly after storm clouds passed. Solar did better than ERCOT models predicted and “contributed to helping keep more customers with power as the grid climbed out of its depths of load shedding.”
The white paper was prepared by Colorado-based grid analysis firm Vibrant Clean Energy.
The firm said that wind underperformed during a few periods over the course of the days-long storm, but that this underperformance “only lasted a few hours at a time.”
40,000 MW of storage would have met all of the February blackout requirements “with room to spare.”

And, looking to the future, the paper said that in a hypothetical high-renewable ERCOT grid, wind and solar variability would still persist, but that adding 40,000 MW of storage would have met all of the February blackout requirements “with room to spare.”
Covering California’s nearly 4,000-mile-long network of public water delivery canals with solar panels could be an economically feasible means of advancing both renewable energy and water conservation.
Researchers writing in the journal Nature Sustainability said that the solar panels would help prevent water loss through evaporation.
They said that pilot projects in India have shown the technical feasibility of several designs, but none have yet been deployed at scale. California’s canal network is among the world’s largest and the state faces both a drought-prone future and a rapid timeline to move to renewable energy. The researchers said that solar canals could address both challenges.
Canal-spanning solar panels are often supported by steel trusses or suspension cables. Both tend to be more expensive to build than support structures for ground-mounted solar panels. The researchers modeled costs in an effort to show how the benefits of solar canals outweighed the added costs for cable-supported installations. They said that cable-supported solar canals showed a 20-50% higher net present value, which they said indicated a higher financial return on investment.
Shade from solar panels also could help control the growth of aquatic weeds, a costly canal maintenance issue. And the study said that every megawatt of solar energy produced by solar canals in California’s Central Valley could replace 15-20 diesel-powered irrigation pumps.
Safari Energy said it has developed or acquired its 500th commercial-scale solar project. Its project are in 24 states and Washington, D.C., and have generated more than 618,000 MWh of electricity.
Founded in 2008, Safari Energy’s first project was a s3 kW solar system installed at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. In 2018, Safari Energy was acquired by utility PPL Corp. Since then Safari Energy has acquired more than 100 solar projects ranging from under 100 kW to over 20 MW.
The company’s 500th project, acquired recently, is a 2 MW solar system located at Chevron U.S.A. Inc.’s San Joaquin Valley Business Unit’s offices in Bakersfield, California.
Energy technology company Heliogen and global mining firm Rio Tinto will explore deploying concentrated solar technology with thermal energy storage at a borates mine in California.
Heliogen will deploy its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology, which uses heat from the sun to generate and store energy to power the mine’s industrial processes.
Heliogen technology will use AI to control mirrors that concentrate sunlight to capture energy used to make steam.

At the California mine, the Heliogen technology will use AI to control mirrors that concentrate sunlight to capture energy used to make steam. The system will also store captured energy in the form of heat, allowing it to power nighttime operations.
Heliogen’s installation will generate up to 35,000 pounds per hour of steam to power operations, with the potential to reduce carbon emissions at the mine site by around 7%.
Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden said they produced a structural battery that performs 10 times better than previous versions. The battery contains carbon fiber that serves as an electrode, conductor, and load-bearing material. The research could pave the way for essentially “massless” energy storage in vehicles and other technology.
A structural battery works as both a power source and as part of the structure, for example, in a car body. Calculations show that this type of multifunctional battery could reduce the weight of an electric vehicle.
The battery has an energy density of 24 Wh/kg. The researchers said this means roughly 20% capacity compared to comparable lithium-ion batteries currently available. Because vehicle weight can be reduced, less energy is needed to move the vehicle. And the battery’s stiffness suggests it can compete with other materials commonly used in vehicle production.
