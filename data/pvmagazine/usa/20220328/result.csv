About 1,000 registered Richland County voters were recently surveyed. Out of more than 575 respondents, almost 60% support solar energy development in Richland County, said project developer Savion. However, a 1995 town ordinance prevents the installation of large-scale solar facilities in Colfax.
The expected local benefits of the solar farm are causing zoning board members in Colfax to reconsider the law. For the first five years of the $300 million solar project’s revenues, the township would receive $1.4 million. Colfax has an annual budget between $80,000 to $90,000, and the Flickertail solar project alone would add more than $100,000 annually to that figure. The school district would receive $90,000 a year, $320,000 annually would go to the county budget, and $290,000 to the state of North Dakota’s budget.
All these financial benefits would stack on to the environmental benefit of adding 350MW of renewable, carbon-free energy to North Dakota’s grid. The Solar Energy Industries Association ranks North Dakota last in the union for solar deployment. As of Q4 2021, only 1.6MW of solar PV has been installed. There are 211 reported solar jobs across eight companies in the state. Flickertail would completely re-frame the North Dakota solar market, pioneering as the first true large-scale installation in the state.
Town board members are set to vote on the 1995 ordinance on Tuesday, April 5th. If the ordinance is overturned, Savion will then send its project to be approved by the state.
“We hope to work with the township to amend the ordinance to allow some common-sense rules,” said Gabriel Klooster, development director. Klooster said the project has been met with interest from local landowners. Sites have been selected for the 2,000 dispersed acres that would house the solar project.
Though the overall feedback has been favorable, the proposal to remove the ordinance has met resistance from Colfax town board chairman Stuart Gunness. Gunness cites resident concerns over the aesthetic effect of large solar fields in a rural area, calling the facilities “unsightly.” “It’s pretty much as black and white as that,” said Gunness.
If approved, the project would connect onsite to the Minnkota Power Cooperative’s Frontier-Wahpeton 230kV transmission line. Savion said it expects the interconnection agreement to be executed in Q3, 2024. Kansas City’s Savion has a project pipeline of 19.6GW of solar and energy storage projects spanning 161 projects in various phases. The company has active projects in 27 US states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/28/breaking-dept-of-commerce-to-move-forward-with-solar-anticircumvention-investigation/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COST AND PRICES,LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 28, 2022",BREAKING: Dept. of Commerce to move forward with solar anticircumvention investigation,"The Department of Commerce (DOC) has decided to act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar requesting that DOC review solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, announcing that it is launching an antidumping investigation into those companies.
Auxin’s petition alleges that solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam are using parts produced by Chinese companies, as a way to keep production cheap, while also skirting existing antidumping and countervailing (AD/CV) tariffs on Chinese goods, which have been in place since 2012.
The announcement of an investigation has begun to cast a dark shadow on the solar industry, as the findings of said investigation could massively disrupt supply for and the manufacture of solar modules, as about 80% of US crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.
Responses and Repercussions
In response to the decision, Auxin Solar released the following statement:
“For years, Chinese solar producers have refused to fairly price their products in the U.S. and have gone to significant lengths to continue undercutting American manufacturers and workers by establishing circumventing operations in countries not covered by those duties. We are grateful Commerce officials recognized the need to investigate this pervasive backdoor dumping and how it continues to injure American solar producers. Fair trade and enforcement of our trade laws are essential to rebuilding the American solar supply chain and making Solar in America again.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has also released a statement:
“Contrary to the Biden Administration’s goal of growing clean energy in the U.S., the Department of Commerce has decided to consider up to 50%-250% tariffs on the solar industry in the United States. This misstep will have a devastating impact on the U.S. solar market at a time when solar prices are climbing, and project delays and cancellations are adding up. The solar industry is still reeling from a similar tariff petition that surfaced last year. The mere threat of tariffs altered the industry’s growth trajectory and is one of the reasons why we’re now expecting a 19% decline in near-term solar forecasts. Taking up this case will have a chilling effect on the solar industry.”
Shortly after the decision was made public, Clean Energy Associates (CEA), a solar and storage technical advisory firm, offered insights into the potential repercussions of the investigation, in both the short- and long-term.
CEA attests buyers of cells and components from companies in the affected countries will likely face delayed shipments and manufacturer attempts to renegotiate term. As for companies in countries not under investigation that make up the remaining 20% of imports, there are a myriad of possibilities.
First and foremost, module and cell prices are expected to increase, potentially significantly. These sellers will likely shift their customer base to the US, rather than catering to domestic customers, however this won’t be a quick fix, as many of the non-listed countries with supply focus on the distributed generation segment as non-utility applications are better able to absorb price increases and afford suppliers better margins, according to CEA
The Petition
Since it was published, the Auxin Solar petition has been disparaged and disregarded by leading organizations across the solar industry, with John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy with the SEIA, calling it “a blatant attempt by Auxin to unfairly gain a competitive advantage, to the great detriment of other domestic module manufacturers and the American solar industry at large.”
Auxin’s petition is very similar to one that was thrown out by DOC in November 2021, but not identical. American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) filed a series of petitions in mid August seeking a Commerce Department investigation into its allegations that module imports from the three countries represented an attempt by the companies to skirt existing U.S. rules against dumping.
In a November 10 decision, Abdelali Elouaradia, director of DOC’s AD-CVD office, said that A-SMACC’s insistence to keep the names of its member companies from the public would “prevent Commerce from obtaining and considering” information related to an inquiry.
The difference in the Auxin petition is that, instead of focusing on specific yet unnamed companies, Auxin is asking for a review of entire countries.
AD/CVD tariffs can be as high as 50-250%, a level of uncertainty that has shuddered through the US solar industry. “Deployment is frozen,” said George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy in an interview with pv magazine. SOLV is among the largest utility-scale solar contractors in the United States, with a strong project pipeline of over 4GW across the nation.
Potential Impact
Hershman said the uncertainty caused by these tariffs is simply too much to digest in a utility-scale solar project, where module prices can account for 50% of the cost or more. SOLV‘s projects can exceed $300 million, so a 50-250% tariff would impose between $75 -$375 million in additional costs. This level of risk is untenable and is why Hershman describes the case as “an affront to the solar industry.”
The effects of US market uncertainty may already be showing, as LG announced it will close its solar module business and close its 550MW module assembly plant in Huntsville Alabama.
Outside of trade industry organizations, other American module manufacturers have also decried Auxin’s petition. Silfab Solar, a Canadian-owned manufacturer with 800MW of module manufacturing capacity located in Washington state, attested that a anticircumvention review would cause immediate and direct harm to American crystalline-silicon module producers, as these companies are dependent on imports of solar cells, because there is no commercial production capacity at all in the United States.
According to SEIA, the implementation of AD/CV tariffs would result in the loss of 14GW of new solar installations, a figure which represents more than half of what was installed in the US last year.
The move by Auxin has been seen as an attempt for the company to better position itself against foreign manufacturing competition and boost the power of American manufacturers, but Hershman shares that the implementation of AD/CV tariffs would have the exact opposite effect. 
In Hershman’s view, tariffs like the ones imposed by the Auxin case are temporary, short-term measures that won’t boost US manufacturing in a meaningful way. Long-term certainty is needed for a company to move a fabrication process to a new country. He called for industrial policy like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, includes numerous tax credits for US-based manufacturing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/28/distributed-solar-installed-in-2021-nearly-matches-capacity-of-all-new-gas-plants/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARIZONA,CALIFORNIA,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 28, 2022",Distributed solar installed in 2021 nearly matches capacity of all new gas plants,"Demand for electricity in the US is growing as more people power cars, appliances, and home heating with electricity rather than fossil fuels. But to be powered by clean energy, that electricity must be generated by renewable sources. According to the ILSR annual update, choosing to build renewable generation resources has become the norm rather than the “alternative.”
In 2021, for the first time ever, nearly half of new electric generation capacity added to the grid was from solar. Long overlooked as a scalable resource, the distributed solar installed in 2021 nearly matched the capacity of all gas plants built last year. And while this is a first, it is a trend that has been building because, in the last decade, there have been only two years in which the capacity from new gas plant construction outpaced renewable energy buildout.
The gap between gas and distributed solar has been narrowing for several years. In 2021, added gas and small solar capacity were almost equal; 5.7GW worth of gas plants were built this year, while developers installed 5.4GW worth of residential and customer solar.

According to SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, solar developers installed over 500,000 residential solar projects in 2021, despite many challenges including interconnection delays or other prohibitive policies set by utilities. However, there is some good news: thanks to a ruling by the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, utilities may be subject to antitrust litigation for their anticompetitive behavior.
Another challenge is net metering rule changes, as seen in California, Florida as well as other states. In Florida, for example, House Bill 741 and Senate Bill 1024 (passed and awaiting the Governor’s signature) aim to dramatically reduce the benefits of net metering for customers.
Also of concern is disproportionate support for wealthier Americans when it comes to going solar. According to research by the Rocky Mountain Institute, the current federal solar investment tax credit has disproportionately benefited wealthier, higher-income, and often whiter households. Changing this incentive to a refundable or direct pay tax credit would help more Americans go solar.
Despite these challenges, solar and other renewable generation resources are proving to be more cost-effective than fossil fuel generation.
Many states and cities have set resolutions to be carbon neutral in two or three decades. Many, however, need to rethink building new gas plants because with a lifespan of 40 years, the states would have little chance of meeting carbon-neutral goals.
Solar breaks records in fourth quarter 2021
New generation capacity in Q4 2021 was just under that of 2020’s: 14GW new gas, wind, large solar, and distributed solar resources came online. Both large and small solar broke their respective records for quarterly growth. Paired with a surge of new wind generation capacity (more than double the capacity added last quarter), renewable resources contributed 85%of generation capacity buildout this quarter.
Distributed solar broke records—again. Despite supply chain delays, 1.6GW of distributed solar capacity were installed in Q4 , breaking the previous quarter’s record. If the federal government extends or tweaks the federal investment tax credit, the demand for residential solar could grow even faster.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/28/construction-begins-for-meta-facebook-90-million-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TENNESSEE",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 28, 2022",Construction begins for Meta (Facebook) $90 million solar project,"Another solar project built to meet the needs of Meta (Facebook) operations is underway, with a 70MW project in Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory breaking ground recently. Silicon Ranch is the project developer, a firm that has partnered with the tech giant on numerous renewable energy projects in the past. 
The project, called McKellar Solar Farm, was launched through TVA’s Green Invest program. The program is a platform for corporations looking to meet their environmental and climate goals by investing in renewables projects in TVA territory. Under the program, corporations typically sign a contract to purchase the project’s solar energy for 20 years. 
Tennessee’s own Silicon Ranch will fund, own, operate, and maintain the solar project, which has an estimated cost of $90 million. 
“TVA is the nexus for reliable, economical renewable energy solutions, and we have already committed $3 billion to bring more than 2,000 MW of new solar to the Valley since 2018. This public-private partnership with Meta and Silicon Ranch demonstrates the strength of TVA’s community energy model to attract capital investment and high-quality jobs into the communities we serve while helping businesses meet their sustainability goals.” Doug Perry, TVA senior vice president, commercial energy solutions
The Metaverse is real
Last April, Facebook announced it supported 100% of its operations with renewable energy by the end of 2020. Now, it targets net-zero across all value chains by 2030. Over the last three years, the social media giant cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 94%, exceeding its initial 75% reduction goal.
Facebook is no stranger to participating in large solar projects. It partnered with Silicon Ranch on three projects in Georgia with a combined capacity of 287MW, another 120MW in Utah, 160MW of solar in Virginia, and has 475MW in total PV projects contracted under TVA’s Green Invest program.
Facebook’s aggressive renewable energy sourcing is an environmentally responsible decision, but the high level of procurement brings attention to an important point: the internet is not free. While we use words like the “cloud” or “Metaverse” describe where internet and data operations take place, there are real-world, physical and energy related costs to these services. It is estimated by the environmental organization Climate Care that servers are responsible for as much emissions as the global airline industry.
This idea of the internet as a physical thing constrained to natural resources was demonstrated in a Mozilla award winning concept project called Solar Protocol. The project connected a series of small data servers across the globe that are directly connected with solar PV and energy storage. When the sun shines in a given region on the planet, that region is activated as the host site for the cloud servers.
“How data is collected, managed, and trains AI systems has an impact on billions of lives. But that impact is often invisible. Creative Media Awards like Solar Protocol make the invisible visible,” said Kofi Yeboah, awards program officer at Mozilla.
This carbon intensity is only increasing with the advent of blockchain technology. One transaction of the cryptocurrency Ethereum is equivalent to the carbon impact of over 300,000 credit card transactions
“Solar Protocol is a great opportunity for us as artists to foreground issues of climate change and how technology is driving it,” said Tega Brain, an NYU professor and project lead. “The project has catalyzed conversations about AI and automation, as in-network user traffic is decided by solar energy. We are using intelligence from natural and dynamic versus a data-driven machine learning model… Why not think of planetary limits as intelligence? After all, they will shape the future of life on Earth whether we like it or not.”
Facebook has been able to rapidly accomplish its goals by becoming one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the world, contracting for around 1 GW of projects in 2020 alone. The company was the second-largest corporate procurer of renewable energy in 2019. It currently ranks third in the world on the list of renewable energy corporate buyers based on cumulative power purchase agreements since 2000, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

According to SunPower, the reasons behind the launch were twofold. According to the company’s 2021 Energy Sense Index, 40% of homeowners worry about outages every month. For customers in natural disaster-prone regions or California customers living in areas subject to frequent blackouts, these concern often become reality, for a few hours or even days at a time. The company also cites EIA data outlining  that the length of time an average American goes without electricity has doubled between 2013 and 2020.
“As power disruptions are becoming more commonplace, the demand for energy resilience and reliability is higher than ever,” said Nate Coleman, chief products officer at SunPower. “With the new SunVault, we are going beyond just the essentials. Customers can have the peace of mind that even if their grid service is disrupted, their lives don’t have to be.”
Under both battery configurations, the SunVault system can keep indispensable appliances running, like refrigeration and HVAC, while also allowing customers to keep power to non-essential, comfort appliances, like a pool pump, EV charger, or really anything in the home that runs on electricity.
Alongside the launch of the new battery configurations, SunPower also announced a new warranty for SunVault systems. All SunVault energy storage systems will come backed by a 10-year warranty, including 70% usable energy retention.
According to SunPower, the new SunVault is available for order now, with installations soon to come.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/28/arizona-requires-transparent-modeling-for-utility-resource-plans/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ARIZONA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 28, 2022",Arizona requires transparent modeling for utility resource plans,"The Arizona Technology Council became involved in the state’s energy policy based on a hunch. The council felt that a report by Ascend Analytics projecting the costs for Arizona to reach 50% clean energy by 2035 “overstated the costs to increase clean electricity resources,” said Steve Zylstra, the council’s president and CEO.
So the council joined with Ceres to hire Energy Futures Group to assess Ascend’s report. EFG had previously worked with solar trade group SEIA to analyze a Michigan utility’s resource plan, using the same planning model as the utility used, and found $100 million in potential customer savings from promptly adding 2GW of solar.
Ascend Analytics had prepared its report based largely on modeling conducted by Arizona utilities. EFG concluded that the Ascend report’s projections of the costs for Arizona utilities to reach proposed clean energy targets “are likely to be incorrect and generally overstated, especially for Arizona Public Service.”
EFG added that it lacked access to “key information” underlying the Ascend report, with “limited access to the utilities’ modeling files” on which the Ascend report relied. The Arizona Technology Council and Ceres included EFG’s report in a regulatory filing last October.
Arizona could “produce a more robust record” on which to base a regulatory decision, EFG  suggested, by enabling intervenors in proceedings on utility resource plans to have a license to use the same planning model used by the utility, at no cost. Several states already have such a provision, EFG said.
Early this month the Arizona Corporation Commission followed that suggestion, ordering three utilities to make their future resource modeling transparent and provide model access. The commission had previously rejected the proposed clean energy targets for 2035 and 2070, in a January vote.
A level field
“It’s hard to overstate how important leveling the modeling playing field is,” said Anna Sommer, lead author of EFG’s report. “As all modelers know, modeling simulations reflect the judgement of the modelers. It’s much more powerful to demonstrate the impact of differences in modeling assumptions on portfolio cost and resource selection, than it is to merely talk about what those differences might be.”
Solar and consumer advocates have long demonstrated how utilities have used modeling assumptions to block solar in their resource plans. But in New Mexico, Sommer said, modeling transparency allowed EFG to show that renewables, storage, and demand-side management could reliably and cost-effectively replace coal. And in Michigan, transparency let EFG show that including incentives for distributed solar would enable the utility to meet demand at a cost comparable to its preferred plan, she said.
Model access
The Arizona Corporation Commission’s order on transparency requires that Arizona Public Service, Tucson Electric and UNS Electric, when preparing future integrated resource plans, work with the provider of their utility modeling software to enable stakeholders, advocates and commission staff to perform their own modeling runs using that same software, “and to provide all necessary data and support to fully utilize the models.” The utilities must absorb the cost of the licensing fees.
The order does not apply to Phoenix-area utility Salt River Project because it is not regulated by the commission. Yet as SRP is now engaged in resource planning, “the issue of greater transparency and modeling access has come up in its advisory group discussions, especially in the wake of the commission’s decision,” said Jennifer Helfrich, senior manager of state policy at Ceres. The nonprofit Ceres had previously been involved in reviews of utility resource plans in Colorado and Michigan.
Solar recently provided 9% of Arizona’s electricity, according to SEIA. In neighboring states, solar generation has reached 26% in California, 18% in Nevada, 10% in Utah and 7% in New Mexico, SEIA data show.
