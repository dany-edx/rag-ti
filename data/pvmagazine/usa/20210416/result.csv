The Donoe Solar farm was originally built at a capacity of 4.8 MW in 2014. It was one of several projects heavily damaged by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in 2017. In the years since those two storms, the solar industry has reviewed the impact of hurricanes and moved to improve the resiliency of ground-mount solar systems, much like what the industry is doing with hail.
This increased focus on resiliency led to Polar’s selection for the reconstruction. BMR said it recognized that Polar’s PRU fixed-tilt racking system is engineered to handle heavy loads from wind, slopes, and a wide range of variable ground conditions.
“Polar and BMR conducted an extensive site investigation and component testing program to support the design of the racking structures and foundations,” said Vishal Lala, managing director of Polar Racking. “BMR is confident that the new racking and module attachment system will withstand future weather events.”
Polar and PRI Engineering, a geotechnical engineering consulting firm, visited the island last October to conduct a detailed geotechnical investigation and foundation testing plan.
Reconstruction is planned to start this spring, and Donoe is planned to be back in service before the end of the year. Polar’s scope of work is expected to take three months to complete. The facility will sell power to the Virgin Island Power and Water Authority (VIWAPA) under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
Donoe highlights Polar Racking’s ongoing focus on the Caribbean. They have previously installed over 20 MW of rooftop and ground-mount solar racking across the Caribbean including Barbados, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Belize, and other islands. Elsewhere, Polar has worked on projects all over Canada and the US, including ongoing projects in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Minnesota, and California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/16/ohio-regulators-approve-a-7x-proposal-for-a-107-mw-solar-project/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,OHIO",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 16, 2021",Ohio regulators approve a 7X proposal for a 107 MW solar project,"The Ohio Power Siting Board approved an application for a 107 MW solar facility in Fulton County, east of Toledo.
The application was submitted by Arche Energy Project and the installation is being sponsored by 7X Energy. The project would sit on roughly 600 acres and consist of photovoltaic arrays ground-mounted on a tracking rack system; no specific hardware details were available.
Energy generated at Arche Solar would be delivered to an existing substation located adjacent to a 138 kilovolt transmission line. The developers said they are still looking into the possibility of finding a power purchase agreement off-taker for the energy.
The project would boost Ohio’s total installed solar capacity, which currently sits at roughly 503 MW. Like Arche, most solar that has come online in Ohio has been utility scale. Despite the state’s modest start as a solar market, rapid growth is expected, with The Solar Energy Industries Association expecting the addition of 2.35 GW over the next 5 years, good for 12th-most in the nation over that span.
Final project design for Arche are expected to be completed in the third quarter. Construction could begin in the fourth quarter and be completed within 12 months.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/16/product-roundup-trina-solar-arctech-first-solar-schneider-electric-and-more/,"PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 16, 2021","Product roundup: Trina Solar, Arctech, First Solar, Schneider Electric, and more","Another week, another bunch of announcements! To stay up to date on what’s new, check out this latest clean energy product roundup:
Trina Solar launched the TrinaTracker Agile 1P Dual Row. The company said that the Agile 1P tracker is fully compatible with ultra-high power modules ranging from 400W to 670W+. The Agile series is a new member to the TrinaTracker family after the Vanguard series launched in December.
Agile 1P adopts the 1P Dual Row design with what the company said are four key technology advantages: higher reliability, greater power generation, optimized balance of system, and enhanced adaptability. SuperTrack algorithm delivers an extra yield gain of up to 8%. The Dual-Row design of Agile 1P shortens the tracker length to 72 meters, enabling installation of up to 120 modules per tracker, and achieving higher installation capacity under the same layout by 15.6%. More information is here.
Schneider Electric Solar said that its XW Pro solar hybrid inverter is now eligible for California’s energy storage rebates. Customers can install the XW Pro through the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), which provides rebates to support homeowners and communities in acquiring affordable energy storage in California.
Depending on their eligibility, SGIP recipients can receive up to $1,000 per kilowatt-hour for their qualifying energy resources. The company said its XW Pro offers a high overload power rating (1.75x). More information is here.
First Solar said that its Series 6 CuRe next-generation photovoltaic (PV) technology has a warranted degradation rate of 0.2% per year, which it said is the lowest rate for any commercially available PV product today based on publicly available information. It said the degradation rate is up to 60% lower than conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) products, and ensures that the module will retain at least 92% of its original performance at the end of its 30-year warranty. The degradation rate, combined with what the company said is a superior temperature coefficient, spectral response, and shading behavior, advances the Series 6 CuRe platform’s competitiveness in all markets. It said the enhanced performance is enabled by First Solar’s semiconductor-level innovation and its Copper Replacement (CuRe) program. CuRe, developed by the company’s scientists at its Silicon Valley and Ohio research and development (R&D) centers, replaces copper with atoms of Group V elements that enhance performance, delivering long-term stability. More information is here.
Arctech Solar has rebranded itself as Arctech and moved to new corporate headquarters in Kunshan, China. The company said that dropping “solar” from its brand name does not mean Arctech is abandoning solar from its business. It said the change better reflects its broader product portfolio and upgraded services. More information is here.
AMPLY Power is partnering with UES (Unique Electric Solutions) to offer a fleet electrification solution primed for V2G (vehicle-to-grid) opportunities being pursued by utilities and end customers. The approach includes repowering existing internal combustion engine trucks and buses with electric powertrains, charge management services, a V2G bi-directional EV charging system from Rhombus Energy Solutions, and baked-in coordination with the local utility.
The companies are deploying their joint solution for the Logan Bus Co., one of the largest school bus providers for the New York City Department of Education. More information is here.
Palmetto said it has launched operations in Southern California, specifically in service areas covered by utilities Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. California represents Palmetto’s 22nd state of operation.
Palmetto said that its technology, marketplace business model, and consumer mobile application are all designed to simplify and democratize access to clean energy, making it easier and more affordable to make the switch. Palmetto’s system helps homeowners estimate utility costs saved by switching to solar, work with a team of local solar experts to design and install a system that matches their needs, and receive comprehensive, long-term customer support. More information is here.
JinkoSolar Holding said it has joined the United Nations Global Compact, the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. Under the U.N. Global Compact, signatories are encouraged to align their operations and strategies with key principles. More information is here.
Stem Inc. said it completed six months operating a 345 MWh energy storage portfolio owned by Electrodes Holdings, which last year transferred portfolio control to Stem’s Athena smart energy software. Stem said that customers in the 86-site portfolio are now realizing more than 30% greater monthly energy savings on average compared to the previous software provider.
Within two months of being awarded the contract, Stem said it had onboarded to Athena management the portfolio that serves 25 large commercial and municipal customers in the Los Angeles area. Customers at these sites use Athena’s artificial intelligence and real-time decision-making to optimize energy storage systems and energy use. Stem also delivered local controllable capacity to an investor-owned utility where the portfolio is based. More information is here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/16/winterizing-texas-power-plants-makes-economic-sense-dallas-fed-says/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,POLICY,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 16, 2021","Winterizing Texas power plants makes economic sense, Dallas Fed says","Analysis from the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank said that winterizing electric generating units in Texas for extreme winter weather events “appears financially reasonable.”
The analysis came in the wake of a prolonged winter storm in mid February that killed more than 100 people and knocked out power to millions of customers served by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid.
Natural gas-fired power plants were especially impacted by the weather, as were wind turbines. Solar generation—although a small percentage of the state’s overall energy mix—contributed in the later days of the crisis, once snow and cloud cover cleared. Energy storage has not yet been deployed in sufficient amounts to contribute in a meaningful way.
The Dallas Fed said that while industry sources reported gas production difficulties occurred as wells and other installations froze, a larger disruption began when power was cut to the wells, processing plants, and compressor stations that move the gas into and along major pipelines serving power plants.
Early estimates indicate the freeze and power outages may cost the state’s economy $80 billion–$130 billion in direct and indirect economic loss.

The bank said that early estimates indicate the freeze and power outages may cost the state’s economy $80 billion–$130 billion in direct and indirect economic loss. Estimates of insured losses range from $10 billion to $20 billion.
The bank said that “every source of power generation failed during the storm,” and that measures to avoid future disruptions range from winterizing power plants to addressing the “efficacy of intermittent renewable generation.”
It said that a large and “perhaps inexpensive fix” would be to prioritize electricity delivery to natural gas infrastructure. It said that if power plant and pipeline operators improved coordination to identify and monitor the gas infrastructure, “some of the problems experienced during the freeze could be prevented.”
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) determined in a joint study following a nearly identical outage in February 2011 that winterizing equipment for Texas gas plants could cost between $50,000 and $500,000 (in 2011 dollars) per plant. Assuming those cost estimates remain valid and adjusted for inflation, the bank said that installing FERC’s/NERC’s recommended equipment on all 162 gas-powered plants in Texas could cost up to $95 million today.
It said that winterizing Texas’ 13,000 wind turbines carries other challenges. Blades with internal warming equipment installed at the factory can cost $400,000 per unit, making retrofits to existing turbines “infeasible.” It said, however, that upgraded blade coatings, cold-weather lubricants, and de-icing drones would mitigate ice formation in most instances at lower cost.
Although the total cost of the winter storm could exceed $100 billion, the bank said that the costs of winterizing electricity production “should be viewed within the perspective of value of lost load.” Using a VOLL estimate of $4.3 billion, and accounting for the once-a-decade frequency of subzero temperatures in Texas, the bank said that winterizing measures and other actions should be equal to or less than $430 million annually.
It concluded that “the most reasonable solutions to prevent winter storm blackouts are within the bounds of being economically justified.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/16/sunrise-brief-boulder-adds-2-1-mw-of-solar-at-11-city-owned-sites/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 16, 2021",Sunrise brief: Boulder adds 2.1 MW of solar at 11 city-owned sites,"The City of Boulder, Colorado, is now home to 2.1 MW of rooftop and ground-installed solar, marking the completion of its Generation Solar project.
Solar was installed on 11 city-owned sites, including parking garages, fire stations, and land adjacent to the city’s Water Resource Recovery Center.
Under agreements with the city, Madison Energy Investments and Unico Solar leased nearly 363,000 square feet of rooftop and ground area for the projects, which were installed by Namaste Solar. The entire portfolio is expected to generate more than 80 million kWh over 20 years and supports Boulder’s goals to operate on 100% renewable energy by 2030.
The city buys power produced by the arrays through separate purchase agreements. The project is expected to generate around $1.5 million in cumulative savings over 30 years. The agreements boost the city’s total solar portfolio to 6.45 MW.
Solar financing platform Mosaic announced a new $1.5 billion, multi-year loan purchase program with Congressional Bank. The program focuses on loans for solar energy systems, as well as battery storage. This partnership follows Mosaic’s recent announcement of closing a $331 million securitization of residential solar loans.
CS Energy and Eversource Energy have agreed to pay up to $310,000 in state fines in New Jersey for allegedly violating state environmental laws, leading to pollution in a stream and other protected areas.
The settlement with the state attorney general’s office alleges that, while building an 11.7-acre solar array in Southampton, east of Philadelphia, in 2018 and 2019, Eversource and CS Energy violated regulations under the Wetlands Protection Act and Clean Waters Act. Eversource owns the array and CS Energy carried out the construction.
Construction caused sediment-laden stormwater to flow off the array site and into tributaries that feed into a stream. By the end of 2018, the sediment discharges were alleged to have clogged one of the streams.
The complaint also alleges that CS Energy did not comply with an enforcement order issued from the Southampton Conservation Commission intended to control erosion and sedimentation.
SunPower said it has repaid its $30 million, 8.5% fixed interest loan with the California Enterprise Development Authority. The company said it plans to retire the balance of its outstanding 2021 convertible bond issue during the second quarter. The early repayment is part of SunPower’s plan to deleverages its balance sheet. The company said it is making “significant progress” on a number of financing-related initiatives, including efforts to shift its residential sales model to more systems sales. The company said it expects its effective cost of capital for residential leases and loans to now be below 6%.
