Called Aggie Power, the project is expected to generate enough clean energy to power about one-third of the university’s 900-acre Las Cruces campus by this fall. The project includes 3 MW of solar panels on single-axis trackers and a 1 MW Tesla battery energy storage system.
Aggie Power is the result of a new partnership between NMSU and utility El Paso Electric (EPE), under which EPE will own, operate, and maintain the project. The utility received state regulatory approval of a special rate contract application in August 2020, allowing the project partners to move forward. Construction kicked off in mid-December with the arrival of the solar panels and battery packs.
EPE CEO Kelly A. Tomblin said the utility is “always looking for creative partnerships with our customers to provide options for more sustainable solutions that will benefit the region and our environment.”
According to NMSU Director of Utilities and Plant Operations Pat Chavez, the university has several smaller solar projects throughout the Las Cruces campus, but Aggie Power will be the largest source of green energy once finished. He said it will be one of three energy sources powering the main campus and give NMSU more flexibility in managing its utility rates and receiving energy.
“The major benefit is that we’ll be able to receive power during the noon-to-early-evening window, usually when the energy demand is at its peak,” explained Chavez. “If we can receive solar power at that optimal time, it means Aggie Power will allow NMSU to lower the need for energy during the time in which energy costs are at their highest and rely on less power from conventional natural gas-powered energy.”
In addition to providing NMSU with a source of renewable energy, Aggie Power also will serve as a living laboratory for faculty and students majoring in electrical engineering.

According to the regulators, the power generated from the solar facility will be sold into a regional wholesale market and the project is estimated to cost $125 million.
Wild Hill Solar, a subsidiary of EDF Renewables, said that if the project clears all of the remaining permitting approvals, construction could begin this year, with a commercial operation date slated for 2022.
The construction of this project would be huge for West Virginia, as it would be far and away the largest solar installation in the state. In fact, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), West Virginia is currently home to just 10.5 MW of solar capacity, spread out across 359 installations, ranking it 49th among all states.
Not only would this project be unlike anything else the state has seen from a capacity standpoint, but it would also represent exponentially more financial investment in solar. SEIA estimated that the state’s total solar investment thus far sits at $33.31 million, roughly a quarter of Wild Hill’s estimated cost.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/16/hawaiian-electric-surpasses-rps-target-on-path-to-100-renewables/,"MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,HAWAII",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Hawaiian Electric surpasses RPS target on path to 100% renewables,"Hawaiian Electric reached a 34.5% consolidated renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 2020. That performance exceeded the interim state mandate and put the utility on a path toward meeting Hawaii’s 100% by 2045 RPS goal.
The 34.5% is the consolidated RPS for Oahu, Hawaii Island, and Maui County, and represents an increase from 28.4% in 2019. Hawaiian Electric said it surpassed the state requirement to reach 30% by 2020 and has more than tripled the amount of renewable energy on its electric grids in 10 years, up from just under 10% in 2010.
President and CEO Scott Seu said that exceeding the state’s 2020 mandate “underscores Hawaiian Electric’s commitment to replace imported fossil fuels” and become carbon neutral by 2045.
The RPS represents the renewable energy used by customers as a percentage of total utility sales.
In 2020, Maui County reached a 50.8% RPS, hitting the 50% mark for the first time. With a mix of solar, wind, and biofuels, Maui County’s RPS represents a nearly 25% increase from its 40.8% RPS in 2019. Meanwhile, Hawaii Island hit a 43.4% RPS, compared to 34.7% in 2019.
Oahu recorded a 30.5% RPS, exceeding 30% for the first time and notching a five percentage-point improvement from 25.2% in 2019.
Seu called Oahu’s progress “especially significant” because there’s less land available on the island for utility-scale projects and high demand for rooftop solar.
According to Hawaiian Electric, total electricity generated by renewable energy resources rose 13% in 2020 over 2019. The utility credited the year-over-year increase in part to a 55% rise in rooftop solar installations, and a full year of production from the 20 MW West Loch Solar project and the three Clearway Energy utility-scale projects, which have a combined capacity of 110 MW.
The company said there are now 87,848 solar systems and 3.7 million solar panels–including rooftop and grid-scale facilities– producing electricity on the five island grids. Those numbers are expected to grow following Hawaiian Electric’s January launch of its Quick Connect program for new residential solar installations.
Hawaiian Electric’s next RPS milestone required by state law is 40% by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/16/sony-lab-and-lf-energy-partner-to-advance-peer-to-peer-microgrid/,"MICROGRID,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Sony lab and LF Energy partner to advance peer-to-peer microgrid,"A novel approach to automating the peer-to-peer distribution of renewable energy through a microgrid has been announced by LF Energy and Sony Computer Science Laboratories.
The initiative, called Hyphae, aims to make microgrids more resilient. It envisions doing that by adapting the Sony business unit’s Autonomous Power Interchange System software to work with AC grids.
The partners said that enabling resilient, peer-to-peer microgrid energy trading will allow even the most remote communities to store and distribute energy without connecting to large-scale power stations or distribution networks.
As envisioned, Hyphae will enable the connection of buildings, homes, and energy-consuming devices to energy-producing devices like storage, EV batteries, and PV. At the core is physical peer-to-peer (P2P) trading.

The energy sector is a “complicated beast” that is shifting from centralized fossil-fired generation to distributed resources, said Dr. Shuli Goodman, executive director of LF Energy in an interview with pv magazine USA.
She said that the grid of the future likely will not be a grid at all, but something closer to the mass of branching, threadlike organisms known as hyphae that underlie forest structures. That means the future grid would be made up of cloud, data, artificial intelligence, 5-G communications, and edge computing, which brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed.
LF Energy is a Linux Foundation nonprofit seeking to accelerate the energy transition of the world’s grids and transportation systems through open source. The organization was recently invited to take part as the Biden administration worked to develop its climate plan. Goodman outlined to the incoming administration a series of recommendations including :
Open source gained an advocate in the new administration when Biden named David Recordon – who has a background in open source, open standards, and security – to serve the new White House Director of Technology.
The partnership with Sony that was announced February 16 is expected to bring LF Energy closer to its goal of building an interoperable AC- and DC-ready microgrid that is self-contained, operational off-grid, and able to connect to an electrical distribution network with utility oversight.
“I think we are at the very beginning of being able to harness, control, and optimize both supply and demand,” Goodman said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/16/sunrise-brief-texas-grid-struggles-to-recover-from-winter-storm-massive-outages/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021","Sunrise brief: Texas grid struggles to recover from winter storm, massive outages","Mother Nature messed with Texas, not to mention large swaths of the South, as a major winter storm vexed transmission grid operators and power providers starting Valentine’s Day.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) was already dealing with frozen wind turbines in West Texas and limited natural gas supplies to power plants on Feb. 14, when a significant number of additional generating units tripped offline as weather worsened Sunday night.
By Monday, ERCOT reported that around 34,000 MW of generation was offline, including renewables, fossil generation, and nuclear power plants. ERCOT has a total winter generating capacity of around 85,000 MW. Demand was forecast to reach around 74,000 MW on Monday, but fell through the day to around 45,000 MW.
Record demand for power as the cold  set in was met by ERCOT-mandated load shedding as supply and demand curves narrowed to unacceptable margins. Reserve margins at one point Monday were around 1,000 MW. By around 7:30 a.m. central time on February 16, operating reserves stood at 1,480 MW.

CPS Energy, which serves the San Antonio region, said it set a winter demand record of nearly 5 GW on Monday. It said that if  outages had not been imposed, then winter energy demand would have exceeded summer maximums for the first time in its history.
Austin Energy said that the sheer size of the load shedding hurt its ability to rotate outages among customers, leaving some people without power since early Monday morning. It said that in normal emergencies, outages are rotated throughout its service area. This time, however, the utility was unable to do that because there were no available non-critical load circuits to put into outage rotation.
By 4 p.m. Monday, ERCOT said that it had restored around 2,500 MW of load. It instructed transmission owners to shed around 14,000 MW of load, down from 16,500 MW earlier in the day.
Next door, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) declared a Level 2 Energy Emergency Alert beginning at 7:22 am central time on Feb. 15. The grid operator warned that operating conditions could continue to tighten through the week because of the winter weather event, as well as “an inadequate supply of natural gas” to fuel an unspecified number of gas-powered electric generation units.
Meanwhile, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) said that it lost both generation and transmission due to the cold weather. The loss led to emergency actions in the region’s western portion to avoid a “larger power outage on the bulk electric system.” Periodic power outages began early Monday morning for some customers in Southeast Texas.
Texas operates its own electric power grid, which covers much of the state. In order to remain free from federal regulatory oversight, the grid has relatively few ties to the rest of the U.S. grid. As a result, ERCOT’s independent structure leaves the state largely unable to import energy when the grid is stressed.
Appalachian Power issued a Request for Proposals (RFPs) for up to 300 MW of solar and/or wind generation resources. The request for bids is the first in a series of RFPs Appalachian Power will issue in 2021 to comply with provisions of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).
Under the VCEA, Appalachian Power must meet annual targets as it works toward 100% carbon-free energy in its Virginia service territory by 2050. The company is seeking facilities that are at least 50 MW in size and commercially operational by mid-December 2023. It said that proposals with an operational date of no later than Dec. 15, 2024 also would be considered. Bidders may also include proposals with an option for a battery storage system.
Under the RFP, Appalachian Power may acquire a single or multiple solar and/or wind facilities from winning bidders who meet certain economic and operational criteria. Proposals that qualify for federal tax credits are preferred, but not required.
To qualify for consideration, solar projects must be located in Virginia. Wind projects located in Virginia are preferred, but not required. All projects must be interconnected to PJM, the independent regional transmission organization that manages the electric grid in 13 states, including Virginia. Proposals must be submitted by March 31.
Canadian Solar said it closed its Japan Green Infrastructure Fund. The Fund secured $208 million of committed capital that will be used to develop, build, and accumulate new solar projects in Japan. The Fund will also consider green bond placements and project finance loans as it expands its asset portfolio. The Fund marks Canadian Solar’s first platform entry into the private institutional capital pool.
