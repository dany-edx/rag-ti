The project represents an investment of at least $1 billion, said developer Savion.
Tax revenues for Ohio are estimated to range between $242 million and $504 million over the 30 to 35 year life of the solar facility. Building the project would result in the creation of over 3,000 construction jobs. A full economic analysis for public record can be found here.
A record of public comments and related documents under review by the siting board can be found here. Over 200 comments have been submitted. A public hearing was scheduled for 5 p.m. on April 11 at Jonathan Alder High School in Plain City, Ohio.
“As a resident of Plain City I am always thrilled with new opportunities for our county to grow. Approving the Oak Run Solar project will bring a lot of potential for growth through the millions of dollars it will bring the county’s tax base along with investments in education. I enthusiastically support Oak Run,” said resident David Quinones in a public comment.
The massive solar project would be installed on 6,000 acres of land in rural Madison County, Ohio. If approved, construction would begin in 2023, with commercial operations coming online in phases starting in 2025.
A comprehensive study of the economic effects on the local and state economy was submitted to the siting board as part of the publicly available review process. Nearly 1,500 Madison County construction jobs would be created, and over 3,000 for the state. Over 63 permanent operations and maintenance jobs would be supported by Oak Run.
Oak Run solar would also include 300 MW of Tesla battery energy storage, which is expected to have a 20-year lifespan. Design submissions on public record call for the installation of modules supplied by most Tier 1 solar module providers, including Canadian Solar, JA Solar, Jinko Solar, Longi, Maxeon, Titan Vertex/Trina Solar, VSun, and US-based First Solar. Trackers may include single-axis tracking from GameChange Solar, Nextracker, Array Technologies, and FTC Voyager. Sungrow was selected as inverter provider.
The report included an economic land use analysis regarding the purchase of the agricultural land for the new facility.
Using a real-options analysis, the land use value of solar purchasing far exceeds the value for agricultural use in Madison County.
The price of corn would need to rise to $21.31 per bushel or yields for corn would need to rise to 462.6 bushels per acre by the year 2056 for corn farming to generate more income for the landowner and local community than the annualized solar payment. At the time of the report, September 2022, corn was sold for $5.45 per bushel and yields were 210.1 bushels per acre. 
Alternatively, the price of soybeans would need to rise to $62.55 per bushel or yields for soybeans would need to rise to 167.2 bushels per acre by the year 2056 for soybean farming to generate more income than Oak Run. At the time of this report, soybean prices were $13.10 per bushel respectively and yields were 62.2 bushels per acre.
“What a tragedy. Oak run project. 5,000 acres of corn equal 1,100,000 bushels of corn every year. Over 50% Kokomo soil, some of the best in the world. I am not against solar panels. I am against solar panels replacing GOD given soil. No amount of money is worth our soil,” said resident Tim Kronk in public comment.
Agrivoltaics, or the practice of co-locating crop production with solar energy facilities, is a practice being evaluated worldwide for mutual benefits to both the solar equipment and the yield of crops.
As much as $300 million in funding would be generated for local public schools in direct result of the project.
“I believe projects like Oak Run will be able to provide more opportunities for long-term investments that will make sure our county has the resources to ensure our school systems are well funded and there are job opportunities,” said resident Gabriel Torres in public comment.

Rouse in 1982 has turned its attention to rooftop solar accessibility.
Enterprise Community Partners, a Washington, D.C. -based affordable housing group which has invested $54 billion to date to create 873,000 affordable homes, this week partnered with the DC Green Bank to fund $12.4 million towards a 2.2 MW rooftop solar portfolio.
Enterprise will install rooftop and solar canopy systems at four affordable housing complexes in the metropolitan D.C. region. Funded by the Green Bank and Enterprise’s community development financial institution, the Enterprise community loan fund, the rooftop solar investment will bring solar to 536 households. Rooftop solar will be installed on Enterprise’s Arbor View and Randle Hill apartment communities in Ward 8. Additional solar carports and EV charging stations will be installed at The Overlook at Oxon Run in Ward 8 and Edgewood Commons in Ward 5.
Underscoring Enterprise’s commitment to ESG investing, solar panels used across its D.C. buildings are expected to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 1,794 tons of carbon dioxide each year. Over time a new community solar program will be offered to residents, providing subscribers a 25% discount on their electric bills. Enterprise Community Development, working with local community providers and installer Prospect Solar, will also offer a complete workforce development program to residents interested in a career in solar energy.
The announcement marks the second phase of a long-term effort to install solar panels across Enterprise Community Development’s entire building portfolio. When complete, more than 3,000  housing units will benefit from solar power.
The solar investment is being supported by Solar Revenue Put production insurance from kWh Analytics, enabling Enterprise to deploy more capital with lower financing risk.
Within the Inflation Reduction Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund provides $7 billion in government funding to low-income and disadvantaged communities who deploy clean energy resources, including distributed technologies on residential rooftops. Under the GGRF, an additional $19.97 billion in awards is also available to qualified projects that reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution, with $8 billion of that funding group carved out for low-income and disadvantaged communities.
“We are hopeful that the low-income ITC adders will apply once these solar panels are placed into service this year, but this is subject to the application process that has yet to be released by the US Treasury,” said John Fox, solar development manager at Enterprise Community Development.
“The IRA is a gamechanger that will unleash tens of billions of dollars for direct investment in communities, and hundreds of billions more in tax and financial incentives,” Jean Nelson-Houpert, interim chief executive officer of the DC Green Bank told pv magazine USA. “We stand ready to ensure that D.C. gets its fair share of these resources and that we harness them to support the delivery of clean, affordable, and renewable solar energy that prioritizes disadvantaged communities.”
The DC Green Bank funds solar energy, energy efficiency and building retrofits, as well as stormwater infrastructure, and EV charging systems across the DC region. In 2022, the Green Bank issued $26 million in capital, a record year compared to $3 million and $2 million issued in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately eight of the Bank’s 20 total FY 2022 loan transactions financed solar projects.
To date the Green Bank has funded 18 solar rooftop projects in Ward 8 and seven rooftop solar projects in Ward 5, where Enterprise will deploy 2.2 MW of new installations.
In May 2022, the Green Bank teamed up with solar developer PosiGen on a $7 million transaction to install 300 residential solar projects across the District for low-to-moderate income (LMI) residents, including houses in Ward 5 and 8. A month later, the Green Bank partnered with Howard University and Volt Energy to deploy 1.5 MW of solar resources in a $6 million deal to finance solar installations across the D.C. university’s campus, representing the largest solar deployment on a historically black college and university (HBCU) campus.
Founded in 1982 by James and Patty Rouse, Enterprise Community Partners is the the fifth largest non-profit housing provider in the US, which built 873,000 affordable homes in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/27/trade-policy-supply-chain-murk-waters-for-utility-solar-growth/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 27, 2023","Trade policy, supply chain murk waters for utility solar growth","The full impact of the Inflation Reduction Act from the extension of the Investment Tax Credit for solar and the advent of a storage ITC has not created smooth sailing for the utility solar market. The 2022 storm of challenging trade policy, supply chain constraints and rising equipment costs curbed utility solar installations to 10 GW, halting year-over-year growth for the first time since 2017.
A recent report from Wood Mackenzie, 2023 Outlook: Brighter skies for US solar in 2023?, indicates the utility solar development market will reset in 2023 back to achieving a growth clip, but first after tradewinds subside and the IRS provides clarity on tax credit adders to the massive IRA’s adders.
In 2022 the anti-circumvention investigation by the Department of Commerce froze project installations and power purchase agreement negotiations, as 85% of total module imports could be subject to tariffs of up to 240%. The government’s implementation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) limited module supply as Customs Border and Protection (CBP) seized module shipments until buyers proved the traceability of quartzite.
UFLPA-detained modules are starting to be released from a 9 GW seizure by customs, and Wood Mackenzie cites another industry report for clarity on this number. The 2022 actions reduced module supply by 18% compared to 2021, though smooth sailing is expected by second half 2023 as shipments of modules are released and stability sets in.
Various media reports over the fall, as well as a research note by ROTH Capital Partners managing director Philip Shen, reported the customs authority released detained models between October and December.
The fine print from the IRA has painted 2023 as a transitionary year in which the IRS and various agencies interpret and lay out the many bullet points that the IRA outlines for the solar industry, including prevailing wage and apprenticeship mechanisms, the energy community, domestic content, and low income benefit adders, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit (AMTC).
In the months following the IRA’s passing, various global suppliers announced a commitment to source over 72 GW of solar manufacturing capacity in the US by 2026, buttressed by the guaranty of the AMTC for a domestically sourced supply chain.
The creation of the US Solar Buyer Consortium, a collective of developers forming a pact to buy US-made modules, made an effort behind the sourcing of $6 billion of US solar panels. The consortium created long-term partnerships to supply up to 7 GW of panels annually starting in 2024, with First Solar, Enel and QCells among the companies making commitments to produce American PV modules.
Wood Mackenzie projects the share of utility solar-plus-storage developments in 2023 will surpass 30% of the share of solar projects to add energy storage, an increase from 25% throughout 2022, thanks to the passage of the standalone storage ITC and long-term certainty from the 30% solar ITC.
Batteries are increasing in corporate offtake agreements as companies seek out 24/7 clean energy, demand charge reduction and virtual power plant methods of supporting their environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy. With more than 33 GW of utility projects having a commercial operations date in 2023, Wood Mackenzie expects more than 7 GW of storage to come online this year.
The research firm projects that 8 GW of end-of-life cycle solar assets, or projects that will reach at least ten years of operating life, will provide repowering, decommissioning or otherwise module recycling opportunities in the year ahead. With many states increasing the scrutiny over the cost of reusing silicon and copper, companies such as SolarCycle are finding utility partners such as Silicon Ranch to avoid modules entering the trash heap.
European influence on the US renewable energy market, with Enel, EDF and RWE becoming further integrated in the US solar market, has created a more experienced set of domestic module sourcing, recycling and repowering opportunities, as many European firms have already experienced the headwinds of the US industry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/27/lg-energy-solution-sees-record-profit-in-q4/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,SOUTH KOREA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 27, 2023",LG Energy Solution sees record profit in Q4,"LG Energy Solution announced its whole year earnings of $223.7 million (KRW 25.6 trillion) in consolidated revenue and $9.7 million (KRW 1.2 trillion) in operating profit, marking a year-on-year increase of 44% and 58% respectively.
In the conference call, the company revealed it’s increasing its 2023 revenue target by 25% to 30% from the previous year, through the expansion and stable operation of global manufacturing facilities, as well as increasing sales in the North American region.
The company is attributing the record high revenue to its ability to meet increased demand for EV batteries and power grid energy storage systems (ESS), in addition to raising prices.
“Thanks to economies of scale led by sales growth, cost saving achieved through improving productivity, and expanding price-competitive metal sourcing, annual operating profit has also shown a significant growth compared to the previous year,” said Chang Sil Lee, CFO of LG Energy Solution on the conference call.
LGES also reported Q4 consolidated revenue increased by 12% from the previous quarter, marking a record high. Year on year it was up 92%, which the company attributes to increased EV battery sales growth in utility-scale ESS.
“Despite positive effects of economies of scale led by shipment growth and continuous improvement in productivity, the fourth quarter operating profit has seen a temporary drop on quarter due to one-off factors such as the recognition of employees’ incentives in line with the sound annual financial results and incremental expenses for ESS battery replacement,” explained LGES. “Excluding the one-off impacts, the operating profit remained similar to the previous quarter.”
In 2020, LG Energy Solution was formed after being spun off from LG Chem, and it debuted on the Korea Exchange in January 2022. In 2017 LG Chem was the first international player to enter the US residential battery market, and now, as LGES, it is firmly established in the burgeoning US battery market for electric vehicles.
LGES also announced that it will pursue 25% to 30% increase in the annual consolidated revenue in 2023, and plans to double its capex over the previous year.
“We aim to meet our annual target revenue mainly through the expansion and stable operation of global manufacturing facilities, as well as sales expansion in the North American region,” explained LGES. “We will also continue to enhance the operating profit by improving the cost curve and advancing differentiations in product competitiveness.”
Earlier this month, LGES signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with three Hanwha Group companies to collaborate on battery manufacturing equipment and battery technologies. The MoU positions LGES firmly in the US market by reinforcing its business portfolio in three sectors: advanced automotive batteries, mobility and IT batteries, and ESS batteries.
In August of 2022, LGES and Honda announced plans to invest $4.4 billion and establish a new joint venture manufacturing plant in the United States that is expected to have an annual production capacity of approximately 40 GWh. The pouch-type batteries produced at the new plant will be supplied exclusively to Honda facilities in North America.
Previously, LGES and GM announced a joint venture, Ultium Cells LLC, after securing a $2.5 billion loan from the US Energy Department to help finance construction of new lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan.
LGES announced in its conference call that it plants to further expand its global production capacity to 300 GWh by the end of this year. Its production capacity in North America is expected to reach 55 GWh, in Poland and Asia, 90 GWh and in South Korea and China, 155 GWh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/27/bipartisan-group-files-to-repeal-solar-tariff-moratorium/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CAMBODIA,CHINA,MALAYSIA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 27, 2023",Bipartisan group files to repeal solar tariff moratorium,"A small coalition of Democrat and Republican congress members filed legislation to repeal the pause on tariffs shipped from four Southeast Asian countries responsible for 80% of the US supply of solar modules. 
“We cannot allow foreign solar manufacturers to violate trade law, especially when it comes at the expense of American workers and businesses,” wrote Congressman Dan Kildee (D-MI), who filed the repeal attempt via the Congressional Review Act. He was joined by Republicans Bill Posey (FL), Bob Latta (OH), and Garret Graves (LA), as well as Democrats Bill Pascrell (NJ) and Terri Sewell (AL). 
Since March 2021, the solar industry has reeled from potential tariffs on goods manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, four nations alleged of harboring Chinese goods in violation of anti-circumvention laws. 
Tariffs on solar goods enforced under anti-circumvention laws have historically exceeded 50% to 250%. The looming threat of tariffs created an untenable level of risk that cascaded into cancelled and delayed projects. The effect was so stark that it led the Solar Energy Industries Association to cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year.
About 20% of utility-scale solar capacity was delayed or cancelled in the first half of 2022 due to supply problems and uncertainty. This uncertainty was temporarily lifted when President Joe Biden placed a 24-month moratorium on solar tariffs from the four nations on June 5, 2022.
The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024, and installed project sites before December 2024.
(Read: “White House freezes solar tariffs: An industry reacts“)
On December 2, 2022, the US Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that numerous major and minor suppliers in Southeast Asia are in violation of anticircumvention laws.
“The Biden administration found in its own investigation that China is evading U.S. tariffs on solar imports, but has paused action on this matter, which is unacceptable,” said Kildee. The repeal will “help America’s domestic solar manufacturing industry grow to meet our nation’s energy needs,” he said. 
“The Biden Administration continues to put American manufacturers last,” said Congressman Latta.
Last August, the Biden Administration passed a record-breaking $370 billion package, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), supporting climate and energy measures, including over $60 billion in rich incentives the domestic manufacture of solar components and other cleantech. But solar industry members say the US needs time to build its manufacturing capacity, and cutting off supply of panels now would be detrimental to the effort to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.
“The world is not yet on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, but solar can help us change that trajectory,” said Scott Wiater, president and chief executive officer, Standard Solar. “The U.S. can play a big role, but to lower carbon emissions sufficiently and achieve our country’s climate goals, we have to deploy 70 GW of solar a year in the next few years.”
The US currently produces about 7.5 GW of solar panels per year. The IRA could increase that number to 15 GW over the next two years, “but that would still not be nearly enough capacity to rely solely on domestic panels,” said Wiater.
(Read: “Solar tariffs are not the answer”)
The Congressional Review Act resolution will expire after 60 days if not passed. If Biden’s policy is repealed, the move would heavily damage solar panel supply and project installations in the near term.
“Fair trade cannot exist where one side plays by the rules and the other lies, cheats, and circumvents like the Chinese Communist Party. Last year the Commerce Department wisely heeded our bipartisan calls to probe CCP corruption in producing solar cells and modules. They confirmed that our trade laws are being evaded by Chinese solar companies. We need strong tariffs now,” said Congressman Pascrell.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/27/town-recoups-2-3-million-in-back-taxes-with-solar-on-a-landfill/,"GUEST POST,INSTALLATIONS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW JERSEY",,"JANUARY 27, 2023",Town recoups $2.3 million in back taxes with solar on a landfill,"There are over 10,000 closed landfills in the United States, and it has been determined that closed landfills could host more than 60 GW of solar capacity – enough to power 7.8 million homes, according to a 2021 study by RMI, and this figure is rapidly increasing with the growing number of landfill projects in the past two years. CEP Renewables, for example, currently has 16 landfill or brownfield solar projects under development, and the company reports that its most recently completed 25.6 MW Mount Olive, project is the largest landfill solar project in North America.
CEP was selected by the Township of Mount Olive, New Jersey to redevelop the former Combe Fill North Landfill Superfund site into a revenue generating, solar energy asset. The landfill had been operating as a municipal sanitary landfill for fifteen years. In the early 1980s the owner went bankrupt, the property was abandoned and the landfill closed.
Like many former landfills, the property was listed on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Priorities List of Superfund sites. Due to its improper closure, runoff from the landfill was draining into local creeks and contaminating groundwater that nearly 10,000 community members depended on.
The town was also losing tax revenue, as $2.3 million was still owed in back taxes on the abandoned land. Most commercial developers also did not want to purchase the property because environmental restrictions and New Jersey environmental requirements meant that no commercial uses could be built on the sensitive, capped landfill without risking piercing the landfill’s protective seal. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) eventually determined that it would only allow a solar facility to be built on this former landfill site and the Township adopted a redevelopment plan permitting a solar array.
Public-private partnership
CEP’s team of landfill and brownfield experts negotiated a unique public-private partnership with the Township and NJDEP that allowed CEP to purchase the landfill by way of the redevelopment and tax lien foreclosure process. As part of the agreement, CEP agreed to pay the back taxes to the Township over time in addition to redeveloping the land into a tax revenue-producing solar field.
The deal also involved an administrative consent order between the NJDEP and CEP that stated that in exchange for CEP agreeing to redevelop the land and take over long-term maintenance of the cap, the State of New Jersey would assume all liability for air pollution and water contamination associated with the site.
The solar installation includes approximately 57,000 450 W Boviet solar modules with a Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric Industrial Systems (TMEIS) inverter. The project won the 2021 Award for Innovation in Governance from the New Jersey League of Municipalities, and it now serves as a financial and legal model for the myriad other closed landfill sites throughout the U.S. to follow.
“Only a small fraction of the 10,000 closed landfills across the U.S. have been converted into solar fields. The unique structure we used to implement this project now serves as a model that can be leveraged to redevelop more closed landfills into revenue producing assets that facilitate cleaner air, tax revenue, jobs, and more affordable energy for residents,” said Chris Ichter, executive vice president at CEP Renewables
Landfill settlement analysis
Landfill settlement analysis is critical in order to ensure that the design and construction preparation is adequate for installing the solar array atop the landfill, while avoiding damage to its protective layer. The stability and slopes of various sections of the landfill need to be determined through this analysis, which will then help with specifying where the best locations to enable site access are, given that there will be obstructions that need to be considered.
Image: CEP Renewables
CS Energy completed a thorough landfill settlement analysis on this site prior to designing and engineering the solar installation and developing the site access plans. The company was able to use its experience on over 200 MW of landfill solar projects to conduct this analysis, which included the use of ground penetration radar, to determine landfill weight requirements and the safest access points. CS Energy planned out the cable tray locations to ensure access in and out of each of these key areas, which is crucial not only for the installation of the solar system, but also for ongoing operations and maintenance work  in the long term.
Based on this analysis, CS Energy used only tracked equipment and, where required, low ground bearing pressure machines. Ultimately, CS Energy was able to design and build this project on time and on budget, without affecting the landfill cap, as a result of its significant preparation work and extremely cautious construction at each stage of the project’s design and construction.
Value engineering
Being the largest landfill solar project in North America, every slight increase in product cost is multiplied and compounded across the entirety of this immense project. Terrasmart, the racking and mounting provider, had seen concrete costs rising, which affected the cost of its ballast blocks. This presented a challenge, as mounting solution companies need to be able to minimize the tilt of the solar array in order to reduce the amount and size of blocks needed, while still ensuring high energy yields from the solar array.
Additionally, in cold climate locations, the solar array tilt cannot be so low that an inordinate amount of snow is able to pile up and cause a great deal of stress on the racking system. This is particularly important for projects like the Mount Olive project, which are located on top of a sensitive landfill cap that cannot be pierced.
The GLIDE solution
Leveraging its experience on several other large-scale landfill solar projects in cold weather locations, Terrasmart was able to successfully design and engineer their GLIDE ballasted mounting solution for this project such that the cost of the blocks was reduced by 50 percent. From wind studies to countless solar generation analyses, Terrasmart determined the optimal tilt and block size to help CEP meet its project budget and energy production goals – all while protecting the sensitive landfill cap.
With over 20 GW of solar deployed across 4,800 solar systems, including its legacy business RBI Solar’s decades of experience in solar landfill development, the new Terrasmart has become the leading provider of solar racking technologies that provide solutions for projects located on all types of terrain.
Landfill solar projects often require fixed-tilt, ballasted mounting solutions that do not pose a risk of piercing or otherwise damaging the landfill cap, which could result in the spread of hazardous contaminants. In order to ensure the myriad integration and delivery deadlines for the skid mount system are met, close collaboration with project partners is paramount.
Having completed over 4,000 skids, Lindsay Precast was able to leverage its steel skid manufacturing and integration capabilities, including on many landfill solar projects. Lindsay Precast’s deep understanding of the entire value chain of a solar project and ability to efficiently provide quotes and accurate schedule estimates made this challenging project as streamlined as possible.
Precast has also completed countless projects with Terrasmart and this project marks the company’s seventh project with CS Energy, which includes the award-winning Cuyahoga landfill solar project. The decades of experience Lindsay Precast has spent working with these partners enabled the skid mounting solutions for this project to be seamlessly integrated and delivered on time and within budget.
Benefits and long-term impact
As a result of CEP, CS Energy, Terrasmart and Lindsay Precast’s extensive landfill solar project experience and collaboration, the Township of Mount Olive was able to not only recoup approximately $2.3 million in back taxes but will also now benefit from future taxes that this property will provide. The electricity generated by the array is enough to power over 4,000 homes.
The 25.6 MW dc of solar electric power contributes to the State of New Jersey’s aggressive renewable energy production goals. After 40 years, the property now has a long-term owner – CEP Renewables – that will be responsible for maintaining the landfill cap for the duration of the life of the facility. The Mount Olive project now serves as a model for the plethora of other closed landfill sites throughout the United States, both in terms of the redevelopment process as well as the design and construction execution, while providing cleaner air and more affordable clean energy for local communities.
CEP is currently under development on at least 16 other landfill or brownfield redevelopment projects in New Jersey. However, without a dramatic change in the state’s policy and attitude toward these projects, creating more successes like Mount Olive will prove difficult, if not impossible.
These projects are all certified by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) under what is known as the subsection “t” certification process. Subsection “t” is a subsection of the Solar Act of 2012 that provides a regulatory framework by which landfill and brownfield redevelopment projects receive state incentives. Once certified under subsection “t,” a project has two years to complete commercial energization. That timeframe is currently impossible due to a multi-year interconnection moratorium announced in April 2022 by PJM Interconnection, LLC, the regional interconnection organization that monitors New Jersey’s and other states’ electrical grids.
Due to the PJM delays, most of CEP’s projects will not be eligible for interconnection until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest.
Although the NJBPU is aware of this, the most the Board has been willing to do is extend the 2-year construction period by up to one 12-month extension – which is not nearly enough time based on PJM’s published information regarding the delays and PJM’s interconnection reform process, which was just recently approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
CEP has petitioned the Board to reconsider the 12-month extension to provide sufficient time to allow these important and transformative projects to interconnect to the regional grid. Unless the state and the Board get behind these projects and allow them the time necessary to proceed, it is unlikely that the state will see more successes like Mount Olive.
CEP remains optimistic that the Mount Olive project can be replicated on additional closed landfills throughout the state with the support of the state and NJBPU, as landfill redevelopment solar projects are necessary to mitigate climate change and provide precious funds, cleaner air and more affordable clean energy to local communities, particularly those that have been burdened by these economically and environmentally destructive properties for decades.

In space applications, however, perovskites would be exposed to protons, alpha particles, atomic oxygen and other stressors. The NREL research is the latest effort to determine how perovskites can meet these challenges.
The biggest challenges on Earth are related to weather, but in space perovskites must address the problems that come from radiation bombardment and extreme temperature swings. Perovskites show signs of tolerating radiation better than many other solar cells, but more testing is needed in that area.
Researchers last year ran simulations to demonstrate how exposure to radiation in space would affect perovskites. The scientists determined that perovskites would work in space, but would need to be encapsulated in some way for protection against the elements. would work in space but pointed out the need to encapsulate the cell in some way to provide added protection.
In the follow-up research they found that a micron-thick layer of silicon oxide, about 100 times thinner than a typical human hair, might be all that is needed. Ahmad Kirmani, lead author of the latest Nature Energy paper, said the silicon oxide layer could reduce the weight of conventional radiation barriers used for other solar cells by more than 99% and serves as a first step toward designing lightweight and low-cost packaging for perovskites.
While high-energy protons travel through perovskites without causing harm, low-energy protons are more abundant and damaging. The researchers found that the silicon oxide layer protected the perovskite from damage by low-energy protons.
“We thought it would be impossible for the silicon oxide to provide protection against fully penetrating long-range particles such as the high-energy protons and alpha particles,” Kirmani said. “However, the oxide layer turned out to be a surprisingly good barrier against those as well.”
Unprotected perovskite solar cells were found to lose only about 15% of their initial efficiency when exposed to low-energy protons, and a larger concentration of particles destroyed the cells. The perovskites, however, demonstrated what the scientists described as “a remarkable resilience.” With the simple barrier, the cells showed no damage.
The team made up of researchers from NREL, University of North Texas and the University of Oklahoma, demonstrated that a silicon oxide layer can harden perovskite photovoltaics against critical space stressors. They found that a 1-μm-thick silicon oxide layer evaporated atop the device can block protons without a loss in power conversion efficiency, which results in a device lifetime increase in low Earth orbit by 20x and in highly elliptical orbit by 30x. They also found that silicon-oxide-protected cells will survive water submersion, and were found to retain power conversion efficiencies on exposure to alpha irradiation and atomic oxygen.
In addition to making the cells more resilient in space, the researchers also tested how the barrier could protect against an uncontrolled moisture and temperature environment for several days to mimic storage conditions. The protected cells retained their initial 19% efficiency, while the unprotected cells showed significant degradation, from 19.4% to 10.8%. The oxide layer also provided protection when exposed to water.
The researchers further subjected perovskite solar cells to bombardment by ultraviolet photons, similar to the environment in low-Earth orbit. The unprotected cells were destroyed after eight minutes, but the protected cells retained their initial efficiency after 20 minutes and only had a slight drop after 30 minutes.
Through the simulations and experiments, the researchers found that by reducing the damage from radiation, the lifetime of the protected solar cells used in Earth’s orbits and deep space would be increased from months to years. With the protective layer of silicon oxide, perovskites could be used for space as well as terrestrial applications.
Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense’s Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), the NREL research was done for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) with the aim of developing low-cost innovative energy sources that can power the armed forces worldwide.
