Illinois’ Community Solar Garden and Distributed Generation programs, as well as “Solar for All,” which seek to promote the fair and equitable development of solar in low- and moderate-income communities, have spurred the expansion from SunVest’s roots in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, Bram Walters, chief executive officer, told pv magazine USA.
In addition to the Inflation Reduction Act’s enhanced investment tax credit structure with adders that can add up to a more than 40% ITC, as well as the standalone storage ITC, SunVest Solar is also looking to install energy storage across a greater percentage of its development pipeline of future projects, Walters noted.
After an investment career spanning close to two decades, most recently as partner of the company’s equity sponsor, Euclid Capital, Walters took the reins of SunVest in December as CEO after serving as interim chief financial officer and on the company’s board since 2020.
SunVest Solar was formed in 2009 by Matt Neumann, a residential real estate developer from Wisconsin. His second-generation home building and development companies have developed and built over 6,000 homes in Wisconsin. Seeing an opportunity to add solar to homes, Neumann decided to start a solar company with the idea that the company would expand into commercial, industrial, and small utility-scale solar projects.
In November 2020, Euclid lined up a $50 million equity investment in SunVest that guaranteed financing for the company’s strong development pipeline, as the company was heavily involved in distributed generation projects, including community solar, as well as some utility solar projects, Walters said.
That initial investment “provided the building blocks and support to help the platform scale up to more than 50 employees,” Walters said about investing in company founder Matt Neumann’s Midwest-based solar development business. Following the investment, Neumann segued into the role of executive chairman at SunVest.
Euclid had a distributed generation solar project portfolio assembled at the time, which fused with SunVest’s industry-leading pipeline of community solar and small utility-scale projects, to create a vertically integrated development platform, Walters said.
Entering 2023 with 53 full-time employees, SunVest is in hiring mode and hopes to get to 75 employees by summer, as the company seeks to expand its concentration of development resources from 14 states with a 1.5 GW project pipeline.
With states such as Illinois and New Mexico adding new sources of community solar projects, Walters said he expects the company’s 2025 pipeline to double to 3 GW from its current threshold, with an expectation to have 215 MW of operating assets under management by the end of this year.
On the supply side, the company, like other developers, continues to see a challenging lead time environment, Walters said.  SunVest has adapted to become increasingly strategic and forward-looking over the last few years in terms of modules, inverters and other components sourced.
SunVest has installed systems using Canadian Solar and Heliene modules. The company has used racking hardware from Array Technologies on multiple ground-mounted projects.
In the Midwest, SunVest developed solar canopies, ballasted landfill sites, ground mount and rooftop commercial projects for small businesses, municipal utilities, non-profits and educational institutions. WEC Group’s We Energies utility, Alliant Energy, and the Elkhorn Rural Public Utilities, are a few of the utility counterparties the company has worked with to install projects.
Solar apprenticeship
SunVest is also preparing for future workforce needs. In 2022, the company acquired Chicago electrical contractor ReThink Electric, which provides electrical services for residential, commercial, and community solar projects. The contractor remains a separate entity but is a sister company to SunVest.
ReThink operates one of the only Department of Labor-licensed electrical apprenticeship programs in Illinois, Walters said. The program applies to the IRA as it requires every solar project >1MW employ a number of licensed apprentices. SunVest’s ReThink program can help developers nationwide meet this key requirement, he said.
ReThink operates under a strong culture of diversity, and today over 50% of the company’s workforce identifies as Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC). This social inclusion attribute positions ReThink well to prepare for Illinois’ diversity requirements in the growing solar market, Walters said.
New markets 
SunVest’s 8 MW Elkhorn portfolio, which consists of three community solar projects for the Elkhorn Rural Public Power District in Battle Creek, Neb., is an example of a project that could qualify for adders under the IRA that promote the development of distributed generation assets in regions of stranded grid transmission and distribution capacity, Walters said.
Assets such as Elkhorn, which received funding from the USDA’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) program, can qualify for different federal incentives such as RUS and certain IRA adders, while alleviating the need of the offtake counter-party or utility from having to make a costly T&D upgrade, he said.  The RUS electric program provides funding to support demand-side management, energy efficiency and conservation programs, plus on-and off-grid renewable energy system deployments to rural customers.
SunVest is seeking to continue building upon its core Midwest markets like Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Nebraska, and also expand into new markets like New Mexico and Maine.  Many of these projects can qualify for adders under the IRA program. The company’s 3 MW to 20 MW size range for projects is a good fit for upper New England where the developer has worked on three projects in Maine, with several more in the pipeline.
Besides Walters and Neumann, Tim Polz, the company’s chief development officer Tim Polz, spent over 15 years constructing solar and wind projects at SoCore Energy, Midwest Wind Energy and Geronimo Energy, now operated by National Grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/26/us-renewable-ppa-price-hikes-cool-off-as-materials-costs-fall/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 26, 2023",US renewable PPA price hikes cool off as material costs fall,"In a quarterly report on large-scale renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPA), energy advisory firm Edison Energy shared that price increases in the US market continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than experienced since Q2 2021.
Tracking 120 projects with commercial operations dates slated through 2026, the report shows that PPA prices increased 4% in Q4 2022. Most of the planned projects are solar, with 105 projects planned. The slower rate of price increases marks a step down from the 17% hike in Q3 2022.
In comparison to one year ago, prices have increased 48%, or $18/MWh. The PJM grid remains the most expensive, where median prices increased by 8% ($5/MWh) in Q4 2022.
In the Southwest Power Pool, the median solar PPA price fell 8% ($5/MWh) in Q4 2022 following arecord-setting 29% increase in Q3 2022.
Following an exceptionally low quarter for project availability in Q3 2022, US developers are more confident in marketing projects with clearer guidance on import tariffs and long-term certainty from the Inflation Reduction Act. Actively marketed projects increased 40% over the previous quarter.
By ISO region, Q4 2022 solar PPA prices are as follows ($/MWh):
 
Raw material costs saw a year over year decline, with copper, aluminum, and North American steel down 15%, 10%, and 64%, respectively. Edison Energy said lower material costs may push PPA prices down even further as the effects of cost improvements ripple through the supply chain.
Rising interest rates are also contributing to higher prices. The Federal Funds rate, representing the cost of borrowing money, rose to 3.7% for the three quarters ending on September 30, 2022, compared to close to 0% throughout the prior year. 
Projects placed in service after January 1, 2023, are eligible for credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. At minimum, the Investment Tax Credit provides 6% of total project costs and can rise as high as 50% if certain wage, domestic content, and Energy Justice requirements are met.
The Production Tax Credit, offered to both solar and wind projects, ranges between $5.50/MWh to $33/MWh, also dependent on prevailing wage requirements, domestic content, and energy community siting.
Edison Energy said members of the European Union (EU) have expressed concerns that the IRA will hinder European companies, and that it violates international trade law. In response, the US and EU have created a joint task force to address these concerns. Project developers will be attentive to any potential changes that may result from these conversations in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/26/minnesota-voting-on-100-clean-electricity-today/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MINNESOTA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Minnesota voting on 100% clean electricity today,"The State of Minnesota is quickly moving toward legislating 100% renewable electricity for the state by 2040. The bill, “100% Clean Energy Standard” – HB7, is due for the House of Representatives floor today – January 26 – according to the official schedule.
Per the bills, by 2030, Minnesota utilities would need to generate 80% of their electricity with carbon free sources. By 2035, 90% of their electricity would have to be carbon free, and 55% would need to come from renewables such as wind and solar. By 2040, the law would require 100% carbon-free electricity for the state.
On January 18, 2023, Jamie Long, House Representative of Minnesota, tweeted that the bill had passed through the House Climate and Energy Finance and Policy Committee. The bill was passed by a vote of 10-6, along party lines.
Yesterday, January 25, the Senate voted to adopt the House version of the bill exactly as it was written; however, the article has not yet been transmitted to the Senate.
Long noted in a press release on the House website that Minnesota, “send(s) $13 billion out of state each year to buy energy. That’s 4% of our state GDP that could create jobs right here in Minnesota.”
The bill has two separate mandates for renewable versus carbon-free electricity. It defines wind and solar power as renewables, and defines hydroelectric, hydrogen, and biomass as carbon free. Nuclear power is referenced in the bill, too. It appears that nuclear power can be included as carbon-free energy, but only after various groups have voted on a resource plan to insure that is in the best interests of the general public.
The bill references the Inflation Reduction Act several times. The legislation gives permission to the legislatures to create financial incentives for domestic content, union labor, and brownfield areas that align with the language of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The state’s major utilities – Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power – have already “pledged” to be carbon free by 2050.
22 states and Washington DC have already pledged 100% clean electricity, energy, or net zero by various time frames from 2035 through 2050.
North Dakota’s governor and other top elected officials suggested that they would sue Minnesota if the legislation is passed. The state has suggested that it is possible the Minnesota laws would affect electricity generation in North Dakota. North Dakota generates significant revenue from fossil extractiion.
This article was amended on 1/30/2023 to remove the statement about a 10% solar mandate, which was not included in the bill that passed. The language for the 10% solar carve-out was in an old 2007 Renewable Energy Standard and was not included in the most recent bill.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/26/cabot-to-invest-in-component-for-manufacturing-lithium-ion-batteries/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Cabot to invest in component for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries,"Cabot Corporation plans to add conductive carbon additives (CCA) capacity in its Pampa, Texas facility to be used in lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles.
The US government announced numerous grants and loans to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, helping the country on its path to carbon neutrality by 2050. This includes $8.1 billion in grants and $25 billion of loans specifically to produce low or zero-emission vehicles or batteries.
Battery manufacturers are clamoring to set up shop in the United States to take advantage of the financial incentives and to be a part of the clean energy transition. Cabot sees this market as ripe for investment, and the government programs as potential funding opportunities for the company in its efforts to expand CCA production capacity in the United States.
“We are at a pivotal moment as the vehicle fleet transitions from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. CCAs are essential materials to make EV batteries work and expanding battery capacity and building a domestic materials supply chain are critical for the growth of EVs to be realized,” said Sean Keohane, president and chief executive officer of Cabot Corporation.
The Boston-based Cabot Corporation’s history goes back to 1882, when two Cabot brothers began the manufacture of carbon black, used as a colorant and reinforcing filler in tires and to add pigment and wear protection in plastics, paints, and more. Fast forward to 2013, and the company is developing CCAs, an essential component of lithium-ion battery chemistry and are used to provide electrical conductivity to the active battery materials.

Demand for critical materials for EV batteries is expected to continue to grow in the range of 20% to 30% globally over the next five years, Cabot reports, and growth in the U.S. is expected to outpace global demand. The company said it plans to invest approximately $200 million over the next five years focused on expanding the company’s CCA production in the United States.
Cabot expects to invest approximately $75 to $90 million to produce 15,000 metric tons of conductive carbons annually at its existing facility in Pampa, TX. This project is expected to create approximately 75 jobs and is planned to begin operation at the end of 2025. In addition to a manufacturing plant, Cabot also operates a research and development facility and pilot plant in Pampa that focuses on developing new process technology for battery and other applications.
Cabot also intends to make additional investments to expand its U.S. manufacturing and technology footprint over the next five years with plans to invest in new CNT powder and dispersion capacity and to continue extending its portfolio of innovative products for battery applications.
The company reports that in fiscal year 2022 EBITDA in the product line was $29M with a year-over-year increase in revenue of 74%. Cabot Corporation is listed on the NYSE as CBT.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/26/wyoming-900-mw-pumped-storage-project-moves-toward-licensing/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,WYOMING",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Wyoming 900 MW pumped storage project moves toward licensing,"rPlus Hydro, LLP, a developer of large-scale pumped storage hydro projects, announced the submission of its application for Final License to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for its 900 MW Seminoe Pumped Storage project located in Carbon County, Wyoming. According to rPlus, this milestone has been achieved by only six pumped storage projects in the United States since 2000.
The Seminoe Pumped Storage project is expected to provide 10 hours of full-output energy storage capacity and will help ensure reliability and dependability of the regional transmission grid, especially as additional wind and solar capacity comes online. With an estimated construction cost of approximately $2.5 billion, the project expects to create up to 500 skilled construction jobs in Carbon County over four to six years. Once operational, the project will provide an estimated 35 full-time skilled positions to the area and generate approximately $9 million in additional annual tax revenue for state and local governments.
Pumped storage hydroelectric storage works by pumping water from a lower to a higher reservoir during off-peak periods. This can be at night or when there is too much electricity being generated, such as by solar during the day. When power is needed, stored water flows downhill through a turbine, and that energy is harnessed to produce electricity.
“Seminoe Pumped Storage will be an ideal match for Wyoming’s excellent wind energy resource, and will support Wyoming’s role as an energy leader,” notes Matthew Shapiro, rPlus Hydro CEO. “It can also help ensure efficient utilization of new transmission lines that are, or will soon be, under construction, such as the Gateway lines and TransWest Express.”
In the project’s design, the lower reservoir will be the existing Seminoe Reservoir. The upper reservoir will be located in the Bennet Mountains approximately 1.7 miles east of the Seminoe Dam, and approximately 1,000 ft higher in elevation than the Seminoe Reservoir. The two reservoirs will be joined by tunnels underground. An underground powerhouse will contain equipment to generate electricity from the power of the water as it flows from the upper reservoir through the powerhouse and on to the lower reservoir. The same equipment would be used to pump water from the lower reservoir back to the upper reservoir, enabling the system to start the cycle again when needed.
Energy for pumping, and power generated by the project, will be delivered through a new, 30-mile transmission line connecting the project with PacifiCorp’s existing Aeolus Substation, near Medicine Bow, Wyoming.
Pumped storage has been in use for more than a century, and there are currently 43 such projects operating in the United States, according to rPlus. The submission of the Final License Application is the first of several major milestones for rPlus Hydro coming in 2023. rPlus Hydro anticipates Final License to be granted by March 2025, construction to begin in October 2026, and commercial operation of the first unit by June 2031, with full operation by September 2031.
rPlus Hydro’s submission of its Final License Application is the culmination of a multi-year study and approval process that includes in-depth engineering designs, environmental assessments, and community engagement. The filing of this application will launch an environmental review and licensing process with local, state, and federal agencies. The company expects to submit a Final License Application for its White Pine Pumped Storage project, a 1,000 MW project located in White Pine County, Nevada in the coming months.
The Final License application is available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/26/retired-coal-sites-to-host-multi-day-iron-air-batteries/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,COLORADO,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Retired coal sites to host multi-day iron-air batteries,"Solar and wind power have variability in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can impact output. Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost effective is important in grid reliability.
This is the logic that supported the creation of Boston startup Form Energy’s iron-air batteries. The grid-scale batteries can store intermittent renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at costs competitive with conventional power plants.
Utility Xcel Energy announced it will install two 10 MW / 1,000 MWh iron-air batteries, one at a retired coal plant in Minnesota and another on a restored site in Colorado. Both projects are expected to come online in 2025 following regulatory approval.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air, creating rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
The technology is less energy-dense than its lithium-ion counterparts, making it a better fit for large grid-scale applications. This may come as an advantage for the company, as EV batteries are in competition for lithium, a metal with geo-political mining concerns and battery fire risks.
“Form was founded with a unified mission to develop a multi-day energy storage battery that would unlock the power of extremely low-cost renewable energy to transform the electric grid,” said Mateo Jaramillo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Form Energy.
Form Energy said an individual battery module is about the size of a side-by-side washer/dryer set and contains a stack of approximately 50 one-meter-tall cells. The cells include iron and air electrodes, the parts of the battery that enable the electrochemical reactions to store and discharge electricity. Each of these cells are filled with water-based, non-flammable electrolyte, like the electrolyte used in AA batteries.
These battery modules are grouped together in environmentally protected enclosures. Hundreds of these enclosures are grouped together in modular megawatt-scale power blocks. Depending on the system size, tens to hundreds of these power blocks can be connected to the electricity grid. For scale, in its least dense configuration, a one-megawatt system comprises half an acre of land. Higher density configurations would achieve >3 mw/acre.
“We’re on track to reduce our electric system carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and to deliver carbon-free electricity by 2050,” said Bob Frenzel, chief executive officer, Xcel Energy. “As we build more renewable energy into our systems, our partnership with Form Energy opens the door to significantly improve how we deliver carbon-free energy.”
Form Energy held a $200 million Series D funding round in 2021 led by ArcelorMittal and a $450 million Series E round led by TPG Rise Climate, and numerous Canada-based funds.
In December, it announced a West Virginia-based manufacturing facility. Emerging from start-up mode, Form expects to begin construction of its Weirton, West Virginia factory in 2023 and start manufacturing iron-air batteries in 2024 for broad commercialization.
The Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to $290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton. The West Virginia Economic Development Authority allocated $75 million toward the purchase of land and the construction of buildings in Weirton. The governor said he plans on working with the West Virginia Legislature and federal partners to obtain an additional $215 million needed to finalize the agreement.
The Xcel collaboration was modeled using Form Energy’s investment and operational modeling tool for grids, called Formware. This modeling helped Xcel Energy validate how Form’s multi-day storage will support Xcel Energy’s ability to reliably and cost-effectively integrate large amounts of wind energy and other renewable resources on its system.
Additionally, this analysis demonstrated how the 100-hour iron-air battery technology will strengthen the grid against normal day-to-day, week-to-week, and season-to-season weather variability, in addition to extreme weather events including severe winter storms and polar vortex events.
“Xcel Energy operates across some of the richest wind-resource areas in North America,” said Jaramillo. “This partnership highlights Xcel Energy’s commitment to ensuring grid resiliency and reliability, energy security, and access to low-cost clean energy when and where it is needed – every day of the year.”

The awarded solar projects, OYA Ellisburg (6.5 MW, Jefferson County) and OYA Main Street (6.5 MW, Livingston County), will be fully subscribed with National Grid customers enrolled in the utility’s Energy Affordability Program, located in western New York. Governed by the New York Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), in partnership with National Grid, the underserved community solar program will deliver clean energy to nearly 175,000 income-eligible customers in upstate New York once complete.

“Expanded Solar For All is a program we’re excited and very proud to be a part of,” said Manish Nayar, chairman and founder of OYA Renewables. “Its progressive approach to delivering clean energy to underserved communities is smart and commendable, and we applaud the State of New York for continuing to lead innovative programs that support its constituents.”
OYA has received more than $4.3 million in support from NYSERDA through the state’s NY-Sun program, which is helping make solar more accessible to families, businesses and communities across the state.
“New York’s Expanded Solar For All program helps underserved New Yorkers save on their monthly electricity bill and become a part of the clean energy transition,” said Doreen Harris, president and chief executive officer of NYSERDA.  “We are excited to partner with OYA and National Grid on these community solar projects that will extend the benefits of solar to more homeowners and renters across the state.”
OYA Renewables has more than 1.44 GW of solar currently deployed in the community solar and utility markets, generating enough electricity to power 720,000 homes on an annual basis.  The company has a 9 GW project development pipeline of projects within the solar, EV charging and other clean technologies in 14 US states.
Last week New York’s grid operator NYISO completed final interconnection studies for 27 renewable energy and transmission projects for which the developers have agreed to interconnection costs.
The projects include 1.6 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of storage, which compares to 16 GW of solar and 14 GW of storage in NYISO’s interconnection queue studies at year-end 2021, according to data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The projects also include 2.3 GW of offshore wind and 0.8 GW of onshore wind, compared to 37 GW of offshore wind and 4 GW of onshore wind in the NYISO queue at year-end 2021.
Also approved was the 339-mile, 1.25 GW high voltage direct current (HVDC) line, the Champlain Hudson Power Express, for which construction began in November 2022.
The total interconnection cost for all approved projects is about $600 million, including about $200 million to interconnect the transmission project.
The approved projects “will help move the state closer to the clean energy mandates” of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, said Zach Smith, NYISO’s vice president of system and resource planning. Under that law, New York has an interim goal of reducing climate pollution 40% by 2030, compared to the 1990 level.
NYISO has made available a list of the 27 projects that are advancing.
NYISO reviews requests to interconnect to the transmission grid using a “cluster study” process, which NYISO calls a “class year” process, as described in “The NYISO Interconnection Process.” In reporting on the 27 projects, NYISO said the “decision/settlement process for Class Year 2021” has been completed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/26/scientists-assess-lifetime-for-perovskite-pv-to-become-competitive-on-rooftops/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Scientists assess lifetime for perovskite PV to become competitive on rooftops,"From pv magazine global
An international research group has assessed what levels of efficiency and stability perovskite solar cells have to achieve to become an economically viable technology to compete with crystalline silicon cells in the rooftop segment.
“The weight of photovoltaic modules drives up costs for installation, transportation, and labor,” Michael Saliba, the research lead author and director at the Institute for Photovoltaics at the University of Stuttgart, told pv magazine. “Utilizing lightweight, high-performance perovskite modules can lower these costs and open a new market in which perovskites are a competitive option.”
The scientists assessed the necessary lifetime (LT) of a perovskite module, which they defined as the time until a module has 80% of its initial efficiency, as a function of efficiencies to be competitive in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
They found that perovskite solar modules might need to provide 20% efficiency for at least 36 years, or 25% efficiency for a minimum of 21 years, if they want to compete with conventional PV panels.
“This demonstrates that even with the significantly lower production costs of perovskites, it is challenging to become competitive with silicon, mainly because of the low LT of current perovskite solar cells and the limited experience with perovskite module stability,” said the scientists.
However, perovskite tech may have some interesting cards to play if the scientific community and the industry will become able to reduce its installation and structural balance-of-system (BOS) costs, as these usually account for around 10% of a PV system costs.
“With lightweight or flexible modules, the installation becomes significantly less arduous,” they said, noting that transport costs would be significantly lowered. “Materials costs could be reduced if simpler installation such as glueing could replace racking.”
The academics assumed a levelized cost of electricity for the United States of $0.119/kWh to $0.136/kW for residential PV systems based on conventional panels in 2021. Their estimates ranged from $0.055/kWh to $0.063/kW for the same installations in 2030.
Their analysis showed that by using flexible substrates, perovskite solar modules would need to achieve lower target efficiencies of 15% and LTs spanning from 13 to 22 years to compete with crystalline silicon in the 2021 scenario, and efficiencies of 17% and LTs spanning from 16 to 34 years in the 2030 scenario.
“This offers a wider corridor of possible combinations in which perovskites could reach the same electricity cost as silicon,” they concluded.
The scientists presented their findings in “Toward commercialization with lightweight, flexible perovskite solar cells for residential photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Joule. The group features academics from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the University of the Basque Country in Spain, and the University of New South Wales in Australia.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/26/puerto-rico-could-approach-40-renewables-by-2025/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PUERTO RICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Puerto Rico could approach 40% renewables by 2025,"Six U.S. national laboratories have described in a report how Puerto Rico could reach 40% renewable electricity by 2025, as mandated by Puerto Rico’s Act 17.
The U.S. territory could reach 36% renewables by 2025 if 3.75 GW of utility-scale solar and 1.5 GW of storage that Puerto Rico has mandated the utility PREPA to procure were constructed and interconnected by year-end 2025, which would be “very rapid deployment,” the national laboratories said in a report.
To reach 40% would require an additional “hundreds of megawatts” of renewable generation, the report said, assuming a capacity factor of 20% for the initial 3.75 GW of solar.
So far, delays at multiple stages have slowed six tranches of planned renewables procurements that the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau mandated PREPA to undertake in an August 2020 order.
While the Energy Bureau’s order guided PREPA to issue requests for proposals for the first five procurements by year-end 2022, only two RFPs have been issued so far.
In the first procurement, PREPA required all bidders to submit a “best and final offer” not once, but four times, said PJ Wilson, president of the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. Then PREPA ultimately told bidders they had to bid a specific price of about 10.5 cents/kWh, Wilson said, adding “the whole process was unusual, drawn-out, unclear, and painful.” The Energy Bureau has hired the consulting firm Accion Group to oversee the second procurement, “and presumably” future procurements, Wilson said.
Another hurdle is that solar and storage projects approved by PREPA must also be approved by the Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB), a body created by a 2016 U.S. law.
After solar projects in the first procurement earn all required approvals, there is a final step known as a “closing date.” Wilson said his understanding is that closing dates are scheduled separately for all projects and spread out over several months, and that “until the final closing contracts are signed, developers could still back out.”
As a result, the first procurement has not yet resulted in any signed contracts with the developers of 845 MW of solar projects, Wilson said. Two energy storage projects for that procurement, totaling 220 MW/880 MWh, are awaiting approval from the FOMB, he added.
For the second procurement, although no information on bids has been posted online, Wilson said “we’re hearing informally” that more than 40 bids totaling 1,800 MW of projects had been submitted.
As for the third procurement, for which the Energy Bureau had guided PREPA to issue an RFP in December 2021, the Accion Group has not yet announced when the RFP will be issued, Wilson said.
Although Puerto Rico’s Act 17 mandated that PREPA reach 20% renewables by 2022, renewables provided 3% of generation in 2022, said Marisol Bonnet, team lead for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Puerto Rico Energy Recovery Team, during a webinar describing the report by the six national laboratories.
More key findings
Accelerated near-term deployment of utility-scale solar, land-based wind, and storage will reduce system investment and operational costs, the report said, and by 2025 these resources will cost less than just the operating costs of fossil-fueled generators. That assessment does not yet consider incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, which the study team will incorporate as it prepares a final study this year.
Rapid deployment of both fossil-fired and renewable generation could lead to “significant stranded assets,” cautioned the report, if distributed generation such as rooftop solar and storage eventually dominates Puerto Rico’s energy supply.
Puerto Rico could increase energy reliability and resilience to hurricanes, the report advised, with both rooftop solar plus storage, and virtual power plants that aggregate storage.
Asked on the webinar how the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s work is addressing generation shortfalls in Puerto Rico while transitioning to renewable resources, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said that “any of the generation work that FEMA adds to the system is strictly temporary, to allow emergency repairs to be made to the current system.” A nonprofit group has filed a lawsuit against FEMA under the Freedom of Information Act to disclose its funding for renewable versus fossil generation.
Wilson, whose group the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico is a participant in the “PR100” initiative that produced the report, said the initiative is a “space for all stakeholders to join minds to define the technical pathways” for Puerto Rico to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2050—the final mandate of Puerto Rico’s Act 17. The PR100 process, he said, also “encourages federal funding to align with Puerto Rico energy policy, local resilience needs and industry best practices.”

Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, N.Y.
Upon completion by 2026, the microgrid will feature the largest rooftop solar array in New York City, made up of 13,000 solar modules. At 7.66 MW, also the largest PV array on any United States airport terminal, with all available and viable rooftop space on the new terminal used for solar panels. Electricity generated from the project is enough clean power for 3,570 average homes per year.
Besides solar generation, the New Terminal One Microgrid project will use 2 MW / 4 MWh of lithium-ion batteries and 3.68 MW of combined heat and power (renewable natural gas) and hydrogen fuel cells from Doosan/HyAxiom.
The microgrid system design consists of four power islands, with each island functioning as its own local, integrated energy system with sources of generation, storage, automation and controls.
Juan Macias, chief executive officer of AlphaStruxure, said the renewable energy system will benefit local Queens borough residents by providing sustainable energy into the local Con Edison grid.
A spokesman for AlphaStruxure said module and PV inverter supplies have not yet been finalized for the large microgrid.
“We have installed more than 300 microgrids to date, and they’re at the cornerstone of energy deployments at airports,” said Annette Clayton, chief executive officer of Schneider Electric’s North American business.
The microgrid’s development is backed by a consortium that, in addition to AlphaStruxure, includes Carlyle, Ferrovial, JLC Infrastructure and Ullico, which are infrastructure fund investors. The distributed generation project is being built in partnership with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the local authority that operates JFK.
Pooja Goyal, chief investment officer of Carlyle’s Global Infrastructure fund, said AlphaStruxure uses an energy-as-a-service subscription business model, while the JV developer shoulders all the upfront capital cost on its own, providing EPC design, financing, construction, operations and maintenance services for the airport microgrid project.
During a January 24 media event, Goyal and Macias said the airport’s new terminal, valued at $9.5 billion, is the largest global project financing transaction on record.
The developer recently broke ground on the microgrid project and is currently entering the engineering phase. Construction is anticipated to take place throughout 2024, with completion before 2026, Macias said during a January 24 virtual media event.
JFK’s new terminal facility is 2.4 million square feet and is estimated to create over 10,000 jobs. The first gates are expected to open in 2026, with completion of the terminal anticipated by 2030.
Based on climate change and the airport’s proximity to the Jamaica Bay waterway, all components of the microgrid will be installed on the terminal’s rooftop, while the microgrid will still interconnect with the local grid, providing about 90% of the electric demand of the terminal.
AlphaStruxure’s microgrid is designed to achieve New York State, City, and the Port Authority’s sustainability mandates, and will contribute toward the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which requires 70% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% by 2040.
