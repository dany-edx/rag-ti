Imerys, a French multinational mining company that traces its roots back to the Rothschild family from 1880, has partnered with TotalEnergies to install a solar-plus-storage facility to offset 50% of the mine’s energy usage. The mine extracts diatomite, a sedimentary rock that the company has been extracting at the site since 1890.
Over the next three years, Paris-based Imerys said it will install a 15 MW ground-mounted solar system with a 7.5 MWh battery energy storage system to provide enough clean power to sustain much its Lompoc, Santa Barbara County, Calif. mining operations into the night. The mining company will hold a 25-year power purchase and storage services agreement (PPSSA) with TotalEnergies under the agreement.
The project developer’s U.S. distributed generation team engaged with Imerys to evaluate which of the company’s U.S. industrial mining facilities offered the greatest viability for solar. Under the PPSSA agreement, TotalEnergies will finance, install and operate the Lompoc facility’s distributed energy system.
The Imersys energy project is part of the public company’s environmental, social and governance plan aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in which the global industrials firm has committed to lowered its carbon emissions by 42% by 2030 with 2021 serving as its baseline year.
“This project highlights Imerys’ approach to reducing CO2 emissions and enabling us to produce clean, smart energy across our plants in the Americas,” said Jim Murberger, senior vice president and general manager of Imerys’ Americas business.
“We remain committed to helping Imerys achieve its sustainability goals with projects around the world, now with a focus on their U.S. operations,” said Eric Potts, managing director of TotalEnergies’ U.S. distributed generation group.
“For the transformation of industrial minerals, this requires ensuring greater energy efficiency through new technologies and processes as well as the integration of renewable energy sources among other levers to combat climate change,” Imerys said in its 2022 Sustainability Report.
The company highlighted other projects installed across its global mining operations. In June 2016, Athos Solar completed construction of the Gilleys Dam solar project, a 5 MW ground-mounted facility located near St. Austell in Cornwall County, England. Energy produced from the solar array powers an Imerys clay producing operation. The Cornwall County, UK site also incorporated the repurposing of several hectares of land previously used as a waste disposal site.
In July 2022,  the U.S. Department of Energy’s Clean Energy Demonstration Office issued a Request for Information to support the development of solar projects among other clean energy projects at 17,750 current and former mines. The goal was to choose a selection of projects that will chart a course to guide future projects, as they seek to navigate the long and complex federal, state, and local rules that regulate siting and grid interconnection.  The government program evaluated the potential for 89 GW of new installations at current and former mining sites.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/16/president-biden-vetoes-legislation-to-repeal-moratorium-on-solar-tariffs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 16, 2023",President Biden vetoes legislation to repeal moratorium on solar tariffs,"In June of 2022, when President Biden implemented a two-year tariff exemption on solar modules made in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, he did so with the intention of boosting domestic manufacturing to support a growing solar industry. Fast forward almost a year, and in a vote of 56-41 vote, the U.S. Senate resolved to repeal the two-year pause on the tariffs. Today President Biden vetoed the repeal.
A statement released by the White House said that “for too long, because of unfair trade practices and underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, the United States has been reliant on China for solar energy products.”  Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August, numerous companies have announced plans to onshore solar manufacturing to the U.S. The White House said the country is on track to increase domestic module capacity eight-fold by the end of President Biden’s first term. Because it takes time to ramp up capacity, the tariff ruling supports U.S. businesses and solar industry workers, “while continuing to hold our trading partners accountable.”
President  Biden stated that he does not intend to extend the tariff suspension past the conclusion of the two-year period, which would end in June 2024.
The rule implements a temporary, 24-month bridge to make sure that when these new factories are operational, we have a thriving solar installation industry ready to deploy American-made solar products to homes, businesses, and communities across the Nation. Passage of this resolution bets against American innovation. It would undermine these efforts and create deep uncertainty for American businesses and workers in the solar industry. Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.
“President Biden’s veto has helped preserve our nation’s clean energy progress and prevented a bill from becoming law that would have eliminated 30,000 American jobs, including 4,000 solar manufacturing jobs,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “This action is a reaffirmation of the administration’s commitment to business certainty in the clean energy sector, and a signal to companies to continue creating jobs, building domestic manufacturing capacity and investing in American communities.”
Hopper noted that the short-term tariff pause creates a bridge to a domestic manufacturing future. With the U.S. experiencing “an avalanche of solar manufacturing investment,” Hopper said that the pause could not have come at a better time.
“Every metric shows that the Biden administration’s policies are working to achieve both goals, and we thank the President for taking this action and protecting the livelihoods of 255,000 solar and storage workers nationwide,” Hopper concluded.
George Hershman, chief executive officer of SOLV Energy, a utility solar contractor, concurred that repeal of the moratorium would have “created business uncertainty, placed tens of thousands of clean energy jobs at risk, and stalled solar projects across the country.” He added that the President’s veto “of this harmful resolution is a victory for U.S. solar companies and the growing solar workforce.”
Calling the veto “a welcome step to avoid a disastrous impact on the U.S. economy,” Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council of Renewable Energy (ACORE), said that the Congressional Review Act repeal passed by Congress would have resulting in “many dozens of canceled solar projects, tens of thousands of lost jobs, and a dangerous increase in carbon emissions.”
“Thanks to the President’s veto, the U.S. solar industry can now resume its growth as we expand our domestic manufacturing base to better meet the growing U.S. demand for solar panels,” said Wetstone.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/16/rfp-alert-9-7-billion-to-bring-clean-energy-to-rural-electric-coops/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 16, 2023",RFP alert: $9.7 billion to bring clean energy to rural electric coops,"To help bring clean energy to rural communities across the United States, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the availability of nearly $11 billion in grants and loan opportunities available through two programs under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be opening a Letter of Interest process for the Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program, which makes $9.7 billion available to eligible rural electric cooperatives to deploy renewable energy systems, zero-emission and carbon capture systems.
The second program, also under the USDA, opens a Letter of Interest process for the Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) program, which makes $1 billion available in partially forgivable loans to renewable energy developers and electric service providers. These providers can include municipals, regional cooperatives, and investor-owned and tribal utilities to help finance large-scale solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower projects and energy storage in support of renewable energy systems.
The goal of the PACE program is to make clean energy affordable for vulnerable, disadvantaged, tribal and energy communities to heat their homes, run their businesses and power their cars, schools, hospitals and more. The USDA estimates that it may be able to leverage nearly $3 billion in projects through this program.
“These investments will also combat climate change and significantly reduce air and water pollution that put children’s health at risk,” said Tom Vilsack, secretary of the USDA.
These programs represent the single largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936, the department said.
“All across America, rural cooperatives lift up our rural communities. President Biden’s investment agenda positions his Agriculture Department as the ultimate partner in this work – financing not just upgrades to clean and affordable power, but also economic empowerment and uplift,” said Ali Zaidi, assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor. “For so many of our rural communities, this is simply a gamechanger.”
Rural electric cooperatives, including current and previous USDA borrowers, are eligible for funding through the New Era program. To apply, eligible entities must submit a Letter of Interest between July 31 and Aug. 31, 2023.
Loans through the Pace program may be forgiven by 40% of the loan amount, and the maximum loan amount is $100 million. Applicants in Puerto Rico, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and tribal communities are eligible for up to 60% loan forgiveness. The USDA will begin accepting Letters of Interest starting on June 30, 2023, on a rolling basis until Sept. 29, 2023.
Rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million people, and operate in 92% of persistent poverty counties, says the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association on its website.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/16/bidgely-releases-hourly-grid-monitoring-distributed-energy-tool/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,SOFTWARE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 16, 2023",Bidgely releases hourly grid-monitoring distributed energy tool,"The intermittency of renewable energy created the use of distributed energy tools such as energy storage and virtual power plants. But with new technologies at the grid and consumer level, utilities and regional transmission operators have turned to grid controls and maintenance software to orchestrate, aggregate and monitor the dispatch of clean power when the sun stops shining and the wind stops blowing.
Bidgely, a California-based energy data software start-up company, released the 8760 Energy Model, a data set and report that provides utilities and industry stakeholders with behind-the-meter energy data tracked at the hourly level throughout the year.
The data tool provides a new approach to grid planning, EV charging analytics, non-wire alternatives and load forecasting that aggregates the data across a full year, 24 hours per day.
With insight on how the daily load curve of each utility customer contributes to the grid, utilities have the ability to identify trends, predict future grid patterns, encourage grid-stabilizing customer behaviors and understand the load impact on grid assets, such as distribution transformers, feeders and substations, the company says.
To download the full Bidgely 8760 report click here.
“Energy consumption is constantly changing. As a result, utilities must develop agile responses to evolving pressures on the grid,” said Abhay Gupta, chief executive officer of Bidgely. “Our 8760 insights let utilities see their grids in high definition across time. They can use this insight to develop new rates, products, services and infrastructure investments that deliver greater value on both sides of the meter.”
With 8760, energy consumption data patterns are broken down by the hour and illustrated across 12 different appliance types, which includes EV charging and residential solar systems, across different geographic areas and utility rate plans. This analysis enables utilities to identify trends and plan strategically for grid management, especially based on daily challenges from the intermittency of renewables, EVs and extreme weather events that can affect predictability on the grid level.
In 2022, the system pulled data from the record-setting heatwave in the Pacific Northwest, when the region saw sustained daily temperatures of 100 degrees for consecutive days. The data was provided to the regional utilities to allow for future grid planning and resiliency measures as much of the U.S. sees rises in temperature and extreme weather due to climate change.
Using Bidgely’s data system, utilities can implement or track non-wire alternatives for managing the grid and target customers with load-shifting programs such as virtual power plants and demand response.
At the consumer level, 8760’s load curves analyzed will show grid asset resources with spare capacity and those regions near capacity. The data shows when a customer is running a pool pump and for how long the appliance will run, revealing a targeted list of utility customers who run the same appliance at peak times. This enables the utility to offer the customers load-shifting programs and incentives for lowering the usage of such home appliances as seen in the accompanying Bidgely screenshot.
For consumers running the same appliance, the 8760 data can make recommendations for the utility’s customer to change their Time-of-Use (TOU) rate plan, run the appliance during off-peak hours, buy an energy efficient appliance, or add a residential solar array for additional energy savings.
Bidgely’s UtilityAI and other solutions are used by more than 30 North American electric and gas utility companies and 29 million households that enable “future ready” means for grid flexibility. The company is partnered with digital meter provider Itron as well as EnergyHub and Salesforce for its artificial intelligence-functions and cloud-based accounting systems used in UtilityAI systems.
Founded in 2011, the company is based in Los Altos, California and has raised $82.7 million in growth equity from Constellation, Khosla Ventures, Moore Strategic Ventures, Future Energy Ventures, Innogy and Accurant International.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/16/utility-scale-solar-interconnection-costs-up-as-much-as-400/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 16, 2023",Utility-scale solar interconnection costs up as much as 400%,"Interconnection and power line upgrades have gained national recognition as crucial steps in accelerating the transition to a cleaner power grid. Recent data on the nation’s interconnection queues reveal a drastic increase in total capacity – and corresponding delays – to over 1.7 TWac, with solar accounting for 947 GWac. To put this in perspective, the nation’s current total solar capacity is approximately 110 GWac to 115 GWac.
A study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Electricity Markets and Policy Group (EMP) of the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in the central United States indicates that not only are interconnection queue waits growing longer, but many projects also face escalating interconnection costs, leading to their withdrawal from the process.

Among the projects analyzed, wind (487) and solar (197) constituted the majority, followed by natural gas (70), and storage (68). The research also covered several hybrid (9) projects, coal (7), nuclear (2), and a single hydropower plant. Specifically for solar, 30 connected projects were analyzed, alongside 114 active projects in the queue, and 53 that had been withdrawn.
Solar projects that chose to withdraw from the interconnection queue faced interconnection costs four to six times higher than those that proceeded with interconnection.
Currently, 114 solar projects moving through SPP’s queue – yet to connect – have received interconnection agreements featuring pricing similar to historically connected projects.
The study found no solar projects to review in the 2002 to 2009 window. However, for projects that did connect during the 2010 to 2019 and 2020 to 2022 periods, interconnection costs doubled. For those projects that withdrew during the same periods, costs increased by 25%, from a high base of $316 per kilowatt of solar, to an even steeper $394 per kilowatt.

The analysis defines “POI” (point of interconnection) costs as those associated with the solar project site, such as transformers and substation upgrades. Network costs extend beyond the substation and include powerlines.
For solar, while POI costs have decreased, network costs have risen. This trend likely results from solar projects increasing in scale, reducing local POI costs per installed unit. Concurrently, these projects have been moving further away from energy demand centers, leading to higher network costs due to the need for more power line upgrades.
As of 2022, SPP hosted just over 105 GW of generating capacity. The region’s peak load in recent years reached approximately 51 GW. By the end of 2022, an additional 109 GW of generating capacity plus energy storage was in the interconnection queue, with over 96% of it comprising wind, solar, and energy storage.

While the analysis of interconnection costs by region was not particularly robust, regions at the extremities of the SPP geography faced higher interconnection costs. When examining different generation types, noticeable differences emerged – for instance, in South Dakota, solar interconnection costs were high while wind costs were low.
According to an analysis by the American Council on Renewable Energy, the interconnection upgrades funded by solar are bringing broader benefits to all power grid users, not just the power plants funding these upgrades. In the SPP power grid region, the group noted that six renewable energy grid upgrades costing over $1.3 billion delivered $340 million in benefits to the broader grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/16/proposal-filed-for-500-mw-of-louisiana-industrial-solar-and-workforce-development/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,LOUISIANA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 16, 2023",Proposal filed for 500 MW of Louisiana industrial solar and workforce development,"Solar developer Distributed Sun announced it has filed for an Industrial Shared Solar pilot program, installing 250 MW of solar in Entergy Louisiana territory and 250 MW in other utility territories.
The Industrial Shared Solar projects operate similarly to community solar projects in other states, but instead offer industrial customers the opportunity to subscribe to renewable capacity. Under the shared solar program, project owners are required to contribute 10% of subscription revenues before profits in workforce development and community reinvestment.
The proposal includes $82 million of reinvestment commitments in Louisiana communities, which would be generated from revenues created by the solar facilities. Two-thirds of the investment, $55 million, will be allocated to reinvestment in communities with high levels of carbon emissions from industrial activities. Distributed Sun said the funds would be eligible for matching grants. The company said the carbon-heavy community reinvestment funds would be used for power resiliency and pollution mitigation programs.
The other roughly one-third of the reinvestment program, $27 million, would fund a workforce development program that would target the areas where the new solar projects are being built. Tenant farmers will receive preferential consideration for the workforce development program.
Under the program, employees are enrolled in corporate apprentice and internship programs to obtain education and experience in the solar industry. Distributed Sun said initial funds target the long-term employment of 192 local area residents.
Management of the workforce development process and of the community reinvestment funds will be conducted by third parties with experience in working with local communities.
Louisiana is set to considerably raise its commitment to solar energy, as its largest utility, Entergy, recently filed with the Public Service Commission to add 3 GW of more solar capacity on top of the 225 MW it had requested in early March.
“Like never before, our state has opportunity to retain businesses, support expansion projects and attract new companies on a global scale, but it’s going to take meeting their operational and sustainability needs,” said Entergy Louisiana president and chief executive Phillip May.
In June 2022, Entergy Corp. discussed plans for generating up to 7 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2025, and as much as 14 GW to 17 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2031.

The project includes 140 MWdc (104 MWac) of solar energy plus 80 MWh energy storage systems. The projects are fully contracted, holding five long term power purchase agreements (PPA) with utilities and cities in California. The projects provide enough clean power for 18,000 California households.
One of the first 20-year PPAs was signed in 2017 with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) for 45MWac of the project’s capacity. This was the first PPA signed by BART under its Wholesale Electricity Portfolio Policy, which requires 100% of BART’s power to come from renewable sources by 2045.
The project is on a site that extends from Kern County into Los Angeles County, California, providing additional flexibility for land use, said Jesse Salveson, director of project management, Matrix Renewables. Construction on the solar-plus-storage facilities took 9 months and reached commercial operations on May 5, 2023. Rosendin Electric served as the project’s sub-contractor and employed 425 construction workers from local unions in Kern County, Calif., during peak construction.
The solar project uses modules from Risen Energy, power controls and balancing equipment from Shoals Technologies.
The storage system makes use of BYD’s Cube Pro (2.5 MWh) liquid-cooled battery modules and Canadian Solar’s CSI Energy Storage (2.8 MWh) systems, according to a video clip for the facility’s construction. The integrated storage solution includes the supply, installation, and commission of the battery system. In addition, CSI will support the battery storage system with capacity and performance guarantees, ensuring system output, safety and reliability.
The construction of the project involved the establishment of a mitigation trust for the removal of Joshua Trees and other vegetation located on the solar farm’s acreage and other conservation easements as recognized by the state, said Clay Grant-Minchen, director of project development, Matrix Renewables.
Matrix funded project construction costs with tax equity provided by Bank of America for a total of $106 million and permanent financing of $99 million with an additional $25 million letter of credit facility provided by MUFG, HSBC, National Bank of Canada and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Matrix Renewables acquired Gaskell West 2 and 3 in April 2022 from Canadian Solar development business, Recurrent Energy.
Following completion of its first U.S. utility-scale project, Cindy Tindell, managing director and head of U.S. for Matrix Renewables, said the company’s growth strategy is to deploy a 7 GW solar, wind and storage portfolio in multiple U.S. markets, including California, Texas, the Southwest and  Midwest. According to the company’s website, Matrix is developing 15 U.S. projects, with two Texas solar projects, Normangee (124 MW) and Northington (156 MW), being its next projects under development after Gaskell.
The developer is owned through a Madrid-based holding company, Matrix Renewables (Spain) Holdings SL, which has an 11.7 GW global project portfolio. The company entered the U.S. market in 2021 and is backed by the TPG Rise Fund, a climate technology and sustainability fund managed by TPG, a San Francisco-based private equity firm with $135 billion of assets under management.
TPG Rise also operates Intersect Power, a utility solar and energy storage project developer throughout the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/16/researchers-assess-degradation-in-pv-systems-older-than-15-years/,"RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 16, 2023",Researchers assess degradation in PV systems older than 15 years,"From pv magazine global
Scientists at the Polish Academy of Sciences have studied PV installations older than 15 years and observed a decrease in energy productivity ranging from 1.9% to 2.9% over a 16-year period. They conducted their tests on two rooftop PV systems in Sinsheim, a town in southwestern Germany.
The first system, a 37.8 kW grid-connected array, consists of 252 glass-backsheet solar modules, each with an output of 150 W, provided by Suntech, a Chinese manufacturer. The second installation is an 18.48 kW PV system comprising 112 Suntech glass-backsheet modules with an output of 165 W. Both systems utilize inverters from Solarmax, a German manufacturer.
Based on their analysis using NREL’s HOMER software, the scientists reported that the PV installations generated a total of 958 MWh during the 2004-2021 period. They also observed that the larger system experienced some inverter failures in 2009 and 2010.
The research group discovered that the 18.48 kW system exhibited higher energy unit productivity compared to the 37.8 kW array, particularly in 2009 and 2014-2015. They determined that the annual degradation factor for the first system was 0.11%/year, while for the second system it was 0.20%/year.
Furthermore, the researchers found that the actual energy production per available irradiation was 0.817 for the 18.48 kW system and 0.826 for the 37.8 kW system. The measured specific yield divided by theoretical specific yield for the initial two years of operation was 96.8% and 95.8%, respectively.
Their analysis also indicated a power degradation rate of 1.9% in the largest system and 2.9% in the smaller system over the 16-year period. Additionally, the yearly power degradation rates were observed to be 0.11%/year for the 37.8 kW array and 0.20%/year for the 18.48 kW installation, which the researchers noted as significantly lower values compared to those reported in existing literature.
Thy described their findings in “Evaluation of degradation energy productivity of photovoltaic installations in long-term case study,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
“The main strength of the proposed extended methodology is the elimination of the impact of weather conditions on the scale of annual differences,” they concluded.
