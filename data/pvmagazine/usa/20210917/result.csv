The projects are the 109.9 MW Mark Center Solar project, the 125 MW Wheatsborough Solar project and its accompanying 50 MW battery energy storage system (BESS), and the 300 MW Hardin Solar Energy III project.
The three projects represent a considerable addition to the state’s solar capacity, which currently is just under 800 MW, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Ohio has been a boom market for solar in recent months; the majority of Ohio’s solar capacity has come online since the beginning of 2020.
The Mark Center Solar Project will occupy roughly 665 acres within an 877-acre project area in Defiance County, west of Toledo. The project is being developed by Candela Renewables, a developer formed by NextLight Renewable Power and First Solar alums Brian Kunz and Nik Novograd.
Candela anticipates starting construction in August 2022 and completing work in June 2023.
The Wheatsborough Solar project will be located in Erie County, midway between Toledo and Cleveland. The 125 MW project is being developed by Apex Clean Energy and will include roughly 390,000 monocrystalline bifacial PV panels mounted on single-axis trackers and installed in linear arrays. It will also include a 50 MW battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS will consist of up to 54 battery containers, 54 inverters, and 27 transformers.
The biggest of the bunch, the 300 MW Hardin Solar Energy III project, will be located in Hardin County in south central Ohio. Developed by Invenergy, the project is the third in a group that includes the 150 MW Hardin Solar I project and the 170 MW Hardin Solar II project. Hardin II also includes a 60 MW lithium-ion BESS.
Modules will be mounted on single-axis trackers affixed to piles sunk 10 to 15 feet below grade. Invenergy said the depth of the footing notes is necessary “in areas with freeze thaw or loose soils, such as Hardin County.”

Analysts at NREL modeled PV recycling strategies and found that current incentives are not well-aligned to drive recycling.
Dominion proposes 1 GW of new Virginia solar + storage by 2023. The utility has proposed 15 new Dominion-owned and 32 new PPA projects, in pursuit of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2045.

Sunpower agrees to be Toll Brothers’ exclusive California solar provider. The deal will see SunPower Equinox home solar systems installed on Toll Brothers-built houses in California, with expansion to other states a future possibility.
Skyrocketing energy, carbon prices already make green hydrogen competitive.  Gas and electricity prices are  opening huge opportunities for solar, renewables, and green hydrogen.
Solar on new-build homes has significantly shorter payback period. A report makes the case for governments to unlock huge rooftop solar potential, citing California’s solar mandate as a shining example.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/17/dominion-asks-to-add-1-gw-of-solar-and-energy-storage-in-virginia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIRGINIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2021",Dominion asks to add 1 GW of solar and energy storage in Virginia,"Dominion Energy Virginia has proposed 15 new solar and energy storage projects as part of its second annual clean energy filing with its regulators.
The proposal includes 11 utility-scale solar projects, two small-scale distributed solar projects, one combined solar and storage project, and one stand-alone energy storage project, which would be owned and operated by Dominion Energy Virginia.
The largest solar project in the package is the 150 MW Walnut Solar array in King and Queen County, east of Richmond. That project was acquired from a joint venture between Open Road Renewables and Eolian.
The proposal also includes power purchase agreements from 32 solar and energy storage projects operated by third-party providers selected through a competitive solicitation process. If approved and in operation, the combined projects would be able to provide more than 1,000 MW of carbon-free electricity.
In a related announcement, East Point Energy, a Virginia-based energy storage developer, sold the Dry Bridge Energy Storage project to Dominion Energy Virginia. Terms were not disclosed.
At 20 MW / 80 MWh, Dry Bridge is expected to be the largest battery energy storage project in the Commonwealth of Virginia when it becomes operational in 2022. The storage project is capable of delivering services that include firming of intermittent renewable energy; grid resilience; and capacity, energy, and ancillary services for the PJM wholesale energy market.
