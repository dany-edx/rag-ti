https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/31/alliant-energy-proposes-414-mw-more-of-wisconsin-solar/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,WISCONSIN",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 31, 2021",Alliant Energy proposes 414 MW more of Wisconsin solar,"Alliant Energy announced plans to add another 414 MW of solar in Wisconsin, almost doubling the state’s current installed solar capacity.
The utility said the six new projects would join previously proposed solar farms, rounding out Alliant Energy’s plan to add more than 1 GW of solar by the end of 2023.
If Alliant Energy reaches that goal, the utility would be among the largest owners and operators of solar energy in the Badger State. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wisconsin is currently home to about 442 MW of installed solar capacity.
As proposed to state regulators, the six newest projects would be developed in mostly rural parts of five counties. Once the projects are operational, Alliant said local communities would receive around $50 million in shared revenues for the next 30 years. Over the same period, local landowners would receive a combined $60 million in lease payments.
Five of the project are being self-developed by Alliant Energy, and include:

Alliant Energy is awaiting a regulatory decision on a May 2020 proposal to acquire and advance six other solar projects that would add 675 MW of capacity by the end of 2023.
If the dozen projects are approved and fully built, Alliant Energy estimates that by 2025 nearly half of its resource mix will come from renewable resources, including solar, wind, and hydro.
Combined with upcoming retirements of the Edgewater Generating Station and Columbia Energy Center, Alliant Energy said it is well positioned to achieve its goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fueled generation in half from 2005 levels by 2030.

Solar made it into the American Jobs Plan in the form of a proposed 10-year extension and phase down of an expanded direct-pay investment tax credit and production tax credit for clean energy generation and storage.
The plan would also use the federal government’s purchasing power to secure 24/7 clean power for federal buildings.

Besides extending the investment tax credit, the Biden proposal would create an investment tax credit to incentivize the buildout of at least 20 GW of high-voltage-capacity transmission power lines and mobilizes tens of billions in private capital.
Aging transmission infrastructure has long been cited as an issue that will hold the clean energy transition back from achieving its full potential.
The plan would also establish a new Grid Deployment Authority at the Department of Energy. It would allow for better leverage of rights-of-way along roads and railways via financing tools to spur additional high-priority, high-voltage transmission lines.
Affirming his earlier commitment to move the federal vehicle fleet to electric vehicles (EVs), Biden also proposed a $174 billion investment in EV, aimed at spurring domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retooling factories to compete globally, and supporting American efforts to make batteries and EVs.
The plan also would offer consumers  point of sale rebates and tax incentives to buy American-made EVs that are affordable and manufactured in the U.S. State and local governments as well as the private sector would have access to grant and incentive programs to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.

The plan also includes goals of replacing 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and transitioning to an electric school bus fleet.
Biden once again noted U.S. declines in investment in research and development (R&D). Biden called on Congress to invest $50 billion in the National Science Foundation to create a technology directorate that would work with and build on existing programs across the government. The initiative would focus on a number of R&D fields, including advanced energy technologies.
Independent of this proposed $50 billion, Biden also called for Congress to invest $35 billion to address the climate crisis and “position America as the global leader in clean energy technology and clean energy jobs.”
The investment would include $15 billion in demonstration projects for climate R&D priorities, including utility-scale energy storage, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, floating offshore wind, biofuel/bioproducts, and electric vehicles.
The solar industry and broader clean tech sector greeted the proposal with near-uniform support .

Of the plan, Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA),  “President Biden’s infrastructure proposal is a significant step in meeting our collective clean energy goals. The plan creates jobs, spurs the economy, faces the climate crisis, and advances environmental justice.”
In an interview with pv magazine USA earlier this year, she emphasized the importance of stable policymaking, particularly at the federal level.
Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), had similar praise for the plan. In a statement, he commended the Biden administration for using the infrastructure bill to tackle the climate crisis. He said, “The American Jobs Plan will move the clean energy sector beyond the endless cycles of temporary stopgap incentives toward a stable, long-term tax platform that will put millions of Americans back to work, upgrading our outdated grid and building a 21st century renewable energy economy.”
But Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, criticized the plan, saying that it “falls short on climate.”
Rather than adopt a Marshall Plan-type approach to climate and renewable energy, he said the “industry-friendly infrastructure plan” includes “gimmicky subsidies for carbon capture, fantastically wishes the free market will save us, and fails to take crucial and ambitious steps toward phasing out fossil fuels.” He said that although the Biden administration has pledged to cut carbon emissions 50% and decarbonize the electricity sector “this proposal won’t even come close.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/31/developer-orsted-advances-solar-and-wind-project/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 31, 2021",Developer Ørsted advances solar and wind project,"Ørsted said it finalized its decision to start work on a combination solar and wind power project in southern Texas.
Totaling 518 MW and representing a nearly $500 million investment, the Helena Energy Center will consist of the 250 MW Sparta Solar and 268 MW Helena Wind facilities. The project is expected to be online in the first half of 2022.
The project has secured contracts with multiple corporate offtakers, including retailer Target for a portion of the solar generation and chemicals company Henkel for a portion of the wind generation. Ørsted is also partnering with the Texas Native Seeds Program for plant research at the solar facility.
The solar portion will consist of around 775,000 monocrystalline photovoltaic panels and is expected to produce around 550,000 MWh of electricity each year.
Ørsted said the location in Bee County near Corpus Christi and the Gulf of Mexico allows it to use strong coastal winds and solar insolation. It will interconnect to an American Electric Power transmission corridor to access San Antonio load centers.
Ørsted, a Denmark-based developer and owner of solar farms, onshore and offshore wind farms, and energy storage facilities, said the Helena Energy Center represents the company’s largest onshore project to date.

The project takes Ørsted’s onshore operational and under-construction portfolio to 4 GW, including U.S. solar, wind, and storage projects across Texas, the Midwest, and the Southeast.
To support future growth, Ørsted also integrated its U.S. trading team into its onshore business. Ben Pratt has been appointed to lead the Chicago-based team and will report to onshore CEO Declan Flanagan.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/31/heres-how-to-get-solar-power-on-roofs-and-in-the-ground/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 31, 2021",Here’s how to get solar power on roofs and in the ground,"Cash is king, and if Congress passes the Save America’s Clean Energy Jobs Act, the future will see a big increase in solar power installations.
Currently, anyone who installs a solar power system – business or private – gets a 26% tax credit. In the year following completion of your solar installation, instead of sending a check to Uncle Sam you might receive one.
There’s the rub: you might get a check. Or, you might not, especially if you do not pay enough tax to benefit from a tax credit. For instance:
● Retired persons whose income is tax free
● Low to Middle Income (LMI) families who pay low taxes
● Real estate investors/owners with low tax liability
● Low income housing
● Farmers
● Non-profit organizations (YMCA, churches)
● Pension funds
● International investors without taxable U.S. income.
What’s more, many successful businesses also have years without tax liabilities.
For example, this author is working with a customer who recently bought a new building, several trucks, and the equipment needed to manage those trucks. This successful business expansion means that in 2021 and 2022 the business probably will not owe federal income taxes.

It also means that, for this business, the Investment Tax Credit won’t mean anything until 2023 income is finalized on or around April 15th, 2024.
The barriers to tax credit utilization have spawned massive industries. The residential solar leasing industry is perhaps twice as large as it would otherwise be. That’s because homeowners typically don’t trust tax credits, and they want their solar now.
A network of boutique investment firms connect small banks and wealthy individuals to owners of projects between 1 and 5 MW. Then, too, almost every Wall Street bank – along with armies of CPAs, engineers, lawyers, and developers – has raised a fund of hundreds of millions of dollars to create tax equity partnerships.
And folks, we haven’t even added in the accelerated federal depreciation. This allows businesses to write off 100% of the depreciable base in the first year. When we add depreciation and tax credits (plus occasional state tax breaks), tax benefits make up well over 40% of a solar system’s incentives.
And these are tax benefits that many cannot utilize.
Instead of all this complexity, let’s imagine that a prospective solar system owner is promised a check for 26% of the system’s cost a mere 120 days after the solar power system is connected to the power grid. That would be a paradigm shift. The retiree suddenly jumps at the opportunity. The LMI family actually sees a benefit. The real estate investor sees a return. The church’s doors stay open to the solar installer who comes knocking.

The most obvious use for a 26% cash grant is to pay down the bank loan. The second best option is for the bank or solar contractor to accept the system owner’s tax credit in lieu of a down payment.
And the third most popular option – and the one that has been getting some people really excited – is to get a long-term loan for 100% of the project. The project’s payment is covered by the solar savings, and the cash is used for other efficiency upgrades.
Consider the successful and growing business-owner client mentioned earlier. Their investment game just changed. Instead of waiting until 2024 for a tax benefit, the business can actually increase its cash flow almost immediately.
The mortgage holders want to write these kinds of loans, and the accountants approve of them as well. The investor’s family gives the final nod of approval to a stable, insurable, 20-year, seven-figure investment.
And that’s how you get solar power installed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/31/sunrise-brief-gop-bill-aims-to-ban-federal-funds-to-buy-solar-equipment-made-in-china/,"EMPLOYMENT,HYDROGEN,MICROGRID,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 31, 2021",Sunrise brief: GOP bill aims to ban federal funds to buy solar equipment made in China,"Eight Republican Senators introduced a bill that would ban using federal funds to buy solar panels or related equipment from China.
A statement issued by the office of Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said that the “Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act” would require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop “standards and guidelines” to prohibit federal funds from being used to buy solar panels manufactured or assembled “by entities with ties to the Communist Party of China”; require the U.S. Comptroller to submit to Congress a report on the amount of solar panels procured by federal departments and agencies; and require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to study the domestic solar panel production market and the global supply chain and workforce involved in solar panel production.
Scott was joined in introducing the bill by Marco Rubio (R-FL), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Kennedy (R-LA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and John Barrasso (R-WY). The senators cited concerns over alleged human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang region.
In February, House members reintroduced a bipartisan bill that would ban imports from China’s Xinjiang region unless it is certified they are not produced with forced labor, and allow further sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for alleged abuses against Muslims. The bill last year passed the Democrat-controlled House but stalled in the Senate, which at the time was controlled by Republicans.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has set a June deadline for its member companies to shift supply chains away from the conflict region.
Concentric Power is building a $12 million 5.0 MW microgrid for a California-based potato growing, packing, and shipping operation.
The microgrid is designed to include energy generation, distribution, and storage, and will offer islanding capability for continued operations during power outages within the broader utility grid. The project is slated to be completed in the third quarter. As designed, it will include 3.6 MW of cogenerated firm power, 120 kW of solar, and 1.25 MW/625 kWh of lithium-ion battery storage.
Last year was the most active wildfire season in recent history in Oregon, California, and Washington as measured by acres burned and fire detections, according to analysis by SolarAnywhere researchers Patrick Keelin and Marc Perez. Smoke particles, and more generally aerosols in the atmosphere, diminish the solar radiation available for solar generation.

The researchers said that recent study in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) region found that solar-powered generation during the first two weeks of September 2020—a time when California was heavily impacted by wildfire smoke—was down 13.4% from the year prior despite an increase in total system capacity.
They said that analysis by Clean Power Research quantified the impact of wildfire smoke on solar-powered generation. When North American wildfires peaked in September 2020, aerosols visibly dimmed sunlight across much of the region. Total sunlight  for the month was diminished by as much as 20% in some locations. This included California’s Central Valley and parts of the Columbia River Basin (including Portland and Bend) that were hardest hit by the smoke.
SolRiver Capital bought a 45 MW solar development portfolio in the Carolinas from Birdseye Renewable Energy, the second such deal between the two. The first project, located in North Carolina, was completed last year. With its latest purchase, SolRiver will finance, build, own and operate the portfolio of solar projects. In total, this is the fifth acquisition for SolRiver in the Carolinas.
The latest Paychex | IHS Markit Business Employment Watch shows increases in jobs growth in March across all U.S. regions and nearly all states and metro areas that were analyzed. The Small Business Jobs Index rose to 94.25 in March. And while the index remains 4.03% below its March 2020 level, the measured 0.30% increase was the” most significant one-month gain since 2013.”

Another leading indicator of economic strength, hourly earnings, reached 2.98%, its fourth month of growth. Weekly earnings also increased, rising to 3.58%, which the report said was a result of growth in weekly hours worked.
The March report also showed jobs growth improved across all parts of the U.S., as well as in 18 of the 20 states, and 16 of the 20 metros analyzed. In particular, the South led all regions in small business job growth, and Florida remained the top state for job growth. The promising jobs report could translate into an uptick in orders for solar developers and installers.
Plug Power and Brookfield Renewable Partners said they plan to build a green hydrogen production plant in Pennsylvania that will use energy from Brookfield Renewable’s Holtwood hydroelectric facility. Green hydrogen from this facility will be used in the transportation and logistics industries in the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic states. The plant is expected to be online by late 2022, with construction slated to begin by in the first quarter of 2022. Once operational, the plant is projected to produce approximately 15 metric-tons of liquid hydrogen per day.
Plug Power also recently announced construction of a green hydrogen production facility and electric substation in the Western New York Science, Technology and Advanced Manufacturing Park, joining an existing plant in Tennessee as the initial links in the company’s North American green hydrogen production network.
