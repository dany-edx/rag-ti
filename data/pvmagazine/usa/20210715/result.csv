The initiative aims to support Microsoft’s goal of 100% renewable energy supply for all its operations by 2025. In addition, Volt Energy and Microsoft will invest a portion of the revenue from the power purchase agreement in community impact funding initiatives. Those initiatives will support programs that bring the benefits of renewable energy closer to communities that have not had equitable inclusion in the wave of clean energy initiatives undertaken by the private and public sectors.
“It is critically important that clean energy infrastructure and economic development investments are made in underserved minority and rural communities that have been disproportionally impacted by environmental injustices and lag behind in the health and financial benefits of the thriving clean energy economy,” said Volt Energy’s co-founder and CEO, Gilbert Campbell.
This is also the first power supply deal known to pv magazine to be executed by Microsoft with a minority-owned solar energy development firm. Details have not yet been made public about the projects that will be supplying the energy to meet the agreement.

But it would come with major rate hikes and gigawatt-scale investment into new gas-fired power capacity.
The bill, House Bill 951, has been criticized as being too favorable to Duke Energy, as it would cut down the oversight that state regulators have over Duke’s spending. For renewable energy advocates, the bill’s enticing levels of procurement don’t outweigh its flaws.
The bill is founded on four key actions: early coal plant closures, investment in new gas generation, investment in new renewable generation, and multi-year rate plans.
Image: Duke Energy
The bill calls for the closure of the remaining units of the Allen Coal Plant on or before Dec. 31, 2023; the Marshall Units 1 and 2  on or before Dec.r 31, 2026; the Roxboro Plant on or before Sept. 1, 2024; Cliffside Unit 5 on or before Sept. 1, 2027; and the Mayo Plant  on or before Sept. 1, 2027
The bill calls for procuring a natural gas-fueled simple-cycle combustion turbine generating facility at the Marshall site with a generating capacity of around 900 MW. The site of the Allen Plant would be home to a 20 MW/80 MWh battery energy storage system. The other sites would host unspecified storage systems of undetermined capacity.
These additions alone won’t be enough to match the total lost capacity. The bill also calls on the state’s investor-owned utilities to procure 5,487 MW AC over a term of six years, beginning when the state’s Public Service Commission approves the program. The utilities are expected to conduct an annual procurement of approximately 777 MW each calendar year beginning in 2021 and concluding in 2026.
Even with these capacity additions, HB 951 falls short of Gov. Roy Cooper’s call for 70% decarbonization of the power sector by 2030.
The bill would restrict the Commission’s oversight only to approving or denying a plan, curbing their traditional jurisdiction.

Duke’s projects would have no capacity limits, while third-party projects would have to be 80 MW or smaller in capacity.
750 MW would come via a shared solar commercial and industrial customer program, and these projects would be 100% owned by independent power producers, and these owners would sell the electricity to duke under power purchase agreements. The final 60 MW would come via utility-owned community solar gardens.
How all of this new solar will be paid for within the bill has become a point of contention. While the renewables that are expected to fill the bill’s procurement will benefit local communities, the bill would also allow Duke to implement multi-year rate plans (MYRP), a rate structure that the utility has been pursuing for some time.
Spot on @nclcv. Renewable additions in NC's HB951 (5.5GWac) would generate by our estimate:
• Up to $1.4 billion in landowner lease payments
• Over $200 million in local NC tax revenues
• $7.5bn of private investment, predominantly in NC's most economically distressed counties https://t.co/ZkSZwLewxJ
— Tyler Norris (@tylerhnorris) July 14, 2021

The MYRP is a process by which the utility can start charging customers for projected costs in the future, as opposed to the current process that looks backward at costs incurred. The MYRP outlined in HB 951 would take place over three years and would limit possible rate increases in the second and third years to 4%.
For the first year of the plan, however, there would be no limit. What’s more, regulators would not be allowed to make changes to a proposal from Duke. The bill would restrict the Commission’s oversight only to approving or denying a plan, curbing their traditional jurisdiction.
The MYRP included in the bill also allows for performance-based ratemaking (PBR). This would allow regulators to incentivize or penalize utilities’ performance based on certain public policy goals, like emission reductions. However, in this instance, the bill calls for a “minimum system method” which experts have argued unfairly places costs on residential customers and “low-use” users.
The bill also gives Duke the authority to institute “standby charges” on customers who install more than 100 kW of solar on their property. While this represents a relatively a small portion of distributed generation systems found mostly on small businesses and commercial buildings, it’s the same type of discriminatory rate that has been instituted in other parts of the country to deter private investment in solar.
Edit 7/16/21: This article has been amended to correct the exact capacity that would be procured under HB 951. We apologize for the error.

The CdTe Accelerator Program, announced this March, has a mission to form a consortium that guides the U.S. to a highly competitive position in the CdTe space.
Specifically, the program seeks to enable cell efficiencies above 24%, and sustainable module prices below $0.20/W by 2025. By 2030, the consortium will have a goal of over 26% efficiency, and costs below $0.15/W.
CdTe is known for its high light-absorption rates, and relatively low manufacturing costs, making it second only to silicon-based panels in deployment. NREL said that if CdTe research could unlock higher cell efficiencies and even lower module manufacturing costs, the United States could capture a larger portion of the global solar market.
The main activities of the consortium will include developing an annually updated CdTe roadmap, addressing the domestic supply chain, conducting core research projects to meet efficiency targets. They will also seek leaders to advise NREL on launching additional projects to reach the roadmap targets, with external research and development projects.
NREL listed five relevant technical areas to the consortium’s work:
Award selection is anticipated for September 2021, and initial funding for the first 36 months of the program will be $9 million, said NREL.
NREL is celebrating nearly 30 years of partnership with First Solar, who recently announced plans of a $680 million, 3.3 GW annual capacity thin-film manufacturing plant in Ohio. The implied capital expenditure of manufacturing these modules will be $0.20/W, pacing well to achieve the consortium’s pricing goals.

German storage system manufacturer Sonnen published test results that indicate the longevity of its products after extended use. In laboratory tests, the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, which are also used in the company’s “solar battery,” reportedly withstood 28,000 charging cycles.
The lifespans of battery storage systems remain an issue for many potential buyers. Sonnen said that it has charged and discharged battery cells at a C rate of one and a depth of discharge of 100% over a period of eight years. This means that a full charge or discharge was completed within an hour. It noted that the test for the batteries was more demanding than its use as a residential storage system.
Over the past few years, it has carried out tests in a laboratory operated by Sonnen in Wildpoldsried, Germany. According to the manufacturer, the iron phosphate battery cells still had 65% of their original capacity. As a result, the cells have not yet reached the end of their lifespans.
Sonnen also tested modules consisting of 200 cells. It guarantees that the modules will retain 80% of their original capacity after 10,000 cycles. According to its latest tests, the modules retained 83% of their capacity over 10,000 cycles.
DNV GL presents its performance index for batteries, the Battery Scorecard, every year. In the last edition, it checked the cycle stability of various battery types. The company’s experts determined how many cycles a battery had to go through to lose 1% of its capacity. The average was 381 cycles for 22 manufacturers. For iron phosphate batteries, the range was between 135 and 448 cycles. For nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries, the range was 180 to 849 cycles for each percent of capacity lost.
If the same method is applied to Sonnen’s test, a value of 800 cycles per percentage of capacity lost is obtained for the cell. The modules would have a value of 588 cycles.

The company said its planned investment aims to serve the market growth expected as a result of what it called the Biden administration’s “extensive support” to the U.S. solar industry and manufacturing.
The new facility is projected to create 150 to 250 jobs and is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2022. It will produce monocrystalline facial and bifacial modules for commercial and utility-scale projects. A company spokesperson told pv magazine that talks are underway with multiple states that are interested in attracting the facility.
Philadelphia Solar manufactures, develops, designs, constructs, owns, and operates utility-scale commercial and industrial photovoltaic plants. It has worked on projects funded by international financial institutions including the IFC, AFD, EBRD, Norfund, FMO, KfW, and IsDB.
The company will produce monocrystalline 450W bifacial and facial 450W modules with plans to start a 530W line in early 2022.
One of its largest projects to date is the 23 MW Al Badiya solar-plus-storage system in Jordan. The 12 MW power plant is one of the largest power storage plants in the Middle East, and has been operating since October 2015. Around 48,000 polycrystalline panels rated 250W support the plant’s production.
The system expanded with one of the first utility-scale energy storage projects in the region at a capacity of  23MW/12.6 MWh made up of Tesla-supplied lithium-ion batteries. The solar array also was expanded by 11 MW, consisting of around 34,350  panels (320W each).
The power plant offers power peak-shaving services. The energy storage component offers renewable firming, ramp rate control, curtailment avoidance, and network frequency support.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/15/california-breaks-1-gw-energy-storage-milestone-and-looks-to-a-future-1-21-gw-moment/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 15, 2021",California breaks 1 GW energy storage milestone (and looks to a ‘future’ 1.21 GW moment),"A new player is taking the stage in the highly charged California electricity market. Enter lithium-ion energy storage.
The world saw this revolution coming years ago, but momentum has been accelerating ever since the summer of 2019, when California regulators and utilities first predicted peak hour shortfalls in September of 2020. 
The regulators noted that the “peak hour of [electricity demand in] the year occurs consistently in September… within hour ending 17 (based on P.S.T. or 6:00 p.m. P.D.T.). By 2022, the peak shifts to hour ending 18.”
As we see in the chart (and noted by the white boxes defined as “uncontracted imports”), there are three to four hours where regulators predict a shortfall.
In 2020, that shortfall totaled around 6,000 MWh over three hours. In 2021, regulators added an hour and increased the amount of shortfall within each one-hour window, bringing the total shortfall to 14,400 MWh. That number expanded again in 2021 to 15,400 MWh of “missing energy” over four hours.
To manage the shortfall (and to compensate for a nuclear power plant that is about to close), California recently decided to procure 11.5 GW of clean energy sourced resource adequacy by 2026. That represents instantaneous capacity, a number which many of the energy storage systems must sustain for a minimum of four hours.
The procurement requires some percentage of that clean energy to be available as longer-term storage, for roughly 10 hours. That could translate to more than 60 GWh of clean energy storage added to the grid in the next half decade.
That’s a massive quantity of energy storage in California’s future. But as climate scientists increasingly sound the alarm over California’s megadrought-caused fires, an increasing sense of urgency exists.
Fortunately, 2,000 MW of energy storage capacity is coming online by August 1, per the California Public Utility Commission. Much of this capacity will have four hours of battery energy sitting behind it, nearly 8,000 MWh in total.
As a preview of what that capacity has to offer, we’re getting our first glimpses via the California ISO Supply charts.
On July 9 at 6:30 PM, California’s main grid noted that energy storage injected 999 MW of power during a “flex event” where rolling blackouts might otherwise have occurred.
Note the battery charging periods, here too. As California’s daytime solar capacity grows, energy storage will increasingly arbitrage the cheap electricity to the point where energy storage may become the evening time’s baseload capacity.
One of the first examples of a huge charging event occurred on July 14 at 9:15 AM, and was brought to our attention by California energy data geek Joe Deely. Here’s what it looked like:

A retroactive analysis of wholesale electricity pricing at the time might give us an indication as to why these batteries were chosen to charge at this point.
Two of the world’s largest lithium ion batteries contributed to these capacity values, and backed up the grid during the flex event.
The first is LS Power’s 230MW lithium ion energy storage facility, which was scheduled to increase from 230MWh to 690MWh by this summer, and add more capacity at a later date. This plant is, for a moment anyway, one of the world’s largest lithium ion grid connected batteries.

The second facility is Moss Landing’s 300 MW / 1,200 MWh facility – again, one of the largest in the world for now – which joined the grid in December 2020. This facility might soon expand to 1.5 GW / 6 GWh.
Let’s all hold on, because — not too far into the future — we’ll see 1.21 GW… Doc Brown’s flux capacitor optional.

A group of scientists from the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, in Saudi Arabia, has assessed the performance of several cooling techniques in solar PV systems subject to the country’s harsh environmental conditions.
The researchers’ analysis embraced passive cooling systems based on a heat sink or a heat sink embedded into phase change materials (PCMs), as well as active cooling relying on micro-flat heat pipes, either immersed or not immersed in an immersion fluid.
The passive technologies were assessed under two different configurations. The  first was an 11%-efficient polycrystalline solar module with a power output of 15 W equipped with six aluminum heat sinks on the back panel. The second was the same panel equipped with heat sinks placed into a highly thermally conductive aluminum container filled with TPM350, a phase change material offering a high thermal conductivity and melting at 50 degrees Celsius.
In all configurations, the solar panels were tilted at 25 degrees and south-oriented. Measurements took into account output power, the surface temperature of the modules, and power conversion efficiency.
Active cooling was considered in two forms: a system consisting of a row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water and place onto the back of the panel; and another consisting of four heat pipes immersed in a box of liquid, as liquid bulk, integrated with the back of the solar panel.
The researchers said this technology is interesting for cooling purposes because it uses buoyancy flow of liquid and evaporative cooling in the heat pipes as a means of transferring thermal energy.
The two passive techniques were found not to be performant enough to ensure proper cooling. The technique with the simple heat sinks was able to lower the module operating temperature by 10 degrees Celsius, on average; the one based on the PCM was able to guarantee sufficient cooling only for the first two hours.
“When melting was completed, the PCM became ineffective, allowing the panel temperature to rise sharply, becoming greater than that of the uncooled panel due to the thermal resistance of the PCM,” the Saudi group said, adding that a PCM with a higher melting point should be utilized.
As for the active system, the most effective was one based on four heat pipes immersed in water, which was able to reduce the panel temperature by up to 53%. That was followed by those immersed in ethylene glycol, which resulted in a 48% reduction; and those immersed in engine oil, which lowered the module temperature by 25%.
The lowest percentage – 21% – was obtained by the row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water.
Lower panel temperatures and higher open-circuit voltages at the solar panel terminals were found if the panel was actively cooled using heat pipes immersed in regular water, the researchers said. “In this configuration, the voltage increment was 13%, relatively compared to the uncooled panel configuration.”
Findings of the research can be found in the paper Innovative technique for achieving uniform temperatures across solar panels using heat pipes and liquid immersion cooling in the harsh climate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, published in Alexandria Engineering Journal.

The project will make use of Maine’s Net Energy Billing kWh Program and will sell power to residential off-takers at a fixed discount to the prevailing utility rate for a 20-year term. CleanCapital will finance the project, which is expected to reach commercial operation in 2022.
This is CleanCapital’s first project in Maine, expanding the company’s total acquisitions to more than 230 MW in 19 states.
Research from Wood Mackenzie said that another commodities supercycle is on its way, with winners expected to be industrial metals needed to electrify society, including cobalt, lithium, copper, nickel, and aluminum.
It said that $50 trillion of investment worldwide will be needed over the next three decades to achieve a 1.5˚C global warming trajectory. Part of that investment will electrify infrastructure and reengineer economic activity that most significantly contribute to carbon emissions. Metals supply will play a vital role in achieving this, the report said.
Three potential developments could challenge how this commodities supercycle unfolds and who, ultimately, benefits from it:
Solar and wind create a demand for minerals and metals that will likely require expanding mining operations for cobalt for use in alloys and batteries, tellurium for solar cells and semiconductors, and germanium for transistors in electronic devices.
Researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T) said that rising demand for these components could increase metal production needs by two to six times per kilowatt produced. For example, they said that the 100,000 tons of cobalt produced each year globally will need to double by 2030 and triple by 2050.
“We could eventually reach some of our materials needs by recycling, but there is very little to recycle at this point,” said Michael Moats, director of the Thomas J. O’Keefe Institute for the Sustainable Supply of Strategic Minerals at Missouri S&T. As a result, new mining capacity will need to be brought online to meet demand, he said.
Metal roof attachment company S-5! and software developer PVComplete launched a web-based solar calculator, designed to create solar project layouts for standing seam and exposed-fastened metal roofs.
Users enter project data into S-5!’s solar calculator, including metal roof type and manufacturer, roof measurements, module size, module manufacturer, and seam spacing. Based on the selected job location, the calculator computes the forces in the upward (uplift), downward, lateral (seismic), and downslope/parallel force according to ASCE 7. It also uses Google maps to assist with rooftop placement of modules.
The calculator provides module spacing recommendations to align standing seams with the module manufacturers mounting zones, as well as an energy output summary detailing how much energy the array will produce, the timeframe to achieve a return on investment, a bill of materials, and a report available for an authority having jurisdiction.
The design tool also integrates ASCE-16 structural requirements.

In a separate move, the Biden administration issued an advisory warning businesses that they could be in violation of U.S. law if their operations are linked even indirectly to suspected surveillance networks in Xinjiang.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent and would create a “rebuttable presumption” that assumed goods manufactured in Xinjiang are made with forced labor meaning they can be banned under the 1930 Tariff Act.
The bill would shift the burden of proof to importers. The current rule bans goods if reasonable evidence exists of forced labor.

The bill now must pass the House of Representatives before it can be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law. The House passed a similar bill in 2020
The bill was introduced by Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR). Rubio previously authored the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-145).
In a separate move, the U.S. State Department updated its “Xinjiang Supply Chain Advisory,” which warned that “businesses and individuals that do not exit supply chains, ventures, and/or investments connected to Xinjiang could run a high risk of violating U.S. law.”
The update singled out the solar industry, and said that as of 2020, China controlled an estimated 70% of the global supply for solar-grade polysilicon. It said that China also “dominated manufacturing” in downstream solar photovoltaic components including ingots, wafers, and cells that are assembled into solar modules.
The State Department advisory said that around 95% of solar PV modules rely on solar-grade polysilicon. In 2020, five of the top six solar-grade polysilicon companies, by capacity, were based in China, with 45% of the world’s supply of solar-grade polysilicon coming from four producers with operations in Xinjiang.
The advisory said that because Xinjiang polysilicon is blended with polysilicon made in other regions of China, “separating and tracing the amount and exact origin of any polysilicon from China can be difficult.” It said that at each stage in the solar supply chain, “there is evidence of enterprises with links to the labor transfer programs that engage in coercive labor practices and to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).”
The State Department said that the XPCC has been sanctioned by the U.S. government in connection with “serious human rights abuse” and is “closely connected” with polysilicon production in Xinjiang.
The advisory said that the “pervasiveness of forced labor programs” in Xinjiang and co-mingling of solar-grade polysilicon supplies by downstream manufacturers “raise concerns throughout the entire solar supply chain.” It said it is likely that “absent more robust supply chain safeguards, reliable, enhanced auditing procedures, and continued midstream supply chain chokepoints that the majority of global solar products may continue to have a connection to forced labor and the XPCC.”
The Chinese government in June passed measures authorizing it to punish companies that comply with U.S. sanctions. That could create legal jeopardy for U.S. companies that find themselves having to comply with Customs and Border Patrol mandates.
In April, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a tool that it said would increase supply chain transparency and help ensure that solar components are “made ethically throughout the solar value chain.”
The Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol is a set of guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.” (Read the protocol here.)
In June, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were directed to begin detaining products imported to the U.S. that are made by or that include components made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. and its subsidiaries, due to forced labor allegations.
Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Troy Miller announced the action in a press briefing on June 24. The action was taken under Section 1307 of the Tariff Act. Section 1307 prohibits the importation of merchandise mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced or indentured labor, including forced child labor. Such merchandise is subject to exclusion and seizure, and may lead to criminal investigation of the imported goods.
In making the announcement, Miller said the CBP action followed an investigation into production processes that offered a “reasonable indication” of forced labor being used by Hoshine. He said the investigation revealed evidence of “intimidation and threats” and “restriction of movement” toward workers.
