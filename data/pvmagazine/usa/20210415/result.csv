We’ll break down the decision-making process into bite-sized pieces so you can navigate the process and feel good about your choices.
We’ll focus on the most common type of residential or commercial installation: a system attached to a roof.
And to get started, we will look at how to evaluate the age and condition of your structure’s roof. Is it old? Is it new? Wait… didn’t we just replace the roof not too long ago?
If your roof is less than five years old (or better yet, if it is brand new) then this is a perfect time to install solar. Solar installed on a newer roof is low maintenance, and will age gracefully over the years!
But what if your roof is old or leaking, and will soon need to be replaced? That’s also an ideal opportunity, because it allows your roofers to coordinate with your solar developer to install the best system overall.
But what if your roof is somewhere in between?
Customers often have a problem adding solar panels to roofs that are middle-aged. A typical roof has a 25-year life expectancy, so roofs in the range of 8 to 20 years present a dilemma of wasting many costly “roof years.”
For instance, a 250,000-square-foot white thermoplastic (TPO) roof on a commercial structure might cost $5/sq. ft.—on the order of $1.25 million–to replace. That amounts to roughly $50,000 per roof year. So, if you “give up” five years, that’s $250,000.
And while a homeowner’s dollar amounts are much lower, the dilemma is just as real.
When unsure of what to do because your roof is in that pesky middle-aged range, use this approach to quickly determine the dollar value of the roof’s age:
Expected Roof Lifetime – Age of the Roof = Leftover Roof Life
Divide Leftover Roof Life by Expected Roof Lifetime. (This gives the percentage of the roof’s remaining value)
Multiply that percentage by the cost of the new roof
The dollar amount that results offers a way of figuring out what you may be willing to pay for clean electricity from solar. If that number hurts as the check is written, maybe wait a few years. But not always! Especially not if you’re someone who cares about the environment. In fact, you might purposely decide to spend a little extra for the opportunity to reduce your environmental impact.
And, sometimes, depending on solar incentives and bank financing rates, it actually makes economic sense to replace a roof early. So use the formula as a guide, but weigh it against your other goals and factors.
As a start, get quotes from both roofing and solar contractors. When you compare the total cost of both investments to the long-term electricity savings you stand to realize from the solar system, you can get a good idea of your projected electricity savings.
Obviously, the combined payback period for a new roof and a new solar system is much longer than a solar system’s payback on its own. However, a solar power system pays for itself in a way that asphalt shingles and TPO simply can’t.
Seen from a different angle, buying a roof with a solar system is almost the same as getting a free roof!
Subsequent articles will dive into important questions such as how to find and vet contractors, how to size the system, and what expenses to expect related to hardware, fees, and labor. We also will show how rebates and tax incentives provide a boost to ROI, and how banks now see solar projects as ideal for lending.

The platform outlines principles for engagement, as well as environmental justice outcomes and policies that the organization will support to “expand equitable access” to solar energy and its benefits.
The document lays out policies that expand access to clean energy.

“Equity and environmental justice are core values for the solar + storage industry,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “If we want to build an equitable clean energy economy, we need to be intentional about our advocacy.”
The platform, released as the Solar Industry Policy Principles on Environmental Justice & Equity, includes input from members, diversity professionals, policy experts, and conversations with numerous environmental justice organizations and experts.
The policy platform includes the following areas:
The platform will be a “living document” that SEIA said it will continually review and revisit as the industry evolves and develops new financing mechanisms or policy tools that expand solar accessibility and workforce programs.
The policy platform was initiated by SEIA’s board-level task force on diversity, the DEIJ Leadership Council, which is designed to catalyze further action on SEIA’s diversity work.
Over the coming months, SEIA said it will release a supplier diversity database and a diversity certification program for the solar + storage industry.

The money will be used to complete essential engineering and planning, eventually enabling Hydrostor to move toward construction. The project will be modeled on Hydrostor’s commercially operating Goderich storage facility, and would provide up to 12 hours of long-duration energy storage.
The Goderich A-CAES facility is in  Ontario and is contracted by Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator for peaking capacity, ancillary services, and full participation in the merchant energy market. The facility has a 1.75 MW peak output, 2.20 MW charge rating, and up to 15 MWh of storage capacity.
Hydrostor also is developing the Rosamond A-CAES Project in California, northeast of Los Angeles. That project will provide 500 MW of on-demand peaking capacity for 12 hours of duration once it becomes operational in 2024.

Over the last three years, the social media giant cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 94%, exceeding its initial 75% reduction goal.
Having reached its initial benchmarks, Facebook said it now is setting  a goal to reach net zero emissions for its entire value chain by 2030.
Facebook has been able to rapidly accomplish its goals by becoming one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the world, contracting for around 1 GW of projects in 2020 alone. The company was the second-largest corporate procurer of renewable energy in 2019. It currently ranks third in the world on the list of renewable energy corporate buyers based on cumulative power purchase agreements since 2000, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Worldwide, Facebook has contracts in place with 63 renewable energy installations, totaling more than 6 GW of wind and solar energy across 18 states and five countries.
Earlier this spring, Facebook and General Motors signed up to buy power from an upcoming solar+storage project in southern Kentucky. That project,the Logan County project, will include 173 MW of solar and a 30 MW/120 MWh battery system. Of the total capacity, Facebook is contracted to buy 145 MW of the project’s solar renewable energy credits (RECs) and all of the storage attributes.
The contract was made possible through the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Green Invest program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/15/a-geospatial-approach-to-evaluating-potential-solar-sites/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,MARYLAND",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 15, 2021",A geospatial approach to evaluating potential solar sites,"A team used geospatial analysis to identify optimal sites for solar in a Maryland county. The approach could help other communities as they consider where to site new solar capacity.
Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center (CIC) presented its report to the St. Mary’s County Solar Task Force. The county sits due south of Washington, D.C., on a peninsula bounded on one side by the Potomac River and on the other by the Chesapeake Bay.
The analysis results showed that the county offers multiple opportunities for solar in locations that would minimally impact the natural landscape or prime agricultural land. Sites included rooftops of commercial and residential buildings, above parking lots as solar canopies, on capped landfills, around a wastewater treatment facility, and on county-owned properties.
High-resolution land cover data allowed the study group to do a detailed analysis down to individual parcels in order to determine how much area is available in optimal and preferred sites. The team also calculated the energy generation potential from these locations.
The study set out to identify all potential solar sites, including those that met legal (zoning) and technical criteria. It ranked county parcels on a range of environmental, equity, and efficiency criteria. It also identified a second tier of locations–preferred ground-mounted sites–that would avoid land-use tradeoffs and conflicts with agriculture or environmentally valuable lands.
These sites met the following criteria: they had less than 50% total tree canopy in the parcel, had more than 5 acres of “Solar Opportunity Area” (defined as a sum of low vegetation, barren, and herbaceous high-resolution land cover classes), had less than 50% prime agricultural soil, had less than 75% soil of statewide importance, and were not in a designated no-go zone (defined as protected, or legally restricted, areas) or within a designated Intensely Developed Area of the critical area.
Sites that were within a mile of an existing transmission line were defined as “preferred;” sites that met the criteria but were farther away were tagged as “other opportunities.”
Based on the analysis, St. Mary’s County has the potential to generate 4,097 GWh/yr of electricity from solar energy from 4,431 acres of optimal sites such as degraded lands and landfills, rooftops, parking lot canopies, and publicly owned lands. Another  4,026 GWh/yr of potential was available from 2,614 acres of preferred ground-mounted sites less than one mile from transmission lines. The report said these numbers “well exceed” the 331 GWh/yr estimate for St. Mary’s share of solar compared to the rest of the state.
Maryland is one of 30 states with a Renewable Portfolio Standard. Maryland’s mandate requires 50% of electricity sold by utilities to come from renewable sources, with 14.5% from solar. The Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) that serves St. Mary’s County is excluded from the 14.5% carve-out, and instead is required to reach a solar carve-out of 2.5% of retail sales. Even so, the report said that land in the county still could be used for solar installations to meet statewide goals.
The results are displayed in a web app that is open to the public.  The full report is available here.

E. Shaw Renewable Investments has announced commercial operation of the 180 MW Cove Mountain solar projects in Iron County, Utah, northeast of Las Vegas.
Cove Mountain (58 MW) and Cove Mountain II (122 MW) both have long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with PacifiCorp on behalf of Facebook, fulfilling a considerable portion of the electricity need of Facebook’s data center operations.
Swinerton Renewable Energy constructed the projects.
The two Cove Mountain projects were part of a flurry of PPAs that Facebook signed last fall, a portfolio that also included projects in Ohio, Illinois, Tennessee and Ireland which, when combined with the Cove Mountain project, came out to roughly 806 MW of solar and wind power.
Cove Mountain and Cove Mountain II weren’t the only projects Facebook targeted in Utah, signing additional PPAs for Graphite Solar, an 80-MW installation coming to being developed by rPlus Energies in Carbon County; Rocket Solar, another 80-MW installation, this time in Box Elder County, developed by D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments and Enyo Renewable Energy; and D.E. Shaw Renewable and Enyo endeavor, the 75-MW Horseshoe Solar installation coming to Tooele County.
Cove Mountain and Cove Mountain 2 represent two of D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments’ nine projects that are currently operating, under construction, or have signed PPAs in Utah.

The projects are expected to be fully operational by December 2022.
The 15-year agreements will support development of two renewable energy projects in southern Alberta, consisting of solar and wind projects totaling 170 MW of installed capacity. Under the agreements, Bimbo Canada will procure the benefit of around 50 MW to offset its electricity consumption. Commercial development of the solar and wind farms will be finalized later this year by RES Canada.
Summit Ridge Energy said it secured a $55 million tax equity commitment from investment manager Foss & Co. The partnership will fund a roughly 73 MW portfolio of residential and commercial community solar projects across Illinois, Maryland, and Maine.
Summit Ridge started construction on the portfolio in 2020 and expects each project to achieve commercial operations in 2021. Once operational, the projects will generate electricity for residential and commercial customers across six utility service territories. Commercial customers include small, medium, and large businesses who will remotely subscribe to the community solar projects.
Hunt Perovskite Technologies said it was awarded $2.5 million in funding for perovskite development work. The award was made by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office Fiscal Year 2020 Perovskite Funding Program.
In addition, Hunt is also co-principle Investigator and collaborative partner in two other DOE perovskite funding award selections, including a $1.5 million award to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a $1.25 million award to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).
