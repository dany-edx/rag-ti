The Conway Solar project, located near Happy, Arkansas, includes a $533 million multi-project financing package. The company closed a $533 million multi-project financing package for the Ventress Solar project, located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Lightsource bp will build, own, and operate both facilities. Power from the Happy project in Arkansas will deliver clean energy to Conway Corp. under a long-term power purchase agreement for their customers in the City of Conway. The solar farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 21,400 homes and will also play a role in reducing the city’s carbon footprint by the equivalent of CO2 emissions from 35,400 fuel burning cars annually.
Construction of the Conway Solar farm at Happy will create approximately 200 construction jobs, to be filled mainly by local workers. In addition, it will abate about 162,800 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually for the city of Conway, equivalent to annual emissions from about 35,400 fuel burning cars. Construction will start in March 2022, with full commercial operation expected in mid-2023. Gibson Technical Services (GTS), a Subsidiary of Orbital Energy Group, has been selected by Lightsource bp as the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor for the photovoltaic (PV) solar plant.
Lightsource bp will also build, own, and operate the Lousiana project, which is the state’s largest solar project to date. The energy it generates will be sold to McDonald’s Corporation and eBay under long-term power purchase agreements.
 “This unique partnership between Lightsource bp, eBay and McDonald’s is an example of how large brands can come together to drive meaningful impact at a local level,” said Emma Cox, Global Renewable Energy Lead at McDonald’s.
Construction of the Ventress solar farm Construction has begun, with full commercial operation expected in late 2023. LPL Solar has been selected by Lightsource bp as the EPC contractor for the photovoltaic (PV) solar plant. Ampirical Solutions, headquartered in Louisiana, has been selected as the EPC for the project substation and the switchyard.
The Ventress solar project will create approximately 400 construction jobs for 21-24 months, to be filled mainly by local workers. It will provide an estimated $30 million dollar boost to Pointe Coupee Parish over the project life, providing additional funding for schools, fire departments, libraries and health services, without a tax increase on its citizens. In addition it will abate about 450,000 metric tons of GHG emissions annually, equivalent to annual emissions from about 99,000 fuel burning cars. And it will deliver an indirect economic impact of over $200 million, according to a study by the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, an economic development agency supporting the nine-parish Baton Rouge Area.
“Beyond improving the health and energy security of communities across America, large-scale solar projects help strengthen local economies. As the owner and operator of the Ventress solar farm, we look forward to bringing economic benefits to Pointe Coupee Parish, along with fostering long-term community partnerships,” said Kevin Smith, CEO of the Americas, Lightsource bp.
Just last month Lightsource bp closed financing and broke ground on two massive projects. The 293 MW Sun Mountain solar project in Colorado, and the 173 MW Bellflower solar project, set to be constructed east of Indianapolis, will each be among the largest in their respective states. In the last two years, the Lightsource bp team has raised over $2.3 billion in financing for its projects in ten states across the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/12/work-on-teslas-rooftop-solar-system-appears-to-be-underway/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RACKING,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 12, 2022",Work on Tesla’s rooftop solar system appears to be underway,"Tesla’s ongoing construction of their Texas Gigafactory appears to have reached the stage where solar panels are being installed. According to information posted by one of the many individuals that make a hobby out of flying drones over the active construction site, the three main manufacturers chosen are Longi for solar panels, Unirac for the mechanical racking, and SolarEdge for inverters.
In Joe Tegtmeyer’s ‘Tesla Gigafactory Texas 5 January 2022 Cyber Truck & Model Y Factory Construction Update (08:00AM)’ on Youtube, viewers can see the hardware being deployed. The 20- minute video starts with a discussion on the hardware where Tegtmeyer notes the manufacturers.
At approximately seven minutes and 15 seconds into the video, the drone crests the west edge of the building, bringing the pallets of gear into focus. Then, by about the eight minute mark, the drone heads off to other parts of the structure.
 

The drone operator speculates that the Longi solar panels are Hi-MO5 bifacial products. While the product is a likely candidate for this project, the images and video released did not confirm the panels’ specifications.
The racking hardware specifications, however, were quite clearly Unirack’s RM10 EVO product. This product is a ballasted racking specifically designed for bifacial solar panels. It is angled at 10 degrees and faces south.
The third manufacturer noted is SolarEdge. While there were no drone shots close enough to read the labels, one could assume SolarEdge’s Synergy product line is used here.
When building the first Gigafactory, located in Nevada, Tesla suggested that the factory would have the world’s largest rooftop solar power plant at approximately 70MWdc. In the years since however, that solar power installation was never completed.
It was recently suggested that the first Gigafactory installation will now be sized closer to 22 MW of solar panels. While that wouldn’t break any world records, it could still earn the respectable title of largest rooftop solar power installation in the United States.
At the Texas Gigafactory, the press has so far not attempted to guess the size of the solar rooftop. So, this author did a very rough – and not fully compliant – design in Helioscope to give our readers an idea of the scope of this colossal structure.
The 4.2 million square foot outline could hold approximately 114,000 Longi LR5-HBD-545M solar panels. The total wattage of these solar panels could reach 62MW. If we remove 5% of those panels to meet local fire inspector regulations for walkways, the facility could potentially host as much as 59MW of capacity.
The multi-story manufacturing facility could probably use most of that electricity, but for now, that data is still unknown. It seems reasonable to assume that the facility will contain at least some integrated energy storage as a hedge against Texas’ questionably winterized power grid/natural gas situation, especially considering Tesla’s world leading expertise on the topic.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/12/solar-supply-chain-trouble-to-ease-this-year-according-to-analyst/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,CHINA,INDIA,JAPAN",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 12, 2022","Solar supply chain trouble to ease this year, according to analyst","The supply chain problems which helped drive up the cost of solar power equipment last year will ease in 2022, according to Scottish analyst Wood Mackenzie.
A note issued yesterday by the U.S.-owned data company, which highlighted how such issues drove up the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) across the Asia-Pacific region in 2021, saw senior analyst Rishab Shrestha state: “Renewables’ supply chain bottlenecks are expected to ease in 2022 and beyond, and the respective LCOE will return to a declining trend.”
With Chinese polysilicon companies ramping up production facilities, WoodMac said an easing in supply problems, and related cost rises, would reverse a 9% year-on-year rise in the average cost of solar projects across the region recorded last year, to US$0.086/kWh – the first such rise in the history of the region’s solar industry.
The only market not to experience more expensive PV electricity last year was solar superpower China, in part thanks to the zero-tolerance Covid policy which has attracted so much attention in western nations of late. Rampant rises in the cost of fossil fuels in China, domestic solar manufacturing, and the nation’s climate change commitments were also factors, according to Verisk-owned WoodMac.
Steepling rises in fossil fuel costs last year ensured that even with their unusual price premiums, Asia-Pacific solar and onshore wind projects – the latter rising in cost 2%, to US$0.103/kWh – gained ground in their economic business case against gas-fired power projects, which became 46% more costly in the region in 2021, and coal plants, which cost 19% more than in 2020.
While solar and onshore wind facilities are 12-29% cheaper over their project lifetime than fossil fuel equivalents in India, China and Australia, “a significant renewables premium” across the other Asia-Pacific countries ensures such clean power plants are 16% more costly over their operating life than gas and coal generation sites, across the region as a whole.
That situation will be reversed by the end of the decade, according to WoodMac, which predicted solar projects, and to a lesser extent onshore wind sites, will together be 28% cheaper than coal across the Asia-Pacific market in 2030 and will achieve at least cost parity with gas. By that stage, solar and onshore wind will be 50-55% cheaper than coal in India, China and Australia, casting into doubt the efficacy of the successful push by the former two nations to water down a desired global commitment to phase out coal use, at the COP26 climate change talks in Glasgow in November.
With gas-fired generation costs potentially set to be driven up 70-100% by the costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology this decade, according to the analyst, the current 50% price premium of renewables with energy storage against the fossil fuel could be removed by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/12/u-s-geothermal-lithium-offers-significant-potential/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,IDAHO,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 12, 2022",U.S. geothermal lithium offers significant potential,"Against the backdrop of growing demand for battery production, the availability of certain materials and the environmental impact of mining them have become central to the energy transition debate throughout the world. For one of the key materials, lithium, pressure has been rising to alter extraction methods or take an entirely different approach.
Commercial lithium now comes from conventional saline salar brine and spodumene ore extractions, but efforts to retrieve lithium from geothermal brine before cycling it back into the ground are increasing in popularity, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. In a paper published in the journal Resources, Conservation & Recycling, scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have evaluated the United States’ potential to supply geothermal lithium using Systems Dynamics modeling.
Their goal was to assess the viability of U.S. lithium supply from geothermal brines and the potential supply chain impact of extracting lithium from this source. They found that the supply of this type of lithium could reach around 60,000 tons by 2030, which would represent around 4% to 8% of total U.S. lithium supply. By means of comparison, the country’s only large-scale lithium mine, Silver Peak in Nevada, produces roughly 4,500 tons a year, which is less than 2% of the world’s annual supply.
The researchers have discovered that extracting lithium from geothermal brines is economically viable. With projections of 23 million to 43 million electric vehicles on the street by 2030, lithium extraction from geothermal could generate up to $258 million to $311 million. They found that this type of lithium extraction might also offset geothermal capital costs, making electrical generation from geothermal more cost competitive.
“(This) provides not only a viable option to meet demand in the long term but also a reliable source for lithium extraction domestically,” said Ange-Lionel Toba, an INL systems modeling researcher. “The technology risk is apparent, but the upside is worth exploiting.”
The circulatory systems of geothermal power plants are a plentiful source of lithium. While producing heat and carbon-free electricity, geothermal plants extract hot, briny water that is loaded with minerals, including lithium. This salty water, or geothermal brine, is pumped to the surface and converted to a gas that turns a turbine to generate electricity. In repurposing the extracted fluids already used for electricity production as a lithium source, the environmental footprint is tiny in comparison to traditional forms of lithium extraction, including very low carbon emissions.
Earlier research led by the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, showed that as much as 15,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate could be recovered from a single geothermal power plant in California’s Salton Sea area, the most mineral-rich brine source in the United States. There are currently 13 geothermal plants in the region and more are planned.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/12/lbl-explores-how-to-compensate-battery-owners-for-grid-value/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 12, 2022",LBL explores how to compensate battery owners for grid value,"Distributed batteries “offer utilities an under-utilized, flexible resource,” says a report from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
Batteries that customers purchase for use during power outages, and batteries used to increase solar self-consumption, could both provide grid services at other times, the report says.
To capture the value of batteries, policymakers and utilities can “improve distributed battery storage economics” in a way that also reduces grid operating costs. That involves compensating customers so they are more likely to buy a battery and operate it in a way that provides grid services. Grid services from batteries will then reduce the need for utility-provided grid services, reducing costs for all customers.
Beyond batteries’ obvious ability to provide energy, batteries can also provide capacity, as well as grid services such as ramping support, frequency regulation, and voltage regulation, the authors note. Batteries can also reduce solar curtailment, and help defer transmission and distribution investments.
The report aims to guide decision-makers on the challenges of updating utility rate designs to “capture” the value of distributed batteries, and describes some approaches that states and utilities have taken so far.
The authors foresee greater adoption of distributed batteries as battery costs fall, and a greater ability for batteries to provide grid services with “advanced technology that enables a higher level of visibility, communication, and control.”
They point to three such technologies: smart inverters for batteries that are compliant with the IEEE 1547-2018 standard; virtual power plants that aggregate customer-sited batteries using automated controls and communication; and distributed energy resource management (DERM) systems operated by utilities.
The authors focus on the retail utility perspective. A distribution utility “typically has very little visibility of the real-time operation” of distributed resources, they say, adding that this can impair the utility’s ability to “ensure real-time reliable and safe operation of the distribution system.”
The report does not discuss sending real-time prices to smart batteries and other devices that can automatically respond to price signals. That approach was proven to work in a pilot study on a distribution circuit served by the California utility SCE, funded by the California Energy Commission. Even so, the LBL study projects that over time, “more dynamic, automated programs could become prevalent.”
In regions with a grid operator known as an ISO or RTO, grid services that batteries can provide may be priced through organized markets that “produce a transparent assessment of value,” the report says, but grid services “procured outside of organized markets must rely on avoided costs.”
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory report is titled “Opportunities and Challenges to Capturing Distributed Battery Value via Retail Utility Rates and Programs.”
