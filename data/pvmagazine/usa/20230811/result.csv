A report by The Office of the New York State Comptroller (NYSOSC), currently led by Thomas P. DiNapoli, states that as of 2022, renewables accounted for approximately 29% of the electricity generated in the state came from renewable sources, of which roughly 75% came from hydroelectric generation, with the remaining 25% primarily split between wind and solar. In 2019, New York State adopted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which including goals of generating 70% of electricity used from renewables by 2030;installing 6 GW of distributed solar by 2025;  installing 3 GW of storage by 2030, and more.
An analysis by the NYISO found that to meet the CLCPA 2030 renewable electricity goal, the state will have to more than triple the installed 2022 renewable capacity of roughly 6.5 GW by adding an additional 20 GW over an 8-year period.
The NYSOSC report names three interrelated processes that play a role in the development of renewable electric generation resources in the state. The processes work in parallel and developers should note that they do not need to have completed any of the processes before they can enter one of the other processes. Permitting and grid interconnection, however, are required for any all-new sources of generation.
The three processes are incentives, permitting and siting and interconnection. Through various programs, particularly renewable energy certificates (RECs), incentives stimulate the market to advance the state toward its renewable goals. The report notes that the permitting process is intended to ensure that projects are sited in areas and under conditions consistent with state and local laws and regulations. The interconnection process should ensure sufficient electric transmission and distribution infrastructure to satisfy customer demand. The report suggests that streamlining the three parallel processes can help reduce the frequency of slow-moving or canceled projects. This is essential, the report contends, to ensuring the state will meet its goal of removing greenhouse gasses from the grid by 2040. 
According to the report, there were three key challenges that hindered its progress: inconsistent provision of incentives; project cancellations; and lengthy project timelines due to delays in siting and operationalization. 
The funding for projects varied widely, too: from $400 million to finance two procurements in 2011 to $66 million in 2013. This irregularity resulted in slow progress, preventing the state from meeting  renewable electricity goals outlined in the RPS. 
The NYSOSC report suggests funding commitments increased under New York’s CES from $360 million in 2016 to $1.4 billion in 2017, leading to more projects under contract. NYSERDA indicates that if the current pipeline of developments is finished, they will provide 66% of New York’s projected electricity needs.
Decreasing project timelines 
Delays in siting and operationalization are the primary cause of slow project timelines, the report contends. 
According to the New York League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, only one renewable electricity generation project has been approved through Article 10 of the New York State Public Service Law since the end of 2018.  
The formation of ORES in 2020 has shortened approval times. The department has 60 days to determine an application’s completeness and a one-year limit to issue a final permit. NYSOSC suggests this new approach has helped to expedite some projects, “Since June, ORES has permitted 13 renewable electric generating facilities, totaling 2.1 gigawatts of generation capacity.”
However, the office still needs a secure vetting process to prevent permitting and interconnection irregularities in the future. 
Reforms to the interconnection process overseen by NYISO include shortening the time it takes the organization to assess the impacts of a proposed renewable electric facility on the state’s transmission grid. Between 2018 and 2022, NYISO was one of four independent system operators with over three year wait times, the longest in the country. 
However, in 2023, projects with over 8 GW of renewable capacity, including two of the state’s offshore wind projects, completed the NYISO interconnection process. The organization has 457 developments in its interconnection queue, but the dramatic increase in projects pushed through this year leaves NYSOSC hopeful. 
 
Other challenges the State must address to remove greenhouse gasses from its electric grid by 2040 include building new electric transmission infrastructure to accommodate state-wide renewable electricity and being transparent with consumers about the increase in utility bills. 
New York already has the 10th highest domestic electricity costs. However, the state is looking to lower these through community solar programs and bill credits. Regarding expanding electric transmission grids, The New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) has included proposals to address this in NYSOSC’s report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/11/new-mooring-system-for-offshore-coastal-floating-solar-arrays/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"AUGUST 11, 2023","New mooring system for offshore, coastal floating solar arrays","From pv magazine global
An international research group has designed a new mooring system for offshore, coastal floating solar arrays that is claimed to reduce costs of such projects.
Compared to the prevalent method of mooring with elastic cables, the novel method is said to reduce mooring costs for a system of 195 kW by 24%, from $62,200 to $47,160 over its service life. “Elastic mooring cables need to be tightened periodically because the creepage of rubber can lead to the loss of tension resulting in the increase in maintenance cost over time,” the scientists said referring to one of the possible issues in using this technology.
In the paper “An Adaptive Barrier-Mooring System for Coastal Floating Solar Farms,” which was published in Applied Energy, the scientists explained that the cost reduction is due to the cheaper material cost and fewer requirements for maintenance in the new system. “The cost comparison is only indicative as there is significant uncertainty in the various costs,” they emphasized. “In addition, the cost estimations only include the mooring system. Other related costs, such as transportation, have not been considered.”
Dubbed adaptive barrier mooring system (ABMS), the new system consists of perimeter pontoons, barriers, clump weights, mooring lines and anchors.
“The barrier is hinged to the pontoon at the top and tied to the clump weight at the bottom, while the mooring lines connect the clump weight with the anchors fixed at the seabed,” the researchers explained, referring to the functions of the system’s different parts. “The pontoon provides the buoyancy, while the barrier tensioned by the clump weight mitigates the wave action with the mooring lines holding the platform in place.”
In their analysis, the scientists used models scaled at 1:30, with the parameters of the various configurations carefully considered to be realistic compared to field deployment. They compared the performance of a floating array based on a conventional elastic system with that of a floating farm where the sea-facing front is supported by ABMS and the coast-facing rear is supported by a variation of this ABMS-based system where the barrier is replaced by mooring lines.
The researchers found that the system using the new mooing tech is 40% more vertically stable in short wave periods. In addition, the ABMS-based system proved to handle changes in water depth of up to 36%, which is highly relevant under tidal fluctuations, without introducing slack in the mooring cables. “Slack may produce sudden jerks and damage the mooring points,” the researchers explained.
The research team included scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the Dalian University of Technology in China. “We hope that the development of ABMS can further aid the development of coastal floating solar farms in the future,” the team concluded. “At present, floating solar farms have already been installed in freshwater bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. However, very few coastal floating solar farms have been installed so far despite the wider availability in sea space, due to the challenges of more complex environmental conditions in the coastal environment.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/11/sunlight-financial-challenged-to-sell-550-million-in-residential-loans/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 11, 2023",Sunlight Financial challenged to sell $550 million in residential loans,"Sunlight Financial Holdings, known for its residential solar financing, has raised substantial doubts about its future operational viability. Their 10-Q financial documents, released on August 9, 2023, highlight a note about the company’s ability to continue as a “going concern” due to issues regarding raising cash for new loans.
The primary challenge for Sunlight arises in their “Indirect Loan” product.  Starting in the second half of 2022, this product has been at the forefront of Sunlight’s offerings, and they’ve now acquired nearly $550 million worth of them. Yet, it has simultaneously placed the company in a precarious financial position. Sunlight has been holding these loans on its balance sheet, awaiting the right opportunity to sell them and thereby raise cash for the issuance of new loans – however – to date, the company has struggled to find buyers at a profitable price.
Recent Sunlight stock performance paints a grim picture: a 23% drop in the past five days and a staggering 96.4% plummet since its January 2021 launch. Roth MKM, a focused solar power analyst, once maintained a neutral stance toward Sunlight. However, post this disclosure, they’ve shifted Sunlight’s status to “Under Review”, citing unreliability in their data.

According to Sunlight’s 10-Q, the company faces difficulty in selling these Indirect loans:
The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates is playing the leading role in this challenge. With interest rates climbing from 0% in March of 2022 to a substantial 5.25% today, the financial environment has turned volatile. Sunlight’s process means that loan approvals preceded specific cost amendments, meaning that Sunlight adjusted rates slower than the Federal Reserve escalated theirs.
To mitigate the ongoing rate increases, Sunlight took “pricing actions” on these loan products. The expectation was to offload these loans at a profit, but prevailing market conditions hindered such sales. As a result, Sunlight now has a backlog, with products valued (as per their former evaluations) at $550 million on their balance sheets. Although their financial partners have waived a cap surpassing $500 million, Sunlight clarifies that this is a short-term concession.
The 10-Q further sheds light on Sunlight’s Q2 performance. Key metrics, such as revenues, net income, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), are all down significantly.

In 2022, the residential sector was the bright spot in the U.S. solar market, boasting a 40% increase in installed solar capacity. This growth came even as the nation’s overall solar installations dwindled due to challenges from solar module import tariffs. Pioneering market leaders like Sunlight contributed to this rise, leveraging aggressive financing strategies to offer affordable loans to homeowners eager to invest in solar power.
For example, SolarEdge witnessed record revenue growth in 2022, buoyed largely by its U.S. sales volume. Yet, despite posting record revenue and experiencing global growth, their most recent quarterly report indicated softness in the U.S. market, which subsequently impacted their stock price.
Industry analysts, such as Ohm Analytics, have noted a shift: residential solar contractors are transitioning away from challenging solar finance states like Texas and Florida. Instead, they’re gravitating toward states offering greater incentives or those with elevated electricity prices to augment sales. This shift follows a conundrum for companies that relied heavily on loan financing structures, such as upfront payments upon deal closure, from entities like Sunlight Financial. Without a steady influx of capital, these companies are grappling with operational challenges.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/11/nikola-bags-58-2-million-for-hydrogen-stations-to-fuel-heavy-duty-vehicles/,"HYDROGEN,ARIZONA,CALIFORNIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 11, 2023",Nikola bags $58.2 million for hydrogen stations to fuel heavy-duty vehicles,"Nikola was granted a total of $58.2 million from various regulatory agencies to build a series of hydrogen refueling stations for heavy-duty trucks, the company announced last week.
Nikola Corporation is a designer and manufacturer of heavy-duty commercial battery-electric vehicles (BEV), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), and energy infrastructure solutions. With headquarters and manufacturing facilities in Arizona, the company began serial production of the hydrogen fuel cell electric truck last month. Earlier this year Nikola launched Hyla, a subsidiary with plans to generate 30 metric tons per day at its Phoenix, Ariz. hydrogen hub, with plans to expand to 150 metric tons in further stages. The first phase of construction of the hub is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024, the company reports.
The largest of the grants to Nikola is $41.9 million from the California Transportation Commission, along with California Department of Transportation to build six refueling stations for heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell trucks in Southern California. In addition, the company received $3.3 million from the California Energy Commission, $1.6 million from the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee, $7 million from the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District and $4.4 million from the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
“Building an integrated, hydrogen ecosystem to support hydrogen fuel cell electric truck deployment and creating a scalable energy business, is a top priority for us,” said Carey Mendes, president of Nikola Energy.
This May, Nikola announced a partnership between its Hyla brand and infrastructure company Voltera, to develop up to 50 hydrogen stations in North America over the next five years. Work has begun on eight initial stations, Nikola announced while reporting its second quarter earnings. The first one, which located in Ontario, California, is scheduled to begin operating at the end of this year. 
Some of the steps that regulators can take to ease the challenges in building out heavy-duty hydrogen refueling networks include implementing voucher-style programs that reduce the incremental cost upfront for end users, and federal funding that flows to states to offer grants, Mendes told pv magazine USA.
Nikola began serial production of its hydrogen fuel cell electric truck on July 31, the company reported in its second quarter earnings, and had at that point received orders for over 200 hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks from 18 customers. It expects to start delivering the trucks in September. 
Hydrogen as a transportation fuel is a relatively nascent market, especially in terms of the market for heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles, like trucks. As of this year, there were 59 retail hydrogen fueling stations in the U.S., largely clustered in California, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. However, only a small number of these are set up to support heavy-duty hydrogen vehicles. The agency anticipates that as more of these vehicles come on to the roads, the country will need to build out much larger stations. 
“The increase in production and distribution of hydrogen for these stations could improve efficiency and utilization of expensive capital equipment leading to lower fuel costs per kilogram, benefiting both heavy- and light-duty customers,” the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center notes. 
Last year, Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy Resources and BlackRock Renewable Power announced they had signed a memorandum of understanding to take a closer look at designing, installing and operating a charging network for medium- and heavy-duty battery electric vehicles as well as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles across the nation, with an initial investment of $650 million. The companies planned to initially focus on charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles, and then hydrogen fueling stations.
