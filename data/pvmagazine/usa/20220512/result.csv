https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/12/secretary-of-commerce-falsely-represented-record-of-solar-tariffs-before-senate/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ASIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 12, 2022",Secretary of Commerce may have underrepresented history of solar tariff rates before Senate,"Appearing before a subcommittee meeting with the Senate, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo addressed bipartisan concerns about an antidumping investigation launched by a petition from a small module manufacturer, Auxin Solar. The investigation could lead to tariffs on solar goods shipped from four Southeast Asian countries that supply about 80% of US polysilicon-based solar panels.
The tariffs can reach as high as 250% of the value of the shipped goods, backdated to November 2021, which has caused a level of uncertainty, essentially halting the deployment of solar in the United States.
“It is true Commerce would be permitted to impose a tariff at that excessive level,” said Secretary Gina Raimondo. “That is exceedingly unlikely, which is to say that level of a tariff is only reserved in outside cases when you can’t tell the difference between the company and, say, the Communist Party of China. The last 150 times we’ve done this since 2012, we’ve come out in the 10, 11, 12 percent range.”
“I am in no way predetermining what this will be, if it will be anything, but the 200% is an extreme case and not fitting with the precedent that we’ve had,” said Raimondo. pv magazine will follow up with Commerce to determine if the Secretary was referring to the past 150 antidumping cases in general, or if this figure was referring specifically to the solar industry.
However, records in the Federal Register show that tariff rates have often come in much higher than 10% to 12%. Dating back to 2012, solar tariffs on Chinese antidumping have ranged from less than 1% to over 100%. In 2017-2018, major suppliers Trina Solar were 92.5%, Risen Energy 100.79%, Canadian Solar 95.5%, Jinko Solar 95.5%. Suppliers that were fully in compliance with the seventh antidumping case paid 0% in tariffs.

And, for unlisted companies that did not participate directly in the investigation, tariffs have been 238.95% each year since 2012.
The investigation has led the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to cut its forecast for solar deployments this year by 46%, and House Representative Scott Peters said that as many as 100,000 US jobs are on the line as a result.
Reacting to the meeting, SEIA president Abigail Ross Hopper said, “Secretary Raimondo seems to suggest that if anti-circumvention tariffs were imposed on solar imports, the applicable tariff rates would be relatively minor and thus a low risk for importers. These remarks play into the petitioner’s misleading claims about the merits of the petition and impacts of the investigation.”
During the meeting, Raimondo was pressed by Senators on both sides of the aisle on the urgency of the issue. “We are in a major, major hurry, because the solar industry in the United States is at a halt,” said Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI).
To succeed in this case, Auxin Solar must show that solar cell manufacturing is “minor and insignificant processing,” Hopper called this “an absurd claim for anyone with a basic understanding of solar cell manufacturing.”
Schatz argued the allegation that the manufacturing taking place in the four Southeast Asian countries is “minor and insignificant” is “facially not true.” He added that Commerce has already determined in multiple rulings that the wafer to cell conversion taking place in the four countries is a significant service, suggesting that anti-circumvention allegations are invalid.
“I’ve heard from many of you, and many in the industry, and I share the sense of urgency,” said the Secretary. However, Raimondo distanced herself from the initial fact-finding process spurred by the petition, saying she was “not involved” and that she was unable to speak in detail about the process.
Sen. Schatz added that the authority is vested in the Secretary to administrate the process. He pleaded with the Secretary to get more personally involved. Schatz also asked Raimondo to commit to meeting with the Senate on a weekly basis to update the process “with pace,” which Raimondo agreed to.
Statutory requirement
Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) asked how the investigation can be swiftly ended. “When I’ve asked you this question, you’ve said your hands are tied,” he said, “and I’m trying to figure out how to untie your hands.”
“Statutorily, there is no discretion,” said Raimondo. “We are going to move as fast as we can.”
Moran questioned the Auxin petition, asking how a “small, single company without access to confidential information” could satisfy requirements to launch the investigation. “Why is there no industry-supported threshold to initiate this anti-circumvention inquiry? Would legislation be helpful?”
Raimondo then suggested to the Senator that if legislation were enacted to give Commerce more discretion, then it could implement those changes. Moran requested that Commerce and the Senate work together to find ways to rework the statue that mandated the investigation.
Industry remarks
“If you buy a solar panel today from one of the four affected countries, you may not know how much you owe in tariffs until months, or even years, from now,” said Hopper. “Why would any reasonable business buy solar panels in such a risky and uncertain business environment?”
“Solar cell manufacturing occurs in many stages and will continue to be a global operation until the United States makes serious investments in domestic manufacturing,” said Hopper. The call for long-term industrial manufacturing policy has been echoed by many players in the solar industry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/12/electric-vehicles-are-cheaper-than-gas-powered-depending-on-the-state-and-incentives/,"EV,FINANCE,INSURANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 12, 2022","Electric vehicles are cheaper than gas-powered, depending on the state and incentives","As gas prices escalate in the United States, many Americans are considering investing in an electric vehicle. The initial purchase price is a deal stopper for some, but when you look at the numbers, it appears that owning an electric vehicle is, in many states, actually cheaper on a monthly basis than a gas-powered vehicle. A study conducted by Energy Innovation Policy & Technology LLC finds that in most states, new electric vehicles (EVs) are cheaper to own on a monthly basis than gasoline-powered vehicles from the day they are driven off the lot.
The study found that owning an EV can save consumers an average of $6,000 over the vehicle’s lifetime. The big caveat, however, is that the savings is dependent on upon Congress passing EV consumer incentives. This includes, at minimum, the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV sales. While the tax credit is a useful method of stimulating sales (and purportedly removing gas-powered vehicles off the roads), it comes with a catch—manufacturers can extend the credit to 200,000 EV sales in year. It is not insignificant that both Ford and Nissan will likely exceed the federal tax credit cap this year. Results of the study shows that increasing the tax credit amount to $10,000 would make EVs cheaper in nearly every state-vehicle comparison in the study’s modeling. Currently gas prices are even higher than when the modeling was done, but if gas prices were to drop, tax credits take on even greater significance because the operating cost difference shrinks.
The study reviewed the monthly costs of owning six different EVs, comparing them to their gasoline equivalents.
Source: Energy Innovation Policy & Technology LLC
These costs include financing, state taxes and fees, state and federal rebates and tax credits, fuel, maintenance, and insurance.
Financing costs are about the same between EVs and gas-powered vehicles, except where manufacturers are discounting interest rates for EV purchases. The good news is that after a loan is paid off, EVs become dramatically cheaper to own, with some saving as much as $1,500 to $2,000 per year, with some vehicle-state combinations as high as $3,000 per year.
Maintenance costs were found to be about 40% lower for EVs ($0.061/mile) compared to gasoline vehicles ($0.101/mile). Annual maintenance costs were estimated using per-mile estimates from DOE and estimated average annual mileage of 13,469 over the loan term using data from modeling done by the US Environmental Protection.
Vehicle fueling costs are estimated using annual mileage, fuel efficiency from FuelEconomy.gov, current average state gasoline prices from AAA as of May 4th, 2022 (which have risen since then) and 2021 average residential electricity rates. Different states levy different fees on electric vehicles—many assessing a “tax” to compensate for lost gasoline tax revenue. (The study does not look at the associated costs of charging from home with solar energy.) Maintenance, fuel costs, and other fees were added together to get the estimated annual operating costs.

The results show that the EV models of the Hyundai Kona SEL and Ford F-150 are cheaper in every single state to finance and own today than the equivalent gasoline model. The Volvo XC40 and Nissan models are just a few dollars or less in several of the states where it is cheaper to own the gasoline version. For example, the Nissan Leaf’s monthly difference is less than $15 in Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, and less than $1 per month in some states. Yellow shaded cells below show combinations where EVs were $15 or less per month more expensive to own. In states that have high electricity prices and/or lower gasoline prices, gasoline vehicles remain cheaper to own than EVs. Some of these states include Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.
While the initial sticker price on an electric vehicle may deter some from making the jump to electric from gas vehicles, the data shows that many EV models in many states are cheaper than a gasoline vehicle. The report authors note, however, that increased EV adoption is contingent on a federal tax credit of at least $7,500. “GM and Tesla have already exceeded the sales cap under this program, and Nissan and Ford will likely hit the cap this year. Without this incentive, it would cost consumers more per month during loan repayment to purchase an EV for nearly all vehicle-state comparisons we evaluated”.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/12/ikea-to-offer-sunpower-residential-solar-and-energy-storage/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 12, 2022",IKEA to offer SunPower residential solar and energy storage,"IKEA announced it has entered a partnership with SunPower to deliver home solar solutions, starting in Fall 2022 in select markets in California. Members of the IKEA customer loyalty program will be able to purchase residential solar systems and battery energy storage at store locations.
The partnership brings IKEAs strengths in retail and home living, and SunPower carries more than 35 years of solar industry experience. SunPower systems are backed by a 25-year warranty, covering everything from panels to racking to monitoring hardware. It has among the highest DC power output protection in the solar industry, claiming 92% DC power in year 25.
SunPower’s energy storage offering, called the SunVault, offers backup power and can perform other services like peak demand response. It is equipped with 6.8 kW continuous power, 13 kWh / 26 kWh rated energy capacity, and a 10-year warranty. It measures 26” x 63” x 15” and is rated for indoor or outdoor use.
“At IKEA, we’re passionate about helping our customers live a more sustainable life at home. We’re proud to collaborate with SunPower to bring this service to the US and enable our customers to make individual choices aimed at reducing their overall climate footprint,” said Javier Quiñones, CEO & chief sustainability officer, IKEA US.
Quiñones said IKEA’s goal is to expand the service at additional locations outside the select California retail sites in the future.
IKEA’s sustainability measures expand beyond the residential solar partnership, setting goals to be “climate positive” by 2030. It has a portfolio that includes multiple utility scale solar, wind, and geothermal systems. Solar arrays top 90% of IKEA locations.
The company also instituted a buyback and resell program, which gives loyalty program members the opportunity to sell back gently used IKEA furniture in exchange for store credit. Rather than being landfilled, the furniture can be reused and sold affordably in the “as-is” section in the store.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/12/hanwha-solutions-to-expand-solar-cell-and-module-manufacturing-in-the-united-states-and-korea/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 12, 2022",Hanwha Solutions to expand solar cell and module manufacturing in the United States and Korea,"Hanwha Solutions, the Korean company that owns Qcells, announced its $320 million investment plan for expanding solar manufacturing in the United States and Korea. The company said it will seek to spend $170 million building a 1.4 GW solar module production facility in the US in an unspecified location. Qcells already operates a 1.7 GW module factory in Dalton, Georgia. With the new factory expected to come online as early as the first half of 2023, Qcells’ total production capacity in the United States will exceed 3 GW, or approximately one-third of the current US solar module production capacity.
The company also announced its plan to invest $150 million to  expand cell production capacity in Korea, bringing overall manufacturing capacity in Korea to 5.4 GW.
“Our company has currently a capacity of 12 GW for both cells and modules spread across Korea, Malaysia, China and the US,” CEO Justin Lee told pv magazine at a press briefing for the Smarter E event in Munich, Germany.
The investments aim to boost solar module supply at a time when the US supply chain is in turmoil from the COVID-19 pandemic to uncertainties around anti-circumvention to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. In addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has sent fossil fuel prices skyrocketing, prompting a surge in demand for renewables.
“Growing uncertainties tell us that securing reliable, sustainable energy has become more important than ever before,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Hanwha Qcells. “To do this, Qcells will increase renewable supply from diversified sources and find cleaner ways to produce energy. That way, we will contribute to both energy security and net-zero emissions.”
Hanwha stated that it will make additional investments in the United States, including wafers and cells, pending “the implementation of long-term, durable policy designed to incentivize solar manufacturing”.
“Ensuring policy certainty is crucial to realizing our goal of rebuilding the US solar value chain,” said Lee. “With our relentless efforts to provide reliable, sustainable energy, we will do our utmost to solidify Qcells as the dependable choice for the US solar market.”
Hanwha Solutions is committed to a clean manufacturing process and reports that it will secure low-carbon polysilicon from manufacturers around the world. In March, the company became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, the Norway-headquartered polysilicon manufacturer, which operates massive production facilities in Moses Lake, Washington, where REC Silicon uses hydropower to make solar-grade polysilicon.
“Currently, we are still sourcing around 95% our ingots and wafers from China, but this will change soon, as we have also recently signed a $1.2 billion deal with Korean manufacturer OCI, which is increasing its manufacturing capacity in Malaysia,” Lee said. “We are not planning, however, to restart our own polysilicon production in Korea,” he also stated.
In other news, Qcells is working with Samsung Electronics to introduce a smart heating system with the aim of hitting the market in June. The system combines Qcells’ solar panels and energy storage system with Samsung’s Eco Heating System, intended initially for the European market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/12/50-states-of-solar-incentives-vermont/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,RESIDENTIAL PV,VERMONT",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 12, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Vermont,"When assessing states on the basis of their commitment to the transition to renewable energy, attention almost always goes first to how much renewable capacity each state has operating. The states typically lauded as solar leaders are typically those with the multi-GW capacity, like California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Massachusetts, among others.
Enter Vermont. With roughly 400 MW of solar installed to date, it would be easy to write the state off as another middle-of-the-pack adopter, putting some capacity on line, but not fully embracing solar. Vermont, however, is New England’s least-populous state, and those ‘meastly’ 400 MW serve just over 16% of the state’s electricity needs, more than every state listed previously, save for Massachusetts (20%) and California (25%).
On the policy side, rating Vermont’s commitment to renewables is a bit trickier. The Green Mountain State doesn’t have a 100% renewable by X date mandate; instead, in 2015, it mandated that utilities reach 75% renewable energy by 2032 – which is arguably more aggressive than the interim targets in most other states. The reason it’s arguable is that Vermont includes hydropower in its renewable mandate, a resource that allows for vast capacity additions across singular projects, but one that is also not viable in many other states, forcing them to look elsewhere for their renewable generation.
In 2019, the state’s largest utility, Green Mountain Power (GMP), announced a decarbonization target of 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2025, and 100% renewable energy by 2030, with specific focuses on installing distributed energy resources, (DERs) like residential solar, and increasing the amount of storage installed in the state. However, both hydropower and renewable energy purchases imported from Quebec both count as renewables to GMP.
Solar in Vermont
As was outlined previously, Vermont is home to 400 MW of installed solar, with just 145 MW expected to come on-line in the next five years, according to predictive data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. Those 145 MW are 49th across all 50 states and Washington D.C. in that five-year timeframe, however, the new capacity will bring Vermont to roughly 22% of its energy needs met by solar, so it really is much more useful to talk about Vermont on a per-capita basis, rather than gross capacity totals.
As is illustrated above, much of Vermont’s capacity additions have come via utility scale installations, a fact that holds true in most states. The state has a pretty consistent capacity mix, with a relatively healthy residential market and a very strong commercial and industrial (C&I) market.
Incentives and Programs 
Outside of the federal investment tax credit (ITC) for solar installations, solar hopefuls in Vermont have a handful of different incentive and rebate programs available to them, provided by both the state and utilities. 
In addition to the Federal ITC, Vermont also has a 6.24% state-level credit for solar systems activated on or before 12/31/2022. After that date, the credit steps down to 5.28% for systems placed in service by 12/31/2022, at which point it will drop further to 2.8% indefinitely.
The state also exempts solar projects under 50 kW from statewide property taxes.
Before the system is even designed, homeowners in Vermont have policy peace of mind in the form of the state’s Solar Rights Laws. These laws forbid any sort of ordinance, bylaw, or other binding agreement to be instituted that would prohibit the installation of a solar system, though size and orientation restrictions are still allowed, assuming they don’t affect a potential project’s overall generation or economic viability.
Vermont, like every other state except Tennessee, has a statewide net metering program. Generally available to systems up to 500 kW, the rate at which customers are credited for their excess generation varies from utility to utility, though it is consistently about a cent per kWh lower than the base rate for electricity purchased from the utility. For GMP, the utility which covers about 75% of the state’s landmass and most of its population, the rate is 14.84 cents per kWh. For Vermont Electrical Cooperative customers, the rate is just under 16 cents per kWh.
The state previously had a cap on net metering, wherein the cumulative capacity of net-metered systems was limited to 15% of a utility’s peak demand; however, this was eliminated in 2017.
GMP also offers Tesla Powerwall and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) home battery programs. The BYOD program is an open incentive system for customers looking to add a battery, while the Powerwall program allows customers to lease a system at a flat rate that provides savings over a standard installation.

The BYOD program offers customers up to $10,500 in upfront incentives to purchase their own batteries through local installers. The program is set to support at least 500 customers annually, until the 5 MW yearly storage cap is reached. Under this program, participating customers agree to provide access to stored energy during peak demand times, in order to meet demand and drive down the price of electricity. Moreover, the customers have a relatively expansive list of participating battery options to choose from.
The Powerwall tariff allows up to 500 customers to enroll each year, where they can choose to pay $55 per month for two Powerwall batteries in a 10-year lease which covers standard installation, with the option of five more years at no additional cost or just pay $5,500 up front. Akin to the BYOD program, customers agree to share their stored energy with GMP during peak demand times.
Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading
In 2019, GMP launched a real-time, blockchain-tracked peer to peer energy trading platform which allows businesses to purchase solar power from customers who own the rights to the renewable energy credits via a phone app.
The program was developed to run on LO3 Energy’s existing platform, and all transactions will be tracked and verified via blockchain, allowing individuals to transact privately, but still giving GMP the ability to closely monitor the RECs as they’re moved through the marketplace. 
Participants will be able to set desired bids to purchase the local attributes. The transactions will happen live, however, GMP will monitor all transactions to verify everything is moving smoothly. The utility has proposed to take a 5% transaction fee on these transactions, paid by the seller of the RECs.

Last time, we reviewed the solar incentive profile of Vermont’s’ southern New England neighbor, Rhode Island, a state similarly committed to making solar one of its foundational resources for the future, but in different ways. Our next stop on the 50 states of solar incentives tour will take us out of New England and into the mid-atlantic.
