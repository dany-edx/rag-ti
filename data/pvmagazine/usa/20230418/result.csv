The SGIP program provides financial incentives for the installation of new qualifying technologies that are installed to meet all or a portion of the electric energy needs of a facility. The SGIP program helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as contribute to demand reductions and reduced customer electricity purchases, resulting in increased grid reliability through improved transmission and distribution system utilization. Current SGIP rebates for qualifying distributed energy storage systems installed on the customer’s side of the utility meter can range up to $1,000 per kilowatt-hour, with the highest amounts for projects deployed within state-designated disadvantaged communities.
Redflow Limited, an Australian company, produces zinc-bromine flow batteries that are designed to work in harsh conditions in deep cycling, long-duration stationary energy storage applications in the commercial & industrial sector.
The battery systems are scalable from a single battery installation through multiple grid-scale battery deployments.
The company reports that it is one of the few non-lithium energy storage providers to have been granted SGIP approval. SGIP approval will complement Redflow’s existing presence in California, which includes its largest deployment to date. The company has 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries in 12 Energy Pods at Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy facility. The batteries are monitored remotely via Redflow’s cloud-based battery management system and integrate seamlessly at the site with various other clean energy technologies. The battery system has been operational for one year, and supports 2 MWh of energy and reduces peak energy use as part of the facility’s microgrid.
With SGIP approval, Redflow expects its flow batteries to be more economically attractive, as the state incentives support wider deployment across disadvantaged communities within the state.
“With more than ten years of experience delivering energy storage solutions and supporting critical infrastructure, our rugged technology has already been proven in a wide range of harsh environments, and is well-placed to support the needs of disadvantaged communities in California as outlined in the SGIP guidelines,” said Tim Harris, chief executive officer of Redflow.
Redflow expects to implement similar systems for other commercial clients across North America.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/18/chipotle-debuts-all-electric-and-solar-restaurant-design/,"SUSTAINABILITY,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 18, 2023",Chipotle debuts all-electric and solar restaurant design,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, among the largest restaurant chains in the U.S., announced a new design for its stores that features all-electric appliances and on-site solar. The restaurant’s operations would also be supported through the purchase of renewable energy credits generated by solar and wind assets. 
The company recently opened restaurants with these new features in Gloucester, Virginia and Jacksonville, Florida, with a third “Responsible Restaurant” opening in Castle Rock, Colorado. The locations will help Chipotle test its progress towards climate targets, which are in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative that targets direct and indirect emissions reductions of 50% lower than 2019 baseline by 2030. 
The Newport Beach, Calif.-based restaurant chain will make use of rooftop solar, all-electric cooking equipment, a smaller electric cookline and improved exhaust goods, energy management systems, biodegradable cups, cactus leather chairs, artwork made of recycled rice husks, and EV charging stations at select locations. 
Chipotle said it plans to have more than 100 of its new locations in 2024 serving up burritos and bowls using all-electric appliances powered by renewable energy. The company will continue to iteratively improve the design as pilot restaurants’ progress is studied. 
Additionally, Chipotle is invested in climate change combatting activities like exploring greater use of low carbon fuels and adoption of renewable resources in logistics, and investing in projects to drive emission reductions in beef and dairy production. The company said it is also exploring and developing strategies to support greater adoption of regenerative agriculture practices among supply chain partners and developing plans for additional vegetarian and vegan menu offerings.  
Chipotle also targets increasing the amount of local produce purchased in 2023 to a planned total of at least 36.4 million pounds, supporting local farming and reducing trucking miles. 
“With our aggressive development goal in North America, we hold ourselves accountable to reduce the environmental impact of our restaurants,” said Laurie Schalow, chief corporate affairs officer at Chipotle. “We are aiming to incorporate some elements of our responsible restaurant design into many of our new restaurant openings going forward.”
 
Corporate solar adoption is on a sharp rise in recent years. As of November 2022, U.S. corporations installed nearly 19 GW of on- and off-site solar capacity, which doubles the amount that had been installed since 2019. Recent growth is due to the expansion of off-site corporate solar procurement, which now represents 55% of all commercial solar use. Almost 70% of all off-site corporate solar has been brought online since 2019.
“From data centers to industrial freezers, the most energy-intensive business operations are turning to solar as the most reliable and affordable way to power their infrastructure,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a November 2022 report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/18/distributed-solar-project-updates-in-california-maryland-and-new-york/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,MARYLAND,MISSISSIPPI",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 18, 2023","Distributed solar project updates in California, Maryland and New York","Solar projects can come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from multi-thousand acre utility-scale projects to small residential rooftop installations and even mobile devices.
In this round-up, pv magazine USA takes a tour through three project portfolios, each of which has project sizes landing somewhere in the middle range, or just under 5 MW. This middle range occupies larger rooftop installations, commercial and industrial solar arrays, and smaller community solar projects. These projects often come with of the benefits of distributed energy, like a more flexible and resilient power supply, the opportunity to build on mixed-use spaces, and they often carry direct savings for the communities or businesses that invest in the project.
California 52.2 MW
Developer and asset manager ForeFront Power and its partner HASI have entered into a follow-on equity investment for a portfolio of distributed solar and solar-plus-storage projects across California. The portfolio is comprised of 48.5 MW of commercial and industrial solar projects, built on ground-mounts, carports, and rooftops, as well as 3.7 MW of distributed solar projects paired with battery energy storage.
Roughly 36 MW of the distributed assets are complete, while the rest of the projects will be funded upon completion before year-end. ForeFront will continue to manage customer relationships across the portfolio and provide its customers and co-sponsor with energy management services.
“Solar is a mature technology that provides long-term returns to investors, while reducing electricity costs for customers and eliminating carbon emissions from the power grid,” said Michael Smith, chief executive officer, ForeFront Power.
ForeFront Power has developed more than 1,400 behind-the-meter and community solar projects, totaling more than 1.1 GW of capacity.
Maryland 17 MW
Summit Ridge Energy and Black Bear Energy announced the commencement of construction of four industrial projects in Maryland. The projects, which include large rooftop installations, combine for 17 MW in capacity. Summit Ridge will develop, own and operate the assets, while Black Bear will facilitate the projects, which were built for industrial logistics specialist LBA Logistics.
The rooftop-hosted solar projects will participate in the Maryland Community Solar program, providing low-cost renewable energy to residents who subscribe.
“Delivering roughly 17 MW of solar to the Belcamp and Rosedale communities is a big accomplishment for LBA and we look forward to future opportunities,” said Michelle German, Vice President of ESG at LBA Logistics.
New York 4 MW
In New York, the nation’s strongest community solar market, Genie Solar Energy announced it broke ground on a 4 MW community solar project in Perry, N.Y. The project will be comprised of roughly 9,000 panels, producing the equivalent of 440 homes’ power needs, and offsetting over 3,500 metric tons of carbon emissions per year.
Genie Solar expects construction to be complete this year. To facilitate the construction, the company will pay for the project’s required grid interconnection upgrades. Project execution will be dependent on timely grid upgrade work performed by National Grid.
New York state’s community solar program enables households and businesses across the state to access the environmental and economic benefits of solar electricity generation without the need to install panels on their properties. Instead, the solar project developer constructs and interconnects a solar array to the grid while enrolling local subscribers.
“For the Perry project, we not only will lower electricity bills for hundreds of local subscribers, but we also plan to utilize highly-skilled, local personnel from Perry and its immediately surrounding areas for critical tasks during the project’s construction including land preparation, panel installation, and electrical work,” said Nathan Knapke, director of community solar, Genie Solar Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/18/ul-and-nrel-set-cybersecurity-standards-for-distributed-energy-inverters/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,MONITORING,SOFTWARE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 18, 2023","UL and NREL set cybersecurity standards for distributed energy, inverters","Electrical standards provider UL Solutions has released a new cybersecurity protocol, UL 2941, which covers distributed energy and inverter-based resources.  Developed with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), UL 2941 provides testable requirements for energy storage and generation technologies on the distribution grid. The new cybersecurity protocol provides a framework for photovoltaic inverters, electric vehicle chargers, wind turbines, fuel cells and other distributed resources operating within a grid interconnection.
The new UL requirement prioritizes cybersecurity standards for power systems that deal with high penetration inverter-based resources, including those interfacing with bulk power systems for periods of instantaneous high wind, solar and hybrid/storage generation.
UL 2941 will also promote cybersecurity measures across all new inverter-based resources (IBR) and distributed energy resource (DER) systems.
“The publication of UL 2941 is a milestone toward securing the distributed generation industry,” said Danish Saleem, senior energy systems cybersecurity engineer, NREL. “Equipment manufacturers, asset owners, regulators and government officials now have an established baseline for strengthening the security of their devices such as network-connected IBRs, monitoring devices, and parts of IBR systems that provide software-based and firmware-based controls.”
NREL is receiving additional support from the DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office to support the new standard’s development.  With SETO, NREL will receive formal industry feedback on the listed requirements, develop test procedures, and perform beta testing of devices under the UL 2941 standard, Saleem said.
Products complying with UL 2941 will be eligible for UL certification. The testing is intended to be an add-on service for inverters, complementing UL 1741, the current standard for power inverters, converters, controllers and interconnection system equipment for distributed energy resources.
Following an increase in ransomware attacks in the U.S. energy markets in recent years and the need for new distributed energy systems following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, there has been an in flux of new DER resources tied to the grid in the U.S. and Europe.
A 2022 report by SETO called “Securing Solar for the Grid” called on national laboratories and industry participants to propose cybersecurity requirements for distributed energy resources. A DOE report on the topic calls for the DER market to engage in such discussions.
As deployment of rooftop solar, batteries and other DERs increases, the potential damage from a cyberattack on DERs also increases, according to the report. DERs now total 90 GW of capacity in the U.S., and are expected to grow to 380 GW by 2025, the DOE said.
In two potential scenarios of a cyber attack, an attacker could use ransomware to take control of multiple DERs, or could use a supply chain attack on an aggregator, or on another party that sends directions or updates to DERs, to influence the operation of the DERs, the DOE report noted.
In two other scenarios, a “botnet” could infect enough DERs with malware to enable the attacker to create unanticipated power swings on the grid, or a “worm” could spread from one DER to a higher-level distributed energy resource management (DERM) system, which could then send a false command to many DERs and instigate power instability.

Rheem’s new air-source heat pump has passed the U.S. Department of Energy’s Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge. The US-based heating specialist released the Endeavor Prestige series in March. It reportedly has a heating performance factor (HSPF2) of up to 8.5 and a coefficient of performance (COP) of between 1.5 and 2.0 at 17.6 F.
“We were not surprised that our team of dedicated, innovative engineers at Rheem developed a residential heat pump that was able to provide 77% of nominal heating capacity at −26 C ambient temperature and provided uninterrupted heating operation at −30.5 C ambient temperature surpassing expectations and delivering top quality performance,” said Jeff Goss, director of product management for Rheem.
The new cold climate heat pump reportedly delivered a 5% higher COP during heating under 32 F ambient temperatures than the challenge specification. Rheem said the unit also performed at a 9% higher HSPF2 than the challenge specification.
U.S.-based Carrier and Johnson Controls, as well as Ireland-based Trane Technologies, have also developed prototypes for the field-testing phase of the Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge. Lennox was the first manufacturer to successfully develop a prototype, winning the Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge in June 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/18/american-companies-ask-congress-to-reject-1-billion-in-retroactive-solar-tariffs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 18, 2023",American companies ask Congress to reject $1 billion in retroactive solar tariffs,"More than 400 companies across the solar supply chain sent a letter to Congress imploring them not to repeal President Biden’s solar tariff moratorium.
The moratorium was announced in June of 2022 in response to the uncertainty in the solar industry caused by the Department of Commerce anti-dumping investigation. At the same time, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act as a means of accelerating U.S. manufacturing across the solar supply chain in an attempt to alleviate dependency on imported solar goods. hardware and materials. A group of lawmakers are currently attempting to overturn the moratorium on tariffs and force American companies to pay more than $1 billion in retroactive duties.
“The tariff pause provided business certainty that kept solar projects moving forward while providing a bridge for domestic manufacturing to grow. This deeply flawed use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) rips the rug out from underneath American businesses and will cause thousands of workers to lose their livelihoods,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The letter expresses opposition to H.J. Res 39, stating that its passage would have “significant detrimental effects for the solar workforce, climate, business certainty, and domestic energy deployment.”
H.J. Res 39 is introduced just as the Inflation Reduction Act has set in motion a wave of new manufacturing deployment across the supply chain in the U.S. Analysis from SEIA shows that passing this CRA legislation will eliminate 30,000 American jobs, including 4,000 manufacturing jobs. SEIA projects that it could cancel 4 GW of solar project deployment or 14% of solar deployments expected in 2023. This represents more than  $4.2 billion in investment, and would increase carbon emissions from the power sector by an estimated 24 million metric tons.
The DOE’s “Solar Futures Study” predicts aggressive cost reduction, supportive policy, and large-scale electrification will mean solar could supply 40% of U.S. electricity in 2035, and 45% in 2050. That would require average annual growth of 30 GW in new solar capacity this year and next, rising to 60 GW extra per year from 2025 to 2030, for a terawatt of new solar capacity by 2035.
The letter states that “The United States has the potential to become a leader in solar manufacturing,” and it emphasizes the projected growth in solar manufacturing, which the National Renewable Energy Lab forecasts could be as much as 42 GW in capacity for solar modules alone.  “The two-year moratorium unfroze the solar marketplace and provided a bridge for domestic solar manufacturing to scale up and meet domestic demand for solar panels,” the letter summarizes.
“This misguided resolution would stall America’s clean energy progress and put thousands of construction jobs at risk,” said George Hershman, chief executive officer of SOLV Energy and chair of SEIA’s board. Hershman pointed to the benefits the industry has seen since the moratorium went into effect, combined with investments from the Inflation Reduction Act. “Ending the two-year reprieve would effectively halt our momentum and undercut American growth in this industry. We need Congress to stand with solar job creators and reject this dangerous effort.”
Update: The House Ways and Means Committee approved legislation on April 19 to repeal the Biden administration’s June 2022 proclamation to provide a two-year moratorium for new solar tariffs. The legislation invokes the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal the moratorium, and now moves toward a vote by the full House of Representatives.

This partnership will allow the two parties to collaborate and study the feasibility of developing wind and solar projects, as well as battery storage solutions, to create new jobs, create economic development on the Navajo Nation, offset lost revenue on the Navajo Nation, and bring reliable, affordable, and renewable energy to power Navajo Nation businesses and residents.
“NTUA Generation has been working diligently to explore renewable energy development opportunities on the Navajo Nation with the promise of new jobs and clean green energy,” said NTUA General Manager Walter Haase. “We do believe the partnership we have with Avangrid will advance clean green energy development on the Navajo Nation and will help provide benefits to the communities served by NTUA,” Haase said.
As part of this partnership, Avangrid and the NTUA will explore projects that could benefit most from the IRA, which the utility said opens a meaningful emissions reductions path for Indian tribes through clean energy development.
“This partnership is transformative and exactly what the Inflation Reduction Act was intended to encourage,” said U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D- Albuquerque). “Avangrid and Navajo Nation’s commitment to explore opportunities together to build clean energy projects will create new revenue streams and lower energy costs for New Mexicans.”
Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, in addition to the 30% solar investment tax credit and new 30% standalone storage ITC, the IRA offers tax credit “adders” for projects in low-to-moderate income communities, including on tribal authority land, for projects featuring American components and labor, and for batteries installed into repurposed fossil fuel power plants.
Developers told pv magazine USA if a tribal authority deploys an American-assembled storage project in a microgrid, the total cost savings can reach up to 70%. That incentive is shared by developer, off-take counter party, investors, and battery and parts distributors.
According to American Clean Power, New Mexico has 5.1 GW and Arizona has 3.55 GW of wind, solar and storage projects in operation, respectively, ranking the southwestern states 11th and 19th in the U.S. for renewable energy output.
The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority was founded in 1959 to address the absence of electric services on the 27,000-square-mile Navajo Nation land in the American southwest.
The NTUA has two utility-scale solar projects in operations and one in active development:
Approximately 15,000 families of the Navajo Nation do not have access to electricity, creating barriers to obtaining clean water, healthy food, healthcare, and using the internet. The Avangrid and NTUA partnership is expected to help more Diné/Navajo families gain access to low-cost and clean energy and provide workforce training opportunities that will support an even greater number of solar installations in the region.
