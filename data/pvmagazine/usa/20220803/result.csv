“There continue to be significant tailwinds for the community solar industry as legislators in existing and new states look to community solar as a way to achieve energy policy goals,” said Jeff Cramer, CEO of CCSA. “The numbers released by Wood Mackenzie represent a conservative forecast of what’s in the pipeline for the next few years. We call on all federal and state policymakers to help remove the barriers and incentivize deployment of community solar to cut energy costs and give more people access to these programs.”
With the addition of new community solar markets including New Mexico and Delaware, Wood Mackenzie has increased its 2022-2026 forecast by 477 MW direct current (MWdc), an 11% increase compared to previous forecasts and extended its outlook to 2027. Additionally state-level programs have been expanded and rules updated, giving rise to stronger markets. Illinois and New York, for example, are forecast to see the greatest state-level changes. New York is projected to continue to be the leading community solar market, with 1.3 GWdc coming online between 2022 to 2027. Other states with pending legislation include California, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

“The community solar industry is a growing solar segment within the US, with several proposed new programs pending in state legislatures. Since the start of Q2 2022, 4.4 GWdchas been installed nationally and we expect to see more growth over the next five years as legacy markets expand their community solar programs and new states adopt community solar programs,” said Rachel Goldstein, US solar research analyst for Wood Mackenzie. 
Wood Mackenzie and CCSA collected data on customer acquisition costs for the US community solar market and found that costs to acquire large customers are lower, but more variable, on a per watt basis than acquisition costs for residential customers.
“Customer acquisition data shows that cost per customer is inversely correlated with cost per kilowatt subscribed. Anchor tenants like Municipal or Large Commercial customers are costly to acquire but subscribe to a large share of projects, so costs per kilowatt are lower,” Goldstein said.
Data from surveys for low- and moderate-income (LMI) customer acquisition costs is limited but shows that these costs are slightly higher than for non-LMI customers. Developers report that directly-billed LMI customers can be significantly harder and more expensive to subscribe than residential customers.
Report findings also highlighted that community solar-plus-storage can provide grid flexibility, but regulatory models do not currently recognize how these projects can manage load.
“As community solar becomes an increasing share of non-residential projects, developers are contending with high grid upgrade costs to manage this new load on the distribution end of the grid. Community solar-plus-storage could help manage this load and provide grid flexibility, but so far, its scope is limited to a few states, and current rules do not necessarily value storage for its grid resilience capabilities,” said Goldstein.
Community solar is on the upswing in about a third of the states. Community solar programs have steadily been on the rise in Massachusetts in recent years. A comprehensive guide run by the state’s Clean Energy Center can be found here. While New York is an established leader in community solar in the United States, hitting the milestone of 1 GW of cumulative installations earlier this year, the state’s Value of Distributed Energy Resources program will help co-locate community solar with storage.
In New Mexico, the Public Regulation Commission (PRC) formally adopted rules in June 2022 to implement a community solar program in the state. While Delaware approved community solar back in 2010, it saw little growth until 2021 when Governor Carney has signed into law a bill that looks to expand access to community solar projects, while also reducing some of the barriers blocking project siting and completion. And in California, new regulatory proposals could help the state contend with potential new net metering rules while providing financial advantages for community solar-plus-storage projects. The Biden Administration wants community solar to reach 5 million households by 2025 and create $1 billion in energy bill savings.

The top three technologies were wind (5.2 GW), natural gas (4.3 GW), and solar (4.2 GW), followed by battery energy storage.
By the end of the year, based on “high probability additions” as tracked by EIA, the year is expected to end with solar taking the largest share with 17.8 GW, followed by wind with 11.2 GW, natural gas with 9.2 GW, and battery energy storage reaching 6.2 GW of capacity. This means developers may be busy in the second half of this year, adding 29 GW to the grid nationwide.
More than 40% of the wind capacity that has been activated this year is in Texas, where 2.2 GW of wind was brought online. The largest projects installed and activated this year through six months include the 999 MW Traverse Wind Project in Oklahoma, the 492 MW Maverick Creek Wind in Texas, and the 440 MW solar and battery storage project at Slate Hybrid in California.
The EIA also tracks operable projects larger than 1 MW in size. Nationwide, there are 497 active natural gas plants, 202 coal plants, 138 wind facilities, 95 nuclear plants, 80 conventional hydroelectric dams, and 66 utility-scale solar facilities. New renewable energy projects coming online and retirements in coal fired plants, as well as natural gas and nuclear, are expected to shift these numbers.
A significant amount of capacity, 15.1 GW, is expected to be retired this year. About 8.8 GW of capacity has already been taken offline in 2022. Coal plants, due to their heavy carbon emissions, have represented the largest portion of retirements, and will account for about 76% of all retirements for the year. This is followed by natural gas (12%) and nuclear (9%). A 1.3 GW coal plant was retired in Ohio this may, and a 1.2 GW station in Maryland retired in June. Additionally, a 769 MW nuclear plant was retired in Michigan this June.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/03/sungage-financial-and-bodhi-partner-to-help-solar-installers-scale-up/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,SOFTWARE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 3, 2022",Sungage Financial and Bodhi partner to help solar installers scale up,"A new partnership has been formed between Sungage Financial, a residential solar finance company, and Bodhi, an online customer experience platform that supports marketing, operations, and service for residential solar installers.
The partnership has a mission to enable solar installers to have a strong, resilient, and growing business. Bodhi shares that in a survey of homeowners, four out of five said they remembered their installation and commissioning process negatively. Solar adoption is disproportionately driven by referrals, which install at a significantly higher rate than other lead generation sources.
Bodhi’s platform is aimed at building trust and a positive experience between installers and homeowners, thereby earning referrals of the homeowner’s friends, family, and neighbors. A key aspect of the platform is it keeps homeowners updated on the progress of their solar project, through design, site survey, permitting, installation, interconnection, and operations.
Sungage offers fixed rate financing starting at 0.99% and with term packages between 5 and 25 years. It offers up to $200,000 in financing through its platform, which offers instant credit decisions through soft credit checks. The financing platform is mobile-compatible, and Sungage’s staff is available for live answer customer service and efficient follow-ups.
“We are always on the lookout for tools and technologies which better support our installer network through better consumer experiences,” said Doug Pierce, director of sales at Sungage. “Homeowner communications can be both difficult and challenging for growing solar businesses. Bodhi provides a targeted tool to manage these potential pain points and allows our partners to focus on what they do best.”
Bodhi’s platform automates post-sales communications for installers. By integrating the installer’s existing CRM and monitoring systems and other operational tools, Bodhi leverages existing customer data into personalized customer interactions to keep homeowners engaged and informed. Bodhi said the platform streamlines the post-sales experience while reducing support costs by as much as 50%.
Through the strategic alliance, Sungage customers will have direct access to Bodhi’s platform. The two are offering a promotional free month of Bodhi’s service and a 50% discount on its implementation fee.
“We’re honored to be partnering with a company like Sungage who shares our commitment of providing incredible customer experiences to homeowners while making solar installers’ lives easier,” said Emmett Miranker, head of business development at Bodhi. “This is really the kind of partnership that just makes sense and benefits everyone in the industry, from solar businesses to the solar customers.”
The two will hold a webinar on automating communications to improve customer experience on August 16.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/03/pairing-agrivoltaics-and-pollinator-habitat-with-community-solar-in-new-york/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 3, 2022",Pairing agrivoltaics and pollinator habitat with community solar in New York,"Renewable Properties, a developer and investor in small-scale utility and community solar projects, currently has a portfolio of 70 MW in various stages of development, construction, and operation.
The developer works closely with the communities where their projects are located, designing the solar to meet local needs. One example is the Slayton Settlement portfolio that sits on a third-generation organic dairy farm in Lockport. When the community was concerned that projects would result in a loss of agricultural production, Renewable Properties committed to building the site as an agrivoltaics project that allows sheep to manage the vegetation. Renewable Properties is also designating part of the solar site for bee boxes. The Slayton Settlement Solar A & B will commence construction by the end of Q3 2022. The total 9.1 MW Slayton portfolio will generate enough energy to power another 1,878 homes per year and offset the equivalent of 10,642 tons of CO2 annually.
Another example is the Bullis Road project in Marilla, which is designed to avoid known archaeological resources, as well as a habitat of the pied-billed grebes, a species of water bird that is considered endangered or locally extinct in some states, with habitat loss being its biggest threat.

Both the Bullis Rd and the Slayton Settlement sites will be seeded with a pollinator grass mix that supports flowers for honeybees, birds, and other wildlife. This mix will enhance the habitat for the residing honeybees at the Slayton Settlement project site as well as helping to improve the nutritional grazing value for the sheep. The 5.7 MW Bullis Road Solar Project’s 11,394 modules will generate enough energy to power 1,141 homes per year and offset the equivalent of 6,465 tons of CO2 annually.
The second recently completed project is the 4.9 MW Rock Island Road Solar project in Gouverneur. The project consists of 9,932 modules that will generate enough energy to power 1,048 New York homes per year and offset 5,388 tons of CO2 annually.
“We are proud to serve New Yorkers with a growing pipeline of community solar projects that allow anyone anywhere to benefit from local clean energy,” said Aaron Halimi, Renewable Properties founder and president. “These solar projects will also benefit the landowners where they are sited via lease payments, as well as the surrounding communities with taxes, jobs, and other economic benefits.”
Renewable Properties, which owns the projects, partnered with Borrego, an EPC, to build the Rock Island project, and with United Renewable Energy (URE), also an EPC, on the Bullis Road and Slayton Settlement projects.
“Rock Island Road is another example of how companies like Renewable Properties are making solar accessible to more New Yorkers,” said Brian Barker executive vice president of EPC for Borrego. “We’re grateful to work on such an innovative project that pairs both economic and environmental benefits for the community. The outcome and momentum of this project is moving the state closer to its clean energy goals, and we will continue to work to see them through.”
Another 9.3 MW of community solar projects in Batavia and the Village of Minoa are scheduled to receive their notice to proceed by the end of Q4 2022. Renewable Properties has another 40 MW in earlier stages of development in the Marilla, Vestal, Oswego, Valatie, and East Syracuse, New York areas. Having raised over $80 million of corporate capital and closed on over $250 million of project financings, the company is also actively acquiring additional community solar projects in New York and other regions.
As a further milestone of Renewable Properties’ commitment to New York community solar, the company recently signed a 30 MW subscriber management agreement with Ampion, a customer management provider, which will fill and manage subscribers for its New York projects in the towns of Lockport, Vestal, Stockport, Batavia, and the Village of Minoa.
This 70 MW portfolio goes a long way toward helping New York State achieve its ambitious goals for renewable energy procurement and buildout, which include sourcing 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable and increasing solar deployment to 10 GW by 2030. It also further positions New York State as the top community solar market in the United States. In March of this year, New York officials announced the state had reached a milestone of more than 1 GW of community solar generation capacity installed across the region. According to New York Governor Kathy Hochul, at the time, New York had the nation’s largest pipeline of community solar under construction, with more than 700 projects in the queue.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/03/battery-storage-operation-under-net-billing-provides-virtually-no-grid-value-berkeley-lab-study/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 3, 2022",Battery storage operation under net billing provides “virtually no grid value”: Berkeley Lab study,"Under net billing, a rooftop solar owner is compensated for electricity sent to the grid at an “export rate” below the retail price of electricity, “often tied to the utility’s avoided costs,” says a Berkeley Lab study. Net billing is replacing net metering in many states, the study says, with some version of net billing having been adopted in ten US states as of last year, and proposed in five others.
The net billing structure provides an incentive for customers with rooftop solar to add storage, so they can use more of their solar generation after the sun goes down, rather than sell it to the utility at a lower value.
At current costs of battery storage, installing storage solely for solar self-consumption is “not an economical customer investment,” the researchers found, with annual customer bill savings ranging from $19-33/kWh of storage capacity for a small storage system, and declining steadily with increasing system size. Rather, residential storage adoption has been driven by a multitude of value streams, the study says.
Meanwhile, net billing barely reduces grid costs, primarily because residential batteries are “largely sitting idle on peak days,” the study said.
If residential batteries were instead operated with market-based dispatch, to maximize their value to the grid, their value at a standard system size, across five of the six utilities studied, would equal a combined annual energy value of $16 to $23 per kWh of storage capacity, plus an annual capacity value of $6 to $13 per kWh of storage. (For the sixth utility the energy value would be much lower, because the utility does not participate in a wholesale market with volatile wholesale prices.)
For four of the utilities, the combined energy and capacity value under market-based dispatch would be greater than the upper bound of customer bill savings from solar self-consumption under net billing, said study co-author Galen Barbose in an email. For the remaining two utilities, the grid value under market-based dispatch and the bill savings under solar self-consumption would be very close, and for all utilities the self-consumption values were influenced by an “aggressive assumption” for the price differential between consumption and export prices, yielding high estimated bill savings from self-consumption, Barbose said.
The authors say that replacing “inefficient” net billing structures with market-based dispatch for storage could yield a significant “Pareto improvement”—a solution in which at least one participant gains and no one loses. Utility customers would gain because system costs would be reduced through savings in energy and capacity costs. Owners of residential storage would not lose so long as they were compensated at least at the level of their current annual bill savings under net billing.
Market-based dispatch is possible for storage batteries with smart inverters because smart inverters can receive communications regarding price signals.
The study defined energy value as the reduction in grid operating costs, measured by wholesale energy prices. It defined capacity value (termed “peak value” in the study) based on a $50/kW-year marginal capacity cost, allocated across the top 40 load hours for the bulk-power system. It defined market-based dispatch based on hourly varying prices for both exports and consumption, with batteries allowed to charge from the grid or discharge to the grid at any time.
A sensitivity analysis projected that the relative advantages of market-based storage dispatch would increase through 2050, because its combined energy and capacity value would rise faster than the value of storage operated for solar self-consumption under net billing.
Unconstrained grid discharging of storage batteries could add stress on the distribution grid, the study said, but by limiting grid discharging, 50–70% of the grid value of market-based dispatch could still be achieved.
The researchers conducted their study using metered electricity load data from about 1,800 residential customers across six utilities. The open access article, published in the journal iScience, is titled “Private vs. public value of US residential battery storage operated for solar self-consumption.”
The authors will host a webinar to discuss their study results on August 4 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time.
