In a series of tests conducted at operational sites in three states, it was found that TrueCapture increased annual energy production by hundreds of thousands of megawatt hours per year.
“TrueCapture gains are predictable and bankable, providing asset owners with gigawatt-hours of additional production and millions of dollars in additional revenue,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “Our trackers come with embedded communication and control capabilities, so we can provide our TrueCapture and NX Navigator control software both to our customers’ existing installed fleet as well as their new projects. Split-boost, added last year further enhanced TrueCapture performance.”
What sets Nextracker’s decentralized architecture apart from linked-row tracker designs is how it allows for highly granular row-level control and optimization. Each row in a Nextracker system is powered by its own solar module, battery, actuator and controller, so intelligent independent-row operation is possible. Furthermore, at the control level, the network components required to monitor, command and optimize each single-axis tracker row are all located on the project site. Nextracker’s hardware is wirelessly controlled by the NX Data Hub, a Linux-based industrial computer. And because it is locally powered and controlled, both hardware and software are secure from AC power outages and loss of external communications. The way the tracker works is that TrueCapture adjusts the position of each individual Nextracker row by dispatching real-time tracking parameters in response to site-specific conditions. Informed by sensor data and machine learning technologies, this enables TrueCapture to precisely orient tracker rows to account for terrain variance, construction tolerance, cell technology and weather patterns.
Three case studies
The paper reviewed longitudinal data across three operating projects in California, Georgia and Mexico, whose output averages over 2% in production benefit. At these sites, the performance of TrueCapture-equipped trackers was tested against a set of control blocks using standard backtracking.
The 40 MWac California site, which is in the Mojave Desert, is one of five power stations that make up the larger 250 MWac Beacon Solar Project portfolio. Commissioned in 2017, the Beacon 5 solar power station integrates full-cell crystalline silicon PV modules and Nextracker’s flagship NX Horizon single-axis trackers. The site has a ground coverage ratio of 50.5% and an average diffuse irradiance percentage of 26.4%. Beacon 5 has significant shading while operating with standard backtracking algorithms. To mitigate the impacts of terrain shading, Nextracker proposed implementing TrueCapture’s yield-enhancing algorithms. Independent performance engineers at Black & Veatch validated TrueCapture’s performance gains, noting in its follow-up engineering report, a 2.2% increase in energy yield for the TrueCapture group relative to the control group.
The 120 MWac Mexico installation is located on 840 acres. Called the Bluemex solar project,  it integrates full-cell crystalline silicon PV modules on NX Horizon single-axis trackers.  Unlike the California site, the  Mexico site is relatively flat, however, it experiences extreme moisture on a seasonal basis. Nextracker estimated that the site would see a boost of 0.64% by implementing TrueCapture, with gains of 0.3% coming from Nextracker’s Diffuse Boost and 0.34% from Shade Avoid. At the end of the test period, performance engineers found that the Diffuse Boost module provided measured gains of 0.31% and the Shade Avoid mode resulted in an average gain of 0.32% for the test blocks that best matched the site’s average slope number. Overall, TrueCapture provided measured gains of 0.63%.
The 102.5 MWac site in southwest Georgia, called Bancroft Station, supplies 100% renewable energy to Facebook’s Newton Data Center. This dual-use site co-locates solar generation with regenerative agricultural practices, therefore Silicon Ranch did minimal grading to minimize negative impacts to the topsoil. In addition to using TrueCapture controlled single-axis trackers, the Bancroft Station site integrates half-cell crystalline silicon PV modules that Silicon Ranch sourced locally from a Hanwha Q Cells factory in Belton, Georgia. In a Split Boost test conducted in June 2021, performance engineers calculated that half-cell optimization algorithm improved performance by 1.7% relative to standard backtracking on a median sloped test block over a 12-month period.
By reviewing empirical gains for three real-world projects, independent engineers validated TrueCapture’s project yield enhancements and have accounted for these gains as part of a bankable independent energy yield assessment.
More details on the tests are available in the white paper, Enhancing Energy Yields with TrueCapture Using Nextracker’s Proven Intelligent Control Capabilities to Optimize Solar Project Financing and Plant Performance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/27/why-did-i-reform-my-views-on-net-energy-metering-nem/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",Why did I reform my views on Net Energy Metering (NEM)?,"A number of people have asked me why I changed my mind about net metering solar, either directly or indirectly. So here is the answer.
Let me begin by saying I have not done a 180-degree turn, as some have said. I have simply updated my views in light of the new evidence that has become visible since I got involved with NEM in 2014.
I recognize there is a cost shift and NEM should be reformed, particularly in states like California where more than a million customers, representing more than 10% of customers, have installed solar panels on their roof.
But imposing a grid access charge is a terrible idea. I also believe that export compensation should be lowered from retail rates but not suddenly and certainly not retroactively.
I also believe that states where solar deployment is in the early stages, and where less than 5% of customers have deployed solar roofs are at a very different stage of the game and should stick with NEM in its current form.
Bayesian insights
In grad school at UC Davis, I came across the concept of “Bayesian Updating” in an econometrics class. I had heard of the Bayes Theorem in my undergraduate class in econometric at Karachi University, but did not appreciate the concept. It sounded like an interesting theorem with no immediate applications. It was one of the many theorems from grad school that I forgot in the decades that followed.
I did not encounter it in my empirical work on price elasticities, demand forecasting, and so on. It seemed so subjective.
In 2019 the Reverend Bayes appeared to me. It was late one evening in July when I flew into Phoenix from Chicago to attend a meeting the next day on rate design (yes, to discuss three-part rates, inclusive of demand charges). I was having some troubling symptoms when I woke up. To make a long story short, I was rushed to ER by the hotel staff who spoke to me and concluded that medical assistance was needed.
At the hospital, they kept doing every medical test and scan on me until the midnight hour arrived and I fell asleep. When I woke up, seven men in white robes were looking at me from just a few feet away. They were arrayed in a triangle and for one brief moment I thought they were angels.
The man in the front smiled and said he was the head of the department of neurology and the others were his students.
He said he was pleased to meet an economist. I asked if he was one. He said he had taken a few classes as an undergrad. Then he said something that no doctor had ever said to me: “All doctors are Bayesian.” We diagnose the patient based on the test results but update it based on how the patient’s condition evolves.
You are perfectly fine and can go home but please follow up with your local neurologist. Which I did. Diagnosis: migraine.
Testimony
In 2014, a utility in the southwest hired me to review their NEM reform proposal and to comment on it. I wrote a brief report, which was then filed with the utility’s regulator, its elected board of directors. In 2015, I testified in that utility’s rate case related to NEM. I appeared at least three times before the Board to defend the utility’s proposal to place all NEM customers on mandatory three-part rates, retroactively. The proposal was approved but not unanimously and without grandfathering.
As the years passed, I testified on NEM in Nevada, Idaho, Kansas (thrice) and Montana on behalf of the investor-owned utilities in those state. In most cases, mandatory three-part rates for NEM customers were rejected right away. Once, they were approved only to be remanded by the state supreme court to the commission. In another instance, customers were given a choice to be on a simple TOU rate or a three-part rate.
Along the way, I became the symbol of the anti-NEM movement in many circles. Even when I was not testifying on NEM and testifying more broadly on rate design reform, it would come up during cross examination. This happened more than once.
One of my clients in the southeast asked me if I ever hesitated to turn the keys in my car. I was taken aback and asked, Should I? He said you might want to see the Robert De Niro film, Casino. It was meant, of course, as a joke.
In another rate case, I asked an attorney who had cross examined me a while back in the formative 2015 NEM rate case why were there so many SWAT police in the very large and packed hearing room. He said, “Ahmad, they were there for your protection.”
Questioning assumptions
By now, I had begun keeping notes, not on the SWAT police being in the hearing room or the action in the Casino movie. None of that bothered me. (I write extensively on the mistakes the Pakistani military has made in its wars with India, in the way it defines national security narrowly to just focus on the military dimension, and the harm it has caused the economy by excessive defense spending).
I had found a flaw in my reasoning. It rested on the presumption that through NEM the “poor subsidized the rich.” It overlooked the fact that the poor was being heavily subsidized by the rich not only the tax code and charitable donations but explicitly through bill discounts, such as the 35% CARE discount in California.
Thus, other than me and a few other witnesses making those cost shift arguments ad nauseum, no one else was making those arguments. We were not gaining a big following. In fact, we had no following at all to speak of. On top of that, I was being reviled in every local newspaper where I testified, even if it was just on simple TOU rates.
There were no public rallies opposing NEM. There were no editorials opposing NEM. The low-income customers never came to the workshops organized by the commissions prior to the hearings.
I began to talk to friends, neighbors and relatives about NEM at parties and other social events, much to their annoyance, I am sure. Not a single person supported the poor subsidizing the rich argument. In fact, I never ran into a person, rich or poor, who was opposed to installing solar panels.
I began to question my assumptions. I found myself standing on the wrong side of history. Bayesian updating kicked in.
Slowly, the truth dawned on me. There were a whole bunch of cost shifts in rate design. Why just focus on this one? Was that not bias? Yes, it was. It was only looking at a portion of the truth, not the whole truth. That was my epiphany!
I got an opportunity to express my reformed views in the last testimony I gave on NEM which took place in South Carolina.
Subsequently, I studied the NEM reform proposals that were presented before the California PUC on March 15, 2021 and co-authored a paper on the topic with several others, including Canadian experts.
The turning point came on December 13, when the CPUC issued a proposed decision (PD) on NEM 3.0. It adopted the most anti-solar views that had presented by certain parties at the March 15 workshop and the subsequent hearings. It would have virtually eliminated the consumer’s incentive to install solar panels. I felt the time had arrived for me to speak directly on the subject even though I was retiring at year end.
Reformed view
In January 2022, reflecting my reformed views, I filed comments to the CPUC on the PD, first individually and then collectively with nine other experts. I kept on tweeting my criticisms of the PD and was invited to join a moderated conversation with Professor Severin Borenstein by Canary Media.
Notably, in the same month, Governor Schwarzenegger published an op-ed in the New York Times in which he lambasted the PD. And the Reverend Ambrose Carroll Sr. published an op-ed in the Mercury News dispelling the myth that low-income customers were opposed to the installation of solar panels. In fact, he wrote, they wanted to install solar panels on their homes and the PD would harm them.
In February 2022 there came the news from Canada that the premier of Nova Scotia had intervened to stop the electric utility from imposing a grid access charge of $8/kW/month on solar customers. The utility dropped the proposal.
I also wrote three editorials on the subject, one by myself, another with Jon Wellinghoff, a former chairman of the FERC, and a third with Dr’s Richard McCann and Perry Sioshansi.
Recently, I have come to know that Governor Jerry Brown has installed solar panels and paired them with batteries at his house.
I am confident my reformed vision is in line with reality. Consumers, rich and poor, want to install solar panels. They enhance affordability and green energy. When paired with batteries, they enhance local resilience. They lower investments in the distribution and transmission system.
They are a gateway to the future, especially in a state like California with strong net zero energy goals. To the extent that low-income consumers have a difficult time affording them, we need to work on ways to enhance their affordability. Not impose a grid access charge that will make solar panels unaffordable to all but the wealthy.
Let me end by quoting Victor Hugo. “No one, not even all the armies of the world, can stop an idea whose time has come.”

The IRA includes over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, as the country seeks to source from within to support its own supply chain. The U.S.- made solar supply chain is lacking in some core components, including backsheets. However, Endurans Solar is one U.S.-based manufacturer, and the company recently announced plans to expand production.
The HP backsheets are currently manufactured in Nashua, New Hampshire using what the company says is a unique, lamination-free, co-extrusion process that delivers superior protective qualities, based on a novel material stack. The backsheet is made from PFAS-free, fully recyclable polyolefin formulations, and the company reports that it has up to a 30% lower carbon footprint compared to traditional products.
Endurans Solar’s fully recyclable HPO – high-performance polyolefin – backsheets (HP) feature what Endurans says is the strongest core layer in the industry whereas the conductive backsheets (CB) enable high-efficiency and aesthetically pleasing solar modules based on backcontact technology. Unlike laminated backsheet, co-extruded backsheets are thermoplastics and can be fully remelted, reprocessed and reshaped, according to Endurans. More than 20 million modules featuring these UL-certified backsheets have been installed worldwide.
To accommodate the anticipated increasing demand both in the U.S. and overseas, Endurans Solar plans to significantly increase its U.S. backsheet manufacturing capacity. The company is currently finalizing site selection for a new manufacturing plant, with the new line expected to become operational in mid-2023.
“We’re excited that many more millions of solar panels will be manufactured and installed in the U.S. over the coming years, and we look forward to supporting the growth of U.S. solar panel manufacturers with our high-performance, sustainable and made-in-America backsheets,” said Nathan Arbitman, president of Endurans Solar.
Endurans Solar is a wholly owned subsidiary of Worthen Industries, with production facilities across Asia, Europe, in addition to the USA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/27/california-renters-will-now-have-access-to-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",California renters will now have access to community solar,"Following Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, California passed AB 2316, the Community Renewable Energy Act. The law creates a community renewable energy program, including community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes.
Community solar projects are often smaller than utility-scale facilities, and are ideally built on landfills, former industrial sites, and other brownfield locations. Customers typically subscribe to a share of energy produced by the local clean energy project, accessing lower bills and reducing their carbon footprint. 
Without the ability to purchase and install solar directly on a rented residence, community solar offers a pathway to the 45% of Californians who rent their homes, and the 70% of renters who are considered low-income. 
Across the United States, solar owners have an average income 58% higher than the median income in their county. The new law is aimed at expanding access while simultaneously strengthening California’s grid.
AB 2316 provisions include: 
“Community renewable energy is a proven powerful tool to help close California’s clean energy gap, bringing much needed relief to millions struggling with high housing costs and utility debt,” said Alexis Sutterman, energy equity program manager at the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “All families will finally have a choice to save on electric bills while unplugging from dirty power and joining the fight against climate change. As this program takes off, California will build the affordable and reliable clean energy supplies needed to retire polluting fossil fuel-powered plants in environmental justice communities and pursue a cleaner, safer future.”
The Biden Administration set a goal this year to sign up 5 million community solar households, achieving $1 billion in bill savings by 2025. The Department of Energy (DOE) reports that by year’s end 2020, about 3 GW of community solar in the United States was active, enough to power about 600,000 homes.
The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW by 2025. DOE estimates customers enrolling in community solar will save an average of about 20% on energy bills.
The Community Renewable Energy Act was sponsored by the Coalition for Community Solar Access, and met with strong support from groups like SEIA, GRID Alternatives, Vote Solar, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and more.
Notably, investor-owned utilities, which serve over 75% of the electricity usage in the state, opposed the bill. Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Edison all signed on in opposition to the bill.
Two attempts have been made in the past in California to set up a community solar market, and they have generally been considered failures due to poor structuring. The Enhanced Community Renewables within the Green Tariff Shared Renewables Program has zero projects in operation after nine years due to unfinanceable rates, said the Community for Solar Access (CSA). CSA said the Community Solar-Green Tariff program is also ineffective as it is expensive, fails to support disadvantaged communities, and a mechanism for controlling cost shift onto non-participants is limiting the program’s growth.
The implementation of this program rests in the hands of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). CPUC is tasked with evaluating existing programs, and will report to the California Legislature its justification for terminating, modifying, or retaining them.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/27/how-long-do-rooftop-residential-solar-panels-last-2/,"QUALITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",How long do rooftop residential solar panels last?,"Residential solar panels are often sold with long-term loans or leases, with homeowners entering contracts of 20 years or more. But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system used, among others. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements.
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20-30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision.
The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL.
Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.

Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.
Image: Hunt Military Communities
A sizeable portion of degradation is attributed to a phenomenon called potential induced degradation (PID), an issue experienced by some, but not all, panels. PID occurs when the panel’s voltage potential and leakage current drive ion mobility within the module between the semiconductor material and other elements of the module, like the glass, mount, or frame. This causes the module’s power output capacity to decline, in some cases significantly.
Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1-3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.
The exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, according to NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures.
Image: Premier Solar
The coefficient explains how much real-time efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
Heat exchange drives panel degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analyzed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.
Image: SunPower
Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-colored materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech. 
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimized for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.
(Read: “Tips for keeping your rooftop solar system humming over the long term“)
Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.

IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and aging tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of over 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.
Image: PVEL
Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.
System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyze inverter performance in the next installment of this series.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/27/nature-conservancy-favors-low-impact-renewables-deployment-in-the-west/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",Nature Conservancy favors low-impact renewables deployment in the West,"The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group with a prominent voice among land conservationists, is promoting a study that modeled high-renewables scenarios for the western U.S. at increasing levels of constraints on solar and wind deployment.
In most model runs, new solar and wind would not be deployed on protected lands, such as national parks and endangered species habitat. In the most constrained runs, renewables would also not be built on land with a high conservation value, such as farmland with high soil quality.
“Do not fret, there is still plenty of land available,” said study co-author Emily Leslie, principal of energy consultancy Montara Mountain Energy, in a webinar. The most stringent constraints would still leave about 20 times more land for solar than is needed, 14 times more land for offshore wind than needed, and three times more land for onshore wind than needed, said the study’s lead author Grace Wu, a professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Other researchers have found that solar development can have positive effects on wildlife habitat, as in Nevada, where a desert solar farm was found to improve desert tortoise habitat. Research is ongoing into how agricultural yields are affected by solar development.
The conservancy’s study projected that 414 GW of solar would be needed in the 11 western states studied to meet a high electrification goal, along with 145 GW of wind power and 80 GW of storage. Of all the scenarios evaluated, the high electrification scenario, which would electrify transportation and heating and achieve net-zero emissions, was found to need the least amount of land and ocean area for siting renewable generation. That’s largely because electricity now used to produce fossil fuels for transportation and heating would no longer be needed.
The solar deployments were modeled as 260 GW of large-scale solar and 154 GW of distributed solar, which the authors said was 35% of distributed solar’s technical potential. Distributed solar would consist of 80 GW of rooftop solar plus 74 GW of “urban infill” solar, defined as ground-mounted solar on undeveloped land in more densely populated areas.
The study also proposed an optimal deployment of additional transmission capacity, including reconductored transmission lines and co-located lines, and assessed the visibility of transmission lines and renewables developments.
The conservancy recommended “improved energy and decarbonization planning to maximize community, conservation and economic benefits,” and stated other policy goals, in an executive summary document.
Evolved Energy Research performed the modeling used in the study, using the RIO capacity expansion model in a way that ensured system reliability. The Nature Conservancy developed siting exclusions through stakeholder consultations, and summarized the findings from its interviews.
Study co-authors included five staff members of The Nature Conservancy, while fifteen other staff members provided contributions and feedback. The research study, titled ” Minimizing conservation impacts of net zero energy systems in the western United States,” has been submitted for peer review. A web page posted by the conservancy provides more background.
The conservancy plans a similar study for the entire U.S.

University of California researchers and academics from four U.S. national laboratories have devised a way to make lithium-ion battery cathodes without using cobalt – a metal that is rare, costly, and linked to unethical mining practices.
In a recent paper in Nature, the scientists describe how they overcame thermal and chemical-mechanical instabilities of cathodes composed substantially of nickel by mixing in several other metallic elements.
“Through a technique we refer to as ‘high-entropy doping,’ we were able to successfully fabricate a cobalt-free layered cathode with extremely high heat tolerance and stability over repeated charge and discharge cycles,” said researcher Huolin Xin. “This achievement resolves long-standing safety and stability concerns around high-nickel battery materials, paving the way for broad-based commercial applications.”
High-nickel cathodes come with their own challenges, such as poor heat tolerance, which can lead to the oxidization of battery materials, thermal runaway, and even explosion. Although high-nickel cathodes accommodate larger capacities, volume strain from repeated expansion and cont raction can result in poor stability and safety concerns.
The researchers sought to address these issues through compositionally complex high-entropy doping using HE-LMNO, an amalgamation of transition metals magnesium, titanium, manganese, molybdenum, and niobium in the structure’s interior, with a subset of these minerals used on its surface and interface with other battery materials. Xin and his colleagues employed an array of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and 3D nanotomography instruments to determine that their zero-cobalt cathode exhibited an unprecedented volumetric change of zero during repeated use. The highly stable structure is capable of withstanding more than 1,000 cycles and high temperatures, which makes it comparable to cathodes with much lower nickel content.
Ford has broken ground on a $5.6 billion complex for electric vehicles and batteries at BlueOval City in Stanton, Tennessee. The company’s largest and most advanced auto production complex, which is a joint venture with Korean SK Innovation’s SK On, is planned to lay the foundation for Ford to achieve a 2 million EV annual run rate throughout the world by late 2026. “Structural steel is erected less than one year after Ford and SK On announced their $5.6 billion investment to build a revolutionary all-new electric truck and advanced batteries for future Ford and Lincoln vehicles in West Tennessee,” the company said. The nearly 6-square-mile campus will create approximately 6,000 new jobs when production begins in 2025.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that EV sales are on course to hit an all-time high this year, lifting them to 13% of global light duty vehicle sales. It said that EV sales doubled worldwide last year to account for almost 9% of the total car market. It also noted that EVs and lighting are the only two components still fully on track for their 2030 milestones in the IEA’s “Net Zero by 2050” scenario. Despite the outlook for EVs, the IEA said they are “not yet a global phenomenon. Sales in developing and emerging countries have been slow due to higher purchase costs and a lack of charging infrastructure availability.”
LG Energy Solution (LGES) has reinforced its cobalt and lithium supply chain in North America by forging comprehensive collaborations with key suppliers in Canada. The latest arrangements are in line with the South Korean battery maker’s mid- to long-term strategy focusing on the fast-growing North American EV market, as well as the recently adopted Inflation Reduction Act. They envisage that EVs will need to have 80% of critical materials sourced domestically or from a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement in order to access a $7,500 tax credit. LGES signed a binding term sheet with Electra, securing the supply of 7,000 tonnes of cobalt sulphate for three years from 2023. In addition, it signed two non-binding agreements with Avalon and Snow Lake to secure a stable supply of lithium. Under the terms of the deals, Avalon will initially supply LGES with lithium hydroxide (11,000 tons per year) for five years, starting in 2025. LGES will also be provided with Snow Lake’s lithium hydroxide (20,000 tons per year) for 10 years once production starts in 2025.
Elli, a Volkswagen subsidiary that manages the group’s charging and energy-related activities in Europe, electricity grid operator Elia Group, and its startup, re.alto, have signed an agreement to accelerate the integration of EVs into the electricity grid. Over the next few years, the signatories will identify possible barriers to EV integration and explore how to showcase its benefits, for example by developing demonstrators. The memorandum of understanding includes four pillars of exploration: price signals/incentives, market design, trusted data, and data security and safe connectivity. “Using the electric vehicle battery as a mobile power bank delivers a triple benefit: Firstly, the climate benefits as renewable energy can be stored and therefore be used more efficiently. Secondly, the electric grid benefits, as the car can contribute toward grid stability, and thirdly, the customer can earn additional revenue with vehicle-to-grid services,” said Elli CEO Elke Temme. “To explore the benefits of this consumer-centric approach, this cooperation with Elia Group is crucial for us.”
Sunwoda plans to build a new battery production facility in Yiwu, in China’s Zhejiang province, with an annual capacity of 50 GWh. According to a stock exchange statement, the battery maker will invest around €3 billion ($2.9 billion) in the new factory to produce cells, modules, packs, and complete battery systems. Construction will be carried out in two phases, with an initial annual capacity of 30 GWh and a further 20 GWh at a later date. The initial investment will be around €1.8 billion, followed by another €1.2 billion for the second phase.
Nio has shipped its first battery swapping station from Hungary to Germany. The Chinese EV manufacturer announced its plant in Hungary in July, as part of its efforts to build 1,000 battery exchange stations outside of China by 2025. The Hungarian plant will serve as the manufacturing, service, and R&D center for Nio’s power products in Europe.
The Climate Group has launched a new zero-emission road transport leadership commitment, EV100+. Five globally recognized businesses – IKEA, Unilever, JSW Steel Limited, A.P. Moller-Maersk, and GeoPost/DPDgroup – are the founding members of the initiative, which aims to get rid of the heaviest, most polluting vehicles currently on roads. Together they have committed to transition their fleet of vehicles over 7.5 tones, known as medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs), to zero emission by 2040 in OECD markets, China and India. The new EV100+ complements the EV100 initiative founded by the Climate Group in 2017, in which more than 120 businesses worldwide have committed to convert their fleets with more than over 5.5 million vehicles to electric by 2030.
