NanoPV will operate in an existing 56,000-square-foot facility in Americus. The company will invest an estimated $36 million into the facility, which is expected to create some 500 jobs. Positions will be available in solar manufacturing, quality control, operations and maintenance, research and development, and marketing.
NanoPV has crystalline silicon and thin film silicon solar panel manufacturing facilities, as well as solar farms using NanoPV technologies, in various global locations.
A recent report from the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) projected that, within the next five years, Georgia will surpass North Carolina, the south’s longtime leader in installed solar capacity, in both total installed capacity and on a solar watts per customer ratio.
In 2020 Florida surpassed North Carolina in terms of total installed capacity and South Carolina eclipsed it on the solar watts per customer ratio.
In September 2019, Q Cells opened a 300,000 -sq-ft factory in Dalton, Georgia, which has the capacity to produce 12,000 PV modules per day and 1.7 GW worth annually.
It has not yet been shared what the production capacity of NanoPV’s facility will be.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/07/california-can-cut-power-costs-almost-20-by-moving-its-rps-to-2040/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",California can cut power costs almost 20% by moving its RPS to 2040,"A new study, “Front-loading Net Zero,” by Wärtsilä Energy, shows that front-loading and accelerating the introduction of renewable energy to create a 100% carbon neutral grid in California by 2040 – five years before the state’s RPS calls for a 100% carbon neutral grid – could cut the state’s cost of electricity generation by 17%.
According to authors Antti Alahäivälä and Dr. Karl Meeusen, both of Wärtsilä Energy, the state’s historic status as an American renewable energy pioneer, as well as the plummeting costs of renewable generation, have created a situation where electricity prices in a future 100% renewable energy system will be lower than they are today.
This reality, however, is not one that the state is on pace to achieve. The report models the renewable capacity additions and total resource restructuring necessary to achieve the vision, which includes:
To reach these figures, the study finds that an average of 3.2 GW of solar PV and 1.2 GW of wind must be added every year to reach these targets. That is significantly more than California’s current record of 2.7 GW of non-rooftop solar power or 1 GW of wind power in a single year.

There is also the issue of MW needed vs. MWh needed, which Wärtsilä also modeled for. California’s 2045 forecasted peak load is only expected to increase 23%, from 57 GW to 70 GW, but the overall TWh of consumption will increase 50%, from 280 TWh to 420 TWh by 2045. This growth  and apparent imbalance is driven societal electrification, which includes, electric vehicles and the production of sustainable fuels from wind and solar PV.
Outside of what is listed, the authors argued that California needs additional resources in supplement; specifically, current baseload resources must be replaced by faster, more flexible resources that are capable of running on sustainable fuels.
Such sustainable fuels, produced by excess wind and solar energy, plus storage resources, can enable California to cleanly and reliably shift energy from low-net loads, when power demand is low and wind and solar energy production are at their highest, to high-net loads, when renewable generation is at its lowest and demand is highest, according to the authors.
This transition will require careful planning, beyond just creating a stack of capacity, comparing the stack to forecasted peak load, and building more if there is not enough capacity to serve the load. Using the state’s summer 2020 rolling blackouts as a backdrop the authors argued that there needs to be both enough reliable capacity to meet the peak and that the resources work symbiotically to ensure adequate energy is available during all hours.
As for how a front-loaded scenario can still be less expensive than the current RPS, the authors outlined that it all comes down to reductions in fossil fuels, which currently serve as baseload. During the transition to carbon neutrality, the electricity produced by these fossil sources would be replaced by economic solar PV and wind generation, which are falling in price annually. The affordable energy from renewables, paired battery storage and long-term sustainable fuel energy storage, enable a cost optimal power system with lower generation costs.
Much of the analysis leans on deploying significant amounts of long-duration energy storage to meet daily ramping needs and energy requirements and the use of hydrogen-based sustainable fuels created from excess renewable energy. The authors predicted that these fuels could bridge up to 20% of gaps in power delivery and load meeting, so long as planning for their inclusion and investment in their development is done right away. The report targets 2030 as the year these resources need to start playing a major role in the energy mix.
With all resources accounted for, the report models that a 2040 zero-carbon California grid would include 53% solar, 30% wind, 17% energy storage, 7% hydro, 7% mixed additional resources, and 3% natural gas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/07/computer-model-uses-ai-to-detect-faults-in-residential-solar/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,RESEARCH,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 7, 2021",Computer model uses AI to detect faults in residential solar,"Solar arrays can often experience faults that go undetected for long periods of time, causing generation and revenue losses. 
In particular, residential-scale solar projects lack sensing and instrumentation for performance monitoring and fault detection.
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst addressed this issue and developed SunDown, a computer model for residential solar fault detection.
The model sidesteps instrumentation and sensors, and instead leverages correlations between the power produced by adjacent panels to detect deviations from a panel’s otherwise expected behavior.
The model can handle concurrent faults in multiple panels and classify the anomaly to determine the probable cause.
SunDown uses two years of solar generation data both from a real home and from a dataset of historic system faults. The result, the researchers said, is a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 2.98% when predicting per-panel output.
The researchers said the SunDown model has demonstrated an ability to detect and classify faults–including from snow cover, leaves and debris, and electrical failure–with a  99.13% accuracy. It can also detect multiple concurrent faults with a 97.2% accuracy rate.
Two main models are used in SunDown. One is a linear-regression-based model that takes advantage of the high correlation between adjacent panels. The other is a graphical model using what the researchers called “half-sibling regression,” which is based on a recently proposed machine learning technique.

The system is one of the first to be completed under a revised net aggregated metering program authorized by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. The program allows customers to offset on-site power consumption through solar PV generated on nearby land that is owned or leased by the same customer.
The solar energy is expected to make the authority’s wastewater treatment plant more resilient to electric supply issues, and lock in rates that will save the authority money, said Michael F. Kukura, resident manager with MAWC.
The project is expected to produce more than 3 million kWh annually. SolRiver said that is enough to  avoid 3,515 tons of CO2 emissions, and is equivalent to planting more than 50,000 trees.
This is SolRiver Capital’s first project in Pennsylvania, a state which has set a greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal of 26% below 2005 levels. The company was founded in 2016 and has managed a portfolio of 180 MW of capacity from 300 projects, from New York to Oregon.

In Yunnan province, in southwest China, producers of the silicon metal which feeds polysilicon have been operating at 10% of the output they achieved in August. They are expected to continue to do so for the rest of the year as provincial authorities try to control electricity demand with a measure that is also affecting the phosphorus industry.

Fellow solar supply chain members from the aluminum industry in Guangxi province, in the south, have been forced to operate just two days per week, alongside peers in the concrete, steel, lime, and ceramics segments. Manufacturers in neighboring Guangdong have access to normal power supplies only on Fridays and Saturdays with electricity rationed to a 15% grid security load for the rest of the time.
pv magazine USA reported that a Tier 1 solar module manufacturer warned customers in an email that energy shortages in China have forced it to reduce or stop production at its Chinese manufacturing sites. The company warned the event will also affect output from its downstream cell and module production facilities in Southeast Asia.
The memo said that in order to recover from the effects of the “potential Force Majeure event,” it may delay or stop equipment delivery or seek to renegotiate contracts to pass through higher prices.
With reports of drastic power shortages emerging from China in recent days, the country has actually been experiencing problems since late June, but rationing is not unusual during the peak summer hours.
What has changed this time is that the outages have continued and prompted rationing measures across 19 of the nation’s provinces for the rest of the year. The problems have been caused by a combination of rising post-Covid electricity demand at a time when the politically-motivated ban on imports of Australian coal has tightened supply; and the manner in which Beijing controls power prices, with the situation further exacerbated by carbon emissions reduction policy.
Electricity demand from industry was 13.5 percentage points higher in the first eight months of the year than in the same period of 2020, at 3,585 TWh. That reflected a 13.8% year-on-year rise in total consumption, to 5.47 PWh, according to data from state energy industry trade body the China Electricity Council.

Figures produced by the China General Administration of Customs tell the same story: a rebound driven by the global recovery from the pandemic, with China recording import and export trade worth RMB2.48 trillion ($385 billion) in January-to-August. That was up 23.7% on the same period of last year and 22.8% higher than in the first eight months of 2019.
With Beijing having enforced an unofficial ban on imports of Australian coal for the last year or so – as the result of an ongoing diplomatic spat with Australia – rising demand for coal (which provided around 73% of Chinese electricity in the first half of the year) has further raised prices for the fossil fuel.
The problem for Chinese coal-fired power generators is that Beijing maintains strict controls on the price of electricity. As a result, input costs cannot be passed on to consumers. The mismatch between a liberalized coal market and centrally controlled end-user prices is illustrated by the current situation in Guangdong. There, a coal price of RMB1,560 per ton ($242) has pushed the cost of coal-fired electricity up to RMB0.472 per kilowatt-hour ($0.073). With coal power companies facing an electricity price ceiling of around RMB0.463/kWh ($0.071), generators are losing around RMB0.12 for every kilowatt-hour they generate. In that situation, rationing electricity supplies is an obvious remedy.
The crisis has been worsened by the introduction of China’s “dual control” energy policy, which aims to help meet President Xi Jinping’s climate change pledge of hitting peak carbon emissions this decade and a net zero economy by 2060. Dual control refers to attempts to wind down greenhouse gas emissions at both a national level and in more local areas, such as provinces and cities.
With the finer details of the carbon reduction policy yet to be ironed out, government departments and provincial and city authorities have started to set their own emission-reduction targets. In mid-August, state planning body the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) published a table of the energy control situation across the nation. With nine provinces marked red for their energy consumption, and a further 10 highlighted as yellow, officials received another motivation to introduce power rationing.

The current approach of rolling blackouts seems unlikely to be a sustainable solution, given the damage it could inflict on industry and the resentment it would cause in parts of the nation already preparing for winter.
The choice facing China’s policymakers is whether to ramp up coal supplies to force prices down by using decommissioned domestic supplies and halting the ban on Australian imports, or to raise electricity prices to prompt generators to get the lights back on. While the drawbacks of raising household electricity bills seem obvious, the first approach of using more coal could endanger the nation’s climate change commitments on the even of the COP26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, in November. Sources close to the NDRC have suggested the electricity price may be set to rise soon.
What is clear is the effect the energy crisis is having on the Chinese economy and on the solar supply chain. Leading up to a  national day holiday in China, the coal price in northern China rose to around RMB2,000 per ton ($310), three times higher than at the beginning of the year.
Investment bank China International Capital Corp.  blamed the dual control emission reduction policy for the electricity shortages. It predicted a 0.1-0.15 percentage point impact on economic growth in the last quarter of 2021.  Morgan Stanley has put that figure at 1% in the current quarter, if industrial output restrictions continue. And Japan’s Nomura Securities revised down its annual forecast on Chinese growth from 8.2% to 7.7%. It now expects GDP gains in the third and fourth quarters to cool from 5.1% to 4.7%, and from 4.4% to 3%, respectively.

Despite disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic, the firm’s Global Energy Storage Outlook forecasts nearly 1 TWh of total demand from 2021-2030.
The U.S. and China are expected to dominate the global storage market, making up more than 70% of total global installed capacity through 2030. Deployments in the front-of-the-meter (FTM) segment could reach 700 GWh, or nearly three-quarters of total global deployment by 2030.

The firm said that moves to accelerate the decarbonization of the U.S. and Chinese power sectors provide the foundation of its global market forecast. It said that China’s newly instituted 30 GW of energy storage by 2025 target has an “outsized impact on the regional FTM market.”
(Read “Battery energy storage pairs well with solar, EIA data show.”)
Wood Mackenzie said it sees the Asia Pacific market growing 20-fold, reaching 400 GWh of total storage capacity by 2030, with the FTM sector accounting for 82% of that demand.
Days earlier, IHS Markit released its global energy storage forecast, and said the market is expected to enter a “prolonged period of growth” starting this year. It pegged annual installations reaching more than 30 GW by 2030, up 250% from 2021 levels.
The IHS Markit forecast said that the energy storage industry will notch rapid growth this year, with installations topping 12 GW. That would be an increase of more than 7 GW from 2020. Annual global installations are forecast to exceed 20 GW in 2024 and 30 GW by 2030.

The firm warned, however, that growth in electric vehicle (EV) adoption is leading to increased constraints in the supply of Li-ion batteries. This could cause delays to project commissioning as cell manufacturers prioritize larger customers in the automotive industry over relatively small energy storage system integrators.
The lower share of battery demand from the energy storage industry will leave it at risk of supply shortages. Even so, IHS Markit said it expects that the disruption to ease within 12-18 months, as suppliers diversify their supply base and EV manufacturers firm their procurement plans.
The Wood Mackenzie report said that the current U.S. investment tax credit (ITC) for storage-plus-solar applications has “supercharged” demand. It noted a 4.5x increase in annual FTM deployments expected this year. Work currently under way in Congress on budget reconciliation and energy tax reform resulting in a new ITC for standalone storage applications would provide upside to the current 10-year market outlook, it said.

Europe’s storage market is also set to surge, with Wood Mackenzie expecting cumulative installs to exceed 100 GWh by 2030, led by Germany and Italy. High power prices will push the European non-residential segment from 11% in 2020 to 19% in 2030, while the residential market will exceed 27 GWh by 2030.
Behind-the-meter (BTM) markets are expanding worldwide, with 57 GWh of new deployments forecast through to 2030. The residential sector is being driven by cost reductions and consumer awareness, coupled with solar hybridization and electric vehicle adoption.
In support of global demand expansion, the report notes that global lithium-ion battery capacity will double in the next two years, with NMC and LFP demand forecast to reach 2.30 TWh in 2030, accounting for 89% of global battery cell capacity.

The two said they are working to identify and develop projects to establish an infrastructure able to deliver low-cost and low-carbon hydrogen at scale. The two also are working to accelerate the adoption of heavy-duty zero-emission fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and hydrogen across industrial sectors by establishing hubs in key locations.
One goal of the collaboration is to set up hubs producing 150 tonnes or more of hydrogen per day near highly traveled truck corridors to serve Phoenix-based Nikola’s planned need for hydrogen to fuel its Class 8 FCEVs within the next five years.
Calgary-based TC Energy has pipeline, storage, and power assets that can be leveraged to lower the cost and increase the speed of delivery of these hydrogen production hubs. The company may explore integrating midstream assets to enable hydrogen distribution and storage via pipeline. Assets also could be used to deliver CO2 to permanent sequestration sites to decarbonize the hydrogen production process.
In March, a report said that a lack of policies around adoption incentives, charging infrastructure, and electricity pricing was preventing the widespread electrification of commercial trucking fleets. Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Los Angeles made the case for prioritizing public policy to help move long-haul trucking from diesel to electric.

The study analyzed the total cost of ownership of an electric long-haul truck compared to a diesel long-haul truck. It said that at the current global average battery pack price of $135/kWh, a Class 8 electric truck with 375-mile range and operated 300 miles per day offers about 13% lower total cost of ownership per mile, a three-year payback, and net present savings of about $200,000 over a 15-year lifetime.
The report said these modeled results were achieved with a 3% reduction in payload capacity. It said this penalty could be reversed through light-weighting, or reducing the truck’s overall weight.
The report estimated that the average distance traveled between 30-minute driver breaks is 150 miles and 190 miles for regional-haul and long-haul trucks, respectively. It said that 30% of charging using 500 kW or megawatt-scale fast-chargers would add sufficient range without impairing operations and economics of freight movement.

The exception was issued for the Chalkley Solar Project, named for a historic local family who founded the company that is leasing the land to Aurora. According to Aurora’s zoning exception application, the Chalkey project  would use roughly one million solar modules and have a nameplate capacity between 300 and 400 MW.
The project is expected to sit on roughly 2,400 acres of “lower-value farmland” off of Highway 14, with Aurora specifically choosing lower-value farmland so as not to occupy what could otherwise be lucrative land.
The project is expected to generate between $30 million and $40 million in property taxes over its 30-year lifespan, and would create 300 to 500 temporary construction jobs and three to four full-time jobs.
The project has drawn significant opposition from locals, however with more than 1,000 names being presented in opposition at the zoning meeting. concerns from these residents generally regard the size of the project, its impact on the local environment, damage that project hardware could cause as debris in the event of a hurricane destroying it, and why their town was specifically chosen.
Some also called into question the local official’s authority to grant the specific type of zoning exemption that was granted.
A petition in opposition of the Chalkley Solar Project on change.org was able to garner 681 supporters before closing, calling the project a “metal/mirror wasteland that can potentially destroy or at least harm vast amounts of wildlife.”
Solar life in Louisiana
The Chalkley Solar Project, if approved, will become the second project in the 300 MW range coming to Louisiana, a state not historically known for its utility-scale solar.
The other such installation is the 345 MW Ventress Solar project, set to start construction by the end of this year and slated for completion in 2023. Lightsource bp is developing the project, which will be located 30 miles northwest of Baton Rouge in Pointe Coupee Parish.
If both end up completed, the projects would represent a nearly 400% increase in the state’s total installed solar capacity, which currently sits at roughly 190 MW, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
These projects would also outpace SEIA’s expectations for solar capacity additions in the state over the next five years, which currently sits at 507 MW.
