The 130,000-square-foot plant will have enough capacity to support its North American expansion plans for the next decade, said the Barcelona, Spain-based company.
Operations are expected to begin as early as June 2022. Wallbox’s Pulsar Plus AC chargers, its Quasar DC bidirectional charger, and its Supernova DC public-use fast charger are planned to have active production lines by the first half of 2023.

The company said it expects to manufacture 290,000 units annually in Texas by 2027. By 2030, the facility is planned to reach its full capacity of 500,000 units per year.
Wallbox currently operates in 68 countries, has a vertically integrated supply chain, and manufactures in-house from design to production.
The company recently entered a strategic alliance with SunPower to provide packaged residential solar and EV charging products. The two are exploring integrating bi-directional chargers with home solar and storage systems, offering greater load flexibility and potential for smart-tech enabled grid services.

In June, the company entered a merger agreement with Kensington Capital Acquistion Corp. II. At the time, Wallbox was valued at $1.5 billion, and is now expected to join the New York Stock Exchange in the third quarter under the ticker “WBX.”
Under the arrangement, Wallbox is to receive proceeds of about $330 million, including $100 million fully committed private investment in public equity from Janus Henderson Investors, Luxor Capital, Cathay Innovation, and Kensington Capital partners.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/02/u-s-solar-panel-shipments-rose-33-in-2020/,"COVID-19,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2021",U.S. solar panel shipments rose 33% in 2020,"U.S. solar PV module shipments (including imports, exports, and domestic production and sales) rose by one-third year-on-year from 2019 to 2020, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
EIA reported a record high 21.8 million peak kW shipped in 2020, a 5.4 million peak kW gain over the 2019 total.
In 2020, 89% of U.S. solar panel shipments were imports, and total peak kW imported rose by 26%. Vietnam was the leading exporter to the United States, followed by Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand.

In August, a group of companies asked the U.S. Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
In their petition, the U.S. companies complained that after AD/CVD duties were imposed on Chinese-origin solar cells, Chinese integrated producers started building cell and module assembly plants across Southeast Asia, while continuing “to rely heavily” on Chinese labor, raw materials, and inputs.
The EIA said in its report that solar capacity additions rose 25% between 2019 to 2020, with utility-scale solar recording the largest gain at 29%. Small-scale solar projects of less than 1 MW rose by 19%.
Despite supply chain disruptions, which remain an ongoing issue today, prices continued to fall. The average value of solar shipments, a useful proxy for price, fell from $1.96 per peak watt in 2010 to $0.38 per peak watt in 2020, EIA said.

One factor that drove growth despite pandemic-driven supply chain constraints was the scheduled reduction of the federal investment tax credit (ITC). In December 2020, Congress passed an extension of the ITC, providing a 26% tax credit for the year 2020-22, and 22% in 2023.
Residential installation growth was also driven in part by an increase in home improvement projects as consumers spent more time at home, said EIA.

Germany-based solar panel manufacturer OpesSolutions and the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP have developed a flexible, lightweight standard solar module for vehicle integration that is claimed to be particularly suitable for cargo bikes, as well as for electric buses, trucks and vans.
“For a light commercial vehicle charged with the current electricity mix, integrated solar panels can reduce annual CO2 emissions by up to 890kg and reduce operating costs by providing electricity for refrigeration systems,” the panel maker said in a statement. “In buses, with their large roof areas, integrated photovoltaics can provide up to 100% of the HVAC system’s energy needs – especially helpful when the engine is off.”
Called SolFlex, the frameless panel is based on 22%-efficient solar cells and is designed for high, one-sided heat load. The standard product measures 100x100x2.9mm, weighs in at 3.4kg, and has a power output of 170 W. Its open-circuit voltage is 24.23 V and its short-circuit current is 9.55 A. A customized panel may also reach a power output of up to 600 W and have a size of 3,000×1,200×2.9mm.
The module also has a bending radius of up to 15 degrees and a scratch-resistant surface.
“Innovative interconnection, integrated bypass diodes and half-cell technology ensure optimum yields even with shading and low irradiation,” the manufacturer said. It said that the panel can be produced at lower costs compared to similar products as it relies on series production located in Changzhou, in China’s southern Jiangsu province.
Electric cars incorporating PV panels on their bodywork or roof have the potential of reaching more than 10,000km per year of pure solar-powered driving and the modules could have a payback time of only three or four years, according to a recent study from the Netherlands.
The 10,000km range, however, is still difficult to reach for most electric cars that are currently on the market, due to their current vehicle energy efficiency. On the other hand, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and its power prices.

CoBank, Natixis, and Export Development Canada acted as lead arrangers for the financing, which includes a construction loan that converts into a back-leverage term loan, sponsor bridge loan, and letter of credit facility.
Located in Calhoun County in the south central part of the state, the project is under construction on 1,200 acres of land and is slated to enter service in 2022.
Chicago-based Invenergy has three separate long-term power purchase agreements with utilities for the output. Consumers Energy will buy 140 MW, Michigan Public Power Agency will buy 50 MW, and Lansing Board of Water & Light will buy 10 MW.

According to the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the expansion of the program will allow community solar to power the equivalent of an additional 6,840 Maryland homes, annually. The expansion also changed development regulations, allowing community solar projects to be built on clean-fill construction sites, transforming previously unusable industrial locations into clean solar energy generation sites.
“Community solar is an integral part of Maryland’s clean energy future and has already produced major benefits for residents,” said State Delegate Luke Clippinger of the expansion. “We cannot achieve our climate and renewable energy goals without community solar.”
In 2019, Governor Larry Hogan (R) has signed into law HB 683, a bill which expanded the community solar program through 2022, at which point the Public Service Commission (PSC) is to deliver a long-term path for proceeding with the program or one of a similar structure.
Under that expansion, 30% of program capacity was still set aside for low-to-moderate income customers wishing to participate and another 30% for development on brownfield sites. The program has been considered a success thus far, and the new expansion should serve to continue the program’s momentum while making it more accessible to citizens.

As part of the process, the BLM is soliciting public input on its proposed rulemaking. The BLM sent letters to potentially affected Tribes, and said it intends to hold separate virtual government-to-government meetings regarding the proposed rule.
The BLM said it anticipates publishing a proposed rule in the Federal Register by early 2022. At that time, an opportunity for additional public review and comment will be available.

In early 2020, a two-year tax holiday enjoyed by solar and wind projects operating on federally owned lands ended, and the Trump administration handed owners of affected projects some hefty retroactive bills. That was not entirely unexpected and most owners had set aside money to pay the tax bill. A more pressing concern, however, was the increasing difficulty of securing federal lands at an economical market rate. One group told pv magazine at the time that lease rates “far, far” exceeded fair market value.
