Sized at 200MW of PV and 110MW of lithium-ion battery energy storage, the cost of acquisition was estimated to be $433 million.
Utility WE Energies is contracted to purchase the largest share at 75%. Wisconsin Public Service (WPS) signed on for 15% of the capacity, and the remainder of 10% is allocated to Madison Gas and Electric (MGE).
The project won regulatory approval in 2020. Last August, Invenergy sought approval to boost the battery storage component from 50MW to 110MW.
The storage aspect has met resistance from the state’s Citizens Utility Board. The group argues the project may not be the most cost-effective solution, citing concerns about the risks related to the relatively new technology of battery energy storage.
A filing from the group to the Public Service Commission said, “Due to the novelty of battery storage technology for utility-scale applications … Commission staff’s financial evaluation was unable to verify the applicants support for the cost-effectiveness of acquiring 110 MW of BESS in this docket.”
In its application to expand energy storage, Invenergy said the storage system can act as an “electrical suspension” system for the grid, to smooth abrupt ups and downs in solar production that can occur on partly cloudy days. The battery system can furnish other grid services such as frequency response, voltage support, and output scheduling to potentially shift some afternoon production to later in the day, if needed, to correspond with peak demands, said Invenergy.

When complete, the solar array will feature between 550,000 to 750,000 solar panels rating between 350-550W. Invenergy said it is selecting panels from a list that includes Canadian Solar, Hanwha Qcells, JA Solar, Jinko, Longi, Risen, SunPower, and Trina.  Invenergy secured the contracts for more than 2,500 acres of land. Initial designs call for the solar arrays to use 1,400 acres for the array, spacing, fencing, and access roads.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates the solar industry employs nearly 3,000 people in Wisconsin. The 837MW installed to date ranks the state as 24th in the nation in deployment, according to SEIA. SEIA projects 3,739MW of deployment in five years in Wisconsin.

In order for solar to truly be a “clean” technology, it is imperative to have a plan for disposal of solar panels at the end of their useful life. The current lifetime for solar panels is about 30 years, and while the solar industry grew slowly for several decades, about 70% of existing solar energy systems were deployed within the last five years.
The International Renewable Energy Agency forecasts that the cumulative end-of-life waste from PV in the US in 2030 is projected to be between 0.17 and 1 million tons. For perspective, there are 200 million tons of solid waste, excluding recycled and composted materials, generated in the United States each year.
Although 95% of a cadmium telluride (CdTe) and silicon (Si) solar module is recyclable, the current cost to recycle solar modules is around $15-$45 per module, while the landfill fee is $1-$5 per module, not including transportation costs. Recycling processes that have been developed in the US for CdTe and Si solar modules also cost more than the value of materials obtained from recycling.
DOE SETO
“As we accelerate deployment of photovoltaic systems, we must also recognize the pressing need to address end-of-life for the materials in a sustainable way,” said Kelly Speakes-Backman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the US Department of Energy.
The DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) is funding research to improve the performance, lower the cost, and support widespread deployment of solar. Research areas that SETO will focus on include reliability and durability to increase the operating life of solar PV systems, lowering the resource-intensity of manufacturing, improving solar module recycling processes, and understanding environmental and health impacts of the EOL options. In addition, SETO will support research on how to cut the cost of module recycling by more than half by 2030. Overall, the plan is to reduce the environmental impact of solar energy while supporting the Biden Administration’s goal to decarbonize the electricity grid by 2035.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/18/federal-legislation-introduced-to-build-renewable-energy-superhighway/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 18, 2022",Federal legislation introduced to build renewable energy “superhighway”,"Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced a bill, Connecting Hard-to-reach Areas with Renewable Energy (CHARGE), that is set to make critical changes to energy transmission planning and operations in support of a future powered by renewable energy.
As solar PV and wind projects join the nation’s electric grid, often in remote or rural areas, there is a lack of power lines to bring the power from distant generation sites to areas of high energy demand like cities. Across the country, the aging electric infrastructure will need to be rebuilt to serve this new class of electric generation.
Markey’s summary of the bill explained that the processes in place to plan and build transmission are fractured across many jurisdictions and shaped by incumbent utilities that lack a forward-looking, long-term strategy. Due to this, Markey said federal policy will be key to ensure proper planning and investment are in place.
“For the United States to run on green energy, we first need to build green infrastructure,” said Senator Markey. “Right now, the United States relies on two-lane roads for our electricity traffic when we need a renewable energy superhighway.”
The problem is already here
Arduous transmission upgrade problems have already hampered Markey’s home state of Massachusetts in achieving its renewable energy goals. About 679MW of solar projects have been trapped in a group study by utility National Grid to evaluate what transmission upgrades are needed to support the new capacity. Some projects have been stuck for three years and may be subject to as much as five more years of waiting for National Grid to approve interconnection of the project.
What’s more, there is a lack of transparency in how these upgrades are justified, and who bears the cost. In Massachusetts, in many cases, utility-scale solar developers are stuck footing the bill for significant utility transmission upgrades. In an interview with pv magazine, Jessica Robertson, Borrego Solar director of policy and business development, said “If we don’t have a new way of structuring cost allocation, the costs for all these projects will be prohibitive, and they will be cancelled.”
A letter to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities warned that 6,800 jobs and $300 million in municipal revenues are exposed to damage from the upgrade costs and delays. This problem scaled from one small state to the entire country, plus interstate concerns, are motivating factors behind the CHARGE act.
What’s in the bill?
The CHARGE Act offers wide-ranging federal policy that introduces a series of reforms to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The bill:
The Act introduces measures for data transparency, which will tighten up the way utilities report their operations and expenses. The bill:
The Act has provisions for competition, fairness, and equity. The bill:
“The CHARGE Act lays the groundwork for an energy grid that can support an explosion of electric-powered vehicles and buildings, while also improving energy reliability, lowering costs for consumers, and spurring economic competition. My legislation will supply America with the tools and guidance needed to turn the clean energy revolution up a notch, accelerating our shift to true energy-independence that breaks our nation’s reliance on foreign oil from countries like Russia,” said Senator Markey.

Under the partnership agreement, Source Renewables will develop the projects, while Sol-REIT will provide capital to Source for construction and long-term financing of the solar projects in their pipeline.
The two companies have expressed hope that the partnership will serve to disrupt what has historically been a highly fragmented finance market in the solar industry.  The companies said this fragmentation has traditionally disadvantaged and discouraged middle-market developers due to inequitable and typically inefficient access to capital.
“We are playing our part to address one of the greatest challenges in today’s solar energy market; access to capital for solar developers targeting projects in underserved communities,” said Mark Settles, CEO of Sol-REIT. “These underserved communities are those who need access to clean renewable energy the most, and Sol-REIT is helping to serve that need in this partnership with Source Renewables.”
In practice, Sol-REIT has made its name as a company by financing solar projects in a similar model to real estate. Under the model, Sol-REIT provides access to construction capital and long-term financing to project developers who want to maintain an equity stake in their developments, improving their overall economics as the project maintains operations and generates revenue.
Source Renewables is a sister company to Source Power, a New York regulated energy supplier and community solar subscriber acquisition company. To date, Source Power has been contracted to own and operate a total of more than 365 MW of installed capacity, and the company has invested nearly $1 billion in residential and commercial solar assets since 2010.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/18/22-california-legislators-call-on-regulators-to-maintain-net-metering/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 18, 2022",22 California legislators call on regulators to maintain net metering,"A bipartisan group of 22 California legislators, including both Senators and Assemblymembers, have sent a public letter to Alice Reynolds, Chair of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), asking that the Commission to reject the proposed decision issued on December 13, 2021, and to keep solar growing, affordable, and in line with California’s clean energy goals.
The letter focuses on the proposed decision’s monthly fee on residential solar customers, with the legislators saying such a fee could “significantly depress the clean energy market, and negatively impact a California-based businesses supporting a sizable number of jobs statewide.”
The letter also takes issue with the proposed lower export credit, with the legislators warning that such a drastic reduction could make it much harder to finance of new multi-family housing projects, reducing new construction of much needed affordable housing. The legislators even go so far as to agree on the need for a somewhat lowered export credit, but not one so drastic as the proposed decision.
The idea that lower export credits and monthly fees would increase difficulty in developing multi-family housing projects comes from the state’s 2020 mandate requiring new homes to have a solar system. By lowering export credits and instituting monthly fees, project payback periods would be greatly increased in a way that the legislators described as discriminatory toward the individuals and families who themselves are making an effort to help the state meet its renewable energy goals.
“It is not reasonable to apply a monthly charge, in this case $684 per year, to only a subset of ratepayers when changes to the net metering export credit these ratepayers receive could accommodate the CPUCs objective,” the letter reads. “We urge avoiding discriminatory fees solely aimed at solar and solar plus storage customers.”
In February, SolarReviews, a residential solar informational site, interviewed about 4,000 active solar shoppers in the state, and showed them what their solar savings potential looked like under the assumptions of NEM 3.0. The results were nothing short of damning for California rooftop solar, as 95% responded they would no longer purchase under the cost assumptions. In many cases payback periods were increased to as much as 20 years, a wait many viewed as unreasonable and too risky.
The CPUC was originally set to vote on the proposal on January 27, but decided to delay any decision on the much-maligned proposal indefinitely.
