Powin declined to reveal each entity’s new ownership share. However, the company told pv magazine USA that private equity firm Trilantic and investment platform EIP invested more than $100 million as part of the deal.
According to Powin, the transaction will enable the company to accelerate its growth plans, enhance its bankability profile, and solidify its position in the energy storage market.
For nearly a decade, Powin has worked to advance its battery management technology and develop product offerings. Analyst firm Guidehouse Insights recently ranked Powin as a leading utility-scale energy storage system integrator, with the company joining Tesla, Fluence, RES, and other major market players.
Powin said it has built more than 600 MWh of systems, supporting 54 projects in 10 U.S. states and eight countries. The company also has a contracted pipeline to supply over 4,000 MWh of energy storage systems globally during the next five years.
CEO Geoff Brown said the agreement highlights the investors’ confidence in “the great potential of the storage market.”

In a presentation for Roth Capital Partners, Ohm Analytics Founder, Chris Collins, discussed inverter market share data across a sample of permit and interconnection sources in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Washington D.C., Texas, Colorado, Florida and North Carolina.

And while the data for Enphase (shown in the graph in blue) don’t represent the entire scope of the inverter industry, these are all relevant markets.
According to the presentation slide, Enphase’s market share has been steadily rising since July and, after suffering a dip in September, overtook SolarEdge for the first time in October. As of December, Enphase held a 48% share in the selected markets, compared to SolarEdge’s 40%.
The timing of Enphase’s rise in market share coincides with its Encharge battery launch in North American markets in July. A month later, Enphase and German module maker Sonnenstromfabrik launched a residential module, the Enphase Energized AC module, which was equipped with an Enphase IQ 7+ microinverter. Although the product currently is available only in select European countries, a North American launch could offer Enphase an opportunity to make more gains on SolarEdge.
Enphase is set to release its Q4 2020 financial results February 9, which could shed light on how the Encharge battery system has helped expand the company’s market share, as well on a North American launch of the Energized AC module.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/08/mass-governor-returns-climate-change-bill-with-a-host-of-changes/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021",Mass. governor returns climate change bill with a host of changes,"The debate over sweeping climate change legislation in Massachusetts continues. Weeks after state lawmakers re-passed a bill, Gov. Charlie Baker sent it back to the legislature on February 7 with proposed amendments.
The bill, “An Act Creating a Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy,” landed on Baker’s desk for a second time after he “reluctantly” vetoed it when the legislative session ended in January. Determined to push ahead, lawmakers refiled and passed an identical bill when the new session started.
As previously reported, the legislation includes a host of environmental, social, and clean energy goals. The bill also includes several provisions designed to help boost the state’s solar industry, including net metering changes and tax certainty.
Baker’s list of proposed amendments appears to leave the solar aspects intact.
In his letter to lawmakers, Baker wrote that he is “grateful” the legislature re-passed the bill, allowing his administration time to work on reaching a compromise regarding some of the governor’s concerns.
Baker restated his support for the overall intent of the climate bill, but proposed various “technical amendments to address the nuts and bolts of implementation.”
Chief among Baker’s worries was the bill’s mandate to cut the state’s emissions no less than 50% below 1990 levels by 2030, which he said is “more aggressive” than his administration’s goal of 45% in the same period. When he vetoed the initial bill, Baker claimed the higher target would prove costly and wasn’t based on the latest data.
In his letter, Baker proposed establishing a range of 45% to 50% reductions for the 2030 limit, as well as 65% to 75% for the 2040 limit. He said the new language would give the executive branch the flexibility to make the most appropriate decision based on the best-available information and unforeseen changes. Baker said this would help “avoid the costs that are expected to result from imposing a higher limit, particularly on those who can least afford it.”
Baker also raised concerns about the bill’s emissions-reduction mandates for particular sectors, which he argued could “unintentionally and disproportionately” hurt Massachusetts businesses and industries. The governor proposed an amendment to have sector-specific emissions sublimits “serve as planning tools, rather than independent legal requirements.”
Similarly, Baker raised concerns about the possible impacts a stretch energy code might have on development and affordable housing. He proposed that the Department of Energy Resources be in charge of transitioning to a specialized stretch energy code to provide more certainty.
Baker underscored his support for the bill’s environmental justice provisions, proposing amendments he claimed would make them “even stronger.” For example, he proposed new language requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to conduct analyses of environmental justice populations as a condition of issuing certain permits.
Baker wrote he “sincerely” hoped the legislature will re-enact the bill with his proposed amendments.
According to local reports, a number of lawmakers are open to compromise and welcome some of the proposed changes. Sen. Michael Barrett, in particular, preferred Baker’s amendment letter over the governor’s earlier veto letter.
Barrett told one publication, “There will be disagreements there, but I liked the new theme.”
Because the climate bill passed with a supermajority, the legislature likely has enough support to override another veto from the governor.
Environment Massachusetts called Baker’s letter a “mixed bag.”
“Legislators should reject any weakening amendments—and, most important, they should act quickly to pass this bill into law,” said Ben Hellerstein, state director for the advocacy group, in a statement.

Early in the year, Belltown closed on a deal with an investment partner for a portfolio of three contracted projects totaling 330 MW in the ERCOT North Zone, including around 250 MW of busbar offtake with Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative (RCEC) and a roughly 80 MW north-hub settled offtake with Vistra Corp.
Belltown also worked with an investor on the sale of a roughly 360 MW project in Denton County, Texas, completing the transaction in August. Later in the year, Belltown worked on Adapture Renewables’ acquisition of a 65 MW project in Hunt County, contracted with a busbar power purchase agreement with RCEC.
Together with a 180 MW project in Falls County sold in 2019 to a unit of Ecoplexus Inc., the 2020 transactions bring the total capacity of projects that Belltown has developed and sold to 930 MW.
Belltown said it is currently working to sell another 870 MW of projects, all of which are expected to close in the first half of this year.
Belltown develops solar photovoltaic and storage projects in ERCOT, with a geographic focus in the North and South Zones of the state.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/08/spare-capacity-exists-to-support-a-supply-chain-shift-industry-group-says/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021","Spare capacity exists to support a supply chain shift, industry group says","Sufficient capacity exists in U.S. and European production facilities to support a June target to shift supply chains away from parts of the world where allegations of forced labor have received increased attention in recent weeks.
“There is still excess capacity for polysilicon production in the U.S. and the EU,” said Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance, whose members include First Solar, Q Cells, NorSun, and REC.
On February 4, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and 175 of its member companies published a pledge opposing forced labor in the solar supply chain. The pledge is part of an industry-wide effort led by SEIA that supports the development of a supply chain traceability protocol along with an update to SEIA’s Solar Commitment, which defines common practices and expectations for the solar industry.
John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy for SEIA, said that “forced labor will not be tolerated in our industry” and called for solar companies to “immediately move their supply chains out of” regions where forced labor practices are suspected.
In an interview with pv magazine USA, SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said, “We think that the (supply chain) shift will happen by the end of June.” She said that SEIA became increasingly aware of the allegations about forced labor in late 2020. She said “there is an urgency to this that companies understand, and so by the end of June they will have had seven-plus months to make these changes. Obviously, if their customers and the U.S. government are demanding it, they will need to move quickly.”
Ross Hopper said that “some domestic supply chain” capacity is available to expand polysilicon production. She said that there are “actors in the U.S. who could help service” some of the expected shift in supply.
“I will leave to the polysilicon manufacturers their ability to ramp up that part of the supply chain here in the U.S.,” Ross Hopper said. “It may not all happen here in the United States, but I think there will be a clear transition out of” the conflict region.
Parr said that roughly half of the world’s polysilicon and three-quarters of the ingots used for solar come from areas where forced labor is alleged to be occurring. He said those inputs account for roughly 4% of total solar system cost. And, while predicting prices is “a fool’s errand,” he said the amount of excess production capacity suggests that a supply chain shift could occur with little impact on solar’s affordability.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/08/national-clean-energy-and-sustainability-accelerator-bills-introduced-in-house-and-senate/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021",National Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator bills introduced in House and Senate,"Bills to create a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator that can leverage $100 billion of public funds to finance up to $463 billion in total investment over the next four years have been introduced in the House and the Senate.
The expectation is that the Accelerator will be pulled into a larger bill, most likely an infrastructure and climate package. The Accelerator would make up a significant piece of President Biden’s goal of $2 trillion in infrastructure spending.
Some bipartisan support exists, but a bill that includes this type of federal clean energy financing mechanism can also be passed using the budget reconciliation process.

“[Investing in clean energy] is an economic opportunity,” said Debbie Dingell, the Michigan Member of Congress who, along with Sens. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md), re-introduced legislation that would create the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator.
“When we invest in clean energy projects at home, we can export American technology and expertise overseas instead of importing foreign oil,” Markey said.
As currently envisioned, the Accelerator would seek investment and procurements in areas such as renewables, storage, transportation, transmission, resiliency, efficiency, reforestation, agriculture, and industrial de-carbonization. The bills currently structure the Accelerator as an independent non-profit capitalized with $50 billion and topped up with $10 billion a year for its first five years.
The model for the Accelerator is not new. For years, state green banks in New York, Connecticut, Michigan and elsewhere have used a model that pairs each public dollar with multiple private dollars to expand clean energy’s reach. Several local funds, including Florida’s Solar and Energy Loan Fund, also exist.
“During the last decade, the green bank model has proven to have an outsized impact in states, creating good-paying jobs and decarbonizing the economy,” said Reed Hundt, CEO of the Coalition for Green Capital said. He expressed confidence that the Accelerator can be passed by both chambers and signed by President Biden this year.
In 2020, nearly 100 organizations voiced support for the Clean Energy Jobs Fund, which included a Clean Energy Accelerator in both its House and Senate versions. Letters of support came from state green banks, start-ups, clean tech investors, utilities, energy industry trade groups (including the Solar Energy Industries Association and Energy Storage Association), and several environmental organizations, including the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and Appalachian Voices.
“U.S. companies have to compete globally with German, British, Indian, and Chinese firms, among others, all supported by government-backed financial institutions that have a specific public policy mandate,” the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine wrote in a report in which it expressed its support for a federal green bank to finance low to zero-carbon technology and infrastructure.
The report said that the German KfW is one of the largest development banks in the world, with assets exceeding €500 billion. It was initially the sole lender in Germany to solar companies, prior to financing from private banks. The China Development Bank holds assets exceeding $1 trillion and likewise has invested heavily in renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure.

“Private sources of capital are unlikely to be sufficient to finance the low-carbon economic transition, especially during the 2020s when the effort is new,” the National Academies report said.
Partial financing by a green bank would reduce risk for private investors and encourage rapid expansion of private sources capital, the report said. Because the public money invested under a green bank model is repaid over time, it can be redeployed.
To better align the economy with the risks and benefits of transition policies and climate change, the report’s authors also called for a policy that requires annual Securities and Exchange Commission reporting of these risks and benefits by private companies and their inclusion in stress tests by the Federal Reserve and in all cost-benefit analyses by federal agencies.
Although the United States currently has no domestic independent development, investment, or federal green bank, it has periodically used them in the past, the National Academies’ report noted, citing the War Finance Corporation, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which later became the capital bank for the 1930s-era New Deal, as past examples.
“The renewable energy industry should look at this policy as the driver to radically expand the total addressable market that they can serve, which in turn means enormous growth opportunities,” said Jeffrey Schub, executive director of the Coalition for Green Capital, a nonprofit that incubates and supports local green banks.

By design, the new Accelerator bill is aligned with President Biden’s Justice 40 Initiative. Because of this executive order, signed last week, the Accelerator bill now requires 40% of all investments to be directed into disadvantaged communities facing climate impacts.
“The Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator will be a critical catalyst for creating good jobs and increasing our health, wealth, safety and competitiveness,” said Doug Sims, director of the NRDC’s Green Finance Center. With a mandate to “focus on underserved communities of color and the just transition for fossil fuel communities and workers, it’s a tool for moving small towns, suburbs and cities forward together.”
In November, the Green Finance Institute, the NRDC and the Rocky Mountain Institute published a report aimed at informing the development of a Green Bank Design Platform that they hope entities can be use to establish green banks and other green financing vehicles.
For its part, the Coalition for Green Capital has been working to engage state and local entities to get them ready to receive Clean Energy Accelerator money.

The rooftop solar projects will total about 3.26 MW.
According to Sigora, the projects will produce an estimated 4,252 MWh of energy, enough to offset nearly half of the schools’ combined energy needs. The PPA is expected to save the district more than $3 million over 20 years.
Principals of the participating schools see the installations as an opportunity for students to learn about solar technology and take part in combating climate change.
Project construction is expected to be completed this fall.
Sigora Solar said the company’s commercial unit has doubled its installation capacity over the past three years and is forecast to do so again in 2021, due in part to public projects like this one.

Expected to be completed in 2023, the solar project is being developed and built by Chicago-based Invenergy. The deal needs to win approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
The project was identified through an all-source request for proposals as part of the utility’s integrated resource planning process. Construction is expected to begin in the fall.
Enphase Energy said it will acquire the solar design services business of DIN Engineering Services LLP, based in India.
The business works with local jurisdictions in the U.S. to streamline the proposal and permitting process for installers.
The acquisition offers Enphase’s installers new services by providing proposal drawings and permit plan sets. DIN services are expected to integrates into the Enphase’s Enlighten digital platform, advancing Enphase’s goal to simplify and accelerate the end-to-end sales process across the residential solar industry.
The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by March 31.
Developers of a 149 MW solar farm in Wisconsin have delayed construction for two years to pursue federal financing. Ranger Power is planning to build the facility to produce electricity for Dairyland Power Cooperative. In January it received permission from state regulators to postpone construction until June 2023 in order to apply for a low-interest loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service, which has several programs to support construction and improvement of the electric grid in rural areas.
In order to qualify for the loan, the company must complete an environmental impact study, which typically takes about two years. In a letter to the Public Service Commission, Ranger said the financing would result in lower costs for Dairyland, which supplies electricity to 41 cooperative and municipal utilities serving about 279,000 customers across Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois.
Ranger and Dairyland reportedly are renegotiating an existing power purchase agreement related to the project.
Electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to reach 62 million units per year by 2050, with a total global EV stock of 700 million, according to new research from Wood Mackenzie.
By 2047, battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and fuel cell vehicle (FCV) sales will combine to pass internal combustion engine (ICE) sales globally for light-duty vehicles for the first time.
EV sales are expected to top a combined 7 million a year in China, Europe, and the U.S. by 2025. Improved EV costs will double EV numbers to a combined 15 million a year in those three regions by 2030. All automobile sales in Europe (86%), China (81%), and North America (78%) will predominantly be EVs by 2050, the report said.
In late January, automaker GM said it would offer 30 all-electric models globally by mid-decade and that 40% of the company’s U.S. models offered will be battery electric vehicles by the end of 2025. GM said it is investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, up from $20 billion planned a year ago.
The Wood Mackenzie report said that global EV sales grew 38% despite a decline of 20% in all car sales. Led by electric buses and light trucks, annual commercial EV sales are expected to top 3 million by 2025 and triple to nearly 9 million by 2030. Annual commercial vehicle sales are projected to reach 6.4million by 2050, while global stock will grow to 54 million.
Residential chargers are projected to be the primary mode of charging for EVs globally. The report said that such chargers would make up nearly 90% of the total 416 million charging outlets globally by 2050.
Amber Solutions, a Silicon Valley startup that developed a solid-state AC/DC enabler, as well as an AC switch, has raised more than $8.5 million its 2020 series B funding round from new and existing investors. In addition to the funding, Amber has also started the year by becoming a BIG Innovations 2021 Award winner, a CES 2021 Innovations Award honoree, and a 2021 Edison Award nominee.
“Our commitment to revolutionize the world’s building electrical infrastructure helped Amber enter 2021 with increased investment, new patents, as well as multiple industry award wins and nominations,” said CEO Thar Casey.
