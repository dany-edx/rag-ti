To stay up to date on what’s new, check out this latest clean energy product roundup:
Ozop Energy Systems reached a cooperation agreement with Yingli Green Energy Americas in which Ozop will distribute Yingli solar PV panels nationwide starting with its new YL360D module.
OES said it received signed purchase orders in excess of $2,100,000 consisting of four containers per month, which include the new YLM360 All-Black 120-Cell Modules. Yingli will provide mono products with black frames and sheets, as well as flexible installation methods.
The 360W, 120-cell modules are 3.3 inches taller than the traditional 60-cell footprint, allowing for a more flexible installation. The amount of power that this module will be producing in a small footprint is significant, Ozop said. More information is here.
SolarEdge Technologies launched its new 120kW three-phase inverter with Synergy Technology. Providing more power and higher profitability in ground mount PV installations, the new SE120K for 480V grids maximizes energy production with up to 150% DC oversizing. The inverter includes built-in nighttime Potential Induced Degradation (PID) rectifier to avoid module performance degradation.

The new inverter introduces a pre-commissioning feature allowing installers to fully and automatically validate system components from their smartphones, before grid connection.
Designed to improve system uptime, the modular design is composed of independently working Synergy Units and controlled by a single management interface. Combining large capacity with ease of installation, the company said the design is light enough for a two-person team to install. More information is here.
ChargePoint said it working with Android Auto to bring essential EV charging functionality inside the vehicle, allowing drivers to access charging information directly from their infotainment system.

Android users will be able to use the ChargePoint app on their vehicle display by connecting an Android phone, with the ChargePoint app installed and running Android 6.0 or above, to an Android Auto compatible vehicle. Key features include: Map with nearby stations; ability to check station status; select the station list for more detailed information; begin a charging session; filter nearby stations by charging speed, availability and cost; compatibility with the driver’s EV make and model; and if a station is busy, the driver can use the in-vehicle app to click Notify Me to find out when the station becomes available again. More information is here.
Elevation Home Energy Solutions and SmartRent announced a partnership to integrate Elevation’s home energy savings technology into SmartRent’s slate of home automation technology for rental properties. Elevation’s algorithm automatically reduces energy consumption during peak electricity pricing times in SmartRent-equipped homes, and aims to increase energy efficiency and lower energy costs for renters.
Based on a pilot program, property owners using the SmartRent platform and their residents can save up to 15% on energy bills with this technology, both by using less energy and by shifting load. When deployed at scale in partnership with local utility providers, this smart energy savings technology has the ability to offset the demand for carbon-producing peaker plants.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/30/solar-101-working-the-angles-to-maximize-your-solar-systems-output/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 30, 2021",Solar 101: Working the angles to maximize your solar system’s output,"In the first articles of our Solar 101 series, (“Is my roof ready for solar?“) and (“Attaching your solar system to your roof”) we discussed how the age and physical characteristics of a roof affect the design and payback of a prospective solar system. We considered weather concerns and panel setbacks to better estimate the number of solar panels that will fit on a roof.
Now, we will take a look at the relationship between a panel’s latitude, pitch, and azimuth to its solar electricity output.
In a perfect world, solar panels always face the sun at a perpendicular angle. But most prospective solar buyers are stuck with pre-existing realities: a home they already own, and a roof with preexisting conditions. Partial shade, a less-than-ideal azimuth, or a less-than-ideal roof pitch are often the norm for a residential installation.
But that begs the question: To what extent will these factors affect my system’s return on investment?
Most of us are looking to maximize electricity generation on an annual basis. Thus, the best azimuth is due south and the ideal pitch is roughly equal to your home or business’s latitude. We can test this hypothesis using the U.S. Department of Energy’s PV Watts tool to estimate solar electricity generation.
Here is what it looks like:

PV Watts is not a perfect tool; it is a rough guide, but it is close enough for our purposes. If you live in a region with heavy snow, dust, tree cover, or other sunshine-blocking variables your electricity production will be lower.
Let’s start this analysis with a completely average city – Normal, Illinois – as our test site. For this analysis, we adopt the default variables in PV Watts, changing two variables: the Tilt (deg) of the roof and the array type to Fixed (roof mount).

A rule of thumb for optimizing the angle of your solar panels is to mount them at an angle equivalent to the site’s latitude, facing due south. The latitude of Normal, Illinois, is 40.5°.
As you can see in the chart below, the peak generation from this roof is not exactly 40.5°, but is somewhere between 35-36°. According to this “Normal” data, a panel’s pitch can range anywhere from 20° to 50° and still generate more than 97% of its peak potential.

One interesting observation from this chart is that if your solar panels are horizontal (corresponding to the far left of the chart) or 90° vertical (at the far right), your system will still produce a decent amount of electricity. Compared to the maximum output value of 5,623 kWh/year, a flat roof produces 15% less and a vertical wall of solar panels produces 38% less. Not optimal, but not useless.
Keep in mind that horizontal panels on a flat roof will collect dirt. That’s why at least a few degrees of pitch are needed to allow rain to rinse off dust and pollen. A slight angle will also prevent rainwater from settling on the solar panels and leaving a residue as the water evaporates. One study has shown that panels in very dusty environments with infrequent rain resist dust deposition best when angled at around 26%.
Now let’s consider the direction that the roof surface faces. This factor is called the “azimuth” and refers to the direction the roof surface faces relative to the North Pole, which is located at 0°. This makes due south 180°, west 270° and east 90°.
Returning to our completely average city of Normal, Illinois, we’ll keep the system’s roof angle at 40.5° for our calculations.
As you can see in the table, the Normal house facing due South can generate 5,608 kWh. When facing due east, that value falls to 4,350 kWh, a 22% loss. When facing due west, we get a similar result: 4,303 kWh, a 23% loss.
But that’s Normal, Illinois. Generation losses due to azimuth become less pronounced as we approach the equator. For instance, in San Diego, California, (latitude 32.7º) a default system modeled using PV Watts fell from 6,314 kWh to 5,511 kWh. That drop was just under 13%.
In the case of San Diego, elevated land to the east blocks some sun, at least compared to the beautiful open ocean to the west. This means a due south solar system actually, slightly, underperforms in terms of electricity generation. We found that the peak value was somewhere closer to an azimuth of 197-198º.

Other factors will affect your roof’s solar generation, including shadows from trees, neighboring houses, and even your own house’s features. Make sure that your solar contractor accounts for all these factors when giving you a quote and a financial model.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/30/sunrise-brief-solar-as-sculpture-could-help-power-burning-man-festival/,"COMMUNITY,HYDROGEN,LEGAL,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 30, 2021",Sunrise brief: Solar as sculpture could help power Burning Man festival,"Mumbai architecture firm NUDES has designed Solar Mountain, which could become a permanent installation on Burning Man’s 3,800-acre ranch in Nevada and produce 300 MWh of electricity annually.
The design features an array of solar panels fanning out from a central spine. Construction is planned with modular design elements of recycled wood and other environmentally friendly materials. It would include four units, each with 182 solar panels of 300W capacity.
Burning Man is an annual festival focused on community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance. The NUDES design is one of 10 finalists in a design challenge by Land Art Generator Initiative and Burning Man Project known as LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch. Later this year, selected design teams will be offered a grant to build a functional prototype on site.
A Texas court granted a request by CPS Energy for a temporary restraining order preventing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ECOT) from using posted collateral from CPS and other entities to cover charges that other market participants have not paid.
The charges are related to electricity prices that remained at market-capped highs for days in mid-February as much of Texas dealt with an extended winter storm that crippled the state’s grid.
CPS Energy, a municipal utility, first filed claims against ERCOT in mid-March. It alleged that the grid operator’s “lack of oversight, preparedness, and failure to follow its own protocols” resulted in $16 billion in overcharges to market participants and customers during the storm.
The utility said that ERCOT has admitted that it could have corrected the $16 billion error by repricing within 30 days of the winter storm, but did not. An Independent Market Monitor also advised that the charges were likely excessive.
CPS Energy said that ERCOT’s attempts to collect these charges from CPS Energy’s customers is “an unlawful extension of CPS Energy’s credit” and a “direct violation of the Texas State Constitution.” Lawyers argued that a city-owned utility cannot be asked to help settle the debts of other entities, “especially in cases where there is no chance of being repaid.”
In late April, a Bexar County District Court judge granted CPS Energy a temporary restraining order.
“Disappointingly, ERCOT continues to inject uncertainty into the market while failing to address its errors, which is contributing to one of the largest illegal transfers of wealth in the history of Texas,” said Paula Gold-Williams, the utility’s president and CEO.
Puget Sound Energy signed a joint development agreement with Mitsubishi Power Americas to collaborate on renewable energy and storage project development in line with the utility’s goal to become a “Beyond Net Zero Carbon” energy company by 2045.
Additionally, Mitsubishi Power and Magnum Development will jointly develop green hydrogen storage assets in PSE’s service territory. Mitsubishi Power and Magnum Development introduced green hydrogen storage at grid scale in May 2019 with the Advanced Clean Energy Storage Project in Delta, Utah.
Advanced Power tapped Bechtel to complete the engineering, procurement, and construction of the 140 MW Cutlass Solar Project in Fort Bend, Texas. The project will be built on a 700-acre site and is scheduled to enter service in 2022. Bechtel Enterprises partnered with Advanced Power to develop the project.
Cutlass Solar is the fourth project and first renewable energy facility that Bechtel will deliver for Advanced Power. The team is currently constructing the South Field Energy Facility in Ohio and previously completed the Cricket Valley Energy Center and the Carroll County Energy Facility using natural gas.
The Indian Point Energy Center permanently shut down April 30 when it retired its last operating nuclear reactor, Unit 3. The power plant began operations in 1962 and produced over 565 terawatthours of electricity in the 59 years it was open. The Unit 3 retirement removes almost 1,040 MW of nuclear generating capacity from New York State, leaving about 3,200 MW of remaining nuclear capacity at three plants in upstate New York.
Indian Point had three pressurized water reactors. Unit 1 began operations in 1962 and shut down in 1974. Units 2 and 3 began operations in 1974 and 1976, respectively; Unit 2 retired in April 2020.
Three natural gas-fired power plants have been introduced over the past three years to help support the electric supply needed by New York City that Indian Point had been providing: Bayonne Energy Center II (120 MW), CPV Valley Energy Center (678 MW), and Cricket Valley Energy Center (1,020 MW).
