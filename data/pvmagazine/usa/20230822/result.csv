The company was joined by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) and federal, state and local officials to initiate the groundbreaking.
The project includes a 100 MW solar facility and 50 MW of battery energy storage that can power the equivalent of 37,000 Virginia homes at peak output. All energy produced by the project will serve Dominion Energy Virginia customers. 
“Thanks to our strong partnership with MWAA, millions of travelers flying in and out of Dulles every year will see this powerful symbol of the clean energy transition,” said Bob Blue, chair, president, and chief executive officer of Dominion Energy. “Just as air travelers can always count on Dulles to reach their destination, our customers can always count on us to deliver reliable and increasingly clean energy.”
The partnership is resulting in the largest renewable energy project developed at a U.S. airport.
“This groundbreaking marks the beginning of a historic achievement – a first-of-its-kind renewable energy project at a major U.S. airport,” said Virginia Senator Mark Warner.
The project includes a unique lease agreement that will advance electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure at Dulles. Instead of making annual lease payments to MWAA for the 100 MW site, Dominion Energy will develop two 1 MW solar carports that will partially power Dulles facilities, and provide 18 electric transit buses, 50 electric fleet vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations for Dulles operations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/22/vermont-startup-joins-partnership-to-commercialize-perovskite-solar/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 22, 2023",Vermont startup joins partnership to commercialize perovskite solar,"Verde Technologies, Inc., a Vermont-based company that focuses on the development of perovskite thin-film solar, announced an exclusive partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Northern Illinois University (NIU) to work toward the commercialization of perovskite solar cells.
NREL and NIU have been working together on advancing perovskite solar manufacturing. For example, they collaborated on a type of transparent sticky tape, which they say can be applied to a perovskite solar cell and will absorb any lead that is leaked from it. The tape, according to the scientists, can easily be integrated with existing encapsulation strategies, and was shown to absorb 99.9% of lead leaked from cells from that were severely damaged.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, perovskite solar cells have made rapid efficiency gains from about 3% in 2009 to over 25% today. While perovskite solar cells have become highly efficient in a very short time, a number of challenges remain before they can become a competitive commercial technology. Some of these challenges include stability and durability, power conversion efficiency at scale, manufacturability, and bankability.
By adding Verde’s manufacturing expertise, the collaboration among the three organizations aims to unlock the potential of efficient, safe, low-cost perovskite solar panels at an unprecedented scale.
“Many of the pieces of the puzzle needed for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells are likely already out there,” said Kai Zhu, NREL’s senior scientist. “It is now largely a matter of figuring out how to put the pieces together, with some tunings, in a stable, low-cost, scalable form factor.”
The partnership includes an agreement for rights to a portfolio of NREL’s breakthrough perovskite solar technologies, spearheaded by Zhu and NIU Chemistry Professor Tao Xu. NREL will take the lead on commercializing these technologies co-owned by both institutions. NREL and NIU will share any income or royalties generated by the technologies.
Verde is a University of Vermont start-up that was selected, along with CubicPV, to work on a center to commercialize perovskites. This effort is led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. What Verde brings to partnership with NREL and NIU is its expertise in the development of a lead-sequestration layer that eliminates concerns of hazardous lead leakage while also preserving the structural integrity and power output of the solar cells.
“This set of technology will help to stabilize the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells manufactured at Verde Technologies and minimize any potential leakage of toxic lead content from perovskite solar cells,” Xu says. “I am excited to see that Verde is taking NREL/NIU’s technologies toward commercialization in the emerging perovskite PV market.”
Verde is making use of an encapsulation technique that was developed at NREL. When applied to the entire solar cell, the active encapsulation forms a seal that enhances stability and performance by reducing moisture sensitivity.
“Our team could not be more excited to have signed this exclusive deal with NREL and to be collaborating with some of the top minds in solar, Dr. Kai Zhu and Dr. Tao Xu,” said Skylar Bagdon, CEO of Verde. “This agreement perfectly exemplifies Verde’s commitment to collaborating with the community and taking a holistic view of module design that addresses all the key factors of stability, manufacturability, safety and low cost.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/22/scientists-outline-innovation-pathways-for-pv-technologies/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 22, 2023",Scientists outline innovation pathways for PV technologies,"Ten scientists have projected the innovation pathways for the major PV cell technologies over the next five years, in an open-access article in the journal Cell.
Although installed PV capacity worldwide exceeds 1 terawatt (1,000 GW), PV’s contribution to worldwide electricity generation remains small, the authors say, at 5% to 6%. Given an “urgent need” to deploy PV at multi-terawatt (TW) scale over the next two decades to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, “PV device innovation takes on new urgency and impact.”
Continued research that leads to “even relatively small advances” in efficiency, reliability and manufacturing efficiency “will have major future impacts at multi-TW scale,” the authors say, as these factors combine to make “the increasingly compelling value proposition” for PV power generation.
While crystalline silicon PV had a 95% market share in 2022, in a “TW-scale future” with “PV everywhere,” multiple technologies may be complementary, or combined, the authors say.
The silicon PV technology known as TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivating contact), with a market share of 23%, will “overcome” production of PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) PV by 2025 and “is likely to become the technology of choice for new-cell manufacturing in the US,” the article predicts.
Crystalline silicon PV cells are approaching the single-junction theoretical maximum efficiency of 29.4%, the authors say.
Research is still needed, they note, to develop high-temperature, selective area passivating contacts on both sides of the PV cell (“advanced TOPCon”), to improve the transparency and conductivity of heterojunction technology (HJT) contacts (“advanced HJT”), and to combine the latest HJT or TOPCon technologies with an interdigitated back contact (IBC) structure, “which could reach an ultimate practical efficiency of 28% possibly as soon as 2025.”
Yet as the theoretical limit is approached, “several new modes of degradation, called carrier-induced degradation, and metastable defects are unveiled,” the authors say.
The industry “is working to reduce or eliminate” the use of scarce materials such as silver for the formation of grid lines and indium used in transparent conductive oxides, the authors say. Several PV companies and research laboratories have announced HJT PV cell design with reduced indium consumption “or even indium-free” HJT cells.
Tandem technology
Many technologies for tandem solar cells have been proposed to overcome the single-junction efficiency limit, the authors say.
Development of monolithic 2-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem cells, “considered by many as the most probable and cost-effective solution,” is currently the most active research area, and has already yielded a record cell efficiency of 33.7% for a small-area (1 square centimeter) cell.
For a 30% efficient 2-terminal tandem cell, “the efficiency of the top cell is significantly more critical than the efficiency of the bottom cell,” so “a potential contender as a bottom cell” would include “almost any” silicon cell technology.
While “there is no doubt” that efficiencies greater than 30% will soon be commercially available on large-area cells, “stability still needs to be improved,” the authors say. To reach the same levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as established “bankable” technologies, “the tandem device may only degrade less than 0.5% per year.”
Cadmium telluride
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV technology accounts for 25% of installed U.S. utility-scale PV, but only 5% of global market share. The researchers projected, based on a First Solar cell with arsenic-doped material that reached 22.3% efficiency, that Cd(Se,Te) cells doped with a Group V material “will become the primary platform for research, development and manufacturing.”
CIGS
Turning to CIGS technology, whose original formulation used copper, indium, gallium and selenium, the authors say that the combination of CIGS in tandem applications is “one major focus of future developments.” CIGS tandem devices “are not limited to pairing CIGS with perovskites,” they add, as “they may be made with numerous materials including CdTe-, Si-, or CIGS-based alloys with different band gaps.”
Multi-junction III-V
Multi-junction III-V PV cells are described by the U.S. Department of Energy as cells that can reach efficiencies over 45% by using multiple bandgaps, or junctions, that are each tuned to absorb a specific region of the solar spectrum. Multi-junction III-V PV cells could enable “significant space-based power generation,” the authors say.
The article, written by five scientists from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory and five others from First Solar and research institutes in Germany, the U.S. and China, is titled “Photovoltaic device innovation for a solar future.”
Three of the co-authors contributed to an article in the journal Science earlier this year titled “Photovoltaics at multi-terawatt scale: Waiting is not an option.”

A hybrid inverter combines a solar inverter and battery inverter into one unit, designed for a simple pairing with rooftop solar-plus-storage systems.
The inverters include a 4.6 kW power output, 6.9 kW solar input model and a larger 9.6 kW power output, 15 kW solar input model, making them right-sized for most rooftop residential solar arrays. Both products support a maximum PV voltage of up to 660 V.
Aims Power’s inverters have a CEC rated efficiency of 97%. It has a generator input for backup power rated at 240 Vac. The customizable DC input allows for pairing with both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries.
Users can control the inverter with a mobile app to remotely monitor production, track energy usage, battery levels, and system performance. It can be configured to operate electrical loads on just solar, just the battery, or both, and can be optimized around net metering, load share, battery back up, grid tie or off-grid operations. A 5 inch LCD screen is installed on the inverter for ease-of-operation.
“Where the Aims Power Hybrid Inverter makes an immediate impact is in its ability to be programmed to do exactly what you want it to do.,” said Aims Power. “Think of an orchestra without a conductor. It may have all the talent and potential in the world, but without a way to organize and direct it, you may as well listen to radio static. Aims Power Hybrid Inverter is essentially the conductor for every source of power that you have in your house.”
The inverter has achieved UL 1741-SA, CSA 22.2 No.107-01, UL1998, and UL1699B certifications for safety and are IP65 NEMA4X rated for outdoor installation. Both inverters are warrantied for 10 years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/22/solar-racking-company-esdec-eyes-5-billion-valuation-ahead-of-planned-ipo/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,RACKING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 22, 2023",Solar racking company ESDEC eyes $5 billion valuation ahead of planned IPO,"Solar racking conglomerate ESDEC is reportedly targeting a $5 billion valuation in preparation for its initial public offering (IPO), following significant acquisition-driven growth in the U.S. and Europe.
According to a report from Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have been hired to manage the process, and is adding further banks to the IPO syndicate
Dutch-based ESDEC has built an impressive solar racking portfolio via a series of strategic acquisitions in the U.S., after making similar purchases in Europe. To date, the firm has bought out four key U.S. racking entities: Ecofasten in November 2018, Ironridge & Quickmount in September 2019, and PanelClaw in November 2020. Notably, in 2020, Quickmount shifted its manufacturing facilities to China.

In 2018, Rivean Capital, a leading European private equity investor, made its first investment in ESDEC, propelling the solar group’s acquisition momentum. Last year, in a significant transaction, Blackstone, dubbed the world’s largest real estate developer and alternative asset manager, alongside Rivean Capital, acquired the ESDEC group, cementing its position in the burgeoning solar market.
This joint acquisition drew close attention from European regulatory bodies. Blackstone emphasized that such strategic acquisitions played a vital role in its growth, as evidenced by the company’s yearly sales leap from approximately €30 million ($28.9 million) in the Benelux regions to €500 million across three continents. The purchase was finalized by the end of 2022. As part of the recent transaction, Rivean Capital not only realized its original investment in ESDEC but also reinvested into the company, demonstrating their continued faith in ESDEC’s potential.
Highlighting the rationale behind the ESDEC purchase, Blackstone’s Senior Marketing Director of Private Equity, Bilal Khan, stated:
We believe this partnership with ESDEC is going to allow access to reliable, low-cost rooftop solar solutions for other businesses Blackstone invests in, creating an opportunity to generate value for Esdec and drive decarbonization across our portfolio.
Blackstone has made multiple investments in the solar industry. The company offered development and construction credit to commercial solar developer Altus Power, put several billion into utility scale developer Invenergy, and launched a $100 billion sustainable credit platform.
