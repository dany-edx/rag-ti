Cleantech Solar, a supplier of renewable energy to corporate entities, has secured a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with US module manufacturer First Solar. It has agreed to construct 150 MW of solar and 16.8 MW of wind-generating assets in India, supplying around 7.3 GWh of clean electricity to First Solar’s new 3.3 GW vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Once it is fully commissioned by the third quarter of 2024, the solar and wind generation assets are expected to cover up to 70% of the facility’s anticipated electricity needs. They are expected to displace almost 7,000 kilotons of CO2 emissions over the duration of the PPA.
Cleantech Solar will procure 150 MW of advanced, India-made Series 7 thin-film solar panels from First Solar, for use in the PV component of the project. The modules are expected to be delivered in the first half of 2024.
First Solar’s cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film modules have among the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV modules. The modules are included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) registry for sustainable electronics, signifying strong performance on metrics evaluating the management of substances in the product, manufacturing energy and water use, product packaging, end-of-life recycling and corporate responsibility.
“Our new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu sets a high benchmark for responsible and sustainable vertically integrated solar manufacturing, not just in India, but globally,” said Sujoy Ghosh, vice president and managing director of First Solar India. “By powering our operations with clean, renewably-generated electricity, we are working to further reduce our environmental footprint, which is already the lowest in the industry.”
First Solar’s Tamil Nadu plant, located in an area of high baseline water stress, is purportedly the world’s first net-zero water withdrawal solar manufacturing facility.
“This collaboration extends beyond powering First Solar’s flagship manufacturing facility in India; it involves leveraging their advanced, ultra-low carbon thin film solar panels to energize our solar assets,” said Sachin Jain, chief executive officer of Cleantech Solar.
With this latest agreement, Cleantech Solar’s total portfolio in Tamil Nadu now stands at nearly 500 MW (including solar, wind and hybrid power projects under operational and construction stages).
Singapore-based Cleantech Solar has built numerous solar and wind projects across India and Southeast Asia, with around 1.2 GWp of assets in various stages of development. The company is backed by Keppel Corp., Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund, and Shell Singapore.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/04/the-largest-solar-facility-in-wisconsin-is-now-active/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WISCONSIN",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 4, 2024",The largest solar facility in Wisconsin is now active,"Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) and We Energies, two utilities operating in Wisconsin, announced that the state’s largest solar facility is now active. 
The Bader Hollow Solar Farm is a 300 MW facility that was built in two 150 MW phases in Iowa County, Wisconsin. The first phase was activated in 2021, while the second phase began powering homes and businesses in the state in December 2023. 
The facility, comprised of 830,000 solar modules, is large enough to power the equivalent of 90,000 homes. The tracker-mounted project includes bifacial panels, enabling the solar panels to absorb light from above, and from reflected light from below. 
Bifacial panels are particularly beneficial in northern climates that have frequent snowfall. With a high albedo, or reflectivity, snow makes for a higher level of production on the back face of a panel. 
“From frigid winter mornings through the hottest summer days, Badger Hollow Solar Park will play an important role in helping us deliver affordable, reliable and clean energy,” said Scott Lauber, president and chief executive officer, We Energies. 
The project resulted from collaboration between the two utilities. The second phase is jointly owned by the two, with WE Energies owning 100 MW and MGE owning 50 MW. We Energies sister company, Wisconsin Public Service (WPS), owns 100 MW of the first phase of the park, and MGE owns the other 50 MW. 
The facility spans about 3,500 acres. In April 2019, WPS and MGE purchased and acquired 150 MW of the Badger Hollow solar farm and the electrical tie in line for about $194 million. The facility is expected to employ 17 full-time staff members. 
MGE said the project will help it make progress towards achieving 80% fewer carbon emissions from electricity use by 2030. The company generates and distributes electricity to over 160,000 customers in Wisconsin. Headquartered in Madison, the company posted a net income of $111 million in 2022.
Community solar
In addition to utility-scale projects like Badger Hollow, community-scale solar projects are expected to help Wisconsin grow its renewable energy economy.
According to Renew Wisconsin, 50% of Wisconsin households can’t access solar energy because they live in apartments, are renters or lack the appropriate roof. The Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) wants to fill this resource gap. In 2022, it asked Forward Analytics to explore the economic benefits of investing in community solar infrastructure across the state.
“Based on the analysis here, construction and operation of the proposed solar facilities, which would generate 1.75 gigawatts of electricity per year when all facilities are operating, would contribute an estimated $2.49 billion of economic activity in Wisconsin,” said the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/04/contact-lens-manufacturer-safeguards-operations-with-rooftop-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 4, 2024",Contact lens manufacturer safeguards operations with rooftop solar,"A contact lens manufacturer in California is expected to cut costs considerably while boosting the uptime and resilience of its operations by installing a rooftop solar microgrid. 
Staar Surgical inaugurated a 1.1 MW grid-tied microgrid on its production facility in Lake Forest, California. The array is expected to lead to $325,000 in annual electricity bill savings while including the added benefit of energy resilience under conditions where the central utility grid is impacted. 
Solar contractor ReVamp Energy designed, installed and will maintain the microgrid, which includes battery energy storage. 
The microgrid is powered by a 780 kW rooftop array coupled with SolarEdge DC-optimized inverters. The remaining capacity is installed on two newly-constructed carports. The 1,752 module system is expected to cut the contact lens manufacturer’s electricity costs by about 50%. 
Moreover, the company is expected to prevent costs incurred by spoiled production runs, which can occur when the power goes out during the manufacturing process.  
“Manufacturing contact lenses is a highly energy-intensive process that requires each lens to be heated in an industrial kiln continuously for several days. Any reduction in power of more than a few seconds has the potential to ruin an entire production run, leading to losses of potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars,” said Jay Cutting, president, ReVamp Energy. 
Excess solar production will be stored by a 450 kW battery that is expected to range between eight and 24 hours of backup power, depending on the facility’s load requirements. The system also included a generator to ensure Starr Surgical can maintain production. 
ReVamp Energy designed custom-made switchgear that will automatically switch the site’s energy supply to back-up power in the event of a power outage. The microgrid is manageable via the SolarEdge monitoring platform which will enable Staar Surgical and ReVamp Energy to track a variety of key parameters like solar energy production, consumption and battery energy levels in real-time and from a single platform. 
“We have worked with Staar Surgical on several solar installations and for each one we have used SolarEdge technology – it is a key component of realizing the client’s requirement for high energy production, reliability, and intelligent control,” said Cutting. “This starts with the use of power optimizers to pull more power from the solar arrays, and extends through to the generation of highly-granular performance data that will enable us to operate and maintain not just the solar installation, but the entire microgrid, in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/04/direct-energy-to-power-boston-community-choice-electricity-program/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"JANUARY 4, 2024",Direct Energy to power Boston Community Choice Electricity program,"Direct Energy, a renewables and energy-related service provider, plans to expand its offering to over 200,000 households and businesses as the new supplier of Boston Community Choice Electricity (BCCE). The program allows the city to purchase clean electricity in bulk from a competitive supplier (Direct Energy) to service Boston residents.
The default service offered by BCCE provides an estimated savings of about 15% when compared with traditional Boston utilities.
Community choice programs, sometimes called community choice aggregation (CCA), defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are programs that allow local governments to procure electric power on behalf of their residents, businesses, and municipal accounts from an alternative supplier while still receiving grid services from their utility. The benefit of these programs is that they help communities exercise control over their electricity sources, demand more green power and negotiate lower electricity prices. Demand aggregation gives communities greater leverage when conducting these negotiations.
The initiative is central to the city’s Climate Action Plan, which aims to make Boston carbon neutral by 2025 by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and energy supply systems, in addition to buildings.
The three products offered under the BCCE include the Optional Basic Program, which costs about $0.14/kWh and gives customers 24% renewable energy. The Standard (default) service costs about $0.15/kWh and provides 39% renewable energy. Lastly, the Optional Green 100 tier costs $0.17/kWh and offers users 100% renewable energy. All offerings are available through December 2025.
The default service and Optional Green 100 tier provide customers with more renewable energy electricity at a lower cost than Boston’s Basic Service; this includes utilities such as Eversource, National Grid and Unitil.
According to the official website of the City of Boston, Eversource recently filed its proposed new Residential Basic Service rate ($0.17/kWh) and Small Business rate (about $0.18/kWh) with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. While the rates came into effect at the start of this year, BCCE’s default offering offers a 15% lower rate while providing consumers 62.5% more Massachusetts Class I renewable power. The latter includes electricity generated from solar panels, solar thermal electric and wind energy facilities that started operating after 1997.
Moreover, the Optional Green 100 provides 100% Massachusetts Class I renewable electricity to consumers, which Direct Energy states is more than three times the state’s annual Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for utilities provided at a cheaper rate. The Database for State Incentives and Renewables Efficiency lists Massachusetts Class I RPS for utilities as being 40% renewable by 2030 and increasing by 1% yearly after that.
Users who subscribe to the service can join BCCE by calling Eversource, asking them to remove their supply block, then enrolling in the program online. Previous BCCE customers looking to opt out of the program or move up or down tiers can do so anytime. Residents who don’t opt out of the program are automatically registered to receive the default product. Moreover, new BCCE customers will receive a mailed notification each quarter, which allows them to switch tiers or opt-out.
Direct Energy is one of North America’s largest electricity and natural gas suppliers, among other energy services. Moreover, the organization states it operates in eight provinces in Canada and all 50 states, including the District of Columbia. The company reports that it has almost 4 million customer relationships and 3,000 employees.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/04/indoor-bifacial-solar-cell-technology-at-ces-2024/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 4, 2024",Indoor bifacial solar cell technology at CES 2024,"At CES 2024, taking place Jan. 9 to 12 in Las Vegas, Ambient Photonics will demonstrate the abilities of the company’s first bifacial solar cell. The Low-Light Indoor Bifacial Solar Cell harvests indoor light energy from the back and front of the solar cell simultaneously and can be used in remote controls and other connected devices.
Ambient Photonics reports that its low-light energy harvesting photovoltaic can generate as much as three times more power than conventional technology. Its cells are made using an industrial printing process through which proprietary energy harvesting molecules are applied to thin and durable glass substrates to create cells of virtually any size and shape, the company says.
Ambient’s metal-free, synthetic organic dyes have tunable electronic and optical properties, enabling the solar cells, the company says, to perform in any indoor light including compact fluorescent, halogen, LED, incandescent and diffuse or shaded natural light. Designed to replace batteries, Ambient says that manufacturers can create much smaller and lighter products.
“Solar power has long been an option for certain low-power electronics like calculators or toys, but it’s taken breakthrough science from Ambient Photonics to develop high-performance solar cell technology for mass-market devices.” said Bates Marshall, Ambient Photonics’ co-founder & CEO.

With the bifacial solar cell, light power is harvested from two sides. Ambient reports that the front side delivers 100% of the power that Ambient cells are known for, while the back side delivers at least 50% of the energy as the front side.
At CES 2024, Ambient will be showing consumer electronics that are powered by the Ambient solar cells including remote controls from Universal Electronics and a wireless keyboard from Chicony. Ambient is also working with E Ink to integrate solar cells into next-generation electronic shelf labels. Ambient Photonics will conduct side-by-side demonstrations at CES of its standard and bifacial DSSC solutions, showing how remote controls can harvest three times more power than amorphous silicon cells and 1.5 times more power than single-sided DSSC devices.
Ambient Photonics produces its indoor solar cells in a new state-of-the-art 43,000-square-foot Fab 1 manufacturing facility in Scotts Valley, California. The automated facility uses a unique fabrication process that allows it to print solar cells in virtually any size and shape, the company reports, estimating that its Fab 1 facility is capable of producing tens of millions of units a year. Ambient plans to break ground on a second, U.S.-based smart manufacturing facility in 2025 to meet growing demand for its technology.
Ambient Photonics was founded in 2019 and the technology was developed at the Warner Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry and funded at inception by Cthulhu Ventures LLC. The company secured $31 million in Series A financing for a solar cell production facility, led by Amazon through its Climate Pledge Fund, and Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Fine Structure Ventures, I Squared Capital and Tony Fadell’s Future Shape.

The 150 MW, 300 MWh system is among the largest BESS projects in the U.S. 
Spearmint broke ground in December 2022 on Revolution in partnership with Mortenson, the EPC on the project. Sungrow Power Supply provided the PowerTitan series to the project, which is located within a wind and solar hub in the Lower Colorado River Authority’s transmission network. The PowerTitan is a liquid cooled energy storage system that uses lithium iron phosphate battery cells and a liquid cooling system.
In October 2023, Spearmint announced the close of a $92 million tax equity investment by Greenprint Capital Management, marking what Spearmint reports one of the first applications of the Investment Tax Credit structure for a standalone battery energy storage system following the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act.
During construction, Mortenson employed 34 team members and trade partners who, in approximately 42,000 working hours, installed 134 battery containers containing 6,432 battery modules, as well as 45 power conversion system units. Spearmint reports that revolution was completed on schedule, within budget and with a clean safety record.
“The project’s completion marks a major milestone for Spearmint as we cement our position as a leader in Texas’ fast-growing battery storage market,” said Andrew Waranch, founder, president, and chief executive officer of Spearmint Energy.
Spearmint is also developing three additional BESS projects, known collectively as Nomadic. The three have a combined capacity of 900 MW / 2,000 MWh. The projects are located in Cooke, Galveston and Brazoria counties and were acquired in March of 2023. Spearmint anticipates that the first project within the portfolio will reach notice to proceed in early 2024 and begin commercial operation within 12 to 18 months.
