While other states may have higher portions of wind in their electricity mix, at full sun the output of solar panels in California rivals that of Texas wind power. It has often been the first state in the nation to pass policies that drive the move to renewable energy and electrification, and these policies are regularly imitated elsewhere. As a result California has been a pioneer for a range of clean energy technologies.
California has also been the first to experience the challenges of the transition. The state is famous for its “duck curve,” where solar floods the grid in mid-day and forces other sources of power to ramp quickly in the evening to meet demand when the sun goes down. The responses to this and other challenges in California have taken many forms—including an emphasis on demand response and using imports and gas plants more flexibly. It has also meant a lot of batteries.

California has long been the nation’s leading market for both battery storage, and “solar plus storage” solutions. But PV Intel’s examination of the interconnection queue from California’s grid operator shows that in terms of large-scale projects, this transformation is reaching another stage. California is on the cusp of no longer being a solar market where batteries are being added—instead, it is becoming a battery market that (sometimes) includes solar.
Rapid battery growth
The numbers are stark: at the end of January the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) queue included a total of 282 projects with a solar component (including various hybrids of solar+storage & solar+wind), compared to 533 projects with a battery component. The raw capacities tell the same story: At 135 gigawatts (GW) the capacity of battery projects is 78% higher than the 76 GW of solar projects.
These numbers underscore the very rapid growth of battery technology in California. According to the American Clean Power Association, California had only 256 MW of utility-scale batteries before 2020, but had reached 2.1 GW by the end of 2021—an 8x increase.
In fact, few standalone solar projects are being proposed anymore. We found only 23 solar projects in the queue that don’t include batteries, meaning that more than 90% of solar projects that have applied for interconnection have a battery component.
This is in stark contrast to other grid operator queues, where solar + storage projects are still niche. The most advanced may be ISO-New England, where in January 30% of total active solar projects were paired with batteries. In Texas (ERCOT) there is also substantial battery capacity in the interconnection queue, but it is not clear how much is paired with solar.
Chocolate and Peanut Butter—or Just Peanut Butter?
When pairing generation, solar and batteries are still the main choice in California, as the “chocolate and peanut butter” combination of the energy transition. The 256 solar + storage projects representing 72 gigawatts of solar and 64 gigawatts of batteries make up the vast majority of hybrid projects in the CAISO queue, with only a handful of wind + storage or solar + wind projects. 
Another notable factor is the size of the batteries. Gone are the days when small batteries were added to solar projects. The average ratio of battery capacity to solar capacity was .89. Nor are the standalone battery projects small; the average capacity of a standalone battery project in the CAISO queue is 248 MW.
In terms of projects with interconnection agreements—a subset of projects which are more likely to be completed and to come online more quickly—solar + storage is still dominant.  76 solar + storage projects are approved for interconnection, as opposed to 31 standalone battery projects. 
But the large majority of this capacity is scheduled to come online in 2022 and 2023. This means that with new projects getting approved, as early as 2024 the market could flip to standalone battery projects being dominant.
The Era of the Battery
This is not to imply that all the energy storage projects that will be built are batteries. Notably there is a 500 MW pumped hydroelectric project in California that has an interconnection agreement and is scheduled to come online in 2028; the long-term plans of California utilities show 1 GW of “long-duration storage,” which implications that this will be pumped hydro.
But the capacities of pumped hydro and other novel storage technologies planned are dwarfed by batteries, with lithium-ion continuing to dominate the market. And as a recent solicitation by California’s community choice aggregators shows, lithium-ion batteries are even being chosen for long-duration storage needs.
California will need all the energy storage it can get its hands on; a recent analysis suggests that the state needs 37 GW of batteries over the next 20 years, as well as 53.2 GW of utility-scale solar. But the projects that are being planned put the state well on its way; as 23.5 GW of large-scale battery projects already have interconnection agreements. The next few years will see whether or not California’s battery market can overcome supply chain challenges and stand on its own. But the path forward is clear. In California, the energy transition has entered a new era: the era of the battery.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/11/rocket-lab-unveils-space-solar-cell-with-33-3-efficiency/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 11, 2022",Rocket Lab unveils space solar cell with 33.3% efficiency,"US-based aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider Rocket Lab USA Inc has presented a new space-grade solar cell based on a cell technology developed by space solar cell maker Solaero, which it acquired in December.
The new product, dubbed IMM-β, is an evolution of Solaero’s inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cell, based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) and developed by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
“The IMM-β solar cell is expected to be the highest-efficiency space solar cell technology in high-volume production,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The cell boasts an average 33.3% beginning of life (BOL) efficiency, up from 32% for the IMM-α that is currently in volume production.”
According to Solaero’s website, the IMM-α solar cell has a thickness of 150μm and a mass of 49mg/cm2, which represents a 42% reduction as compared to conventional multi-junction, space-grade solar cells.
The new cell can be used in applications in the civil, military and commercial space markets. “The IMM-β is also a radiation-hard cell with a power remaining factor of 87% after exposure to 1-MeV electrons at a fluence of 1E15 e/cm2 or equivalent of about 15 years life,” Rocket Lab stated. “Now undergoing final space qualification testing, the cells are expected to be ready for commercial use later in 2022.”
“In partnership with our colleagues at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), we’re not only commercializing the world’s highest efficiency and lightest weight space solar cell, we’re doing so at the most competitive cost of any IMM technology to date. IMM-β’s impact on solar array and launch mass will make it a compelling option for satellite integrators,” said Solaero CEO Brad Clevenger.
Solaero operates an 11,000m² manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where it produces different kinds of space solar cells.
These include a 30%-efficient four-junction device on a germanium substrate; a 30.2%-efficient triple-junction solar cell optimized for low earth orbit (LEO) applications; a 29.5%-efficient, standard triple-junction cell based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge); a 29.4%-efficient triple-junction device based on a germanium substrate; and the above-mentioned IMM-α cell, with an efficiency of 32%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/11/indiana-makes-it-harder-for-hoas-to-ban-solar/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 11, 2022",Indiana makes it harder for HOAs to ban solar,"Indiana passed legislation, House Bill 1196, which makes it considerably more difficult for Homeowners Associations (HOA) to prohibit residents from adding solar installations to their homes.
The law states that any homeowner who is a member of a HOA that has codified rules (adopted or amended after 2019) or previously ruled that solar installations may not be installed within the community, can petition other homeowners association members for approval to install a solar energy system on the homeowner’s dwelling unit or property.
After providing the members that they are petitioning with some required project and property specifications, they can collect signatures of approving members. If collected signatures exceed 65% of members, or the expressed amount of signatures needed to ratify an amendment under the HOA’s existing rules, the homeowner must then present the signatures and project and property information to the HOA board of directors. The board of directors, an architectural review committee, or an architectural control committee of the HOA may not deny the homeowner’s request to install the solar energy system once the signatures have been collected.
Projects may still be denied for legitimate siting and technical concerns, or if the HOA is responsible for the maintenance of the roof intended for installation. While these technical grounds for denial may exist, the law still opens up development to the nearly 400 HOAs have full or partial solar prohibitions in central Indiana alone. In many cases, the HOAs institute these policies under the guise of “maintaining community aesthetics” or to protect the value of homes in the community. A 2019 Zillow report found that homes with residential solar systems sold for 4.1% more than their non-solar neighbors.
Moreover, research from Michigan Technological University found that grid-tied solar owners subsidize their non-PV neighbors. Solar homeowners also help utilities avoid making many infrastructure investments, and shave peak demand when electricity is the most expensive.
The researchers also found that grid-tied PV-owning utility customers largely are under-compensated for their neighborliness. That’s because the value of solar eclipses both the net metering and two-tiered rates that many utilities pay for solar electricity. The research is published online for any interested parties.
This is not the first initiative of its kind to be introduced in Indiana, with proposed legislation on HOAs and solar panels in beginning in 2017.
In August 2021, Illinois passed similar legislation to House Bill 1196. That legislation rescinded the ability of community associations to ban members from installing solar on certain areas of their homes. The associations can still determine the specific configuration of said installation, so long as that decision does not lower the system’s annual estimated generation output by more than 10%. The law also significantly cut down the amount of time that association members have to wait for a response once filing their application for approval of a system with their association.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/11/the-solar-tech-check-pv-in-space-and-thin-films-stride-forward/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 11, 2022","The Solar Tech Check: PV in space, and thin films stride forward","In the United States, a three-year project investigating causes of voltage loss in cadmium selenide telluride thin films published its discovery of a new way to measure and track the mechanisms causing voltage loss within a device.
Working both with modules produced in the lab at Colorado State University, and by Ohio headquartered manufacturer First Solar, the group measured a characteristic called external radiative efficiency, that allowed it to better understand mechanisms behind voltage loss. “We learned that the main mechanism limiting voltage is not necessarily linked to defects within the bulk of the cell nor at the interfaces between different materials comprising the cell,” says Arthur Onno, assistant research professor at Arizona State University, who led the research. “That’s usually what is assumed in the CadTel community. But instead, it’s an issue with selectivity, which is when electrons within the cell go the wrong way and cancel each other.”
The group has published an explanation of the method and its use for a full analysis of CdTe devices in Nature Energy. With a fuller understanding of what limits the voltage, they were also able to suggest doping and other approaches to achieve higher efficiencies. The group also states that its measurement approach could also be applied to other cell materials including silicon and perovskites, and that it is already working on industrial applications. “We’re also focused on getting this technology into the hands of industry,” says Zachary Holman, an associate professor of electrical engineering in the Fulton Schools. “We have already built replicates of this measurement technique for a couple of domestic solar cell and module manufacturers.”
Ahead of a planned launch in August, NASA this week announced that it has completed the construction of the solar arrays that will power its Psyche spacecraft on a 2.4 billion kilometer mission to study a metal-rich asteroid.
“Seeing the spacecraft fully assembled for the first time is a huge accomplishment; there’s a lot of pride,” said Brian Bone, who leads assembly, test, and launch operations for the mission at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “This is the true fun part. You’re feeling it all come together. You feel the energy change and shift.”
After launch, the solar arrays will deploy, and provide all of the power for the spacecraft’s 3.5-year journey to the asteroid, located between Mars and Jupiter. The cross-shaped solar arrays measure 75 meters, and with them fully deployed the spacecraft is roughly the size of a tennis court. Near Earth, the full array’s capacity is around 21kW, but this will be reduced to just 2kW closer to the mission’s destination. “These arrays are designed to work in low-light conditions, far away from the Sun,” explained Peter Lord, Psyche technical director at Maxar Technologies where the panels were designed.
While NASA is preparing to launch a foldable solar array into space later this year, research continues into making these cells even more powerful, as well as lighter and flexible – to potentially allow an array to roll up into an even smaller space before deployment.
Working with high efficiency materials used in solar cells for space and satellite applications, scientists led by Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE simulated various cell designs, each based on a flexible triple junction layer approximately 10 microns thick. The cells were divided into three ‘generations’ and tested under “AM0” irradiation, to represent the light spectrum outside of Earth’s atmosphere, before and after being particle irradiation similar to what the cells would be exposed to in space. The cells and testing process are described in full in a paper published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“The power-to-mass ratios of the presented solar cells of 3.0 W/g [before irradiation, or beginning of life] and 2.6 W/g [after irradiation, or end of life] are already three to four times higher compared with space solar cells on thin germanium substrates and can compete with best published values for thin-film solar cells,” the group says, further noting that its fabrication process is based on a reusable substrate, with potential for further cost reduction.
Scientists in Spain and the UK worked with silver-bismuth-disulfide (AgBiS2), to fabricate a device less than 1000 nanometers thick. Their devices achieved 8.85% efficiency certified by an accredited lab in the US, and themselves measured a top efficiency of 9.17%.
While silver is a rare and expensive material to work with, the group noted that other thin-film solar technologies rely on rare materials such as indium or tellurium, and their approach uses no toxic materials and does not require temperatures higher than 100 C, bringing potential for low-cost manufacturing.
The cells are described in full in a paper published in Nature Photonics. Key to fabricating a device so thin was a mild annealing process that allowed them to engineer particle distribution on the surface of the device, and optimize its light absorption properties. The group says it will now work on further optimizations to reach higher efficiency. “the devices reported in this study set a record among low-temperature and solution processed, environmentally friendly inorganic solar cells in terms of stability, form factor and performance,” said Gerasimos Konstantatos, professor at the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology. “We are thrilled with the results and will continue to proceed in this line of study to exploit their intriguing properties in photovoltaics as well as other optoelectronic devices”.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/11/survey-said-a-majority-of-homeowners-want-to-go-solar-but-up-front-costs-are-a-deterrent/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 11, 2022","Survey said a majority of homeowners want to go solar, but up-front costs are a deterrent","A recent survey conducted by Rocket Homes, a national platform for homebuyers, found that 66.5% of those who don’t have solar on their homes are interested in getting it in the future.
To understand homeowner interest in and experience with residential solar power, Rocket Homes surveyed 2,096 homeowners across the US. Nearly 30% of respondents say they already have solar panels or solar shingles or are in the process of getting them.
Those who purchased their homes recently are far more likely to have solar: Only 9.7% of those who purchased prior to 2000 have solar, versus 35.3% of those who purchase in the past two years.
Reasons given for wanting to go solar include lowering their electric bill, being eco-friendly, cost payback, the reliability of the electricity, and to reduce or eliminate reliance on the local utility. While payback for system owners varies widely, according to Rocket Homes data, homes with solar are nearly 25% more likely to sell for more than the asking price and spend 13.3% less time on the market.
While 90.7% of respondents said their reason to go solar was to lower their electric bills, it didn’t seem to matter whether the respondents had high electric bills or not. 53.2% of those paying $60 or less a month for electricity showed interest in going solar, and 69.2% who pay more than 200 are interested in putting solar on their homes.
What’s keeping many from going solar? Nearly 75% said it’s the upfront costs, and another 43.8% said the costs of solar outweighs the benefits. Additionally, over 40% said they’d need to upgrade their roof before a solar installation, so that added cost was also a deterrent.
Around half the respondents indicated that financial assistance, tax incentives, grants, or good financing options would motivate them to go solar. While incentives do exist on the federal level and in some states and local jurisdictions, it seems that educating homeowners on existing solar assistance and potential financing options could help homeowners overcome the financial barrier.
A recent SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report estimates that passage of some form of the Build Back Better Act with a long-term investment tax credit could boost US residential solar installations by 20%. Uncertainty around net metering policies is also stalling residential solar. In California in particular, Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the passage of NEM 3.0 could cut residential solar installations by half.

The 219,000 square foot facility is expected to reach operations in Q2 2022.
The facility is expected to double the company’s manufacturing capacity. It said the new space will allow it to introduce new innovations to the BOS space.
“Our new facility will allow us to optimize our manufacturing lines to increase operational efficiency, expand production capacity and bring new innovations to market to deliver even more value to our customers,” said Jason Whitaker, CEO of Shoals Technologies Group. “Furthermore, the new facility gives us a significant footprint for the growth of new product lines, especially our Fuel by Shoals® eMobility solutions for electric vehicle charging, which deliver a more simple, reliable, and scalable way to deploy EV charging systems.”
Shoals posted its Q4 2021 results, showing record profits and gross margin. Full-year gross margin for 2021 was 38.8%, and orders nearly doubled year-over-year to a record $299 million. Revenues for its systems solutions increased 29% year-over-year for Q4 2021.
Revenue and gross profit grew 21% and 24% respectively over 2020’s reported figures. Adjusted EDBITA grew modestly, as the company made investments in human capital, international expansion, and a new EV business unit.
“While demand for our products is accelerating, the current environment is dynamic and we are closely monitoring our supply chain, labor costs, materials costs and logistics availability,” said Whitaker.
Fourth quarter revenues totaled $48 million, up from $38.8 million in the previous year’s quarter. Income from operations was $2.2 million, and net loss was $2.2 million. This compares to the previous Q4 income from operations of $7.2 million and a net gain of $4.2 million. The figures are not directly comparable, as because prior to its IPO, the Company was organized as a tax flow-through partnership rather than a corporation and did not record income taxes. Basic and diluted loss per share was $(0.04).
Shoals said at least half of the solar energy projects installed in the US in 2020 used its products.

Duke’s proposed Net Metering 2.0 rule change in North Carolina meets stiff opposition Add North Carolina to the list of states considering changes to net metering rules, as Duke Energy proposes shifting costs to solar customers.
Without federal support, US would only reach 39% of carbon-free energy sector by 2035, said Wood Mackenzie Without important federal measures like the Build Back Better reconciliation bill, the investment tax credit long-term extension, and US manufacturing support, Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said the US will fall short of goals.
Indiana enables renewable-ready communities With the passage of SB 411, Indiana communities can opt to voluntarily adopt regulations that will qualify them as a wind- or solar-ready community. The standards are expected to significantly cut project development time, lower costs, and create thousands of jobs in the clean energy industries.
Charge EVs at work, not home, to put daytime solar power to work Workplace EV chargers, which number only 10,000 in the US, are needed for charging EVs in regions with abundant solar generation, says an RMI study. Home chargers are fine in regions with high wind generation, to enable nighttime charging with wind power.
Renewable advocates urge regulators to reject fixed charge for shared solar program The Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Hearing Examiner has proposed a requirement for residential shared solar customers to pay a $55 minimum bill each month, which opponents claim will dramatically limit program participation.
Solar+food in ethanol fields could fully power the United States Converting the nation’s 40 million acres of ethanol corn farms into solar-plus-food facilities would generate 1.5 times our nation’s electricity needs, while also powering a 100% electrified passenger vehicle fleet.
