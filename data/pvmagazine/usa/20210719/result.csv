Although lithium-ion batteries are already powering various devices that we rely on every day and their presence in vehicles and on electricity grids is rapidly increasing, the technology still has a few shortfalls when it comes to performance and longevity.
Much of the research that’s underway into improving today’s battery technologies is focused on working with new materials, also keeping in supply chain and environmental concerns related to several commonly investigated materials. But whatever material is used, sophisticated new techniques allowing scientists to observe mechanisms at work within the battery in minute detail will be essential to understanding where the issues that hold back performance are occurring, and how to get around them.
Two separate studies have used such techniques to examine the role of oxygen in lithium-ion battery performance.
It was already known that as the battery charges and discharges, tiny amounts of oxygen are released. But the tiny scale of this process makes it difficult to observe, and the wider effects of oxygen loss are not well understood.
“The total amount of oxygen leakage, over 500 cycles of battery charging and discharging, is 6%,” said Peter Csernica, a scientist at Stanford University who worked on one of the studies. “That’s not such a small number, but if you try to measure the amount of oxygen that comes out during each cycle, it’s about one one-hundredth of a percent.”
In the study led by Stanford University, the group sliced open battery electrodes after cycling and scanned samples using an x-ray microscope; and combined this with computational imaging to observe the structure at the nanoscale. They also shot x-rays through whole electrodes, to confirm that their observations at the nanoscale could be applied to the full component. Results of this analysis have been published in Nature Energy. The group found that oxygen is initially released in a “burst” from the surface, and then a slower “trickle” from deeper inside the cathode.
And, they found that the release of oxygen fundamentally alters the structure of the cathode. When oxygen leaves, surrounding manganese, nickel and cobalt atoms migrate as all of the atoms dance out of their ideal positions. “This rearrangement of metal ions, along with chemical changes caused by the missing oxygen, degrades the voltage and efficiency of the battery over time,” said Stanford associate professor William Chueh. “People have known aspects of this phenomenon for a long time, but the mechanism was unclear.”
In a separate study, published in Advanced Energy Materials, scientists led by Japan’s Tohoku University found that, in a cathode based on equal amounts of nickel, cobalt, and manganese, the oxygen release facilitates several unwanted reactions that deteriorate the battery structure. They also found that the presence of highly valent nickel in the cathode led to higher levels of oxygen release, and that the process overall reduces the battery’s ability to hold a balanced charge. (Valence is a measure of an element’s capacity to combine with other atoms).
The findings are expected to led to the further development of high energy-density and robust next-generation batteries composed of transition metal oxides, said Tohoku University researcher Takashi Nakamura.
By highlighting the role played by oxygen in battery degradation and confirming that it may be a more important piece of the puzzle than previously thought, both studies may provide the basis for future work that aims to limit the loss of oxygen during cycling and the damaging effects this has on a battery.

Spotsylvania gained national attention in 2019, not only for being the largest solar installation east of the Rocky Mountains, but because of the staunch opposition it faced locally. Some opposition to the project came from long-discarded arguments relating to the potential leakage toxicity of First Solar’s cadmium telluride PV modules.
These concerns were vocalized in large part by “Concerned Citizens of Spotsylvania County” a “citizens group” which used language and arguments directly copied from other groups and websites that are funded by the coal industry, like the Heritage Foundation, Taxpayer Protection Alliance, SolarSecrets.org, etc.
A more sincere objection was made directly by Spotsylvania citizens, who questioned the project’s scope. These concerns were addressed when county supervisors voted to cap the project at 500 MW, quelling fears that the massive project would end up even bigger than initially planned.
Regardless of the arguments, Spotsylvania Solar is here, at least in part, and the remaining portion of the solar facility is expected to be online by the fall. The project has power purchase agreements in place to sell the energy generated to Apple, Microsoft and the University of Richmond.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/19/supply-chain-issues-are-driving-solar-prices-higher-and-delaying-some-projects-levelten-says/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 19, 2021","Supply chain issues are driving solar prices higher and delaying some projects, LevelTen says","The surge in demand for renewable energy from public and private entities, combined with rising development costs, and structural barriers to entry for new projects put upward pressure on power purchase agreement (PPA) prices during the second quarter, according to LevelTen Energy, a provider of renewable energy transaction infrastructure.
The firm’s PPA Price Index rose 4.3% from between the first and second quarters, and 14.4% year-over-year.
The firm said that solar PPA prices have risen steadily since the beginning of 2020. Prices eased a bit in the most recent quarter, as solar PPA prices rose 0.3% quarter over quarter. Between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, solar PPA prices rose 2.6%.
The firm’s index for solar prices rose 0.3%, to $31.45 per MWh during the second quarter. Year-over-year, the index rose 9.8%, or $2.80 per MWh.
The firm’s index for solar prices rose 0.3%, to $31.45 per MWh during the second quarter.

Despite PPA price increases, the pace of project development will likely continue, the firm said. Around 12% of developer respondents said they were delaying projects; no respondents said they were planning fewer projects.
The firm’s solar index prices ranged from $27.20 in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to $35.90 in PJM in the mid-Atlantic. ERCOT solar prices have risen nearly 10% since the second quarter of 2020, driven by steady quarterly increases in pricing at ERCOT’s North, South, and Houston settlement hubs, the firm said.
Despite the upticks, ERCOT remains the most competitive solar market in the U.S. as abundant land, a unique market structure, and high insolation provide a favorable environment for solar development.
Solar prices in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) region fell during the second quarter, down 4.5% compared to the first quarter. Price volatility was due to a lower volume of solar PPA offers compared to other markets, the firm said. And although CAISO has been an active region for renewables, it is not a leading market for offsite commercial and industrial procurement.
U.S. sanctions against Chinese firms for allegedly violating human rights add pressure to an already constrained solar supply chain, the firm said. It said that developers, construction companies, and module suppliers are shifting their supply chains to meet the high demand for solar while also avoiding “problematic suppliers.” The firm said it expected PPA prices to stabilize as new supply chains emerge.
(Read “SEIA has a ‘strong sense’ that U.S. supply chains are shifting, but hard numbers are scarce.”)
LevelTen said it does not expect rising PPA prices to soften demand in 2021.

And, as the awareness of alleged human rights issues grows, it said that developers “will come under increasing pressure” from stakeholders to ensure the materials for their projects are ethically sourced.
It said that 68% of developer respondents said they were working to improve their practices and tracking related to social and environmental justice as a direct result of buyer preferences.
According to the survey, one-third said they had been asked directly during the PPA proposal process to disclose human rights protections throughout their supply chains. LevelTen said that percentage is likely to increase as awareness grows. It said that renewable developers are “closely examining their sourcing practice,” and will increasingly choose to work with upstream producers that are transparent in their operations, and that have human rights protections in place.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/19/nrel-adds-solar-plus-storage-category-to-its-2021-energy-cost-dataset/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 19, 2021",NREL adds solar-plus-storage category to its 2021 energy cost dataset,"The Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) updated its 2021 Annual Technology Baseline (ATB), an energy costs analysis report, to recognize solar-plus-energy storage as a separate category for analysis.
The ATB is used to support both DOE and NREL research, as well as third-party industry-player analyses with a consistent and unified set of data about technology costs.
NREL presenters said in a recent webinar that most of the upcoming large-scale utility solar projects now include storage, making it necessary to add a new category to understand the effect of storage on costs. The largest change is an improvement of the capacity factor projections for solar-plus-storage facilities.
Another change is the inclusion of more cost categories into overall operations and maintenance (O&M) figures. Costs not typically associated with O&M but that represent ongoing costs (such as land use costs and property taxes, in addition to six other categories) have been folded into the photovoltaic O&M figures.
The ATB explains historical trends, offers current estimates, and presents future projections for three primary cost and performance factors: capital expenditures, capacity factor, and O&M costs. The projections for these figures are based on three scenarios: conservative, moderate, and advanced technology innovation adoption timelines.
Downloadable spreadsheets, a web app, Tableau workbooks, interactive charts, and API data are available for free through NREL.
Perhaps the most critical offering of the ATB is the past, present, and future levelized cost of energy (LCOE) report. Available projections span 2019 to 2050.

The tool also allows users to select different projections based on whether a federal investment tax credit (ITC) will be approved going forward. Users will notice that regardless of the outcome of the ITC, a lowering in the LCOE is expected for utility-scale solar PV in the two to three years approaching 2030, which NREL said will largely be driven by innovation.
The ATB data is the core behind NREL’s Standard Scenarios suite of forward-looking power sector analysis tools. The Standard Scenarios report has served to build an Electrification Futures Study, and the Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study, providing analytical support for Los Angeles County in its pursuit of 100% renewables penetration by 2045.
The Standard Scenarios suite is updated each year and is capped off with a December presentation of the findings. The most recent Standard Scenarios presentation from December 2020 can be viewed here:

The project is one of the first in the state to be awarded a 20-year power purchase agreement through Duke Energy’s Competitive Procurement of Renewable Energy (CPRE) program. The project broke ground in July 2020, and was finished ahead of schedule, as the project was projected to enter commercial operation later in the third quarter.
The installation uses fences to allow wildlife to pass through the project, and also includes measures to mitigate habitat disruption. These steps were taken as part of Pine Gate’s SolarCulture initiative, which aims to protect underlying agricultural land to help native plants and animals.
The project created 300 jobs during construction and the electricity generated by Trent River will be enough to power roughly 16,000 homes annually.
Trent River represents Pine Gate’s 36th solar project either in operation or under construction in North Carolina. It followed completion in late June of the company’s Grissom Solar project, a 6.9 MW/10 MWh solar and storage installation with a long-term contract with North Carolina Electric Membership Corp. for energy and ancillary services.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/19/solar-101-how-to-pay-for-your-rooftop-solar-investment/,"FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 19, 2021",Solar 101: How to pay for your rooftop solar investment,"You’ve got a contractor, you found your solar panels and inverter, you understand the taxes, you’ve got the project priced, and you’re ready to take care of your solar power plant for the long haul. How’s that for a Solar 101?
The next question is, where’s the money going to come from to pay for all this?
For most things we buy, this is an easy answer: Cold, hard cash. However, the out-of-pocket cost for a solar power system is pretty high, so the purchase is a lot like buying a car. And because solar panels pay dividends, a better analogy might be investing in a financial product.
The key is, your solar power plant is going to generate a commodity — electricity — which has a value that can be readily determined. And because of electricity’s highly quantifiable nature, many banks and other financial parties have an interest in being part of your solar power project. Even so, cash is king.
Everyone likes a cash payment, and if you’re ready to pay your contractor the day you call them, that will likely help you get the best price on your solar power project.
A small down payment to start the process (and that covers engineering, application, and permit fees) is fair. Next up is a big payment which includes a deposit, or even full payment, for hardware and at least some of the labor. The final payment – on the order of 10% – often is made after the project connects to the grid and starts generating electricity.
Paying no interest and getting a great price often means that using cash provides the fastest payback on your solar power project.
A HELOC with a respectable interest rate might make an attractive financial option. Naturally, this depends on the opportunity cost of spending your own cash on the solar power asset, versus investing it elsewhere.
For instance, if you prefer to put cash into your 401K or your children’s education fund, it might make sense to get a low-interest-rate HELOC from your bank.
In general, banks positively view solar power projects that are put on homes on which they hold the mortgage. This is because solar installations generally lower a homeowner’s monthly expenses, while also making the home more valuable.
As residential solar moves past 400,000 installations a year, banks have increasingly sought to earn the fees associated with underwriting the — on average — $21,000 loans. As homeowners add accessories to their projects, the bank loan agents may even become a bit more charming.

You can visit banks in your area to see if any of them want to  own your project, or search nationally for banks that have a department set up specifically for solar. Your state may already have one or more programs to drive solar power financing. Massachusetts is a good example, with its Mass Solar Loan program.
There is at least one nuance to understand when considering a bank loan. Currently, homeowners get a 26% tax credit when they buy a solar power project. If you happen to pay the average price of $21,000, that means you are entitled to a tax credit of $5,460.
Banks will generally request that borrowers put down a deposit on this type of loan. So let that 26%/$5,460 be your anchor number, and if you can find a better offer, go for it.
Keep in mind that the type of loan you choose may affect your tax burden for years to come. A home equity line of credit is similar to a mortgage, as is usually tax deductible. General bank loans are not typically tax deductible.
And we are by no means tax experts, so consult with your tax professional before making a decision, and remember to account for any additional incentives when you have those conversations.
Many residential solar buyers choose instant loans from companies that specialize in solar finance. These groups will include energy storage and car chargers with no paperwork and on-the-spot approvals. They offer a combination of 20-year and longer terms, no down payment, low interest rates, plus a guaranteed discount on your electricity bill.
In general, these finance companies will save the 4-8 weeks that bank financing might take.
The biggest downside to these fast-credit products is the “dealer fee.” This fee is a percentage added to your project’s price by the finance company. Make sure you compare your full project return on investment, and factor in all fees and interest rates from all product types.
EnergySage’s semi-annual Solar Marketplace Intel Report gives a breakdown of what finance companies contractors suggest to potential solar buyers.
Many contractors offer different financial products depending on your needs and what the various companies offer.
Who would want to own my tiny little rooftop? Well, Sunrun might. Sunrun’s “tiny little rooftop” installations add up to a greater-than-utility-scale solar power plant every few months.
Sunnova also figured out that tiny rooftops add up, and they’re currently the nation’s second-largest rooftop lease company, behind Sunrun. To sweeten the deal, Sunnova offers backup batteries, 25-year warranties, no cash down, guaranteed savings, and other benefits depending on where you live.
In this author’s opinion, the greatest benefit in going with a third-party-owned system or a quick-finance company is simple: It gets the solar on your roof right away so you can be part of the movement.
And while a solar lease doesn’t offer a compelling ROI like a system you’ve bought yourself, there’s no down payment. You, the homeowner, get 10-30% off your electricity bill, and the lease company assumes all risks and responsibilities. If there’s weather damage, faulty components, and O&M, that’s not your problem to fix (even though it is your problem to deal with, and that sometimes can be unpleasant).
In our next article of our Solar 101 series, we’ll talk about what California thinks homeowners should pay attention to – and protect themselves from – when buying solar power.

German start-up Sax Power GmbH is offering a residential AC battery it says works entirely without an inverter and has 50% more capacity and service life than conventional batteries.
According to its specifications, the battery stores direct current and can deliver both alternating current and direct current. The conversion is not carried out by transistors such as IGBTs or MOSFETs, but via the software of the battery management system.
By interconnecting with cascaded H-bridges, the cell blocks can be controlled individually. That enables the system to build a sinusoidal curve typical of alternating current from the individual DC voltage values. It also increases efficiency, since the conversion is purely electronic. Sax states the efficiency of its solution is 99%. The option of plugging the battery into a main socket is a further innovation, according to the company.
Sax Power said that in this type of device the current is measured by folding current transformers. That means no cables have to be disconnected in a household network. In addition, a second current measurement of the same type is carried out on the feeding line to the house. The battery then receives the information it needs for optimal use, via wireless communication units.
The manufacturer said some performance can be lost with the plug-in device, which has a nominal power output of 3.7 kW. The standard product, without the plug-in, has an output of 4.6 kW.
The battery comes with lithium iron phosphate cells and the capacity of the basic model is 5.2 kWh but it can be expanded with extra modules to 15.6 kWh. The nominal current is 20 A, or 16 A with the plug-in installation.
The company offers a 10-year guarantee for the device, which weighs 52kg and is said to be easier for installers to mount as they do not have to handle an inverter.
In May, the product received a German Innovation Award and Sax Power said it will be on display in October at the EES storage fair held alongside The Smarter E trade event. The developer said its product has qualified as a finalist for the EES Award at this year’s show.
A price for the product can be found on the Sax Power website. The basic version is listed as costing €5,079 ($5,976). In a version with wireless communication and a better smart meter, the device costs €5,210 ($6,130). It will be sold in series beginning this autumn.

The Mexican government said it plans to develop what it claims will be Latin America’s largest PV plant. The array will be built in Puerto Penasco, in the state of Sonora, one of the world’s best regions for solar power generation.
The project was initially announced by the CEO of the country’s power utility, CFE, Manuel Bartlett Díaz, and Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador. They have claimed that the solar facility will be Latin America’s largest solar park and the eighth biggest in the world. Currently, Mexico’s largest operational PV project is the 750 MW Villanueva plant, built by Italian utility Enel in 2016.
Earlier, the governor of Sonora, Alfonso Durazo, said the project would require an investment of approximately $2 billion, with construction to proceed in several phases. He did not provide any details on project financing, but a private-public partnership is likely, given that the Obrador government has always opposed the idea of giving sole permission to build power assets to private investors.
The plant is expected to occupy a surface area of around 2,000 hectares. Construction will also entail the deployment of a new connection line. The project is part of an overall plan by CFE to modernize its power assets and distribution system. Sonora lies immediately south of Arizona.
CFE is currently also developing two PV projects with a combined capacity of 350 MW in the state of Baja California. It has only turned to solar in recent times, after having opposed energy reforms introduced by the Pena Nieto government in 2013. Through these reforms, which introduced a successful auction scheme for renewables, several gigawatts of solar power were deployed throughout the country, including 11 large-scale solar plants in Sonora.
In March 2019, CFE said it had decided not to resume auction tenders for renewable energy. In May 2020, Mexico’s National Energy Control Center (CENACE) imposed new restrictions on renewable energy deployment, citing the need to protect energy security during the Covid-19 pandemic. The provisions halted grid connections for new solar and wind power projects until further notice.
