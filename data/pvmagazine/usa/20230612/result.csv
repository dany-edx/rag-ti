A survey by the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) found that 100% of its respondents perceive the U.S. market to be increasing in attractiveness relative to other major countries in renewable energy investment.
The response, made by executives from 43 leading companies with $100 million in annual revenues or investments, is the first time in the ACORE survey’s history that the United States has unanimously been perceived to be increasing in relative attractiveness to other nations. 
“The IRA is going to… make markets that have not historically been available, available,” said a surveyed investor.
“Direct pay, transferability, and long-term tax extensions have transformed uneconomic projects into ones with healthier margins and are allowing us to expand our portfolio,” said another investor in the ACORE survey.
The relative strength seen in the U.S. market comes at a serendipitous time, as renewable energy investment globally now nearly doubles that of the fossil fuels. For every dollar invested in fossil fuels, $1.70 is invested in clean energy technologies. This marks a fast divergence from five years ago, when fossil fuels and clean energy investments were essentially even.
Global clean technology investment is expected to reach $1.7 trillion in 2023, with PV leading the way as the largest contributor of energy generation, said the International Energy Agency.
While the report showed positive sentiments about the prospects of the U.S. renewable energy investment market from 2023 to 2026, there are still numerous challenges for the industry to overcome.
“Grid-related constraints, supply chain challenges, trade restrictions, tax credit monetization uncertainties, anti-ESG actions, and inflation are hindering the rate of sector growth. Project financing in particular will be constrained over the mid-term as it faces unprecedented demand from developers,” said the report authors.
Despite solar project investment pulling back 8% in 2022, largely due to supply chain constraints and tariff threats, 84% of survey respondents said that they plan to increase renewable energy investment by 5% or more in 2023.
Much of the uncertainty that plagued the U.S. solar investment market in 2022 is peeling back this year, as investors expressing uncertainty lowered from 16% of respondents in last year’s survey to 4% this year.
“2H 2021 and 2022 were full of equipment delays. In 2023, we’re finally catching up and deploying megawatts that were planned for 2022,” commented a developer in the survey.
While this reported uncertainty has lowered, many other headwinds of 2022 persist in the 2023 market.
“Supply chain issues (primarily tariff and other trade restrictions in the solar supply chain) and interconnection queues are our two biggest challenges, followed by the absence of much needed transmission upgrades to existing systems; and new transmission build-out,” said one surveyed developer.
Grid interconnection queue delays were cited as a major bottleneck for solar developers, bogged down by heavy costs and slow administrative processes by utilities and grid operators. However, the issue has been placed under the spotlight, as federal agencies and national labs go to work to develop pathways for speeding up and lowering costs.
“The appetite is there, and well-funded sponsors can get access to whatever they need. Queue delays are a huge issue now, although I think they’re shaking out,” said a developer in the ACORE survey.
Surveyed investors collectively ranked utility-scale solar, energy storage, and commercial solar as the top three most attractive clean energy sectors for investment over 2023-2026.
The respondents ranked the PJM region as the most attractive for renewables investment over a three-year span, followed by MISO, CAISO, ERCOT, and ISO-NE. Developers responded slightly differently, ranking the top five grid regions as follows: PJM, ERCOT, MISO, CAISO, ISO-NE.
Tax credit incentive adders based on meeting domestic content requirements in renewable energy projects, stacked with tax credits for manufacturing components in the U.S., are making the nation a top target for building new factories.
More than one-third of investors, about 38%, reported plans to invest in clean energy manufacturing in the U.S.
“There will be a number of opportunities in the onshoring of manufacturing, particularly around [storage] battery plants and wind energy manufacturing and assembly facilities,” said an investor in the survey.
Traditional investors are not the only ones supporting the domestic content push. About 28% of developers reported plans to open a new manufacturing plant, and 33% said they plan to incentivize their suppliers to open domestic facilities. Furthermore, 11% of developers said they intend to directly invest in domestic manufacturing plants.

The funding will support continued development of Revolution, a 150 MW, 2-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) project in West Texas. The project is being developed in partnership with Mortenson, a power engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor that is constructing the battery storage facility, substation and transmission line connecting the project to the ERCOT grid.
According to Mortenson, Revolution is expected to be one of the largest batteries in the U.S. and will begin operation in mid-2023.
“This facility will enable Spearmint to accelerate the construction of our projects currently under development, capitalize on our strong pipeline of development opportunities, and reliably deliver renewable energy to the grid for years to come,” said Andrew Waranch, founder, president, and chief executive officer of Spearmint.
Spearmint is also developing three additional BESS projects, known collectively as Nomadic. The three have a combined capacity of 900 MW / 2,000 MWh. The projects are located in Cooke, Galveston,and Brazoria counties and were acquired in March of this year. Spearmint anticipates that the first project within the portfolio will reach notice to proceed in early 2024 and begin commercial operation within 12 to 18 months.
Javelin Capital and Paul Hastings LLP served as financial advisor and legal counsel, respectively, to Spearmint. Holland and Knight served as legal counsel for Aiga.

The accreditation empowers SEIA to convene industry stakeholders to develop national standards for materials, products, processes and services in the U.S. solar and energy storage industry.
Through the development of national standards, SEIA will promote open and efficient markets, working to reduce costs and minimize risks for the industry. Standards encourage the use of best practices across the supply chain, supporting a safe and rapid deployment of projects. Standards also foster shared expectations and trust among customers, businesses, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders.
The organization said it will pursue standards that improve supply chain traceability, consumer protection, and end-of-life or performance period management.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, SEIA said:
Strong national standards are the bedrock of any successful industry. Through strong leadership and SEIA’s new ANSI accreditation, we will help the industry proactively and responsibly manage its growth, building confidence among solar customers, businesses and key stakeholders alike. We look forward to creating new industry standards that will propel the industry forward and create a culture of compliance, helping to address PV recycling and provide assurances of ethical practices throughout the solar supply chain.
SEIA is welcoming industry collaboration for the development of standards. It also offers voting memberships in a Standards Technical Committee, enabling participation in the development, review, approval, and publication of SEIA standards. Industry members are also able to publicly review and comment on standards that SEIA publishes. More information on these activities can be found on the SEIA website.
Standards will be developed under a multi-phase consensus process through a diverse coalition of SEIA members and non-members representing producers, users, and general interest categories. The organization’s first Standards Technical Committee will focus on supply chain traceability and said it is planning to release its first American National Standard in early 2024.

The multi-day LDES project is part of Georgia Power’s integrated plan to deploy additional cost-effective clean energy systems for grid reliability and resiliency. Subject to regulatory approval, the battery project is projected to enter commercial operations in 2026.
“Our customers, including many businesses and commercial accounts, are increasingly interested in the use of new technologies such as multi-day energy storage to help grow renewable energy and enhance reliability, especially as they relocate or grow their operations in Georgia,” said Kim Greene, president and chief executive officer of Georgia Power. “Form Energy’s technology is cutting edge and we’re excited to continue to work with them to serve our customers.”
Form Energy and the utility are collaborating to fully evaluate and demonstrate the 100-hour iron-air battery project will strengthen the local grid against normal daily, weekly and seasonal weather variability, in addition to extreme weather events, the developer said. This includes analysis modeled by Georgia Power and input from Formware, Form Energy’s investment and operational modeling software tool for power grids.
“We are pleased to strengthen our relationship through this partnership with Georgia Power and look forward to delivering an innovative multi-day energy storage system that will provide grid reliability and resiliency in their service territory for years to come,” said Mateo Jaramillo, chief executive officer and co-founder of Form Energy.
Georgia Power provides electricity to 2.7 million customers in all but four Georgia counties. In 2022, regulator Georgia Public Service Commission approved the utility’s long-term integrated resource plan (IRP). The utility has already deployed a large grid storage project, the 265 MW McGrau Ford battery facility, a lithium-ion battery project in Cherokee County, Ga., and an additional 500 MW of storage assets.
Besides the Form Energy project, the utility has a 65 MW project under development in Talbot County and a 13 MW project deployment for the U.S. Army located at Fort Stewart, near Savannah, Ga.
Form Energy was founded in 2017 by energy storage veterans who shared a unified mission to reshape the global electric system by creating a new class of low-cost multi-day energy storage systems.
The company began construction of its Weirton, West Virginia battery factory in May and plans to start manufacturing iron-air battery systems in 2024 for commercialization. The Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to $290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton.
The company has raised over $820 million in growth equity funding to date, with a most recent $450 million Series E round completed in October 2022 from TPG Rise Fund, GIC and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Prior investors include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, ArcelorMittal, MIT’s The Engine, Prelude Ventures and VamosVentures, among others.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/12/ira-equals-consolidation-diversification/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 12, 2023","IRA equals consolidation, diversification","With investment and production tax credits for clean energy production, storage, and electrification, the IRA is generating an influx of funds into the clean energy industry, supercharging market demand and evolution. This situation creates a strategic business opportunity for solar installers to take advantage of the market to grow their companies. Not only will solar installation businesses be able to organically grow thanks to increased demand, they will also have a window of opportunity to expand their businesses into new distributed energy resources (DERs) that have not traditionally been part of their offering.
At the frontline of the “electrify everything” movement, solar installers are uniquely positioned as trusted advisers to households on the installation of other DERs such as heat pumps, water heaters, smart electrical panels, and smart thermostats. As many solar installers have already added electric vehicle (EV) chargers and battery energy storage systems to their service offering, this provides another opportunity for installers to increase the average revenue per system through add-on products. In addition to net new sales, retrofitting previous solar customers with newly electrified appliances is another sales prospect.
Market potential
With 120 million households across the U.S. and the average household having the potential to receive $10,600 in tax credits to fully electrify, according to lobby group Rewiring America, there is $1.27 trillion of federal funds available. Solar installers that can quickly transition to smart energy installers with early training of sales teams and installation crews could be ideally positioned to take advantage of these federal funds and establish themselves as market leaders. This could prove crucial as the market evolution accelerates and potentially consolidates. At the same time, national solar installers may decide it is more efficient to partner or merge with large or local specialized electricians, such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning installers to capture this market opportunity.
These dynamics could also lead to a significant amount of market consolidation in other parts of the value chain, especially upstream. Distributors may need to expand the products and training offered and this could lead to new competition between solar-dedicated distributors and more general electrical appliance distributors.
Meanwhile, solar manufacturers, like inverter companies that have been expanding into the smart energy space, could benefit from expanding their product lines into heat pumps, smart thermostats, and other DERs, which could all be smartly managed by the inverter. While this could happen through internal research and development, it might be more likely to occur via mergers and acquisitions due to competition and time pressures.
Such consolidation could lead to solar manufacturers evolving into full smart energy companies that would compete with the likes of industry giants such as Bosch or General Electric. It is worth noting that these diversified conglomerates potentially also have plans to adapt their business strategies to take advantage of the expected, massive market potential created by the IRA.
While the US solar market is relatively immature, compared to Germany or Japan, it has experienced many transformations during its evolution. However, the impact of the IRA on the US solar market is unprecedented in both breadth and depth. The market has the potential to face both expansion and consolidation and only the fittest and fastest to adapt will survive.
Jessica Fishman is a strategic marketing professional with nearly 20 years’ experience, including seven years as head of global public and media relations at inverter maker SolarEdge. Passionate about addressing climate change by accelerating the clean energy transition, she has worked at leading renewables companies, building marketing and communications departments.

The technology is used in multi-cylinder rotary piston compressors in heat pumps. By optimizing the structure of the “exhaust port” that discharges the compressed refrigerant to the outside of the cylinders, it addresses the issue of overheating, thereby allowing for increased heating capacity, Toshiba-Carrier explained in a statement.
The design minimizes issues commonly seen in high-capacity equipment, including discharge volume loss, pulsed discharge, and distorted rotating axis. The compressor also purportedly shows lower-level noises and higher efficiency.

“The invention is instrumental in high energy efficiency and low-sound level while saving materials used with a smaller number of compressors and simplified piping design,” said Tsutomu Masamoto, chief technology executive at Toshiba Carrier.
The National Invention Awards of Japan was established in 1919 for driving innovations in science and technologies in Japan. It recognizes exceptionable inventions, devices, and designs that have generated or are expected to generate significant achievements.

A new report penned by Dartmouth College and Princeton University researchers found that solar and wind project developers stand to reap significant cost savings by using U.S.-manufactured components and paying workers fair wages, thanks to investments tied to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
“Using U.S.-manufactured parts and materials for clean energy development and paying workers a fair wage has always been the right thing to do. Now it’s also the most economical thing to do,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, publisher of the academic report. “This report shows that the IRA successfully creates an air-tight business case for supporting U.S. workers and manufacturers.”
The Ivy League renewable energy report  a developer meets prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards, the cost of producing solar or onshore wind power drops more than 60%, relative to deciding not to offer workers fair pay and career pathways. Any additional project costs associated with meeting these labor standards are more than offset by the full credit. Costs will likewise be roughly 20% cheaper for offshore wind projects that meet these labor standards than projects that do not.
Together, the clean energy tax credits and Section 45X manufacturing tax credit will induce demand for more than 4 million additional clean energy jobs across both industry verticals. The report attributes 3.7 million additional jobs to the utility-scale solar market and about 350,000 new wind market jobs in 2035, compared to projected employment levels without the IRA.
This includes domestic demand for 2.5 million jobs in solar manufacturing tied to the onshoring efforts provided by the IRA’s domestic content and advanced manufacturing tax credit. In project development and construction, the IRA is expected to stimulate 1.9 million jobs by 2035 for the utility solar development market.
The $200 billion in total solar market wages assumes the workforce earns the median real wages and does not account for wage increased in compensation to satisfy high demand for labor in the expanding market. Prior research found that a 20% increase in installation and construction labor costs would increase the installed cost of utility solar by only 3%.
The induced demand for renewable energy employment under the IRA is the result of both accelerated power capacity additions associated with production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) incentives as well as increases in domestic manufacturing associated with the 45X manufacturing credit and the PTC/ITC domestic content adder.
By spurring growth in the U.S. solar and wind markets the IRA will help to:

The report is based on interviews with 15 people from solar and storage firms and trade groups, nonprofits, and state agencies, along with an original case study for Massachusetts and a review of prior studies.
In Massachusetts, more than 900 MW of proposed distributed energy resource (DER) capacity was delayed in 2019 “as a result of National Grid’s DER cluster studies, resulting in a regulatory investigation of the utility,” the report says.
And while the annual proposed capacity of distributed solar and storage in Massachusetts increased eight times between 2009 and 2022, the annual authorized capacity, measured by interconnection authorizations, is no higher now than it was in 2012, and only exceeded 7 MW per year in 2017 and 2018, the report says.
The report’s authors say that the findings from its Massachusetts case study “are broadly applicable” across the U.S.
The Massachusetts process for DER interconnection has three features that “help determine where the process creates barriers to more rapid interconnection,” the report says:
Solutions
To improve hosting capacity, the report recommends “pro-active, system-wide” interconnection planning that forecasts hosting capacity needs and makes system upgrades to expand hosting capacity before interconnection requests exceed the existing capacity.
To avoid unfair cost allocation to some customers, the report advises spreading distribution system upgrade costs over a broad set of stakeholders, not just the projects applying for interconnection, and to determine cost allocation “prior to and separately from” specific individual or cluster project applications.
For storage resources, the report recommends that interconnection studies evaluate how storage resources would be expected to operate, allow smart inverters to regulate bidirectional power flows, and enable predictable charging and discharging from storage systems. The report references the “BATRIES” report, prepared by a team led by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, in making its recommendations.
The report also recommends continuous iteration to build in regular improvements to interconnection processes.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s i2X initiative will address DER cost allocation and queue management in a webinar on July 26.
