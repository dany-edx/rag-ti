The RFP says Con Edison wants projects totaling at least 200 MW in New York City and Westchester County. O&R is looking for projects totaling 10 MW. The battery systems must go into operation by the end of 2025.
Developers that respond to the RFP can propose one project or more projects. Each project must be more than 5 MW in size.
The projects must connect to the Con Edison or O&R transmission or distribution systems. Developers would own, operate, and maintain the storage systems and enter contracts of up to 10 years with Con Edison or O&R. Developers also would agree to allow the utility bid services from the systems into the state’s wholesale market.
The RFP said that for a four-hour battery, the storage system must be able to operate at least 350 cycles per year, limited to one cycle per day. The system also must average a 50-80% state of charge. A one-hour battery would need to average a 45-80% state of charge.
In addition, all proposed projects must maintain at least a 98% availability for dispatch in any calendar year, must demonstrate a minimum roundtrip efficiency of 80%, and must have a minimum ramp rate of at least 10% of the battery system’s dispatchable capacity per minute.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/02/as-maui-approaches-100-renewables-nrel-models-grid-options/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,HAWAII",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 2, 2021","As Maui approaches 100% renewables, NREL models grid options","Maui has dashed ahead of Hawaii’s 2045 clean energy mandate and by 2024 may become among the first 100% renewables-powered interconnected electric transmission systems anywhere in the world .
The island has a pipeline of 175 MW of new solar-storage hybrid power plants over the next three years, adding to the almost 200 MW of solar and wind presently on the grid. This is expected to be enough power to supply Maui’s roughly 70,000 customers without using conventional generation for many hours of the year.
The Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory said it is developing and validating multi-timescale tools that are expected to help bring Maui closer to its clean energy goals.
Solar and wind add their fair share of uncertainty to the grid. Grid operators face the challenge of scheduling power or grid stability services under uncertain conditions. And, because these conditions are so new, few models exist for operators to look to for guidance.
NREL is using its MIDAS–the Multi-Timescale Integrated Dynamic and Scheduling model–to help grid operators manage high-renewable systems, providing operational intelligence and advance system analysis.
MIDAS could enrich existing operational tools for managing energy markets and conducting reliability analysis down to the fast time-scale dynamics, said NREL. The tool bridges gaps between economic analysis and dynamic reliability evaluations of grid operation, so that trade-offs in dispatching renewable and nonrenewable assets for grid services are known.

For example, MIDAS has helped Maui model operations under future low grid inertia. The model has identified potential reliability issues, from resource adequacy and energy balance to frequency dynamics and electromagnetic transient timescales.
Inverter-based resources like wind, solar, and battery storage can provide a range of grid ancillary services by programing the controls, said Jin Tan, principal investigator  of several NREL projects aimed at enabling 100% renewable grid operations.
One problem, however, is that system operators largely do not use the tools. As a result, system operators need to incentivize renewables to provide grid services by developing new market rules. To do that, they need modern tools to validate the performance of renewable systems, or to manage risk—economic and operational—associated with scheduling variable resources like solar and wind, Tan said.
Inverter based resources (IBRs) such as solar and wind are beginning to make an impact on low-inertia grids, NREL said. While conventional power systems have historically used spinning generators to smooth sub-second electromagnetic disturbances, IBRs are replacing those resources. As a result, related systems need a new supply of grid stability.
NREL simulated Maui’s entire future transmission system, modeling hundreds of lines, buses, transformers, solar, storage, and wind, along with and their inverter controls at a sub-second scale.
They found that as Maui approaches 100% renewables, several options are available for ensuring grid stability. Under simulation, using synchronous condensers to stabilize, or even by programming grid-forming controls on a relatively small number of inverters makes it possible to stabilize a completely renewable powered system.
Maui’s renewable operation is supported in part by the DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), which awarded an NREL-led project called “SAPPHIRE” to develop hybrid renewable plant controls. The $3.6 million project bridges the research of SETO and NREL by unifying stabilizing controls with the MIDAS operational framework.
NREL will first use the ARIES (Advanced Research on Integrated Energy Systems) platform to develop and de-risk the plant controls at real power. ARIES creates a replica grid environment for Maui to validate its newly interconnected renewables and evaluate real-time inertia and stability.
The project will be capped off by a 60 MW demonstration on Maui’s system, and will act as a proof of 100% renewables remaining possible. This model can serve as a guiding force for high-renewables grids anywhere, said NREL.

The project in southwest Indiana would be connected to the utility’s existing coal-fired Petersburg Generating Station. AES Indiana will acquire the project from a unit of NextEra Energy Resources, which will develop and build the Petersburg solar project.
Indiana regulators must approve the project, which could enter service by May 1, 2024.
The utility is retiring two coal-fired units at the Petersburg plant in 2023, affecting around 630 MW of capacity. Last August, it reached a settlement agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Justice, and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to resolve alleged Clean Air Act violations at the power plant.
Under the settlement, the utility agreed to spend $5 million on a non-emitting generation source to support the Petersburg plant’s auxiliary load requirements and partially offset emissions.
In June, AES Indiana received regulatory approval to acquire the Hardy Hills 195 MW solar project in Clinton County, northwest of Indianapolis. Construction on the Hardy Hills project is expected to begin in the fall and reach commercial operation in 2023. Invenergy will develop the project and manage construction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/02/auxin-and-suniva-ask-the-itc-to-extend-trump-era-import-tariffs/,"COVID-19,LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 2, 2021",Auxin and Suniva ask the ITC to extend Trump-era import tariffs,"Auxin Solar Inc., a San Jose, California, solar panel manufacturer, and Suniva Inc., which owns an idled solar cell factory in Georgia, formally asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to extend solar tariffs for four more years.
The 18% tariffs were imposed by the Trump administration in 2018, and are set to expire in February 2022. They largely affect imports from Chinese-owned companies.
“Extending this safeguard is essential for America to reclaim its lead in solar energy manufacturing and development, and it represents a critical step to achieve the broader goal of American renewable energy independence,” said Mamun Rashid, co-founder and chief executive officer at Auxin Solar. Rashid said that Auxin “is committed to re-shoring the solar supply chain” and filed the petition hoping that policymakers are “committed to the promise of green energy independence and the good-paying manufacturing jobs that will result.”
Without an extension, the safeguard remedy will expire on February 6. Auxin Solar said that its extension petition will prompt the ITC to determine whether the safeguard remedy continues to be necessary and whether evidence exists that the industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition. The ITC is expected to report its determination to President Biden by December 8.
During the Midterm Review of the Section 201 tariffs, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said that about 10 GW of solar was not developed because of the 201 tariffs. It also estimated that about 62,000 jobs were not created.
Responding to the move by Auxin and Suniva to seek an extension, John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy for SEIA said in a statement, “There are no two ways about it. It is time to end the job-killing Section 201 solar tariffs.” He called them a “multibillion dollar drag on industry growth.” He said that leading domestic panel manufacturers are “thriving,” both here in the U.S. and globally. “If we hope to reach our ambitious climate goals, we must accelerate solar deployment, not hinder it with unnecessarily punitive trade measures,” he said.
In a recent webinar, Rhone Resch, president and chief revenue officer for Solarlytics and former head of SEIA, had a different view, and said that the Biden administration may keep the tariffs in place both as a show of support for domestic manufacturing and as a way to show strength in competing with China.
“The (labor) unions want this and it gives domestic protection,” Resch said.
Auxin Solar said that neither it nor Suniva have been able to complete plans to adjust to import competition. Those plans were negatively impacted by what the companies said was stockpiling prior to the tariffs, economic headwinds caused by Covid-19, alleged predatory pricing, and a “loophole” that allowed excluded modules to be imported in high volumes and at “cut-rate prices.” These challenges meant that the safeguard “did not have the desired effect to allow companies like Auxin Solar and Suniva to recover from the serious injury caused by imports,” Auxin said.
Auxin joined in the original safeguard investigation and the mid-term monitoring review. Georgia-based Suniva was the original petitioner for the tariffs and also took part in the ITC’s mid-term monitoring review.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/02/europe-had-just-650-mw-of-solar-cell-manufacturing-capacity-at-the-end-of-2020/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,WESTERN EUROPE",MAX HALL,"AUGUST 2, 2021",Europe had just 650 MW of solar cell manufacturing capacity at the end of 2020,"From pv magazine Global
The latest version of the Photovoltaics Report produced by German research body the Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy Systems (ISE) has laid bare the state of European photovoltaic manufacturing at the end of 2020.
The continent had 22.1 GWp of solar-grade polysilicon production capacity at that point, according to an executive summary of the latest update of the document. According to the report, Europe’s polysilicon capacity was held by Norwegian-based, Chinese state-controlled manufacturer Elkem, and by German businesses Wacker and Silicon Products.
By contrast, Europe had just 1.25 GW of solar wafer production capacity at the end of 2020, according to the Fraunhofer ISE report, based in Norway, at Norsun and REC Silicon-owned Norwegian Crystals; and in France, at energy company EDF‘s Photowatt operation. The lack of European cell manufacturing capacity was even more glaring, with the study estimating just 650 MW of facilities, held by Finnish business Valoe, at its fab in Lithuania; by Italian energy business Enel in its homeland; and by Ecosolifer, in Hungary.
The market had 6.75 GW of solar module production capacity at the end of the year, however, spread across 29 companies identified by the research institute. That marked 3% of the world’s silicon solar module market last year, stated the report’s authors, with China contributing 67% as part of the 95% accounted for by the wider Asian region, and producers in the U.S. and Canada claiming 2%.
The study offered an insight into the energy payback time of a typical, Chinese-made, 60-cell, PERC, 19.9%-efficient solar module. Such a panel, mounted in India, would take only 160.6 days to generate the amount of energy consumed during its production process, with the figure rising all the way to 1.42 years – 518.3 days – in Canada. In the examples cited by the report’s authors, the balance-of-system, non-generating components required the most time to displace their energy footprint, between 138.7 and 167.9 days.
The statistics offered up by the Fraunhofer ISE included the facts PV accounted for 10.6% of Germany’s electricity generation capacity, 5.3% of Europe’s and 3.2% of the world’s. German rooftop PV systems cost between €890 and €1,850 per kilowatt-peak of capacity last year; large scale power plants in the nation offer a current levelized cost of energy of €0.031-0.057/kWh; and the lowest tendered tariff for solar electricity remains a €0.0433/kWh bid registered in February 2018.
Despite the dramatic shift in module production from Europe to Asia witnessed from 2010 onwards, Germany accounted for 7.6% of all the solar capacity installed worldwide by the end of last year, with Europe as a whole hosting 23%, China 36%, North America 12%, Japan 9%, India 6% and the rest of the world 14%, including off-grid capacity.
Referring to data provided by British market data company IHS Markit, the report estimated current inverter costs of €0.03-0.17/Wp for the string products which account for 64.4% of the market; €0.04/Wp for central inverters which cater to 33.7%; €0.08 for DC/DC power optimizers which have a 5.1% market share; and €0.25/Wp for the microinverters which occupy a 1.4% global niche.
Taking a longer view across numerous graphs, the study also illustrates how Germany’s solar feed-in tariff went off a cliff just as household electricity prices began a steady rise during 2008-13, and fleshed out how the nation added peak volumes of around 7-8 GWp of solar capacity in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, immediately after production shifted to the Far East. For European manufacturers, however, it may be encouraging to see Germany’s installs back rising at a steady 1 GW or so per year since 2017.
