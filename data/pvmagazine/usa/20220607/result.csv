According to EnerVenue, the batteries will be used to support Puerto Rico’s industrial sector, as many of the Island’s businesses are actively seeking ways to transition their energy supply into a renewable mix. This trend has emerged since Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the persistent power grid deficiencies left in the storm’s aftermath.
“The industrial sector in Puerto Rico faces a crucial and time-sensitive need for more sustainable, affordable, and reliable energy,” said José Rodríguez Varela, president of Sonnell Power Solutions. “EnerVenue fits into our mission to provide the off-grid alternative energy path forward that industrial businesses are so eager to adopt – one that is safe and built to last.”
EnerVenue’s batteries were selected by Sonnell due to their chemistry’s lack of thermal runway or fire risk. The systems also deliver differentiated tolerance of extreme temperatures and environmental conditions, making them optimal for industrial usage.
“We anticipate that EnerVenue will become a cornerstone technology for us, where we are able to fulfill the market’s energy transformation needs now and going forward,” continued Varela.
EnerVenue is betting on the success of metal hydrogen batteries, specifically nickel-hydrogen batteries. This chemistry has proven to be an incredibly powerful energy storage technology for the aerospace industry for quite some time, but was always held back from greater commercial success due to its high price. According to Dr. Yi Cui, chief technology advisor with EnerVenue, the company has been able to achieve commercialization via “a breakthrough competitive price using new low-cost materials.”
Unlike lithium-ion, EnerVenue’s metal-hydrogen batteries excel operating in conditions of extreme heat and extreme cold. Specifically, the solution operates optimally from -40° to 140°F ambient temperatures.
EnerVenue claims that the company’s batteries have a more than 30-year lifespan, can go through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation and offer exceptional overcharge, overdischarge, and deep-cycle capabilities. The company also claims cost-per-kilowatt-hour as low as a penny, as well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion.
In May, EnerVenue and Pine Gate Renewables signed a multi-year agreement under which Pine Gate will procure and deploy 2400 MWh of EnerVenue’s battery energy storage systems in the United States to support their growing energy storage project pipeline. EnerVenue’s batteries will be supplied to Pine Gate to provide a choice in storage technology for Pine Gate’s development partners and customers, giving said customers the freedom to choose a technology that meets long-term reliability, energy and capacity needs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/07/new-us-made-residential-lfp-battery-inverter-and-monitoring-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 7, 2022","New US-made residential LFP battery, inverter, and monitoring system","Briggs & Stratton, which acquired California battery maker SimpliPHI Power late in 2021, announced the launch of the SimpliPHI Energy Storage System (ESS), with the product available to order beginning June 14. The integrated, scalable solution starts with three core components, a 6 kW inverter, 4.9 kWh battery, and a proprietary monitoring system. The system will be on display at the RE+ conference in Anaheim this September.
The battery uses lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which is known for its advantage of having a minimized fire risk when compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. It negates the use of cobalt, a metal associated with health hazards, and a key culprit in battery fires.
“Our energy storage solutions are held to industry-leading standards. From the chemistry, form factor and manufacturing processes of the batteries to the testing and validation requirements on behalf of our customers, we seek to provide a safer and more reliable solution,” said Catherine Von Burg, president and CEO, SimpliPHI Power.
The 6 kW inverter has integrated multiple power point tracking for solar or utility charging in either DC coupled or retrofit AC coupled systems. The inverter’s eight-millisecond switchover time prevents flickering lights and equipment damage associated with power outages. It is optimized for the LFP battery, and scalable in 6 kW increments.
The battery contains a closed-loop communications system in its battery management system, which logically integrates with the inverter and proprietary EnergyTrak management software. It is scalable from one module to 72, for a total energy storage capacity of up to 358.5 kWh. The battery and inverter are both IP65 rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The monitoring system allows users to manage energy usage through a mobile app that provides real-time status and updates. The system enables performance optimization, boosts utility bill savings, and creates energy security for customers.
“With aging power grids, more frequent outages and unpredictable weather patterns, the addition of the SimpliPHI ESS to our product lineup is another solution for people looking for an innovative, scalable energy system for their home or business,” said Tom Rugg, president, Energy Solutions at Briggs & Stratton.
SimpliPHI batteries are backed with over 110 years of power experience, with batteries deployed in over 40 countries. The equipment comes with six to ten year limited warranties. The batteries are capable of integration with solar arrays, the power grid, and backup generators.

Along with its major competitor SolarEdge, the company holds a dominant foothold in the market share of US residential solar. 
Founded in 2006, the company has reached 2,260 employees across its global offices. Worldwide, Enphase has partnerships with over 5,000 solar installation companies. To date, Enphase has shipped 43.4 TWh of microinverters, representing over 42 million microinverter units, deployed across nearly 2 million solar projects. This equates to 12 GW of microinverters shipped.  
Its latest microinverter model, the IQ8, was launched in Q4 2021. The innovative design allows the IQ8 to form a microgrid, enabling backup power usage during an outage without the need for battery energy storage. This is a distinct advantage, as conventional solar arrays without storage must shut down during outages for safety reasons. 
The company also operates a battery energy storage division and has shipped over 300 MWh of home batteries to date. In 2021, Enphase batteries backed up nearly 54,000 power outage events. 
Systems using Enphase inverters have abated 31 million metric tons of carbon emissions to date, the equivalent of the consumption of 3.5 billion gallons of gasoline, or the electricity demand of 3.9 million homes in one year. It recycles 100% of its e-waste at its North America, India, and New Zealand operations. 
Our strategy is simple. We focus on making best-in-class home energy systems that enable homeowners to make, use, save, and sell their own power. We are deeply committed to making these systems innovative, high-quality, and easy-to-use, helping millions of people gain access to cleaner, affordable, and more reliable energy while creating jobs and contributing towards a carbon-free future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/07/after-a-suppressed-first-quarter-the-us-solar-market-buoyed-by-tariff-suspension/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 7, 2022","After a suppressed first quarter, the US solar market is buoyed by tariff suspension","The US solar industry had its lowest quarter of installations since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the US Solar Market Insight report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. In Q1 2022, price increases and supply chain constraints continued to suppress the solar market as the industry installed 24% less solar capacity than Q1 2021.

However, the tide turned yesterday when the Biden administration announced a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Without this action, massive project delays and cancellations would have continued throughout 2022, putting President Biden’s climate goals at risk.

Since the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced in March that it would act on a petition filed by Auxin Solar and launch an antidumping investigation into Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, solar module manufacturers halted shipments to the United States, causing an industry-wide module shortage. According to the US Solar Market Insight Q1 report, these supply constraints are expected to ease as manufacturers ramp up shipments to the United States in the coming months.
“The solar industry is facing multiple challenges that are slowing America’s clean energy progress, but this week’s action from the Biden administration provides a jolt of certainty businesses need to keep projects moving and create jobs,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO. “President Biden has clearly taken notice of how drags on the industry are hampering grid resiliency. By acting decisively, this administration is breathing new life into the clean energy sector, while positioning the US to be a global solar manufacturing leader.”

The effects of the DOC investigation was taking its toll on what was previously a burgeoning industry, with 2022 forecasts cut in half due to continued supply chain challenges and the anti-circumvention inquiry.
“The White House’s executive action brings relief to the US solar industry, which has been steeped in uncertainty regarding the anti-circumvention investigation initiated by the Department of Commerce in late March following a petition filed by Auxin Solar, a domestic module manufacturer,” said Michelle Davis, Wood Mackenzie’s principal analyst.

“Despite this, this announcement is expected to create approximately 2 – 3 GW of upside potential to Wood Mackenzie’s 2022 base case outlook, assuming the global market resumes normal operations” Davis added.

Nearly all areas of the industry had been hit, but the greatest pain was felt in the utility-scale sector.  Utility-scale solar set an annual installation record in 2021 at nearly 17 GWdc; however, final installations in 2021 were lower than expected due to the many challenges faced in the industry. US solar suffered its sharpest decline in Q1 2022 and experienced its lowest quarter of installations since 2019. Multiple gigawatts of projects pushed their online dates from 2021 to 2022 or later. It also had the lowest number of new projects added to the pipeline since 2017.

The commercial solar market saw 28% quarter-over-quarter declines, while the community solar market shrank by 59% quarter-over-quarter. Project delays from interconnection challenges and supply chain constraints limited growth in both sectors.
The bright spot in the US solar industry was the residential sector, where installations totaled 4.2 GWdc in 2021, setting an annual record and exceeding more than 500,000 projects installed in a year for the first time.
Residential solar has a bright future, as well. Wood Mackenzie forecasts 13% growth for residential solar in 2022, although analysts note that NEM 3.0 in California and the expiration of the ITC heavily impact the base case outlook from 2023 onward. California volumes are set to fall by 45% in the first full year of NEM 3.0, and Wood Mac forecasts a 2% market contraction in 2023. The market will grow everywhere but California by 18% during the same time period. An ITC extension would paint an even rosier picture, with residential increasing to 13 GWdc, or 21%, from 2023 to 2032.
The 24-month tariff extension offers some certainty at a time when it is needed most, and it buys some time for industrial clean energy policies like long-term tax credits and manufacturing incentives to be put into place. Certainty around the investment tax credit (ITC) would be a major catalyst for the industry, increasing capacity installations over the next decade by 66%, according to the Q1 Insight report.

A 66% overall increase represents a 20% increase for residential, 15% for non-residential (commercial and community solar), and 86% for utility solar. Total installed solar in the United States under this scenario by 2032 would be nearly 700 GWdc compared to 464 GWdc in the base case.
For this Year in Review report, Wood Mackenzie released 10-year outlooks for each segment. Overall the solar industry is expected to more than triple from 120 GWdc installed today to 464 GWdc by 2032. While this is good news, it is far short of what’s needed to hit the Biden administration’s clean energy targets.
The Build Back Better (BBB) Act is unlikely to pass; however, there are opportunities for numerous clean energy provisions included in the BBB Act to make it to final legislation. The Wood Mac/SEIA report concludes that passage of an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) extension and other clean energy provisions would be a significant solar market catalyst, increasing installations by 66% in the next decade over the base case.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/07/westbridge-energy-announces-250-mw-solar-and-storage-project-in-alberta/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 7, 2022",Westbridge Energy announces 250 MW solar and storage project in Alberta,"Westbridge Energy Corporation, a utility-scale solar development company operating primarily in Alberta, Canada, has announced the newest project in its expanding development portfolio: the Dolcy Solar and Battery Storage, a 250 MW solar and 100MW of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) installation.
Like the majority of Westbridge’s portfolio, the Dolcy Solar and Battery Storage project is being developed in Alberta, Canada, specifically in the municipality of Provost, in east-central Alberta. While the company has not yet shared the duration of the 100 MW BESS, most installations of such a scale opt for four-hour duration, meaning it is fair to expect the battery system to be 100 MW/400 MWh.
The Dolcy Project has secured site control in the form of a long-term solar lease covering approximately 1,025 acres with private landowners. It is currently in Stage 1 of the Alberta Electric System Operator interconnection process, with environmental studies underway in accordance with Alberta Environment and Parks guidelines.
By adding the Dolcy project to the company’s portfolio, Westbridge now has four utility-scale solar projects totalling 985 MW, and 300 MW of battery storage capacity in its development pipeline. All but one of those projects are being developed in Alberta, Canada.
Peeking down the pipeline
The lone American project is located in the Lone Star State: the 221 MW Accalia Point Solar project, acquired from Aelius Solar in October 2021. The project is located in Texas, near South Padre Island and the US-Mexico border.
Construction is yet to begin, but the project’s site has been finalized thanks to long-term leases covering approximately 1,120 acres of cultivated farmland. Interconnection studies for the project have begun and the preliminary environmental analyses have been completed. Westbridge anticipates completion of the project and interconnection agreement to take place Q1 2023.
A month before the acquisition of the Accalia Point Solar project, in September 2021, Westbridge completed its environmental and wildlife field study programs for one of the largest solar installations ever proposed in Canada: the 230 MW Georgetown Solar Project.
The project is set to be constructed on 710 acres of privately owned cultivated farmland southeast of Calgary. Development began in early 2020, while construction is anticipated to begin in August 2022.
Construction of the project is expected to create up to 360 jobs, most of which Westbridge said will be for local Alberta workers.
Rounding out the company’s late-2021 development and acquisition spree, Westbridge acquired a 75% controlling interest in Sunnynook Solar Energy, the company developing the 236 MW solar and 100 MW Sunnynook Solar and Storage project in Alberta, Canada.
The project is currently in Stage 1 of the Alberta Electric System Operator interconnection process, with environmental studies underway in accordance with Alberta Environment and Parks guidelines.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/07/holistic-solar-modeling-predicts-even-lower-future-pricing/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 7, 2022",Holistic solar modeling predicts even lower future pricing,"It’s not just the price of solar panels that has fallen, but also the price of inverters, racking, components, and labor per installed watt. In fact, the cost to install utility scale solar has fallen by 19%, as the industry scaled from 10 GW to 1 TW globally.
Future costs can be predicted using only hardware and construction prices to estimate projected cost declines, but this data alone is insufficient, as it seems to underestimate learning curves.

Researchers from the Electricity Markets & Policy (EMP) team at the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have released a more refined way to observe – and predict – the price declines associated with learning curves. The key refinement to their learning curve analysis examines a facilities’ broader levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) rather than focusing exclusively on installed costs (CapEx).
Looking at the cost of electricity that a plant makes, along with its construction costs, allows other advancements to be taken into account. For instance, if a power plant lasts longer (say for instance with a 50 year solar panel), the same dollar of installation cost will generate more electricity.
The report authors note that researchers have produced versions similar to these LCOE models before. The EMP team says that their product improves on prior versions by integrating capital expenditures (CapEx), operating expenditures (OpEx), facility capacity factor, the weight average cost of capital (WACC), tax benefits, and plant design into their LCOE calculations.

To develop their models, the EMP team collected data on 822 utility-scale (i.e., ground-mounted and >5 MWAC) PV plants totaling 33.7 GWAC. The plants were built between 2007 and 2020, and represent 87% of total US utility-scale PV capacity operating at the end of 2020. The LCOE was determined on an individual plant basis, accounting for installation year, available sunlight, regional labor costs, changes to borrowing costs, and other factors.
While the research paper doesn’t provide a specific value, the image below does show what the researchers believe the solar learning curve would be with CAPEX costs alone (orange line), versus this document’s LCOE based calculation.
By 2050, the two lines are separated by roughly 24%.

Going forward, this data was used to project solar power’s future pricing declines toward the year 2050. In the next few years, solar’s 24% learning curve cost declines versus wind’s 15% implies that solar should soon be cheaper than wind.
Long term projections suggest that the average cost of solar electricity will be 1.4¢/kWh across the United States. The lower bounds of the nationwide cost of electricity sneaks under 1¢/kWh, with the best sites blowing past the penny barrier.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/07/acore-indicates-reduced-solar-investment-and-development-if-tariffs-had-persisted/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 7, 2022",ACORE outlines reduction in solar investment and development if tariffs persist,"The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) released a report today that indicates that the Commerce investigation presented serious challenges to the US solar industry that would have ultimately derailed progress on climate goals. The report, Expectations for Renewable Energy Finance in 2022-2025, presents the results of surveys that were conducted with financial institutions and renewable energy development companies both before and after the Department of Commerce initiated its solar tariff inquiry.
In the first round of survey results, respondents had a positive outlook on the growth of the US renewable energy sector despite uncertainty caused by supply chain delays, lengthy interconnection wait times, and unresolved legislation. Since the announcement of potential tariffs, investors and developers said they were less optimistic and that they anticipated pulling back on solar investment. The report indicates that investor companies representing $100 million or more of annual renewable energy investment estimate that 71% of their US solar investments, on average, are “at risk” due to the Commerce inquiry. Developers who developed 100 MW to 1 GW of solar installations over the past three years report, on average, that the Commerce investigation put 86% of their planned solar installations are “at risk”.
“It’s deeply troubling to see how confidence in the renewable energy sector, which was at an all-time high last year, has been undermined by the destructive tariff inquiry at the US Department of Commerce,” said Gregory Wetstone, ACORE president and CEO. “Every day this baseless inquiry drags on, we lose precious time that we do not have in our efforts to achieve America’s clean energy goals and combat the climate crisis.”
In a quick turn of events, pv magazine USA reported yesterday that the White House is preparing to pause the tariff investigation with a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. pv magazine USA will continue to track how this will pay out among investors and developers.
After the announcement of the pausing of the investigation, Wetstone stated that the solar industry “can finally get back to work driving economic growth, reducing electricity costs and lowering greenhouse gas emissions”  He thanked the President and his staff for “the vitally important relief he has provided for the nation’s solar sector,” adding that “Now that we have a reprieve from the destructive impacts of the Commerce inquiry, we look forward to working with the administration and our allies in Congress to secure the enactment of policies that strengthen our domestic supply chain, such as the clean energy tax package currently being negotiated that provides advanced manufacturing tax credits and long-term tax incentives for renewable power.”
The ACORE report looked back as well as forward, tracking progress on the $1T 2030: American Renewable Investment Goal, an initiative ACORE launched in 2018 to help secure $1 trillion in private sector investment in renewable energy and enabling grid technologies by 2030. One trillion dollars of investment over 2018 to 2030 would represent more than double the historic annual investment in the US renewable sector in the years before the campaign launch and help put the United States on a trajectory toward meeting the Biden Administration’s goal of a carbon-free grid by 2035.
The ACORE analysis finds the United States attracted $228.3 billion in renewable energy, grid-enabling technology and transmission for renewable integration investment since the launch of the campaign in 2018, represents 23% of the $1 trillion campaign objective. To achieve the goals, annual investment will need to increase 65% over 2021 levels to $96 billion through 2029.
Prior to the Commerce inquiry, 92% of surveyed investors perceived the United States as an attractive venue for renewable energy investment compared to other leading countries. More than three-quarters of investors said they expected the attractiveness of renewable energy to increase compared to other asset classes in their portfolios in 2022 to 25.
