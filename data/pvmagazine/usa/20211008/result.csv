https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/08/iron-flow-battery-tech-shows-early-promise-for-mid-duration-energy-storage/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 8, 2021",Iron flow battery tech shows promise for mid-duration energy storage,"Iron flow battery manufacturer ESS Inc. has been in the news lately, most recently for releasing an updated version of its product guarantee.
Munich RE, one of the world’s largest reinsurance companies, also updated its insurance policy for ESS to address customer concerns over technology risk. ESS told pv magazine USA that the new policy covers the battery modules and electrolyte management system, as well any needed repairs or replacement for the first 10 years of the system’s life. ESS manufactures these components itself.

The product’s pump and motor drives have an expected lifetime of 19-22 years. The industrial computer, which was described as “inexpensive,” can be expected to be replaced every 5-7 years. ESS offers an O&M service contract after the 10-year mark.
But even more striking is the battery’s expected longevity. Much like the grid’s oldest assets, (some of which were first built in the 1890s), ESS batteries show the potential to soldier on for many decades. While the ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, the battery modules, electrolyte, plumbing, and other components may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance.
For one thing, the battery is expected to experience zero degradation over 20,000 cycles. By design, iron flow batteries circulate liquid electrolytes to charge and discharge electrons using a process called a redox reaction, which represents a gain of electrons (reduction), and a loss of electrons (oxidation). ESS uses the same electrolyte on both the negative and positive sides, eliminating possible cross-contamination and degradation. As a result, ESS chemistry remains stable for an almost unlimited number of deep-cycle charge and discharge cycles.
Another reason for the expected long operating life is that ESS batteries use a “proton pump” to balance and maintain electrolyte health over the life of the asset.
The pump connects to the tank and passively mixes unwanted hydrogen back into the solution. Doing so maintains the balance of pH and states of charge in the liquid electrolyte circulating through the system.
In human terms, the battery is the heart, the electrolyte is the blood, and the proton pump is the kidney, which keeps everything in balance.
The pump itself is expected to be a key commercial differentiator for ESS. Other flow chemistries need to come offline regularly to rebalance their electrolytes. Not so with the ESS design.
In the unlikely event that the battery is to be decommissioned, the system and all of its components can be substantially recycled.
Any non-ESS manufactured system components come with third-party warranties. The full warranty wasn’t available to be distributed via pv magazine USA.
The company currently offers two products, the single shipping container Energy Warehouse and a string of warehouse units in an Energy Center.

One Energy Warehouse shipping container holds 400-600kWh of storage capacity and can be configured with variable power to provide storage durations of 4-12 hours. That makes the power rating configurable from 50-90 kW. The round-trip efficiency is 70-75%, DC-DC. Each battery weighs 16,000 kg dry, and as much as 38,000 kg after it’s filled with the electrolyte.
For larger volumes of energy storage, ESS will string together multiple batteries in what it calls an Energy Center. At this larger scale, ESS batteries take up some real estate. One acre of batteries holds up to 6 MW/90 MWh, providing up to 12 hours discharge at rated power. These large battery centers are expected to have fast, easy permitting due to the lack of hazmat concerns as well as non-flammable, non-explosive materials.
But the most important news of the day – product sales news – shows that ESS has been busy.
To support its growth, ESS announced that they were to become a publicly listed company through a SPAC merger with ACON S2 Acquisition Corp this past May. And in a great coup, the company will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “GWH.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/08/doe-wants-to-power-5-million-homes-with-community-solar-by-2025/,"COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"OCTOBER 8, 2021",DOE wants to power 5 million homes with community solar by 2025,"Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have announced a new goal for community solar in the country: installing enough capacity to power the equivalent of 5 million homes by 2025 and create $1 billion in energy bill savings.
The target is also being pursued to help achieve the Biden-Harris Administration’s goals of achieving 100% clean electricity by 2035 and ensure that all Americans see the benefits and resiliency provided by renewable energy equitably.
“Community solar is one of the most powerful tools we have to provide affordable solar energy to all American households, regardless of whether they own a home or have a roof suitable for solar panels,” said Secretary Granholm.
As for the scope of this undertaking; it’s no small project. According to DOE, there’s currently enough community solar capacity to power 600,000 households, meaning that this commitment will represent a 700% increase in capacity in roughly four years. For further context, consider that there is currently enough installed solar capacity in all forms to power roughly 19 million households across the United States, still 6 million lower than the 2025 goal.
The announcement has been well met across the by solar and energy equity advocates alike. The Coalition for Community Solar Access released the following statement in support:
“Today’s announcement from Secretary Granholm demonstrates the overwhelming support that’s building  for the role  community solar should play in  transforming and strengthening our energy grid while expanding access to solar for all. DOE’s goal of 26 GW by 2025 is consistent with the accelerated growth that our research shows is needed for the community solar industry to meet our climate goals at the  lowest cost.”
The statement acknowledged that there is significant work to be done, and that strong policies and goals are needed bring those benefits possible under this goal to fruition. IT also said that Congress and state policymakers should listen to the DOE and do their part to accelerate the growth of community solar so that a clean, cost-effective, and equitable grid can be built.
“I’m energized about the Department of Energy’s new goal, and I get more excited the deeper I dig into it,” said Kiran Bhatraju, founder and CEO of Arcadia, which manages a 500 MW community solar portfolio. “It’s fantastic to see the Secretary’s commitment to public education about how community solar can help people reap the benefits of clean energy, and to see her commitment to strengthening consumer protections and recognizing credible companies in the market.”
The goal was announced as a target under the National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP), a coalition of community solar stakeholders; namely State, local and Tribal governments, solar developers, and community-based organizations. The group works to expand access to affordable community solar and break down the barriers that prevent Americans from having access to the resource. NCSP currently has more than 650 members from over 440 partner organizations.
Membership is set to grow as DOE is offering free, on-demand technical assistance to NCSP partnership members in order to meet the stated targets. This assistance will take the form of personalized support to each organization, helping to accelerate implementation, improve the performance of a program or project, and build capacity for future community solar development.

In fact, it is estimated that an increased rate of current distributed generation solar and storage deployment vs. “utility-scale only” model could save U.S. ratepayers over $109 billion by 2030.
A coalition of solar advocates, Local Solar for All, shared this in an analysis of electric grid modeling experts Vibrant Clean Energy. The report found that the U.S. must deploy a minimum of 103 GW of distributed solar and 137 GW of distributed energy storage by 2030 to achieve President Biden’s climate and equity goals at the lowest cost. This represents a growth rate in deployment of two to four times faster than the previous decade.
These deployment figures were derived using President Biden’s climate goals as key constraints: 80% clean electricity by 2030, 50% economy-wide carbon reductions by 2030, 95% economy-wide carbon reductions by 2050, and 100% electrification of the economy by 2050. The report made use of Vibrant Clean Energy’s WIS:dom-P model, which analyzes trillions of data points, including every potential energy resource, and direct costs and benefits associated with bringing different resource mixes onto the grid.
It was also found that a scale-up of distributed resources reduces stress on utility-scale resources, and makes way for 579 GW of utility-scale solar, 442 GW of wind by the close of the decade.
Local Solar For All said that deploying 103 GW by 2030 would create about 1.2 million jobs. The advocacy group also pointed to the need for an equitable and fair energy transition, as laid out by Biden’s Justice40 initiative. It said if 50% of distributed projects are directed to low- and middle-income communities, they could power between 8-15 million households.

First announced in December 2020, the 1 MW installation is located on land leased from the local Michels Corporation, a utility contractor. It is expected to generate enough electricity to fulfill the energy needs of 1,000 customers.
Michels also serves as the anchor tenant of the project, signing up for a significant portion of capacity, while still leaving enough open for other interested customers.
“When the opportunity to participate presented itself, we saw it as a win-win,” said Pat Michels, president of Michels Corporation. “We could do the right thing for the environment and provide ourselves the ability to have multiple locations benefit from clean energy.”
The project is the first under Alliant’s community solar program, which provides subscribed customers with a credit on their monthly electric bills for every block of energy purchased. The credits begin generating once the facility is in service and will last for 20 years. When initially announced in December 2020, 4,000 solar blocks were available for subscription to Alliant Energy’s Wisconsin electric customers on a first-come, first-served basis. Currently, less than 250 solar blocks remain available.
Alliant currently has plans for multiple community solar locations across Iowa and Wisconsin in the near future. Any readers interested in purchasing some of the remaining Alliant Energy Community solar blocks may do so here.

The governors said the plan will improve the region’s economy and remove toxic emissions that would be otherwise expelled by cars and trucks. The plan’s supporters said it will help the Midwest compete for federal funding and private investment.
As part of the plan, a network of medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles chargers will be constructed to streamline the charging experience for truck drivers in the region. Regulations and charging operations would be standardized for ease-of-use.
The plan also emphasizes what it said would be an equitable transition to an electrified transportation economy. Communities that are particularly affected by transportation emissions will be selected as sites for charging stations, helping curb localized emissions.
A task force made up of senior officials from each state will meet regularly to manage the program, update its progress, and work on identifying barriers and providing solutions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/08/maxeon-to-set-up-2-6-gw-module-hub-in-mexico-for-u-s-market/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,NORTH AMERICA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 8, 2021",Maxeon to set up 2.6 GW module hub in Mexico for U.S. market,"Singapore-based solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd, plans to convert its two solar module production facilities in Mexico to manufacture shingled modules for the U.S. and other markets.
The two Mexican factories are located in Ensenada and Mexicali, which are both in the state of Baja California close to the U.S. border. The Mexicali facility will serve the U.S. market exclusively.
“The two facilities should reach a capacity of around 2.6 GW,” Maxeon Chief Revenue Officer Mark Babcock told pv magazine during the Intersolar event in Munich, Germany. He said the facility in Ensenada is currently being ramped up to 800 MW and the one in Mexicali should reach 1.8 GW.
Both facilities will manufacture only products based on the company’s mono PERC shingled technology.
Production should start again at the two facilities in late in the first quarter of 2022.
“We have committed deliveries in early Q2,” he said. “We also could sell these products in non-U.S. markets, but right now it’s more profitable shipping them there.”
The solar cells for the new production will be provided by Maxeon’s 1.8 GW manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which will produce uniquely for the Mexican facilities. Babcock said he was not concerned about a possible investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce into solar cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand.
“We have been in Malaysia for years and it is not to get around anything,” he said. “That facility started many years ago.”
Modules produced at the two facilities will be sold as SunPower-branded rooftop products to SunPower itself and Maxeon-branded modules for the utility-scale segment.
“We saw headwinds for Chinese production and we feel very strongly that our manufacturing base in China will serve the rest of the world,” Babcock said. “Given the trade restrictions with the United States, the only way to bring our products to the U.S. market was to use our Mexican factories, which was great, as the facilities have been in operation for many years.”
Maxeon is also examining the possibility of expanding its production capacity for the U.S. market by opening a new factory there, although no location has been identified to date. “We made that public in our latest earnings call,” he stated. “The final decision will depend to some degree on the measures that the U.S. Congress may introduce to support solar manufacturing.”
Finding the rights partners to build the rest of the supply chain will be crucial.
“It is not only about the cells, you need the glass, the aluminum and the backsheets and without this ecosystem it will be impossible,” he said.

Georgia Power wins approval for a battery energy storage system. The Mossy Branch Battery Facility will connect to and charge directly from the electric transmission grid.
China’s electric power woes cast clouds on U.S. solar’s near-term future. The solar manufacturing supply chain is among the Chinese industries hit by a combination of soaring power demand, coal shortages for power generation, and carbon emission reduction measures.
Solar array now helps power a wastewater treatment plant. In a virtual net metering arrangement, SolRiver Capital completed a 3 MW solar project for a municipal plant in Pennsylvania.
California can cut power costs almost 20% by moving its RPS to 2040. Accelerated and unprecedented additions of renewable generation and energy storage will be needed.
