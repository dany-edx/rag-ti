Honeysuckle, if completed, would be a 150 MW installation, among the largest of the projects being announced seemingly weekly, as Indiana ups its solar commitment.
According to an official with RES, Honeysuckle solar farm has been in the works for more than a year; the company looks to begin construction next year and finish in 2023. The farm would create a maximum of three permanent full-time jobs.
The dates could be pushed back, however, as RES  has yet to find a buyer and an electrical off-taker for the planned installation.
A larger issue facing the project could come from tension over the new tax-increment financing district, or TIF, that would be created for the project.
When a local government creates a TIF, the base property value within the district is locked, even before the creation of the district. From that point on, any new taxes on increased value in the district go directly to the city or county redevelopment commission.
In this instance, the money raised by the TIF would go toward paying back RES for some or all of the property taxes the company pays on the project.
Indiana, a state historically committed to the fossil fuel industry, has seen a solar renaissance, especially at the utility-level in the last several years. In March, Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO) signed a build-transfer agreement for the 200 MW Elliot Solar project, set to be built in the southwestern part of the state with Capital Dynamics.
Later, the utility company announced 900 MW of solar across three projects: the 200 MW Cavalry Solar project, paired with 60 MW of energy storage; the 265 MW Dunns Bridge Solar I project; and the 435 MW of solar and 75 MW of battery storage Dunns Bridge Solar II project.
NIPSCO also signed a long-term power purchase agreement for 280 MW of the power generated by Capital Dynamics’ upcoming Gibson Solar project and a build & transfer agreement for the 200 MW Indiana Crossroads Solar Park .

Arizona regulators agree to delay the state’s clean energy goal to 2070,"Arizona utility regulators voted 3-2 to advance an amended package aimed at moving Arizona’s regulated utilities to 100% carbon-free energy by 2070. The vote came after the energy rules package failed at the commission’s May 5 meeting.
The amended energy rules will now go back through the formal rulemaking process which allows for public comment before eventually coming back to the commission for a final vote.
In early May, regulators voted down new rules that would have required most of the state’s electricity providers to get all of their power from clean energy sources by 2050. That plan had been backed by the state’s regulated utilities and was given initial approval by the commission on a 4-1 vote last November after three years of work.
When it came up for a vote on May 5, however, the plan ran afoul of an amendment that would have turned requirements into voluntary goals. That change cost the support of the two Democrats on the panel.
Following the surprise defeat, several compromises were made among commissioners to reach the votes needed to advance the rules package.
For example, a joint amendment from commissioners Anna Tovar and Jim O’Connor extended the deadline by which utilities must reach 100% carbon-free emissions from 2050 to 2070. Interim standards begin with a 50% reduction by 2032, a 65% reduction by 2040, an 80% reduction by 2050, and a 95% reduction by 2060.
Three other amendments which were adopted add a Ratepayer Impact Measure Test, make changes to the portfolio options utilities must include in their Integrated Resource Plans, and add the definition of ‘All Source’ which includes supply-side and demand-side resources.
Chairwoman Lea Márquez Peterson offered an amendment to allow a utility to seek a fair return on the fair value of investments made in demand-side resources, such as energy efficiency and demand response.
The regulatory package is out of step with clean energy goals already announced by the state’s electricity providers.
Arizona Public Servuce announced in January 2020 that it plans to get all its power from non-carbon emitting sources by 2050 and to end use of coal-fired power plants by 2031.
The utility gets about 25% of its power from the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating station west of Phoenix. It plans to add utility-scale solar power plants, increase battery storage, and looks to homeowners to add more rooftop solar panels to supply electricity.
Tucson Electric Power said last year it will retire its coal plants by 2032 and get more than 70% of its power from solar and wind by 2035.
Non-regulated Salt River Project said in early May that it planned to more than double its 2025 utility-scale solar commitment to add 2,025 MW of new utility-scale solar energy to its power system by the end of its 2025 fiscal year. The new goal is more than 1,000 MW beyond SRP’s original 2025 commitment of 1,000 MW, announced in November 2018.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/27/enough-solar-and-wind-to-clean-the-u-s-power-grid-available-yesterday/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 27, 2021",Enough solar and wind to clean the U.S. power grid… available yesterday,"In order to clean the U.S. power grid, wind, solar and energy storage professionals will need to deploy over a terawatt of additional clean electricity capacity.
No problem, drill sergeant! The developers are at the ready!
According to power plant waiting lists around the country, over half of the generation we need is already in queue. But curb your enthusiasm: the power grid isn’t yet ready to take on these projects, and many of them won’t be built.
What matters most is not the low rate of project completion, but that this emerging data sends the signal that developers have already completed reconnaissance on more than half the sites needed to reach our clean electricity goals.

The Department of Energy’s Electricity Markets & Policy Group at Berkeley Lab (EMP) has released new data tools that summarize the proposed projects in the nation’s power grid interconnection queues. The queues represent 85% of the country’s electricity sales.
Included within this release is a data rich interactive tool, a graphic slide deck discussion, and the cumulative queue data itself.
The key data show that we have more than 750 GWac of electricity generation capacity in the queues, and 90% of that is clean energy-related.
More recently, added capacities from renewable electricity sources have completely dominated the queue. The chart below was taken from the interactive data tool. It shows that gas represents the only fossil capacity added since 2016. Solar and solar+battery dominated new capacity in 2020.

With a total of 462 GWac, solar accounts for the largest share of generator capacity in the queues. Applying the standard 1.25 module-to-inverter ratio results in 577 GWdc of solar capacity. Currently, installed U.S. solar capacity is just over 100 GWdc.
Wind, at 209 GWac, represents the second largest capacity volume in the queue. Offshore wind represents 61 GWac of that amount, having started from almost zero last year.
With both the East and West Coasts embracing offshore wind, and with technological advancements like floating wind, we could hypothetically power the whole of the United States. Expect this capacity to grow massively in future reports.
And while there is no nuclear, coal, or “other” capacity to speak of, there is 74 GWac of natural gas capacity in the queues. pv magazine USA has reported that while substantial volumes of new fossils are built annually, there has been zero net new fossil capacity since the mid 2000’s. New gas capacity primarily replaces dirtier, less flexible, and more expensive coal capacity.
In addition to the generation hardware, the queues now hold greater than 200 GW of energy storage. The capacity value – the number of consecutive hours that 200 GW can be delivered  – is not yet publicly available. The greatest number of projects may involve 4-hour batteries, but there are many shapes and sizes in our current market.
The real energy storage story isn’t volume, but rate of growth. At the end of 2019, there were about 50 GW of storage power capacity; by the end of 2020 that number had ballooned 400%.

A little over half of all the energy storage capacity is coupled with solar and wind power. A recent analysis by the EMP team suggests that there would be significantly less coupling without the IRS’s Investment Tax Credit, which applies to batteries when they’re paired with solar.
The absolute volume of energy storage in the queue is probably between 400 and 800 GWh. That might seem small compared to our full year electricity use of 4,000,000 GWh. However, that potential 800 GWh provides nearly two of the 12 hours of energy storage that is needed for the U.S. power grid to reach 80% wind plus solar.
A key detail of the report is that a large percentage of this volume will not be built. Historically, less than one-quarter of projects that entered the interconnection queues were actually built. According to EMP, that number is even lower for solar and wind  power.
One reason for this is that many groups submit projects to the electricity utility when the utility submits a request for proposals (RFP). As a result, these RFPs often become heavily oversubscribed with bids.
And sometimes, as in the case in Texas, there is significant project speculation by those hoping to sell electricity in a nascent solar power market. In fact, the Texas queue for solar power – 64 GW – represents 13% of the nation’s total solar power queue.
Remember, although we can meet U.S. electricity needs with a 100 km x 100 km square placed out in the desert, we don’t need to. In addition to eye-popping utility scale capacity volumes, we are also seeing significant volumes of solar built on residential and commercial rooftops.
For instance, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Virginia all have solar power programs deploying systems up to 5 MWac. The queue data from EMP shows fewer than a dozen 5 MWac projects in Pennsylvania, while is now at least 1 GW of projects submitted.

Furthermore, every single year we install a growing volume of residential and nonresidential (commercial) projects. These two segments on their own just broke 5 GWdc for the first time in 2020. Projected out, that would  mean adding over 100 GW by 2035.
Two documents, a 2030 analysis calculating what’s needed to meet our goal of an 80% clean power grid, and the Biden administration’s 2035 goal of a 90% clean power grid – suggest that we need 950 GW and 1,100 GW, respectively, of solar and wind capacity.
The EMP queue volumes today represent 61% and 71%, respectively, of the capacity required to hit those 2030 and 2035 targets. The largest developers know that much of what is in their queue today won’t be built by then; however, there’s a long way to go.
One of the largest solar developers in the U.S., and possibly the largest member of the queue, NextEra has stated in quarterly financial earnings calls that there is much more development capacity potential in its pipeline than the gigawatts disclosed in its quarterly earnings reports. This capacity will be unlocked, the company said, when and if financial and political conditions support it.

Considering that President Biden announced a federal goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, along with a clean energy standard, we should expect to see queue numbers continue to grow. If project submission-to-completion rates remain as low as they currently are, then we should expect to see truly massive volumes – terawatt plus – enter the queues.
What actually gets built… well, that’s yet to be determined.

Scientists from the University of Arizona created a holographic light collector which they claim is able to increase the efficiency of solar panels by up to 4.5%.
Presented in the paper “Holographic low concentration optical system increasing light collection efficiency of regular solar panels,” published in the Journal of Photonics for Energy (JPE), the collector is built with a low-cost holographic optical element (HOE) and a diffuser and can be easily embedded into conventional PV modules, according to its creators.
In this system design, the optical element is placed symmetrically at the center of the solar panel in order to increase the length of the effective light collection region. “The left half of the HOE diffracts light to a PV cell on the left side of the inactive module surface area (IMSA), and the right half of the HOE diffracts light to a cell on the right,” the academics said, adding that each hologram in the proposed system is able to separate the colors of sunlight and direct them to the solar cells within the solar panel.

The new infrastructure is part of MTA’s plan to upgrade facilities to support its plan to buy only electric buses starting in 2028 and to have an all-electric 5,800-bus fleet by 2040. MTA officials said they plan to boost their electric bus buy this year from 45 to 60 vehicles.
Under the financing agreement, NYPA will provide and install overhead electric bus charging infrastructure for 45 buses at four  locations in the boroughs of Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and, Manhattan. An on-street pantograph (a device mounted on an overhead structure that mates with electrical contacts on the bus’s roof to deliver power) at Williamsburg Bridge Plaza in Brooklyn will be replaced. On-street pantographs provide enough charge during the drivers’ rest periods to keep the bus operating for two full shifts per day.
The scope of work includes design, permitting, and providing and installing 53 overhead direct current fast chargers and related pantographs and gantry support systems. The overhead chargers will allow interoperability between buses from different manufacturers.
Two different vendors have been contracted to help complete the project: ABM and Verdek. Charging hardware will be supplied by ABB and Siemens. The project is expected to be completed within a year. The overhead chargers will have power levels ranging from 150 kW – 300 kW and the on-street charger will be 500 kW.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) launched the Storage Advocacy Network, a branch of the industry trade group to serve as a national and state advocacy voice for energy storage.
SEIA said it plans to offer one board of directors’ seat to the chair of its Storage Division and 10 free memberships to companies focused on energy storage. Through collaboration with various SEIA committees, the Storage Advocacy Network is expected to shape the organization’s lobbying and public affairs advocacy on energy storage.
SEIA said it will put its full weight behind state and federal policies that scale competitive energy storage deployment, increase private sector investment in storage, and create well-paying jobs across the entire storage value chain.
A 2021 reliability assessment from the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) warns that parts of North America are at elevated or high risk of energy shortfalls this summer during above-normal high temperatures. (Read the report here.)

It said that Texas, New England, MISO, and parts of the West are at an “elevated risk” of energy emergencies. In the “high risk” category is California, which relies on large energy imports during peak demand scenarios and when solar resource output declines in the evening hours.
The assessment said that although more than 3 GW of additional resources are expected in California this summer compared to 2020, most will be solar photovoltaic (PV) generation. It said that these plants can provide energy to support peak demand, but output falls off in late afternoon while high demand often remains. NERC said that reliance on imports during these periods is an “increasing reliability risk.”
(Read “Agencies release final report into California’s heat-related blackouts.”)
It said that while actions taken by the California Public Utilities Commission, CAISO and utilities to procure additional resources will help, the Western Interconnection’s increase in demand and decline in resources may reduce the amount of surplus capacity available when California is in shortfall.

The assessment also said that wildfire season in the western United States and Canada poses risk to bulk power system reliability. It said that government agencies are warning of the potential for above-normal wildfire risk beginning in July in parts of the western United States as well as central and western Canada.
The summer assessment said that in Texas, on-peak planning reserve margins have increased to 15.3% from 12.9% last summer with the addition of 7,858 MW wind, solar, and battery resources. It said, however, that extreme weather can affect both generation and demand and cause energy shortages that lead to energy emergencies in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). It added that with a “significant portion” of electricity supply coming from wind generation, operators must have sufficient flexible resources to cover periods of low-wind output.
The assessment said that MISO and NPCC-New England have sufficient resources for periods of peak demand. However, above-normal levels of demand are likely to exceed capacity resources and require additional non-firm transfers from surrounding areas.
The annual assessment said that all other areas have sufficient resources to manage normal summer peak demand and are at low risk of energy shortfalls from more extreme demand or generation outage conditions.
