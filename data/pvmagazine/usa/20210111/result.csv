The growth comes in spite of an especially bad first half of the year, with the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic leading to funding being down 25% year-over-year in H1.
The rebound and recovery were driven in large part by publicly traded solar companies, with several initial public offerings and securitization deals creating what Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu referred to as an “investment haven” in the uncertain Covid economy.
The solar exchange traded fund (ETF) significantly chipped into the H2 turnaround, rising 225%, with 15 solar stocks up over 100% in 2020. An ETF is
While total global solar funding rose in 2020, global venture capital and private equity funding in the sector fell to $1.2 billion in 41 deals, compared to $1.4 billion in 53 deals in 2019. Nearly all of this funding – $1.1 billion of it – went to 27 downstream companies.
Among these companies, India’s Ayana Renewable Power led the way, raising $390 million, followed by Silicon Ranch Corp., which brought in $225 million. Brighte, an Australian company, raised $76 million; Singapore’s Sunseap Group raised $72 million; and Aurora Solar and Zero Mass Water tied for fifth, each raising $50 million.
Of the VC funding that didn’t go to downstream companies, solar service providers raised $61 million, PV companies raised $17 million, balance-of-system companies brought in $15 million, thin-film technology companies raised $15 million, and concentrated photovoltaic companies raised $5.5 million.
Alongside all of the funding, 39.5 GW of large-scale solar projects were acquired in 2020, compared to 26.1 GW in 2019. According to the Mercom, those 39.5 GW represent the largest amount of projects acquired in a single year to date. The capacity came from 231 large-scale project acquisitions in 2020, compared to 192 such transactions in 2019.
There were also 62 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals in 2020 – compared to 65 in 2019 – most of which involved downstream companies. No surprise, the largest transaction in 2020 was Sunrun’s $3.2 billion, all-stock acquisition of Vivint Solar.
Debt financing came to $8.3 billion in 2020, a 6.4% increase over 2019. Eight securitization deals totaling $2.2 billion were recorded in 2020, which Mercom said represented the largest amount of securitization financing ever in a year.
Finally, public market financing saw an exponential rise, up 101%, with $5.1 billion in 2020. Array Technologies raised $1.2 billion in its initial public offering in Q4 2020.

As part of its sustainability efforts, team owner Comcast Spectacor added a 1.06 MW rooftop solar array at the Virtua Center Flyers Skate Zone at Voorhees, New Jersey.
The company partnered with SunPower on the installation, which started in May and was recently completed in November. The facility also serves as the training spot for the National Lacrosse League’s Philadelphia Wings and offers public ice-skating sessions and youth hockey activities year-round. In addition, the facility replaced its traditional propane-fueled Zamboni machine with a new electric model.

Comcast Spectacor, a major entertainment company that also owns the Wells Fargo Center arena, said it will sell the renewable energy certificates (RECs) from the onsite solar project and purchase national RECs to provide all Spectacor facilities with 100% renewable energy. These latest developments build on Wells Fargo Center’s previous deal with Constellation to fully cover the arena’s power needs using wind energy resources.
“The Flyers will now train and compete in facilities completely powered by renewable electricity, which furthers Comcast NBCUniversal’s ongoing commitment to sustainable innovation,” said Dave Scott, chairman and CEO of Comcast Spectacor.
Kim Davis, NHL senior executive vice president of social impact, growth initiatives and legislative affairs, said these efforts “epitomize our overall NHL Green environmental sustainability work in North American community rinks where we play and enjoy the game.”
Such green initiatives are part of a growing trend among major U.S. sports franchises, from the National Football League to NASCAR, that are embracing solar and other renewables to help power their stadiums and venues.

In a “Today in Energy” report, the agency said it expects nearly 40 GW of new utility-scale capacity to start commercial operation this year. Of that, solar power will make up the largest share, 39%, followed by wind power at 31%. Natural gas additions will account for 11%, and a new nuclear reactor at Georgia’s Vogtle site is expected to make up about 3%. Notably, battery energy storage is projected to contribute 11% of expected new capacity.

The EIA said project developers and plant owners expect utility-scale solar to set a new record by adding 15.4 GW of capacity to the U.S. grid in 2021. This new capacity will surpass last year’s nearly 12 GW increase, based on reported additions through October (6 GW) and scheduled additions for the last two months of 2020 (5.7 GW).
More than half of the new utility-scale solar capacity in 2021 is planned for four states: Texas (28%), Nevada (9%), California (9%), and North Carolina (7%). The EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts an additional 4.1 GW of small-scale solar capacity to enter service by the end of 2021.

EIA said it expects utility-scale battery storage capacity to more than quadruple in 2021, with 4.3 GW slated to come online. The EIA called the rapid growth of renewables a major driver in the expansion of battery capacity. It also noted that the 409 MW Manatee center in Florida, among the world’s largest solar-powered battery projects, is scheduled to go online by late 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/11/cec-awards-5-million-grant-for-hybrid-energy-storage-demonstration/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 11, 2021",CEC awards $5 million grant for hybrid energy storage demonstration,"San Diego-based Indian Energy LLC received a grant worth more than $5 million from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to develop and demonstrate long-duration, non-lithium-ion-based energy storage technologies.
The grant is part of the CEC’s Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) program and aims to demonstrate the value of energy storage technologies, evaluate how they meet varying customer needs, and help increase grid resiliency.
With the funds, Indian Energy, along with construction management partner Webcor, will develop, integrate, and commission several innovative Hybrid Modular Storage Systems (HMSS) as a long-duration energy storage technology demonstration and deployment research project.
Webcor’s part of the contract award totals more than $1.9 million, including $1.5 million in match funding. Also receiving project budget line items are Eos Energy Storage ($983,000), Avalon Energy ($624,000), and the Electric Power Research Institute (nearly $400,000).
In its grant application, Indian Energy said that large-scale energy storage is a critical success factor in the widespread de-carbonization of the nation’s electric power generation and delivery capability. To date, however, “single technology solutions do not offer the required capacity, are expensive, have short duty lives, and much of their approach is harmful to the environment when decommissioning occurs,” the company added.
The HMSS project involves developing six module types, each capable of meeting the requirements of long-duration energy storage and the needs of the state grid operators.
Located in the 52 Area of Camp Pendleton to leverage existing clean energy assets, the HMSS will demonstrate how to optimize the productivity of a variety of solar assets by charging with clean energy and shifting the delivery of that energy to peak demand and evening hours. It will also demonstrate how to shift to 100% renewables, as well as provide deep resiliency toward grid disturbances such as wildfires and cyber attacks.
Three specific HMSS modules will be made of flow batteries, supercapacitors, fast-responding mechanical energy storage and zinc hybrid cathodes in integrated installations. The other three modules will be funded by other government agencies and private industry partners. Developed using a “system of systems approach,” the energy storage technologies will also include an innovative hybrid controller which will ensure that each technology will be used at its most advantageous operating point, or optimized.
The project includes installing different types and configurations of batteries, testing them, and then using them as one large unit, to test how such a unit would be used on the California power grid. The best HMSS then will be scaled to achieve 400 kW for 10 hours, the requirement stated in the grant.
The project is preceded by nearly a decade of renewable and resiliency activities in the Navy Southwest Region and adds to Indian Energy’s recent award of more than $6 million in funding by the CEC to create two laboratories to test advanced energy storage technologies. The energy storage grants are being developed in partnership with the United States Marine Corps and the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians.
Indian Energy is a 100% Native American-owned utility-scale and microgrid development and systems integration firm. It specializes in developing large-scale advanced energy resiliency solutions for the Department of Defense, Community Choice Aggregators and Tribal Utility Authorities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/11/sunrise-brief-kauai-co-op-project-with-aes-combines-solar-and-pumped-hydro/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 11, 2021",Sunrise brief: Kaua’i co-op project with AES combines solar and pumped hydro,"Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative signed agreements with AES Corp. to develop, build and operate a solar pumped storage hydro project known as the West Kaua‘i Energy Project.
When operational, the solar array will provide up to 35 MW to the island’s grid and store up to 240 MWh for dispatch during evening peak. The hydro resources are expected to produce 24 MW on average daily, including 12 hours of storage to be used overnight.
A power purchase agreement (PPA) related to the project was filed with the Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission in late 2020.
The pumped hydropower and battery energy storage are designed to shift most of the project’s output to the nighttime peak. In total, the project is expected offset the use of 8.5 million gallons of fossil fuels annually and supply irrigation water delivery to support diversified agriculture on state-owned lands.
In 2018, AES and the utility cooperative broke ground on  a 28 MW project that used SunPower E-Series PV modules mounted on a single-axis trackers. The project was paired with a 20 MW/100 MWh lithium-ion battery system based on 13,000 Samsung SDI battery modules.
That project enabled the  cooperative to meet around a third of the island’s electricity demand with solar; a combination of biomass and customer-owned solar lifted renewables’ total to around 60% of the island’s electricity mix. With the latest AES project, that portion is expected to reach 80%.
Kaua’i has no electrical interconnection to other islands, which means it must balance supply and demand on its own grid, a sometimes-challenge as high levels of renewables are introduced. Resource options on the island also are limited due to the presence of endangered birds; that means no wind turbines have been built, which leaves the cooperative unable to tap daytime solar and overnight wind.
To date, AES has more than 200 MW of solar, solar + storage, and wind resources in operation or under development across Hawai‘i.
El Paso Electric filed a Transportation Electrification Plan (TEP) with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) for approval. The goal of this two-year plan is to increase the use of electric vehicles by incentivizing the installation and usage of smart charging infrastructure through rebate and pilot rate programs while addressing the challenges associated with the lack of awareness of both the technology and benefits of EVs.
The proposed plan includes:
The utility said it expects final approval in the second quarter of 2021, with a launch by the third quarter of 2021.
Pivot Energy and Joliet Junior College completed a 1.3 MW solar system at the college’s main campus in Illinois. The solar array consists of 3,542 solar panels and was installed by solar developer Pivot Energy. It is expected to save the college more than $1.6 million in electricity expenses over 25 years.

The system is expected to offset the college’s total energy consumption by 22.5%, making the campus one of the greenest in the state.
The panels were provided by retired Joliet oncologist Dr. Sarode Pundaleeka with Sunlarge Industries. Pundaleeka said he hopes the solar array will inspire future generations to pursue careers in clean energy and convey the importance of sustainability to all campus visitors.
Since 2000, JJC has completed over 50 sustainability projects, including opening multiple LEED-certified buildings. In addition to the solar project, a pollinator habitat mixture will be planted around the panels using native grasses and forbs, which will support bee and butterfly habitats and aid in drought and stormwater mitigation.
Consumers Energy, Pine Gate Renewables and Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, L.P., said that five new solar energy projects in Genesee County and three in Saginaw County, Michgan, are online.
The eight sites were built and are operated by Pine Gate Renewables and are owned by Kayne Anderson. Consumers Energy has 20-year agreements to purchase the energy from the projects. Each solar farm has a 2 MW capacity.
The solar farms add to Consumers Energy’s 10 MW of solar energy capacity previously available to serve its customers.
Consumers Energy has agreements to purchase energy from six additional Kayne Anderson solar projects elsewhere in Michigan which are scheduled to begin operating this month.
Southern Company said it published a Sustainable Financing Framework. It said the framework will allow it and its business units to issue sustainable financing instruments and allocate proceeds to investments in eligible green and social project categories.
Include are projects related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, access to essential services (such as education and telecommunications), and employment advancement and development opportunities.
Eligible social projects include the procurement of products and services from diverse suppliers, education assistance for minority people, as well as economic advancement and development opportunities for underserved employees, communities and students.
The inaugural bond under the Framework, a $400 million green bond, was issued January 8 by Southern Power Co. With that issue, Southern said that its system to date has issued nearly $3.9 billion in green bonds.
The utility holding company said its framework aligns with The Green Bond Principles, 2018; Social Bond Principles, 2020; Sustainability Bond Guidelines, 2018; and Green Loan Principles, 2018.
