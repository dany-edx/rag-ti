The grants have led to the construction of 93 solar + storage projects across 22 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To date, the grant awards have resulted in the completion of 30 solar + storage projects in low-income communities and communities of color.
The grants originate from CEG’s Technical Assistance Fund, a grant program founded in 2014 as a branch of the organization’s Resilient Power Project. That project, in turn, was launched to provide relief in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, with the goal of increasing access to the resilience, health, and economic benefits of solar + storage in underserved communities.
The Technical Assistance Fund issues targeted grants averaging about $10,000 each to support solar + storage projects that are in the early stages of exploration. The grants fill a capacity gap among community-serving nonprofits and affordable housing providers that lack the in-house expertise to evaluate solar + storage as well as the financial resources to hire experienced technical services providers.
In addition to offering project-based technical assistance, a portion of the grant funding also supports knowledge-building for nonprofits new to solar + storage. As of 2021, more than 50% of grant dollars have been awarded to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color organizations.
An example of the effect of the program in action is the Jubilee Housing and New Partners Community Solar. In 2018 it received a $9,000 CEG grant for a technoeconomic feasibility assessment of solar + storage for the Maycroft Apartments, an affordable housing development in Washington, D.C.
The resulting analysis was used to secure a $65,000 grant from the Pepco Foundation to fund the battery storage portion of a $327,000 solar + storage system. The completed project delivers monthly energy savings to the residents and supports a resilience center that  provides access to lighting, cooling, food storage and preparation, and charging for phones and medical devices during outages.
“Jubilee Housing expresses its gratitude to Clean Energy Group for their grant,” said Martin Mellett, Jubilee Housing Vice President of External Affairs. He said the grant not only allowed the organizations to create a first-of-its-kind Resiliency Center at the Maycroft Apartments, but “is channeling the benefits of solar + storage to low-income housing residents – who most severely feel the impact of energy outages.”
Clean Energy Group is currently raising funds to achieve its goal of awarding another $1 million in Technical Assistance Funds over the next three years.

The PPA represents the utility’s largest standalone solar power plant currently under development  northwest of Flagstaff, Arizona.
CO Bar Solar is slated to be commercially operational in 2024 and will deliver between 440 and 480 megawatts (MWdc) of renewable energy to SRP customers. Clēnera, a developer of large-scale solar and storage projects, and a unit of Enlight Renewable Energy, will construct and operate CO Bar Solar.
CO Bar Solar will occupy up to 2,400 acres of private land in Coconino County. Construction is expected to begin in 2023.
SRP said it expects that nearly half of the retail energy it delivers to its customers will come from carbon-free resources by 2025. The resources contribute to SRP’s goals to reduce carbon intensity by 65%  in 2035 and by 90% in 2050, compared with 2005 levels.
In August, NextEra Energy Resources said it would build the 260 MW Sonoran Energy Center solar project in Buckeye, Arizona, near Phoenix. SRP contracted for the output from the energy center, which will include one of the largest solar-charged battery projects in Arizona. Construction work could begin this fall and the capital investment is pegged at $600 million.
SRP also contracted for a large-scale solar and battery storage project at Pinal Central Solar Energy Center, and is bringing online a new grid-charged battery storage project at the Agua Fria Generating Station.
Late last year, SRP brought online the 100 MW East Line Solar and the 100 MW Saint Solar. The two utility-scale solar fields serve commercial, municipal, and educational customers who participate in SRP’s Sustainable Energy Offering.

Project financing will be provided by Fusion Renewable. Total engineering, procurement and construction, and renewable energy credits could exceed $500 million, said iSun.
A $7 million development and professional services contract is included in the project, iSun said. This is the second award executed by iSun’s utility division, and brings total contract awards over the past six months to $8.25 million for 566 MW of capacity.
The solar capacity will be sited at three Alabama locations, and is expected to produce enough power to power over 85,000 homes. Notice to proceed on the first phase is expected in 2022.
In April, iSun acquired the intellectual property of Oakwood Construction Services, enabling entry into the solar development services market. Earlier in September, iSun acquired Vermont-based installer SunCommon in a stock and cash deal, citing SunCommon’s strong performance in customer acquisition as a motivating factor.
The projects were structured by Fusion Renewable and will be financed and owned by a joint venture involving Israeli public companies. Mobile, Alabama-based Altmayer Limited Partnership is serving as an active development partner in the project.
The capacity would more than double Alabama’s solar capacity, which according to the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA),  totaled 283 MW through the end of the second quarter. The three projects would each outsize the largest solar project in the state, River Bend Solar, a 75 MW facility that was completed in 2016.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/22/generac-unveils-microinverter-as-it-expands-into-solar-and-energy-storage/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2021",Generac unveils microinverter as it expands into solar and energy storage,"Generac, perhaps better known for backup generators, unveiled two models of solar microinverters for residential applications.
Introduced are the Generac PWRmicro 1:1, a single-module microinverter, and the PWRmicro 2:1, a 720W, dual-module microinverter. Generac said the products will be available to order and ship in early 2022.
The units have integrated grounding and modular bus cabling, which Generac said reduces install time through simplified wiring. The two model types are compatible, so installers may have greater design flexibility with the ability to mix and match.
Generac partnered with Chilicon Power this July to bring the microinverters to market. The microinverters were originally planned to be unveiled at Solar Power International New Orleans this month, but damages and power outages caused by Hurricane Ida cancelled the in-person event.

The microinverter product release continues Generac’s move into the solar and energy storage space. Generac also offers a backup battery storage solution, called the PWRcell, which features a modular design.
The PWRcell battery can scale from a 3-module, 9 kWh capacity, 4.5 kW output, to a 6-module, 18 kWh, 9kW output. If more storage is needed, multiple PWRcell battery cabinets can be integrated to a single Generac PWRcell inverter for up to 36 kWh capacity and 11 kW continuous backup power.
The PWRcell string inverters feature 7.6 kW and 11.4 kW models, with peak efficiencies of 97.3% and 97.7% respectively.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/22/seia-warns-that-tariffs-could-jeopardize-one-third-of-solar-projects-by-2023/,"LEGAL,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2021",SEIA warns that tariffs could jeopardize one-third of solar projects by 2023,"The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warned that tariffs on imported panels from three Asian countries would jeopardize nearly 30% of the solar capacity the U.S. is expected to install over the next two years.
The Commerce Department could decide in early October whether to launch a trade investigation into solar cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. Those countries account for 80% of all panel imports into the United States.
In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the SEIA said the duties – proposed by an anonymous group of domestic manufacturers last month – would be devastating to the growth of the renewable energy sector.
“I cannot overstate the dire threat that these reckless petitions are imposing on hundreds of thousands of American families,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO in a statement. She said the petitioners are asking Commerce to “misinterpret U.S. law” and “overturn a decade of department decisions” in solar trade cases. “We urge Commerce to use its discretion and dismiss these frivolous petitions.”
(Read “Making sense of the trade triple-threat to solar.”)
The tariffs would jeopardize 18 GW of solar projects by 2023, the SEIA said. The U.S. industry is expected to install a combined 63 GW in 2022 and 2023, according to a forecast from research firm Wood Mackenzie.
The petition from the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention is one of several efforts by the U.S. solar manufacturing sector to seek trade remedies to allow their products to compete with cheaper Asian panels that dominate the market. SEIA for years has opposed tariffs on solar imports because those products have fueled the sector’s growth.

In their petition, the unnamed companies asked the Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The group filed three petitions in mid-August through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
Commerce could launch an investigation in early October based on the petitions. A preliminary determination could be issued in 180 days with a final determination next summer. Any duties would be retroactive to the start of the investigation.
