Philip Shen, managing director of ROTH Capital Partners said an industry contact reports as much as 3 GW have been held since the law has been enacted.
As much as nine to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering US markets by the end of the year, said Shen.
The Xinjiang region of China, which is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, an essential material in conventional solar modules, has come under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Beijing has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said developers across the United States plan to install 17.8 GW of capacity this year. However, through six months, only 4.2 GW has been installed and brought online as module supply challenges led to cancellations and delays. Ongoing module supply challenges may continue to hamper deployment.
The UFLPA was passed last December and first enacted this summer. The law bans all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor.

To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at an entity subject to “rebuttable presumption” that there is a connection to forced labor, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/15/new-platform-centralizes-ppa-market-data/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 15, 2022",New platform centralizes PPA market data,"From pv magazine global
In recent years demand has been high for renewables to enter the grid and for power purchase agreements (PPAs) to make use of them. However, on top of the already tricky state of supply chains, geopolitical unrest and grid congestion heightening the risk of curtailment along with “revenue cannibalization,” the PPA market has proven increasingly volatile. 
According to Zurich-based consultancy Pexapark, approximately 400 MW of PPAs were closed in Europe in March 2022, representing a sharp contraction in the market from February, when 1.3 GW of PPAs were contracted. The war in Ukraine is having repercussions on PPA prices and Europe could see very complicated electricity price curves in the remainder of the year, the analyst explained.
Prasun Chaudhury, director of data solutions at LevelTen Energy, told pv magazine that “instant access to fresh data is even more critical in today’s volatile energy market, which has been changing rapidly over the past two years.” Chaudhury noted rises in renewable PPA price offers of 30% in North America and 47% in Europe. 

That access to PPA price data has long been a challenge.
“Price offers are only shared directly between buyers and sellers,” another LevelTen spokesperson said. “And often as a product of weeks-long FRP processes that can result in outdated prices by the time they are completed. Without access to data from a centralized marketplace, clean energy buyers, sellers, investors and analysts struggled to get the data they needed for benchmarking, modeling and analysis.” 
A cursory look at some of the platform’s features shows data on everything from price offers, capacity sizes, projected settlement values and status updates across North America and Europe. The data can also be examined for particular contract details, such as operation dates, contract tenor, shape, escalator, non-settlement thresholds, and market price floors.
The data itself is taken from the LevelTen’s online PPA marketplace, in which the company boasts 90% of renewable energy developers in North America and more than 60% of developers in Europe take part. As an example of the kind of PPA deals the market is currently seeing, Chaudhury points to a deal between Constellation and US media and technology giant Comcast. The 250 MW deal represents a 15-year PPA with Scout Clean Energy’s Blue Sky solar project in northern Illinois.
The market may be in a volatile phase, and solar PPA prices may have risen for the past two years, but the demand for solar PPAs remains strong.  In the last six months, LevelTen’s Energy Marketplace has seen organizations seek to procure clean energy PPAs for around 6 TWh, a figure which rises to 75 TWh over the life of the PPAs. 
As developers hustle to catch up with demand, Chaudhury says the MarketPulse platform can deliver “greater transparency” to the PPA market while empowering “energy sellers to price their PPAs more effectively, buyers to quickly compare and benchmark price offers, and investors to conduct thorough due diligence and inform financial models.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/15/solar-industry-reacts-to-passage-of-the-inflation-reduction-act/,"LOOKING BACK,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 15, 2022",Solar industry reacts to passage of the Inflation Reduction Act,"Both the US Senate and House of Representatives voted to enact the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It now must reach President Biden’s desk, where he is expected to sign the bill into law. 
Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is focused on supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience. The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest Americans and corporations. 
The legislation contains numerous provisions to support the US solar industry, including a long-term extension of the federal investment tax credit, significant domestic manufacturing incentives, labor standards, production credits and more. Below are some reactions from around the industry: 
Sunrun
“What an historic moment for our country! Sunrun applauds everyone in Congress and the Biden Administration who helped accomplish this major step forward for humanity. The Inflation Reduction Act will combat inflation, lower energy prices and help our country meet its climate goals. It will boost U.S. manufacturing, create millions of good-paying jobs, expand access and equity for those who need it most, and improve grid stability and resilience. The need for families to take control of their energy and for broader U.S. energy independence has never been clearer. All of us at Sunrun are focused on scaling as fast as humanly possible to provide customers with a more affordable, clean and resilient way to power their homes and lives.” Mary Powell, CEO.
Nextracker
“Nextracker has been investing for years to expand our U.S. supply chain and now with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, it’s go time. We applaud the smart industrial policy in the IRA to create jobs, lower energy costs, and rebuild our industrial manufacturing capacity.” Dan Shugar, CEO.
Baringa Partners US
“This amounts to clear supply and demand side incentives that will enable the U.S. to build clean energy technology at a blistering pace while also investing in the necessary domestic manufacturing capability – a measure key to enhancing energy security.” John Baron, senior consultant, energy. 
Advanced Energy Economy
“This era-defining agreement should mark the beginning of the end for fossil fuel dominance in America. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, clean energy technologies will be fully unleashed. Clean energy manufacturers and developers alike will now have the right financial tools and the policy certainty they need to produce and buy the components that power these innovative technologies here in America. That’s going to translate into millions of family-supporting jobs and billions in energy savings for American households.” Nat Kreamer, CEO.
American Council on Renewable Energy
“We have waited many years for this moment. With House passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress has acted to address the climate crisis and accelerate the transition to renewable energy. For more than a century, our tax code has been weighted to promote fossil fuels, but now we’re just a presidential signature away from a level playing field that will unleash dramatic clean energy growth. We cannot say that this bill alone will achieve our climate goals, but for the first time, it puts us on the path. For our part at ACORE, this is the culmination of years of determined efforts alongside our members and many allies. We look forward to working with the Biden administration as they implement this historic achievement, and work to build on it with additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO.
Southern Environmental Law Center
“We applaud the House and Senate for taking bold and necessary action to pass this historic legislation, which is far from flawless but overall represents a promising and necessary step forward. This bill lays the foundation for Southern communities and individuals alike to take tangible and feasible steps to address the impacts of climate change, all while boosting local economies and advancing us toward cleaner, more affordable energy options. We look forward to moving these policies into practice to cut carbon emissions, improve energy efficiency commitments, and open access to clean energy across the board, and we’ll be ready to fight anything resulting from this that could harm Southern communities.” Nat Mund, director of federal affairs.
First Solar
“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act by the US House of Representatives is a victory for America. First, it represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to achieve energy security and to ensure that the fight against climate change is powered by solar technology that represents American values and principles and is produced here, at home. Second, it’s an opportunity to ensure that the benefit of this groundbreaking legislation is shared, creating jobs and economic value where needed most. And finally, it will facilitate the cycles of innovation necessary to ensure our country’s leadership in clean energy technology, ensuring that the next generation of solar technologies is developed and made by America. Once signed into law by President Biden, we expect that this legislation will be the cornerstone of our country’s transition to a truly sustainable, decarbonized future.”  Mark Widmar, CEO.
Ultra-Low Carbon Solar Alliance
“For the first time in decades, we have a meaningful policy to support not just using solar energy but making solar products here in the USA. This bill is a major step forward for energy independence and catalyzes the growth of a sustainable, resilient low-carbon solar supply chain by spurring much-needed expansion of domestic solar manufacturing. The Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance welcomes the House passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and looks forward to it becoming law.” Michael Parr, executive director.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/15/nine-gigawatt-solar-manufacturing-facility-being-scouted-for-qcell-module-manufacturing/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GEORGIA,SOUTH CAROLINA,TEXAS",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 15, 2022",Nine gigawatt solar manufacturing facility being scouted for Qcell module manufacturing,"Qcells is searching for a place to build a nine gigawatt per year manufacturing facility for their newly branded solar panels in a nearly fully vertically integrated facility. The company is researching locations in Texas, South Carolina or nearby its current base of Georgia.
Qcells has not yet announced these ambitions publicly; however, these plans align with their public position of investing in US manufacturing capacity – if and when the solar module manufacturing credits were passed as part of a climate bill. In fact, these credits were included in the Inflation Reduction Act – which has been passed by the Senate and the House, and is now awaiting the President’s signature.
The potential facility came to light via a series of documents, (1, 2 and 3) in the Local Government Assistance & Economic Analysis Division of Lancaster, and surrounding school districts, in Texas.

The total investment in the facility is estimated to be at least $1.829 billion. Of that, $461 million will be paid to construction workers, and will peak at almost 4,000 individuals in the second year of construction. Once construction is complete, the facility will employ 204 ‘non-qualifying’ permanent positions, and 25 ‘qualifying’ positions. The qualifying positions will have an average income of at least $78,522 per year.
The facility would include a “fully integrated value chain from Ingot, Wafer, Cell, and Module.” The filing notes that raw materials will be shipped in by common carriers – including glass, frame, back sheet, and polysilicon.
Some of the machines, equipment, and tools that will be onsite include:
And while the facility might not be 100% vertically integrated onsite – the polysilicon, glass, and frames will be trucked in – Q Cells’ parent company happens to control the largest solar polysilicon manufacturing in North America. The Moses Lake facility has a current annual manufacturing capacity of 20,000 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon. Hanwha Solutions, the largest shareholder of the facility and the parent company of Q Cells, has announced they plan on retrofitting and restarting the facility in 2023.
A 9 GW per year facility using 3 grams of polysilicon per watt, would require a bit more than 27,000 MT of raw polysilicon per year. Considering the Moses Lake facility manufacturing gear is a few years old, and Hanwha is a global leader in manufacturing technology, one would expect that these facility upgrades could meet Texas’ needs.
The company recently announced a new partnership with a glass manufacturing facility in Canada. This facility has a total glass manufacturing capacity equivalent to 16 GW of solar output.
The company currently has a 1.7 GW per year module assembly facility in Georgia, and has announced 1.4 GW of additional capacity. Q Cells informed pv magazine USA that these new facilities will be in addition to the current and announced facilities. In total, this would bring the company to 12.1 GW of solar panel assembly capacity in the United States.

The law also establishes incentives for pollinator-friendly community solar and commercial and industrial projects and creates a new council that will work toward improving the state’s transmission and distribution grid planning.
The legislation secures the state’s place among the top ten solar states in the country. Currently ranked ninth by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Massachusetts had over 3.6 GW installed through 2021, and over 400 businesses in the industry. This ranking is impressive considering it ranks 16 in population, has limited open land availability, and is in the lower half of the nation in terms of solar irradiance. 
“Massachusetts just enacted groundbreaking climate legislation that will help the Commonwealth invest in the clean energy economy and decarbonize the grid,” said Valessa Souter-Kline, Northeast regional director for SEIA.

Sounter-Kline added that, “We are also excited to see the legislature codify incentives for pollinator-friendly solar projects and support the Commonwealth’s efforts to more thoughtfully consider grid modernization updates and the transmission planning process.”
