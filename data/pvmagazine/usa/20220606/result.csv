Tariffs attached to goods supplied by these countries could range 50 to 250% of the cost of goods and would back-date to the February filing by US-based manufacturer Auxin solar.
The uncertainty and risk level caused by this investigation essentially froze the solar industry in its tracks, with hundreds of megawatts of projects cancelled or delayed and the industry cutting its forecasts for deployment this year in half. This uncertainty will now be alleviated, for now, as the Biden Administration enacted a 24-month moratorium on tariffs from these locations.
This development came with praise from most major players in the solar industry, save US-based manufacturers like First Solar. One of the major criticisms of the investigation was that it appeared to be a feeble, poorly planned attempt to boost US-based manufacturing. Many industry players said they were open to supporting domestic manufacture of US solar goods, but that the tariffs were a short-term measure that blindsided developers and crushed deployment in the near- and mid-term.
The moratorium was launched alongside a few other actions designed to support domestic manufacturing, indicating the White House heard the near-uniform message from the solar industry that executive actions and stated goals were misaligned. With these new actions, the Biden administration is steering the market back toward the high bar of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030, among other climate-driven emissions goals.
While the actions have been generally celebrated, the industry is still awaiting long-term industrial policy like the provisions introduced in earlier drafts of the Build Back Better Act. It is calling for a swift end to the investigation for greater long-term clarity.
“While I applaud the President for his leadership in building a brighter future today, the lingering threat of tariffs stemming from the ongoing circumvention case will continue to jeopardize our clean energy progress. I strongly urge the Department of Commerce to work toward a swift end to this case and put the solar industry fully back to work.” George Hershman, CEO, SOLV Energy
In addition to the halt of tariffs, the White House invoked the Defense Production Act for clean energy, and stated goals to use the full power of federal procurement through master supply agreements and giving solar goods “super preference” status.
The Defense Production Act
In pursuit of a rapid expansion to 22.5 GW of domestic solar manufacturing by 2024, the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 was invoked. This act will not end the antidumping investigation, but it will eliminate the provision that would have back-dated tariffs to the date of the February Auxin Solar petition.
The DPA, to be administered by the Department of Energy will be directed to boost five key technologies, including solar panel parts including modules and module components, insulation for buildings, efficient electric heat pumps for heating and cooling, equipment for making electricity-generated fuels, including electrolyzes, fuel cells, and related platinum group metals, and critical power grid infrastructure like transformers.
The Act will encourage strong labor standards, including agreements for project labor and community benefits that ensure prevailing wages are paid and a quota of local hiring is met. The administration also stated goals of environmental justice and empowering clean energy transition in low-income communities that have historically (and continue to) bear an inequitable burden in energy-related injustices.
Following the announcement, the Biden administration said it will meet with industry, labor, environmental justice, and key stakeholders to enable a strong implementation of the DPA.
Federal procurement
The administration said it is also using the full power of federal procurement in action to increase domestic manufacturing capacity. 
Master Supply Agreements will be put in place to enable domestic clean electricity providers to sell products to the US government rapidly and efficiently. Such agreements standardize contracts, making them easier to administer, and supporting transparent quality control for all parties involved.
It also enacted the use of “Super Preferences”, which apply domestic component content standards for federal procurement of solar projects. The procurement will be in alignment with the Buy American Act.
The White House said these actions combined will pave the way for 10 GW of solar procurement over the next decade by the United States government alone. In cooperation with local and state governments and municipal utilities, the administration said the actions will make a potential market impact of as much as 100 GW over the next decade.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/06/ranking-the-states-of-distributed-solar/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 6, 2022",Ranking the states of distributed solar,"In the recently released report “States of Distributed Solar,” Institute for Local Self Reliance (ILSR) researcher Maria McCoy looks at which states have the most small-scale solar. States with the greatest capacity have more than 300 watts of rooftop and community solar per capita.
In 2021, a record 18.2 GW of solar generation capacity was installed in the United States. Of that total, 5.4 GW was distributed solar, including a record 500,000 homeowners who installed residential solar systems.  Distributed energy resources (DER) are smaller scale solar installations that are connected to lower-voltage distribution grid. Residences and businesses with solar are good examples, where they use the electricity right where it is generated and send the excess to the grid.
The map below from the ILSR report illustrates the saturation of each state’s distributed solar market, relative to population, at the end of 2021.

For the  purposes of the map, community solar in Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York is included as distributed solar. ILSR added its own figures on state community solar capacity to the US Energy Information Administration’s figures on small-scale photovoltaic capacity by state. This sum was divided by state population estimates from the US Census Bureau, resulting in a figure for distributed solar per capita (watts per person). The US EIA does not collect data for Alabama or Georgia.
Top five states:
Although California, Texas, Florida, and North Carolina have the largest overall solar markets, Hawaii, Massachusetts, California, and Arizona have the greatest distributed solar saturation, as measured in installed distributed solar capacity per capita. California, Arizona, Nevada, Massachusetts, and New Jersey all land in the top ten for both distributed solar saturation and total solar generation capacity.

Since the 2020 update, a few states have made remarkable progress. In Texas, California, and Florida, installed capacity grew by more than a gigawatt in 2021 (4.3 GW, 3.0 GW, and 1.5 GW, respectively). Virginia’s installed solar capacity grew by just under 1 GW (955 megawatts). In Maine, Ohio, Illinois, and Wisconsin, solar capacity was doubled since 2021. Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, and Michigan also saw rapid expansion of solar generation capacity. Eighteen states can now claim more than 1,000 megawatts of total solar capacity and 40 have more than 100 MW.
Community solar
Community solar is another example of distributed energy and it is currently available in 20 state and the District of Columbia. These installations offer the same electric bill stability and savings as rooftop solar, but operate remotely under a subscription model.  In three years, the Biden Administration targets 5 million US households to be served by community solar, leading to an estimated $1 billion in utility bill savings. Recently, New York State surpassed 1GW of total community solar capacity, edging out Minnesota as the top state for development.
Community solar installations– larger than residential solar installations, but smaller than utility-owned solar fields — are the most cost-effective size for solar. The following graphic highlights the four community solar-enabling states — Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York. The figures for community solar saturation are calculated by dividing installed community solar capacity by state population.

So far, the decision has been met with praise across the solar industry, as the President’s actions are expected to get module imports flowing again. The decision provides a lifeline to the hundreds of MWs of solar projects that faced delays or cancellations due to sudden module supply constraints.
SEIA
Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper commending the move in a statement.

“We applaud President Biden’s thoughtful approach to addressing the current crisis of the paralyzed solar supply chain,” said Hopper. “The president is providing improved business certainty today while harnessing the power of the Defense Production Act for tomorrow. Today’s actions protect existing solar jobs, will lead to increased employment in the solar industry and foster a robust solar manufacturing base here at home.

“While the Department of Commerce investigation will continue as required by statute, and we remain confident that a review of the facts will result in a negative determination, the president’s action is a much-needed reprieve from this industry-crushing probe. During the two-year tariff suspension window, the U.S. solar industry can return to rapid deployment while the Defense Production Act helps grow American solar manufacturing.”
Hopper went on to highlight how critical establishing a domestic supply chain is to achieving both Biden and SEIA’s renewable energy and emission reduction goals and thanked SEIA’s members who raised awareness about the damage being done by the investigation.
ACORE
Similar praise was shared by Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
“Thanks to today’s actions by the White House, the American solar industry can finally get back to work driving economic growth, reducing electricity costs and lowering greenhouse gas emissions,” he said in a statement. “We thank the President and his staff for the vitally important relief he has provided for the nation’s solar sector. This welcome development follows months of needless disruption to one of the country’s fastest-growing sources of new jobs and best defenses against the threat of climate change. Now that we have a reprieve from the destructive impacts of the Commerce inquiry, we look forward to working with the administration and our allies in Congress to secure the enactment of policies that strengthen our domestic supply chain, such as the clean energy tax package currently being negotiated that provides advanced manufacturing tax credits and long-term tax incentives for renewable power.”
SOLV Energy
George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy, also applauded the announcement, but warned that any tariffs imposed as a result of the ongoing circumvention case after the freeze could still mean trouble for the industry.
Swinerton
“President Biden’s decisive leadership enables companies like mine to move forward on stalled projects and bring solar workers back to our jobsites,” said Hershman. “This announcement provides much needed clarity in the short-term on trade, and takes action on his promise to deploy more clean energy resources domestically while growing American manufacturing in the long-term.
“While I applaud the President for his leadership in building a brighter future today, the lingering threat of tariffs stemming from the ongoing circumvention case will continue to jeopardize our clean energy progress. I strongly urge the Department of Commerce to work toward a swift end to this case and put the solar industry fully back to work.”
8minute Solar Energy
Much like Hershman, Tom Buttgenbach, CEO and Founder of 8minute Solar Energy sees the action as an opportunity to kickstart development and prove the near-term certainty to the industry to keep projects viable.
“Less than a year ago, the Biden Administration introduced an ambitious and necessary plan to address climate change,” said Buttgenbach. “We applaud today’s decision by the President to remove the near-term threat of new panel import tariffs as an absolutely essential step towards achieving these goals. Solar is a critical lifeline for both our climate and our economy – generating reliable, affordable energy that provides good-paying American jobs and economic value. With this decision, 8minute and the broader solar industry can resume the massive momentum we have built this past decade – deploying the most advanced and responsive energy technologies to support the country’s clean energy goals.”
American Clean Power Association
While some have criticized the President’s action as undermining American Solar manufacturing by prioritizing imports, Heather Zichal, CEO of the American Clean Power Association (ACP) is of the opinion that the tariff freeze and enactment of the Defense Production Act will provide a net positive for American manufacturers.
“President Biden’s proclamation today to use the full power of executive authority to jumpstart the domestic solar industry is a bold act of leadership. It recognizes the immediate need to protect middle-class American jobs, promote U.S. energy independence, protect consumers from rising electricity bills in the face of inflation, and stay true to his climate commitments.”
Zichal went on to say, “The President’s announcement will rejuvenate the construction and domestic manufacturing of solar power by restoring predictability and business certainty that the Department of Commerce’s flawed inquiry has disrupted. This action is necessary due to the inconsistent and archaic regulatory process at the Department of Commerce that has frozen the U.S. solar industry. Alongside over 100 Governors and Members of Congress, the American Clean Power Association continues to call on Secretary Raimondo to conclude the inquiry swiftly and to use the Secretary’s legal authority to reaffirm a decade of precedent previously set by the Department of Commerce.
“The U.S. solar industry is actively making investments to further increase the scale of the domestic manufacturing sector, including recent announcements to expand U.S. module production facilities, create new manufacturing plants for components like steel trackers, and work with allied trading partners to unlock the potential for inputs (like polysilicon) from the United States. As one example, ACP has exclusively learned that a large U.S. developer is pursuing a domestic solar panel manufacturing facility that could have up to 5GW of production. Panel production at this facility would begin by the fall of 2023 and would put 1,000 American workers on the job building America’s clean energy future.
“The President’s actions today make those investments possible, and the policies contained in the reconciliation bill would only hasten the pace of building a more robust domestic solar manufacturing sector.”
Center for Biological Diversity
Jean Su, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Energy Justice program shared her hope that Biden’s executive action will lead to more climate- and renewable energy-focused action from a federal level.
“Biden’s executive moves give critical momentum to the needed transition to solar energy,” Su said. “We hope this use of the Defense Production Act is a turning point for the president, who must use all his executive powers to confront the climate emergency head on. While pausing tariffs will bring in much-needed solar panels quickly, it’s also vital for the U.S. to ramp up domestic manufacturing with strong labor practices so we don’t support slave-labor manufacturing abroad. Biden needs to follow through on these promising actions by using every tool at hand for a rapid phaseout of violent fossil fuels and robust development of a just, renewable energy system.”

“We’re encouraged by the Biden Administration’s recognition of the crisis our industry is facing and taking the immediate necessary steps to protect the crippled solar supply chain and the thousands of solar workers who would be adversely affected by these tariffs. By providing this two-year reprieve from the Department of Commerce probe and nurturing market growth via the Defense Production Act, his administration allows us to return to the vital business of developing solar projects and forwarding our country’s clean energy transition.”
AEE
Nat Kreamer, CEO of Advanced Energy Economy applauded  Biden’s action that is expected provide stability for the solar industry moving forward.
“This is a needed stay in a more than decade-long tariff war that has been a loser for all parties,” said Kreamer. “Tariffs only raise costs for consumers and don’t create domestic demand for clean energy. These announcements today provide much-needed stability to the solar industry and the clean energy transition at large, and send the message to Congress that now is the time to act urgently to build the clean energy domestic manufacturing industry this country needs to protect consumers and become energy independent.
“Investments in clean energy technologies, like the ones announced today by the White House, will help develop a robust, U.S.-based advanced energy manufacturing industry that can bolster the middle class, revitalize communities hollowed out by decades of deindustrialization, and expand economic opportunity in frontline communities.”
First Solar
Samantha Sloan, Vice President of Policy for First Solar, which manufactures in the US, expressed her company’s disappointment at what she sees as an undermining of American manufacturing.
 “First Solar is deeply disappointed in today’s announcement, which only benefits China’s state-subsidized solar industry,” she said.
 “Today’s proclamation directly undermines American solar manufacturing by giving unfettered access to China’s state-subsidized solar companies for the next two years. This sends the message that companies can circumvent American laws and that the US government will let them get away with it as long as they’re backed by deep-pocketed political pressure campaigns.
“Furthermore, the use of the Defense Production Act to boost solar manufacturing is an ineffective use of taxpayer dollars and falls well short of a durable solar industrial policy, such as the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which the administration has so far failed to deliver. Quite simply, the administration cannot stick a band-aid on the issue and hope that it goes away. Had the administration consulted with America’s solar manufacturers, they would have known as much.”
Stoel Rives 
For Morten Lund, Stoel Rives’ Energy Partner, the enacting of federal procurement measures to drive domestic manufacturing could have an even bigger impact than the tariff freeze.
“Postponing the effectiveness of a potential tariff expansion is a big deal and this freeze seems to indicate it would effectively kill the retroactive portion of the tariffs.  That takes care of the uncertainty issue, which frankly is at least as important as the tariff itself.  Development and procurement has slowed significantly in advance of the tariff ruling, and this gives the industry price certainty which will allow us to proceed with development effects.  This benefit is not just for the duration of the freeze, but also thereafter—if there is a tariff expansion this year, we will have two years to prepare for it and price it into projects.  It would actually be a significant benefit if all tariffs came into effect this way, with a lead-up transition.  The inability to plan ahead always causes a temporary pause and is very harmful.
“The mention of using federal procurement to drive domestic manufacturing is potentially more significant than the DPA both in the near and long term. The US federal government is arguably the largest energy purchaser in the world, and leveraging that purchasing power could have immediate and profound impacts.”
Renewable Properties
Not only are utility-scale developers lauding the president’s actions, but Aaron Halimi, founder and president of community solar developer, Renewable Properties, says the tariff exemption will provide certainty to the community solar market, too.
“As a community solar developer with active projects throughout the U.S., Renewable Properties is relieved to hear that President Biden has placed a 24-month tariff exemption on imported solar panels while supporting domestic supply chains and the growth of U.S. manufacturing,” said Halimi. “The President’s actions not only bring certainty to solar development, but they will also decrease the costs of developing solar projects while supporting local construction jobs.”

Energy sprawl, or the increased use of land and water spaces to support energy infrastructure, could rise over the next several decades, working against some of the environmental goals that are the foundation of renewable energy deployment.
Distributed rooftop solar is one way to prevent energy sprawl, and another method, agrivoltaics, the co-location of farming and solar, can be effective in supporting local wildlife and farming practices while adding large amounts of emissions-free energy to the grid.
The AgriSolar Clearinghouse, an informational and networking organization dedicated to connecting farmers, landowners, and solar developers around the buildout of agrivoltaics, shared a case study of one solar farm that supported not just one species, but several. The study focused on the 23.4 MW Arnprior solar project in Ottawa, Canada, developed by EDF Renewables (EDFR). The project sits on 180 acres of land and can meet the peak energy demand of about 7,000 homes.
Image: EDF Renewables
The pioneering project was built in 2009, at the time doubling the PV capacity of the entire country of Canada. Six years following construction, one of the landowners expressed interest to EDFR to return the land to functioning agricultural after decommissioning.
EDFR took interest in the idea, but decided not to wait for decommissioning to take action. In 2015 it began phasing out the use of pesticides and herbicides. By 2016, as declining bee populations became an international focus, it reached out to a local honey company to install hives at the site. Two hives were installed, and side by side with renewable energy, 100 jars of honey per year were produced. Today, efforts have expanded, and over 300 jars are made each year.
In 2017, EDFR received an award by the Government of Canada to provide a habitat for the monarch butterfly. Arnprior became the first solar project in Canada to be awarded by the Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk. In tandem with the Pollinator Partnership, EDFR planted native wild flowers and milkweed, the exclusive host plant for monarch butterfly larvae. Within a month of the partnership, larvae and butterflies began to appear.
Later that year, the Arnprior site launched a pilot program for sheep grazing as a method of vegetation management to reduce shading on the solar modules. Local business Shady Creek Lamb Company brought 50 ewes to snack on vegetation and optimize solar production. The array site proved beneficial to the local sheep farmers, providing an area for the flock to expand without having to rent or buy additional land.
The arrangement offered the sheep farmers additional revenue streams, as they were paid for the sheep’s vegetation management services. In 2022, over 500 sheep roam the site from spring to fall, boosting production, eliminating the need for chemical-based plant killers, and providing free range lamb and fiber to the local market.
In total, the site has proved to be a win-win for both farmers and solar developers. This agrivoltaic model could prove useful for the energy transition. In California alone, Environment California said as much as 148,000 acres of land could be used to support solar by 2045, based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles. With this development comes the opportunity to build a future that is sensitive to all life on Earth and the farming needs of local communities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/06/benefits-to-affordability-of-virtual-power-plants/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 6, 2022",Benefits to affordability of virtual power plants,"It’s not just the cost of gasoline soaring recently, but electricity prices, too. Rising energy costs put a burden on all American households and businesses, but none more than Americans with low or fixed incomes.  Spending on energy comprises 3.1% of the average US household’s income, but for low-income households, its 8.1%. More striking still, 40% of low-income households spend more than a tenth of their incomes on home energy.
A big reason for rising electricity costs is that fossil fuels are still responsible for most electricity generation in the United States, and the price of fossil fuels is inherently volatile.  Their affordability may well rebound in the future, but our fossil resources are relied on internationally, and the global commodity market, as we’re seeing now, can fluctuate dramatically and unexpectedly.
When prices go up, there are generally only three things that can be done: reduce the cost of the fossil fuel, find alternatives to that fossil fuel, or use the fossil fuel more efficiently. Just look at the successes of wholesale market competition and ENERGYSTAR, for example – both have been important contributors to the United States’ ability to produce affordable energy for these respective reasons. One of the things that excites me most about virtual power plants (VPP) is their ability to bridge this affordability gap from both sides at once.
Zero-marginal cost energy
Lucky for us, the price of renewable energy is less volatile than fossil fuels over time thanks to zero-cost inputs; we do not pay for sunshine and wind. Even with rising costs, the average levelized cost of energy for renewable projects across the United States has begun to compete aggressively with new combined cycle technology projects, even putting tax credits aside.
Renewable energy itself is not a silver bullet. Solar, wind and hydropower are resource-constrained technologies, meaning generating capacity isn’t available on demand. But this is also why VPPs are so important to the deeper integration of renewable resources: they offer operators an effective way to pair variable distributed energy resources with dispatchable assets, whether they be traditional peaker plants or the emerging option of mid- to long-duration energy storage. The result is a reliable, clean, and affordable aggregation of power supply.
However, for VPPs to drive down electricity bills, we also must address system integration – not in the sense of how we use power, but when we use it.
Savings flexibility
We’ve come miles in terms of the efficiency of our buildings, but we have yet to fully consider our patterns of use. Energy end-use is at least somewhat predictable because most people follow daily patterns: washers, dryers, ovens, HVAC, and other usual suspects come to life around the same times each day, often in the evening. These daily peaks, as well as seasonal peaks, are when electricity is most expensive, hence when demand flexibility can save consumers the most money. But don’t just take my word for it: active VPP participants are saving hundreds of dollars a year. VPPs’ benefit to energy affordability is equitable too, with a growing number of VPP companies and programs demonstrating significant adoption by low to middle income households.
Additionally, the costs of building new transmission and distribution infrastructure are borne by ratepayers. This spend is increasing as a portion of the average US electricity bill as utilities overbuild this infrastructure to handle peak loads – meaning that the average utilization of the grid is going down every year. Utility spending for electricity delivery increased 65% over the past decade and now represents nearly half of the all-in costs of electricity supply. VPPs, and DERs in general, can further drive savings by deferring further investment in system infrastructure by spreading out electricity demand that will only increase as we electrify the nation’s economy.
The energy savings from being part of a VPP come from these opportunities: in the short term from shifting intraday power usage; in the midterm from enabling grid integration of increasingly affordable renewables; and in the long-term from the deferral of infrastructure investment. The size of savings of course depends on measuring unused power against a baseline, and the method by which responsive demand can be activated ranges from automatic to discretionary. How VPPs are dispatched will be critical to their widespread adoption and one I’ll begin to explore in an upcoming VPPiece on the role of software.
VPPs offer deeper integration of renewables and demand flexibility, and deeper integration of renewables and demand flexibility offer all Americans more affordable power. What’s more, its affordability that’s as reliable as your daily routine.
In last week’s VPPiece on the opportunities in virtual power plants, Jigar Shah discussed how VPPs can help achieve a zero-carbon electric grid.

The settlement resolves patent infringement disputes that Solaria brought in 2020 against Canadian Solar in Federal District Court for the Northern District of California and in the United States International Trade Commission (ITC). The suit claimed that Canadian Solar infringed Solaria’s US patent concerning a process for separating photovoltaic strips from silicon solar cells for use in shingled solar panels.
Solaria asserted in the lawsuit that “it first introduced Canadian Solar to its high-efficiency, high-density module (HDM) technology in 2014, when representatives of Canadian Solar evaluated Solaria’s next-generation shingling technology for a potential licensing deal. After further collaborations between the companies over the ensuing year, in which Solaria disclosed its proprietary technology and business strategies to Canadian Solar under an NDA, no deal was reached.”
“Solaria initially filed suit against Canadian Solar because they chose to ignore and violate Solaria’s core intellectual property (IP). When rendering his Initial Determination in the ITC investigation, the Chief Administrative Law Judge recognized that Canadian Solar infringed Solaria’s patents,” said Tony Alvarez, Solaria CEO. He explained that in that Initial Determination, issued in October 2021, Chief Administrative Law Judge Cheney found that Canadian Solar, a Chinese solar panel manufacturer, violated section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, in their importation of shingled solar modules.
“Solaria remains open to cooperating with companies that recognize the value of Solaria’s IP; we’ve licensed Solaria’s technology to other firms in the industry. However, Solaria will actively defend our IP against any infringers, and protect our technology for ourselves and our valued partners,” stated Alverez.
This is not the first time Solaria has sued other solar manufacturers related to its technology and patent use. pv magazine reported, for example, that in 2018, Solaria filed suit against South Korea’s Genesem for using Solaria’s patents outside of agreed upon terms. In 2017, Solaria resolved a legal dispute with GCL-Poly of China involving alleged stolen trade secrets for shingle-cell solar technology. The suit was settled under NDA. Solaria also sued Jiangsu Seraphim Solar System and Suzhou Autoway System for mis-using its patents.

SCOOP: @POTUS will use executive action Monday to kickstart solar projects in the U.S. that are stalled by a Commerce Dept tariff probe, and he will invoke the Defense Production Act to spur domestic production of solar panels and other clean energy projects, sources tell me
— Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1) June 6, 2022

The move comes as a direct response to the industry-wide uncertainty that has unfolded since the Department of Commerce (DOC) March 28 announcement that it would act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar requesting that DOC review solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, announcing that it was launching an antidumping investigation into those companies.
According to reports, alongside the moratorium on new tariffs, President Biden will invoke the Defense Production Act as a means to accelerate American manufacturing across the solar supply chain and alleviate overall dependency on imported PV hardware and materials. Reports indicate that the goal of invoking the act is to raise domestic solar manufacturing capacity to 22.5 GW by 2024.
Enacted in 1950, the Defense Production Act allows the President to to direct private companies to prioritize orders from the federal government and allocate materials, services, and facilities for the purpose of national defense. The order has been invoked twice since the beginning of 2020, once by then-President Donald Trump and again by Biden, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Invoking the Act will not end the DOC investigation, which is expected to continue, meaning that tariffs could still be imposed after the moratorium, depending on DOC’s ruling. However, according Reuter’s unnamed source, the impending action would eliminate the possible imposition of retroactive tariff collection, which could have gone as far back as the date of Auxin Solar’s initial petition filing.
An industry applauds 
The President’s action has already been met with praise from solar advocates, with Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper commending the move in a statement.
“We applaud President Biden’s thoughtful approach to addressing the current crisis of the paralyzed solar supply chain,” said Hopper. “The president is providing improved business certainty today while harnessing the power of the Defense Production Act for tomorrow. Today’s actions protect existing solar jobs, will lead to increased employment in the solar industry and foster a robust solar manufacturing base here at home.

“While the Department of Commerce investigation will continue as required by statute, and we remain confident that a review of the facts will result in a negative determination, the president’s action is a much-needed reprieve from this industry-crushing probe. During the two-year tariff suspension window, the U.S. solar industry can return to rapid deployment while the Defense Production Act helps grow American solar manufacturing.”
Hopper went on to highlight how critical establishing a domestic supply chain is to achieving both Biden and SEIA’s renewable energy and emission reduction goals and thanked SEIA’s members who raised awareness about the damage being done by the investigation.
Similar praise was levied by Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
“Thanks to today’s actions by the White House, the American solar industry can finally get back to work driving economic growth, reducing electricity costs and lowering greenhouse gas emissions,” he said in a statement. “We thank the President and his staff for the vitally important relief he has provided for the nation’s solar sector. This welcome development follows months of needless disruption to one of the country’s fastest-growing sources of new jobs and best defenses against the threat of climate change. Now that we have a reprieve from the destructive impacts of the Commerce inquiry, we look forward to working with the administration and our allies in Congress to secure the enactment of policies that strengthen our domestic supply chain, such as the clean energy tax package currently being negotiated that provides advanced manufacturing tax credits and long-term tax incentives for renewable power.”
Immediate impact
In the months that followed the announcement of the investigation, SEIA lowered its solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by 46%, predicting that the case would result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021.
Developers across the US have already felt the sting of the investigation, which has frozen module imports and left solar projects in development and construction limbo, with some partially-constructed projects sitting idle in the field, waiting for modules.
According to the most recent publication of SEIA’s investigation impact survey, with over 700 responses current to April 26, 83% of respondents who purchase or use modules reported cancellations or delays in their module supply agreements. In 13 states 100% of respondents said that they were experiencing delayed or canceled module supply.
Based on voluntary reporting, responses have outlined to SEIA that a total of 318 utility scale projects accounting for 51 GW of solar capacity and 6 GWh of attached battery storage are being cancelled or delayed. What’s more is that a large percentage of delayed projects could move into the realm of cancelation, as developers don’t know when they might be able to get modules and som delays may drag on to the point of project failure.
With respondent data from 39 states, all but two of those states are reporting utility-scale project cancellations and delays above 100 MW in capacity. SEIA stated that these figures also likely only represent a fraction of the investigation’s true impacts. Across the US as a whole, 42% of the known utility-scale solar development pipeline has been disrupted. Indiana and Idaho both reported 100% of each state’s known pipeline being disrupted.
With such capacity lost, SEIA estimated that the United States would emit an additional 364 million metric tons of carbon by 2035, missing the opportunity to effectively take 78 million internal combustion-engine vehicles off the road.
Those predictions are based on assumptions of an affirmative decision on the investigation, with tariffs imposed in the 50% to 250% range; sharply restricted module import supply from countries named in the investigation, with manufacturers in non-named countries needing time to pick up the slack; and the updated results of the impact survey.
Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam currently account for roughly 80% of US module imports.
External pressure
Since the announcement of the investigation, the Biden Administration has been stuck between a rock and a hard place, pitting Biden’s goals of decarbonizing the US power grid by 2035 and cutting national greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030, versus 2005 levels, against existing political pressure to stand against Chinese economic practices and product dependance.
Both DOC and the Biden admin have been flooded with pleas from renewable energy advocates and politicians alike to abandon the probe. So far, 22 Senators and 19 state governors have officially called on DOC to deliver an expedited and negative preliminary decision.
On the other end of the spectrum, on May 26, US Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Bob Casey (D-PA), along with US Representative Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-9), sent a letter to President Biden expressing their support for the continued investigation.
The investigation was also expected to lead to the loss of 100,000 jobs across the solar industry, according to SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. It’s important to clarify that the figure of 100,000 jobs lost also includes new jobs not added, though SEIA asserts that the vast majority would be layoffs of existing workers. 16,000 to 18,000 solar manufacturing jobs would be not realized between 2022-2023 due to the imposition of tariffs, the majority of which would be layoffs. For context, roughly 31,000 people were employed in solar manufacturing in 2020, the most recent year for which survey data is available.
