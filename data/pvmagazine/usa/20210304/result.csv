As might be expected from one of America’s cloudiest and rainiest cities, first-year project energy output is expected to be around 535 MWh. That modest output may be offset by bragging rights: The 18,100-seat Climate Pledge Arena–future home of the National Hockey League’s Kraken expansion team–aims to achieve net-zero carbon for all of its roughly 11 MW load.
To reach that goal, onsite solar will be mixed with off-site renewable resources, which could include a combination of solar and wind power from eastern Washington State, where conditions for both resources are better. The developers said that Seattle’s decidedly rainy climate will help wash the solar panels, a benefit that may not always make it into a project’s promotional brochure.
Altogether, solar panels will be installed at three sites related to the venue: a newly built atrium in front of the arena itself, an adjacent parking garage, and a training facility in another part of the city; that facility has a separate load of around 2 MW. Panels at the atrium site will be flush mounted on the roof. The parking garage will feature canopy solar at its rooftop level. And the neighborhood site will use a more conventional ballasted installation with panels at a 10-degree tilt.
The solar installer is McKinstry, and inverters are being supplied by Chint Power Systems.
Excelsior Energy Capital, Unico Solar Investors, Oak View Group, and the Kraken hockey franchise announced the solar plan for the 18,100-seat arena, which is being developed under a historic landmark roof that dates from the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair. That event almost 60 years ago also saw construction of the city’s landmark Space Needle.
Financial details on the solar installation were not disclosed, but project financing is through Excelsior’s $500 million Renewable Energy Investment Fund I LP. The hockey team will retire applicable renewable energy credits. And the developers plan to use a Washington State program that allows 50% recovery of related sales and use taxes once the project is completed.
Last June, Amazon bought naming rights to the arena. In a departure from usual corporate naming, Amazon chose to focus attention on climate change.
The Seattle installation is part of a 250 MW portfolio of commercial and industrial solar projects being developed by Unico Solar and Excelsior across North America.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/04/new-york-state-adopts-rules-to-streamline-large-renewable-energy-project-reviews/,"COVID-19,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 4, 2021",New York State adopts rules to streamline large renewable energy project reviews,"New York State has finalized and adopted new rules designed to streamline the siting and construction of large-scale renewable energy facilities.
The regulations are the result of the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act. Enacted in April 2020, the law aimed to consolidate the environmental review and permitting of renewable energy projects larger than 25 MW. It established an Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES) to write rules and serve as a one-stop-shop to coordinate and review proposed projects.
Gov. Cuomo said, “We’re working against the clock to protect New York State from the effects of climate change.”

Renewable projects were previously sited the same way as fossil-fuel power plants, meaning it could take several years for them to be permitted and start construction.
In a statement, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, “We’re working against the clock to protect New York State from the effects of climate change, and cutting red tape so that renewable energy sources can be built and distributed more easily is part of that effort.”
Cuomo said that the rules will help jump-start the state’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. During his State of the State address in January, the governor offered a list of initiatives to boost clean energy and related jobs.
Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, New York League of Conservation Voters, Alliance for Clean Energy, and Natural Resources Defense Council, applauded the final regulations.
Through the new regulations and review process, ORES is expected to play a role in meeting the state’s 70% by 2030 clean energy standard.
To help boost community involvement, the regulations will require project applicants to consult with local governments and community members before filing an application, provide public notices at milestones during the permitting process, and make application materials available in both electronic and paper format.
Draft siting permits will be subject to public review and comment, and adjudicatory hearings will be required when significant and substantive issues are identified. What’s more, for each project, municipalities and community interveners will have access, as appropriate, to funds to defray certain expenses incurred in reviewing the project.

The company wants to secure power purchase agreements of 10, 12, or 15 years from PJM-sited projects that begin operation between 2021 and 2024. Eligible projects include new solar farms, new or repowered wind facilities, and stand-alone or co-located battery energy storage systems. The RFP calls for between 300 MW and 500 MW of nameplate capacity.
AEPEP, part of AEP’s energy supply division, said it will use the contracted off-take to support its growing retail and wholesale loads in the PJM region.
Interested parties must submit a notice of intent to bid to AEPEP by March 10. Proposal packages are due March 26. The company said it plans to choose the winning bids in the third quarter.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/04/target-expands-its-renewables-strategy-by-signing-ppas-for-solar-and-wind-energy/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 4, 2021",Target expands its renewables strategy by signing PPAs for solar and wind energy,"Target signed three power purchase agreements (PPA) for renewable energy projects that, when completed, will bring it nearly halfway to its goal of sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.
The three projects are the Golden Buckle Solar Project, located in Texas and developed by Savion; and the Haystack Wind Project, located in Nebraska and developed by Ørsted. The third project, a separate Texas solar installation, has not yet had its details released.
The three new PPAs mark a shift in how Target procures its renewable energy. Previously, the retailer’s renewable commitments have been onsite, with 230 MW of its roughly 285 MW of solar capacity sited at its facilities.
Two of Target’s biggest suppliers, PepsiCo and Hormel Foods,  also signed PPAs for energy from at least one of the newly announced projects. That fits into another Target goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from operations, purchased goods, and services by 30% below 2017 levels by 2030.
In April 2019, Hormel Foods said that it would aim to become 50% renewable via subscriptions to solar gardens at five manufacturing locations. It also signed a virtual purchase agreement for energy from a Nebraska wind farm.
Specific capacity figures for the two latest PV projects have not yet been released, but are likely to boost Target’s position as a top corporate solar energy buyer. Target said that the three PPAs will cover nearly one quarter of its electricity use. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA) most recent Solar Means Business report, Target ranks as the 4th largest corporate purchaser of solar energy, with roughly 285 MW of PV sourced via both onsite solar and PPAs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/04/xcel-backs-1-7b-transmission-plan-to-deliver-solar-and-wind/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,COLORADO",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 4, 2021",Xcel backs $1.7b transmission plan to deliver solar and wind,"Four electric power utilities are backing a $1.7 billion project to build 560 miles of transmission lines in the rural eastern part of Colorado to bring solar and wind to population centers that sprawl along the Front Range from Colorado Springs to Fort Collins.
The project is dubbed Power Pathway and likely would involve Xcel Energy, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Black Hills Energy, and the Platte River Power Authority.
The Solar Energy Industries Association said that Colorado ranked 13th in terms of installed solar capacity, with roughly 1,530 MW installed to date.

Xcel filed the proposal in early March with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which will decide whether the project is needed and in the public interest.
In late February, Xcel released details on its proposed $8 billion Clean Energy Plan. The plan calls for cutting the utility’s carbon dioxide emissions 85% below 2005 levels by 2030. To reach that goal, Xcel said it plans to double its renewable energy portfolio in the state and stop using coal-fired generation by 2040.
The plan is in response to a 2019 Colorado state law that required regulated utilities to cut carbon emissions by 80% in the next 10 years.
Xcel’s plan calls for adding around 5,600 MW of new renewable and energy storage capacity. The mix includes 1,600 MW of large-scale solar projects, 400 MW of battery storage, and 2,300 MW of wind power. Another 1,300 MW of distributed solar, such as community solar gardens, would also be added.
By 2030, 80% of the electricity Xcel generates in Colorado would come from renewable sources, the company said.
The proposed 345 kv transmission lines would ring eastern Colorado, covering more than a dozen counties. If approved, the first segments could enter service by 2025.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/04/sunrise-brief-these-3-states-have-the-most-small-scale-solar-pv/,"FINANCE,MARKETING,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 4, 2021",Sunrise brief: These 3 states have the most small-scale solar PV,"The top three states with the most small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity at the end of 2020 were California (10.6 GW), New Jersey (1.9 GW), and Massachusetts (1.8 GW).
Of the 4.5 GW of small-scale solar capacity added in the United States in 2020, California accounted for 31%, the largest share by far.
And although Texas and Florida have less total small-scale solar capacity than either California or New Jersey, capacity has grown rapidly in recent years. In 2020, Texas added 422 MW of small-scale solar, and Florida added 282 MW. State incentives, strong solar resources, and policy changes are largely driving these gains.
The rankings were reported by the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), which defines “small scale” as any installation that is connected to the grid and is less than 1 MW in size.

New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are leaders for small-scale solar capacity despite having less favorable solar resources. In these states, long-standing state policies such as renewable and clean energy standards and other incentives, some of which include specific provisions for solar, encourage small-scale solar capacity growth.
Small-scale solar capacity in Texas grew by 63% in 2020.

Removing restrictions on leased solar systems has encouraged small-scale solar growth in Florida. Until April 2018, the Florida Public Service Commission restricted electricity sales from leased solar systems. Without that restriction, electricity customers can now lease solar systems with little or no upfront costs, making solar PV more widely economic and resulting in big growth. In 2020, small-scale solar capacity there grew 57%, from 492 MW in 2019 to 773 MW.
Although not in the top states for total small-scale solar capacity, Illinois added 309 MW of small-scale solar capacity in 2020, the third-highest number of additions, according to EIA. The additions doubled small-scale solar capacity in the state from 206 MW in 2019 to 515 MW in 2020.
Distributed Solar Development (DSD) secured a two-year, $150 million construction revolver with Rabobank, a global food and agribusiness bank. The money will finance Distributed Solar’s pipeline of solar projects in the commercial and industrial (C&I) market.
The revolver follows a $300 million debt facility that DSD closed with Credit Suisse in late January. The revolver incorporates multiple tax equity partnerships and is designed to deliver capital through DSD’s business cycle, including an equipment supply sub-limit.
Sunlight Financial said it is adding Spanish language loan products to enhance its technology platform, Orange. The move is aimed at further expanding solar to potential customers that have had difficulty accessing the market because of language barriers.
Sunlight is a point-of-sale finance company that works with contractors nationwide to provide homeowners with financing to install residential solar systems and other home improvements.
In late January, Sunlight agreed to combine with Spartan Acquisition Corp. The combined public company will be named Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc., and Sunlight’s existing management team will continue to lead the business.
In both 2019 and 2020, U.S. project developers installed more wind power capacity than any other generating technology. Data from the EIA’s Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory said that annual wind turbine capacity additions set a record in 2020, totaling 14.2 GW, surpassing the previous record of 13.2 GW added in 2012. Total wind turbine capacity now stands at 118 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/04/report-card-hands-the-energy-sector-a-c-for-infrastructure-its-an-improvement/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"MARCH 4, 2021",‘Report card’ hands the energy sector a C- for infrastructure. It’s an improvement.,"The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave U.S. energy generation assets, including renewable energy, a C- in its latest national infrastructure report card.
The grade is a notch above the D+ that the sector received in the ASCE’s last report in 2017. The 2021 report card said that increasing electrification – particularly of the transportation sector – could have a big impact on the U.S. energy system’s ability to meet national demands.
The 2021 grades for all of U.S. infrastructure ranged from a B for rail to a D- for transit.

Overall, ASCE gave U.S. infrastructure a grade of C-, an improvement from the D+ it handed out four years ago.
The report said renewables helped drive an increase in electric transmission infrastructure spending during the last four years.
The new lines not only link renewable resources to customers, but they also help harden the grid and reduce outage frequency and duration, the report said.

Reliability issues continue to plague the aging transmission and distribution systems, however, and this problem will likely accelerate due to climate change.
An area stretching from Texas through the Midwest suffered major service disruptions in mid-February as a winter storm overtaxed power plants and ice brought down transmission lines. And in California, wildfires pose a recurring threat to the state’s far-flung grid.
The grid’s distribution system accounts for 92% of all electric service interruptions, the ASCE report said. In addition, 70% of transmission and distribution lines are well into the second half of their lifespan.
The ASCE report said that transmission spending rose 34% to $20.9 billion between 2012 and 2017, the most recent year for which figures were available. Meanwhile, distribution system spending over the past two decades has risen from $31 billion to $51 billion.
Renewable energy generation assets made up the largest portion of new generating capacity last year, and electricity generation from renewable energy sources is set to rise from 20% in 2020 to 22% this year, the report said.
In a separate report, Moody’s Investors Service said that the U.S. lags behind its peers in renewable energy.
By leveraging their size and strong policy commitments, China and the EU – including the UK, a former EU member state – have become the global leaders for solar and wind. China increased solar and wind power by 579 terrawatt-hours (TWh) or about 46% more than its closest peer, the EU+UK, between 2010-2019. The EU+UK added 396 TWh of wind and solar during this period.

Combined, these economies added almost 44% more wind and solar than the total for the next 13 economies, including the U.S., Moody’s said.
Moody’s cited the historical lack of a U.S. federal policy mandate and inconsistent support in Congress for tax subsidy incentives as weaknesses.
It said, however, that state-level policy support, cost competitiveness of renewables, economic development, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors should add to long-term growth. It also said that the new Biden administration’s goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 should result in new incentives to promote renewables.
As the ASCE report card was being issued, leaders from the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced the Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s (CLEAN) Future Act. The legislation aims to decarbonize the country and establish a national 100% clean electricity standard.
The legislation would authorize $565 billion over 10 years to achieve its goals, which include mandating net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.
