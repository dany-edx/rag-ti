While these 10 states fared best on a variety of weighted criteria, each home’s suitability varies, and solar is not one-size-fits-all. SolarReviews has a calculator tool to estimate your home’s solar savings potential based on the utility rates and programs in your area. 
The rankings are based on the following criteria:

  
 Based on these rankings, the top 10 states are as follows: 
Homeowners looking to maximize the financial gain of solar may first look to the payback period, but SolarReviews said this measurement overlooks what happens after the payback period (or breakeven) is achieved. Instead, homeowners may get a better idea of the financial value of solar with their estimated internal rate of return.
Solar shoppers often use the stock market as a proxy to understand the value of their investment. According to officialdata.org, the average annual return of an Internal rate of return (IRR) 5% of grade investment in the S&P 500 for the last 25 years is around 8%. The top ten states for IRR blow this figure out of the water:
“The states recognized in our Top 10 rankings are excellent examples of using government policy to produce good outcomes for ordinary homeowners. By encouraging private investment in solar, these states will reap the benefits of improved environmental quality and increased energy self-reliance for generations to come,” said Andy Sendy, president of SolarReviews.

The company has released new product lines, spanning residential, commercial, and utility-scale applications. The modules have been certified by UL, a prominent global testing and certification company based in the U.S.
“N-type TOPCon solar modules experience lower degradation (1% in first-year and 0.4% year-on-year) than P-type solar modules (2% in first-year and 0.55% year-on-year) which ensures longevity of the solar project,” said Gautam Solar. “They provide 5% more generation every year and BOS Savings of 3.26% and LCOE reduction of 1.56%.”
Gautam Solar’s new lineup includes:
The modules incorporate half-cut cells based on larger M10 wafer to enable more power production per unit area as compared to polycrystalline and full-cell monocrystalline modules, said the company. Improved levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and low-light performance are enabled by the half-cut cell design, it said. 
Gautam also uses round ribbon connectors in its cells to boost light utilization, and non-destructive cell cutting to minimize microcracking. Its cells integrate multi-busbars for lowered electrical losses. Further, the M10 cells ensure maximum space utilization in a standard 40 foot shipping container.
Monofacial and bifacial variants are available for the N-type modules, with the bifacial module incorporating a lightweight transparent back sheet to add 10% to 30% more production. 
“We’re also adding solar power plant design and remote monitoring services at no extra cost for our customers to provide a more comprehensive solar solutions package,” said Gautam Mohanka, chief executive officer, Gautam Solar.
Gautam manufactures the modules at its facility in Haridwar, India. The company has announced plans to add a 1 GW manufacturing facility in the United States, joining the solar manufacturing gold rush.

Applications are now being accepted for the Career Skills Training program (CST). The grants are intended to help address the limited qualified green building workforce across the country, and to support the implementation of national energy efficiency improvements sparked by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.
Last year DOE announced $225 million in grants to cross-sectoral partnerships pursuing innovative approaches to advance state and local adoption of the most recent building energy codes for residential and commercial buildings. In a 100% renewables grid, energy efficiency is valuable, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory study has found, as the cost-optimal strategy would involve energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings of about 60%, along with oversized renewable generation and long-term storage.
With an uptick in adoption of those codes, workers with up-to-date training in energy efficiency building practices are in short supply. The CST program aims to train building performance professionals to fill those jobs. Program participants will obtain industry-related certifications to install energy efficient building technologies.
“President Biden’s historic investments are accelerating the clean energy transition, creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, while turbo-boosting our clean energy economy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Today’s investment expands career training and retention programs that will equip the workforce with the necessary skills to deliver on the President’s climate goals and help us achieve our equitable clean energy transition.”
CST is part of the effort at DOE to invest in a clean energy workforce that can implement the $8.8 billion Home Energy Rebate Programs other energy efficiency programs that will help homeowners, state and local governments, and businesses save money and fight climate change.
The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) provides application instructions and program guidance. Applicants need to submit a Community Benefits Plan along with their application, detailing how their proposal will support local community and labor and how it will invest in the workforce; advance diversity, equity, and inclusion; and aid economic and environmental justice initiatives.
The CST program aligns with the  Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure that 40% percent of the overall benefits of clean energy investments make a difference in communities that are energy burdened and historically underserved.
Applicants can sign up for regular updates here, including a webinar on October 3, 2023, that will provide insights into the FOA and application process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/20/bluetti-rolls-out-ep800-b500-off-grid-energy-storage-system/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023",BLUETTI rolls out EP800 & B500 off-grid energy storage system,"BLUETTI, a pioneering provider of energy storage products, unveiled its latest innovation, the EP800 & B500 off-grid energy storage system, on September 15th. The unveiling of the EP800 system directly caters to the surging demand for dependable energy solutions, driven by the frequent power outages that have happened in recent years.
The EP800 energy storage system closely follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, the EP900, embracing the same modular design philosophy. With exceptional capacity, output, and flexibility tailored for home backup, it presents homeowners with superior alternatives to noisy gas generators or underpowered batteries.
Key Features of the EP800
The EP800 has a maximum continuous output of 9,000 W at either 120 V or 240 V, making it suitable for powering a wide range of power-hungry appliances simultaneously, from air conditioners and heaters to stovetops, ovens, dryers, and power tools. With the option to add multiple battery packs, the EP800 can provide between 9,920 Wh to an impressive 19,840 Wh of capacity, ensuring most homes can run for days using stored power alone. In case of a power outage, the system kicks in within 20 ms, and homeowners will no longer need to choose which appliances to power during the outage.
The EP800 can also be charged using solar panel arrays, allowing users to harness renewable energy. Equipped with dual MPPT charge controllers, the EP800 can maximize solar energy at a rate of 9,000 W. It stores excess solar power in the battery pack and ensures a steady power supply during nighttime or whenever it’s needed most. This capability is particularly suited for users living in remote areas or regions with unreliable power grids.
Homeowners can monitor and manage their EP800 systems through a user-friendly mobile app, including but not limited to checking the battery level, energy consumption, and renewable energy generation. The system operates smoothly within a temperature range of -4 ℉ to 122 ℉ and produces noise levels comparable to a kitchen refrigerator.
With a minimum 10-year lifespan (backed by BLUETTI’s 10-year warranty), the EP800 system translates to an economical daily cost of approximately $3. Homeowners can offset this upfront expense by storing free solar energy and cheap grid power during off-peak hours, potentially leading to passive income. The BLUETTI EP800 & B500 energy storage system is available via BLUETTI’s website, with debut prices starting from $5,999.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/20/native-american-group-recruits-solar-construction-firms-as-tribal-partners/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023",Native American group recruits solar construction firms as tribal partners,"Native American tribal lands encompass 6.5% of the utility-scale solar and wind potential in the U.S., but tribes face several barriers to deployment, said Margaret Tallmadge, senior development manager at Navajo Power, at a panel discussion at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas.
The newly-formed Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, which serves as a liaison between tribes seeking to overcome those barriers and solar construction firms, is recruiting firms that are willing to “work in both worlds—renewable energy and traditional cultural preservation,” said panelist Dave Harper, the alliance’s head of tribal engagement. “We open doors” for developers to work with tribes, he said, including by offering cultural training to developers.
Tribal nations are eligible for a total of $20 billion in loans for their energy projects, said panelist Paul Dearhouse, a senior consultant with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.
Success story
A lot of tribes “are trying to figure out” their strategy for renewables development, said panelist Kevin Blaser, tribal energy and economic development executive with tribal entity Bakinaw Federal Contracting.
Blaser described how Bakinaw created a utility in the Midwest, with guidance on interconnection from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and in partnership with Midwest grid operator MISO, which the utility joined to be able to buy and sell bulk power on the wholesale market.
Yet “one of the most influential partners,” said Blaser, was the Michigan Electric Transmission Company. That independent transmission company “didn’t have any vested interest in trying to protect any incumbent utility or any regulated monopoly that’s there, they just wanted to connect.” The transmission company also made “some really good introductions” to their customers, and “gave us a little bit of guidance,” smoothing the way for Bakinaw to “put in the work and build it.”
“We were kind of forced into it; it wasn’t really a strategic plan,” Blaser said. “The hardest part for us,” he said, was not having a model of success that Bakinaw could copy. “We had to figure it all out.” Generally speaking, he said, “that’s part of the whole process, particularly with tribal energy development, because there are 576 federally recognized tribes, and 576 different ways” of doing things, because each tribe has its own body of laws, and every culture is different.
Navajo lands potential
Panelist Jennifer Hershman, the director of community relations with solar construction firm SOLV Energy, spoke of her company’s work building solar on Navajo Tribal lands, including a 39 MWdc solar plant and household solar for previously unpowered homes.
Navajo Power’s CEO has estimated a 10 GW renewables potential across the Navajo Nation, while the Los Angeles City Council has directed the city’s water and power utility to explore a solar partnership with the Navajo Nation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/20/hydrogen-stations-could-avoid-unplanned-shut-downs-with-predictive-models-research-finds/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023","Hydrogen stations could avoid unplanned shut-downs with predictive models, research finds","New research from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Colorado State University (CSU) indicates that consumers could develop more confidence in switching to hydrogen-fueled vehicles if fueling station operators use predictive models that help them better plan for maintenance needs. 
According to the research, one of the key issues consumers of fuel cell electric vehicles could face is when hydrogen refueling stations shut down for unscheduled maintenance issues, and this could slow the adoption of these zero-emission vehicles. However, the authors pointed to a “prognostics health monitoring” model that they said could help hydrogen refueling stations avoid these shut downs. 
Motorists expect to be able to fuel their vehicles without any problems, and drivers of hydrogen-fueled cars should have the same experience, Jennifer Kurtz, lead author of the paper, said. Kurtz  leads NREL’s Energy Conversion and Storage Systems Center.
“This predictive model can let station operators know in advance when a problem might occur and minimize any disruptions that motorists might experience with hydrogen fueling,” Kurtz said. 
NREL is the DOE’s primary laboratory for research and development connected to renewable energy and energy efficiency. This latest paper was funded by the DOE’s Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office.
The research focuses on a specific model called hydrogen station prognostics health monitoring, or H2S PHM, which uses data to reduce the frequency of unscheduled maintenance, and instead increase the frequency of preventive maintenance. The model looks at how many fills the refueling station has completed to figure out the probability that a component will continue working, and can also estimate the remaining useful life of each component, helping to lower maintenance costs. However, this model has its own limitations when looking at the reliability of a hydrogen station, since it cannot predict sudden failures caused by human error. 
One of the most common reasons that hydrogen refueling stations shut down without warning is due to issues with the dispenser system, which includes hoses and dispenser valves, according to the National Fuel Cell Technology Evaluation Center.
Hydrogen refueling stations are still relatively rare in the U.S. As of this year, there were 59 retail hydrogen refueling stations in the U.S., mostly in California, according to the DOE – compared to the 10,000 gasoline stations in the state. 
“With relatively few choices, motorists who rely on hydrogen must be confident their needed fuel is available. Station operators must make any necessary repairs to meet the demands of consumers, but they also must investigate the causes of any failures to avoid future problems,” NREL said. 
However, this could soon be changing. This year, fuel cell electric vehicle manufacturer Nikola Corporation received $58.2 million from different regulatory agencies to set up a hydrogen refueling station network for heavy-duty trucks. And last year, Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy Resources and BlackRock Renewable Power announced they had signed a memorandum of understanding to take a closer look at designing, installing and operating a charging network for medium- and heavy-duty battery electric vehicles as well as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles across the nation, with an initial investment of $650 million.
