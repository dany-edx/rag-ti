Ascent achieved a 15.2% efficiency, bounding past the 10.8% standard efficiency measured for production material in 2012. The Department of Energy said that although laboratory-scale cell efficiencies have exceeded 20%, commercially viable CIGS modules typically have efficiencies between 12% and 14%. 
CIGS technology is a versatile material that can be fabricated by multiple processes and implemented in different form factors. It can be deposited on substrates like glass, metal foils, and polymers, allowing for lightweight or flexible modules. 
Starting with an ultra-thin, 25 micron (µ), polyimide base film, the final thickness of Ascent’s thin film is 52 µ. For reference, a human hair is on average 72µ thick. This enables lightweight power production at 68.4 grams per square meter. 
The company’s breakthrough in efficiency for commercial cells is attributed to replacing cadmium sulfide, a harsh and hazardous material, with zinc oxysulfide. Preliminary measurements have shown the replacement material to offer 5% to 8% higher efficiency, offering a theoretical limit of about 16%. 
“We’re thrilled with the recent achievements in process optimization for our CIGS technology, an innovation in thin film PV that we believe positions us for increased commercial adoption,” said Paul Warley, chief executive officer, Ascent Solar Technologies. “With continued increases in efficiency, we anticipate expanding sales into both new and existing markets and meeting the ever-increasing demand for solar power in targeted specialty applications.” 
Ascent said its technology is suitable for flexible applications like agrivoltaic installations, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), drones and autonomous aircraft, and space and defense applications.  
Ascent Solar’s research and development center and 5 MW production facility is in Thornton, Colorado. The company’s technology is backed by 40 years of research and development and 15 years of manufacturing experience.
In April Ascent Solar announced the closing of its acquisition of Flisom AG, a Swiss manufacturer of thin-film solar modules with 15 MW of production capacity.
In December 2022 the company secured a $50 million equity financing from two institutional investors.  The company said it intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including financing its continued growth, strategic investments in partnerships and capital expenditures.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/06/ampt-introduces-70-kw-output-solar-string-optimizer/,"MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",Ampt introduces 70 kW output solar string optimizer,"Colorado-based Ampt announced it has released the i50 String Optimizer, a DC optimizer that builds on the company’s i32 model. The i50 supports up to 70 kW of output power.
The optimizer supports system voltages between 600 V and 1500 V, output currents between 32 A and 50 A, and output power between 15 kW to 70 kW. A full spec sheet can be found here.
Ampt’s string optimizers are designed to boost solar output and can support major utility-scale projects. The i32 model has been used in a 380 MW solar-plus-storage in California and a 390 MW project in Chile, the largest solar-plus-storage plant in the nation. 
The company’s string optimizers are DC/DC converters that deliver power from the PV array at a fixed voltage. A high fixed voltage allows the system to operate at lower current for a given power, thereby reducing the cost and quantity of electrical components like cables, energy storage, inverters and transformers.
Ampt String Optimizers have two inputs and one output back to the inverter. The optimizers are located between the PV source circuits and the combiner box on a PV system. The optimizer performs maximum power point tracking on each input and delivers full available power to the output at a voltage set by the inverter. This is done without requiring communication between the inverter and optimizers.
The optimizer also has maximum power point tracking on each of its two input strings of PV modules. This mitigates or eliminates mismatch losses to deliver more energy under changing environmental and system conditions over the lifetime of the power plant.
“We’re proud to present the new i50 String Optimizer to the market, which is designed to improve the economics of today’s largest, most advanced PV power plants and solar-plus-storage systems,” said Levent Gun, chief executive officer, Ampt.
The 70 kW output allows a single power optimizer to be deployed on each solar tracker. By enabling higher input currents, paralleled PV strings, and flexible string lengths, designers can boost the utilization of each solar tracker without typical string sizing constraints, said Ampt.
Ampt string optimizers include a technology called V-match to automatically match the DC bus voltage while delivering full available power from the solar array. This increases system design flexibility, simplifies controls, and unlocks value across diverse applications.
The optimizers also include a direct-to-battery feature which allows them to connect directly to the battery and follow its state-of-charge voltage while delivering full power from the PV array. The optimizer, battery, and battery inverter share the same DC bus without using battery converters.
Ampt will be exhibiting at RE+ in Las Vegas, Nevada from September 12-14 at booth #1746.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/06/carrier-launches-new-series-of-high-temperature-heat-pumps/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",Carrier launches new series of high-temperature heat pumps,"From pv magazine global
Carrier has launched a new series of high-temperature heat pumps for applications in industrial sites, commercial settings, public buildings, and district heating systems.
It has developed four new products with capacities ranging from 30 kW to 375 kW, all of which use hydrofluoroolefins as a refrigerant.
“In addition to harnessing heat from ambient air and the ground, the heat pumps capture wasted heat from a wide range of sources, including data centers, leisure facilities, hotels and restaurants, process water, flue gases and sewage systems,” the manufacturer said. “Heat collected can be used for comfort heating and domestic hot water production in large buildings and facilities.”
One of the products, the 410 kW AquaForce 61CA air-source heat pump, can reach a temperature of up to 179.6 F (82 C). The manufacturer said it is a suitable solution for large buildings, as well as local and district heating networks.
The AquaForce 61CW-Z water-source heat pump, meanwhile, offers power ranging from 410 kW to 735 kW. It can achieve a temperature of up to 197.6 (92 C). The new solution is recommended for district heating networks and industrial process heating systems.
The third product – the AquaForce 61CWD water-source heat pump – has a power range of 110 kW to 540 kW and can reach a temperature of up to 120 C.
“Screw compressors specially designed for the highest temperatures for heavy-duty continuous use,” the company said noting the product is also suitable for industrial process heating.
The smallest product, the AquaSnap 61CG water-source heat pump, has a capacity of 30 kW to 130 kW and can be cascaded to 390 kW. It can reach a temperature of up to 179.6 F and can be used for heat recovery in hotels, the food-processing sector, and the pharmaceutical industry, while also supporting energy supplies and data centers.
“The units come ready to connect to Abound, Carrier’s cloud-based digital platform that enables real-time, intelligent outcome-based results that make buildings more efficient and responsive,” the manufacturer said. “To minimize operating costs, users can opt for one of Carrier’s BluEdge service options to keep heat pumps operating at peak performance and efficiency throughout their lifecycle.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/06/climate-central-finds-41-million-residents-exposed-to-higher-temperatures/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",Climate Central finds 41 million residents exposed to higher temperatures,"Energy justice seeks to correct damage done to people in low-income communities that have long suffered from fossil fuel pollution near their homes, lack of access to renewables-driven affordable electricity, climate change, and more. Renewable energy in the form of community and rooftop solar can bring relief to people who are disproportionately affected by climate change, pollution, and rising energy prices. 
While many proponents of advancing community solar for low-income residents often point to the concern that low-income neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by climate change, a recent report shows that this is true. In its recent report, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) index explored how infrastructure and population size differences contributed to warmer climates in various domestic municipalities, and the findings note that low-income neighbors bear the brunt of excessive heat. 
Researchers analyzed the UHI index in 18,945 census tracts of 44 U.S. cities to develop their understanding of what parts of each municipality experienced the most intense urban heat. They then assessed data on varying land cover types building heights and population sizes to estimate how UHI levels changed in each location. The heat wave experiences of about 22% of the total domestic population was assessed in this work.
Results showed local environmental factors like albedo (how much roofs and roads reflected or absorbed heat), the number of porous surfaces, prevalence of trees, green spaces, building heights and airflow impacted UHI intensity. 
“Maps of each city reveal how different land use and urban growth patterns influence the distribution of heat hot spots across census tracts— whether concentrated in a small urban core or sprawling across a vast area,” Climate Central reports. 
Albedo had the most significant effect on the UHI index of each city. 
That’s because roads sidewalks buildings and parking lots absorb more sunlight, then emit it into the town as heat. So places like Houston Los Angeles and New York City experienced temperature increases of at least 8 °F. According to the report, these places are among the 25% of areas with the most extreme UHI index values. 
Structural inequities meant over 10% of residents in D.C. Chicago New York and San Francisco low-income neighborhoods experienced temperature increases of 10°F (an additional 2°F to their regional counterparts). 
This adds up – one 2021 study published in Nature Communications found that members of Black Indigenous People of Color communities and those living below the poverty line are disproportionately affected by UHI’s. 
Heat.gov reports outdoor workers, people experiencing homelessness, athletes, children, and seniors are most likely to experience heat-related illness, suggesting further disparities. 
“They spend more time outside, or have pre-existing health concerns that may make it increasingly difficult to adapt to, or recover from heat waves without the appropriate resources,” the report writes. 
Coastal cities like Seattle New Orleans and Miami also had a higher UHI index as bodies of water tend to have a low albedo too. However, Wichita, Kan., had the lowest average UHI index per capita at 7.2°F. 
Aside from making everyone uncomfortable, extreme heat can cause serious health risks, especially when combined with high humidity sun exposure and poor air quality. 
Along with decreasing dependence on fossil fuels to power vehicles and buildings, Jen Brady, a senior data analyst at Climate Central, suggests planting trees along paved streets including space for rooftop gardens in infrastructure designs and using highly reflective emissive materials to construct cool roofs and pavements instead of asphalt or concrete. These infrastructural changes can help to cool cities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/06/qcells-to-enter-into-3-billion-supply-agreement-for-u-s-made-polysilicon/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WASHINGTON",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",Qcells to enter into $3 billion supply agreement for U.S.-made polysilicon,"REC Silicon ASA announced it is entering into a supply agreement between its subsidiary REC Solar Grade Silicon LLC and Hanwha Q Cells Georgia, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions. The American-made, low-carbon polysilicon produced at REC Silicon’s Moses Lake facility in Washington will be used for ingot/wafer manufacturing at the new Qcells manufacturing facility in Georgia, which will begin operation late next year. The 10-year take-or-pay supply agreement is for high purity fluidized bed reactor (FBR) granular polysilicon.
FBR technology has been hailed as a means to produce polysilicon for solar at lower costs and with a small fraction of the electricity used by the dominant Siemens process.
In March 2022, Hanwha Solutions announced stepped up efforts to supply customers with U.S.-made products. Hanwha launched this effort by becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major U.S. manufacturer of polysilicon. Now, to secure the supply agreement obligations and to help restart of the Moses Lake facility, Hanwha will make sizeable prepayments at the time of the signing of the supply agreement and at first delivery.
In January of this year, Qcells announced what is considered the largest investment in U.S. solar history, with plans to invest more than $2.5  billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States. This makesQcells the first company to establish a fully-integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the U.S.
The estimated total value of the supply agreement for the duration of the REC Silicon arrangement will fluctuate depending on market prices, which are currently estimated to be approximately $3 billion.
REC Silicon reports that the restart of the plant is expected by November 1, 2023, and it has a goal of reaching full capacity by the end of 2024.
The base price for the polysilicon will be determined by market indices, including markets both inside and outside of China, adjusted for a premium for U.S.-sourced low-carbon material. The polysilicon will also benefit from the $3 per kilogram tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act.
The re-opening of the Moses Lake operations will enable REC Silicon to provide high-purity polysilicon to the emerging U.S. solar supply chain. In addition, REC Silicon manufactures silane gas (SiH4)  at its plant in Butte, Montana, which serves the fast growing battery industry.
Hanwha Solutions, together with its affiliate Hanwha Corporation, controls 33.3% of the shares in REC Silicon ASA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/06/how-to-ensure-safety-under-ul-3741-understanding-the-risks-and-limitations-of-some-solutions-without-dc-optimization/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",How to ensure safety under UL 3741 – understanding the risks and limitations of some solutions without DC optimization,"The introduction of the UL 3741 Standard for Photovoltaic Hazard Control in 2020 was hailed as an important milestone in the solar industry’s continuing drive to improve solar system safety. Building on rapid shutdown best practice first introduced in NEC 2014, it was conceived to equip the solar industry with a broader array of rapid shutdown options in PV arrays, with the primary objective being to protect firefighters when dealing with fires in buildings with solar installations.
In this respect, UL 3741 has achieved notable success. However, concerns are arising regarding the safety of some of the PV hazard control solutions that have entered the market since the regulation’s introduction.
Prior to the introduction of UL 3741, the solar industry relied on module-level power electronics (MLPE) technologies, including DC-optimization, to provide rapid shutdown. DC-optimized systems allow for two panels to be connected in series, meaning that, upon rapid shutdown initiation, the maximum voltage within the array is 125 VDC (Hazard Level 1), eliminating the need for additional protective measures to comply with UL 3741.
UL 3741 opened the door to allow solutions that use few if any MLPE devices, including DC-optimization, to be code compliant. In these solutions, AC conductors are de-energized using traditional string inverters. However, the DC array itself maintains high voltage levels (1,000 VDC) even after a rapid shutdown is initiated, corresponding to Hazard Level 3.
To mitigate this increased risk, UL 3741 states that solar arrays must not allow any exposure to dangerous voltages during firefighter interaction. This means that every wire, module, or energized component in the array that can be accessed during firefighter operations must be protected from damage using robust wire protection measures ─ i.e., sturdy guards and conduits. Furthermore, regular inspections are required to ensure that all protective elements and wire management components provide this level of protection throughout the project lifespan.
It is at this point that some of these alternative solutions start to lose traction. This is not due to flaws in UL 3741 itself, but rather because of the way it is being interpreted by some manufacturers and certification agencies.
The biggest concern is non-DC-optimized systems without integrated rapid shutdown, in which exposed, accessible live wires with voltage levels up to 1,000 VDC are held in place by plastic cable ties or plastic raceways. These solutions are not compliant with UL 3741, but they have somehow slipped through the certification process. From day one, those exposed live wires may pose a significant risk to fire fighters.  And that risk will only increase as aging and weathering potentially cause the plastic ties and raceways to deteriorate. Once this happens, more sections of conductors may become exposed, accelerating the shock hazard risk to firefighters.

From a project economics standpoint, opting for a non-optimized solution might initially seem to make sense. However, upon further analysis, this may not be the case when metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and Net Present Value (NPV) are considered.
To comply with UL 3741, non-DC-optimized systems require advanced mechanical protection, PV Rapid Shutdown Equipment for array subsections, and longer AC cable runs. These additional costs quickly accumulate, significantly increasing upfront system costs.
Maintenance costs also need to be factored in. DC optimization provides continuous, granular data, which enables real-time monitoring of any potential issue at the DC array. In non-optimized solutions that do not have this capability, a site visit may be required to investigate any issues.
Organizations also need to consider the impact on energy production. For non-DC-optimized solutions to meet the requirements of UL 3741, the inverter must be located no more than one foot away from the array to limit exposure to dangerous energized DC conductors. This restricts inverter placement, increases voltage drop losses, and can make it challenging to avoid shading throughout the day, leading to production losses.
In conclusion, the solar industry has seen great progress in rooftop installations for safety. However, if they are not applied correctly, some non-DC-optimized UL 3741 solutions threaten to diminish this progress. Additionally, designers, developers, EPCs, and asset owners must consider that initial cost savings from non-optimized systems can be outweighed by the added expense of ensuring safety over time. In other words, a thorough understanding of the risks and limitations of these solutions is essential before implementing them in projects.
