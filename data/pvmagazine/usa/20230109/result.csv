The projects are developed by EDF Renewables North America and AES Corporation.
Three projects are set for construction in Cortland and Jefferson County, N.Y. and are expected to provide nearly $20 million of payment-in-lieu of taxes (PILOT) to host counties, towns, and school districts, and host community agreements to invest in infrastructure and other services over the first 20 years in operation.
The three projects are expected to drive $458 million in capital investment and create 460 short- and long-term jobs in development, construction, operations and maintenance.
Once operational, the facilities will add 542,000 MW of new renewable capacity per year, and generate enough power to support 69,000 homes per year for a 20-year PPA life, and reduce carbon emissions by more than 356,000 metric tons annually.
The projects include:
“The success of the section 94-C siting process is attributed to staff at ORES and its partner state agencies, as well as all involved stakeholders including local officials, community members, environmental groups, labor unions and the clean energy industry dedicated to building a cleaner, more resilient New York,” said Houtan Moaveni, executive director of the NYS Office of Renewable Energy.
National Grid, the utility system operator in Jefferson County, N.Y., pointed to grid congestion in its western N.Y. service territory at the recent NYSEIA 2022 Solar Summit conference in December.
“Distributed generation is not an alternative, it’s a whole new asset category that does not require a 100-year power line and wires upgrade,” said Tom Vaccaro, director of transmission for renewables at National Grid. “It can no longer be a stranded asset. Now it can be changed every 15 years with non-wire alternative solutions.”
In September, National Grid and Nexamp announced plans to install an 8.4 MW solar project with 10 Tesla Megapack batteries in Jefferson County, N.Y., providing 31 MWh of storage capacity, allowing the utility to call on 5.7 MW / 29 MWh up to 25 times per year from the panels or batteries.
Including projects sited through the state’s Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment, New York has approved 20 new renewable energy projects since 2021 with a total of 1.8 GW of power capacity.
New York has set ambitious goals for renewable energy procurement and buildout, including sourcing 70% of the state’s electricity from renewable and increasing solar deployment to 10 GW by 2030. Most recently, it outlined plans to roll out 4.7 GW of additional energy storage over the same timeframe.
Through Q3 22, the Empire State had 4.04 GW of installed solar capacity, with a devilish amount of 666.6 MW deployed in 2021, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, ranking the state ninth in the country for solar.
With a five-year growth pipeline of over 8 GW, the state looks to be on track to meet its clean energy goals well in advance of 2030. Solar momentum spurred attendees of the NYSEIA 2022 New York Solar Summit conference in December to ask agency chiefs such as Doreen Harris, president of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, whether the state’s energy groups will increase their goal to 15 GW or more of new solar capacity.

The latest in such innovations comes from the University of Cambridge, where researchers have developed a system to use electricity from solar panels to power plastics-to-fuel and carbon dioxide-to-fuel processes. The results were reported in the journal Nature Synthesis.
The system can convert two waste streams into two chemical products at the same time. This is the first time that a process has been achieved in a solar-powered reactor. The reactor converts CO2 and plastics into a variety of products that have use cases across several industries.
“Plastic pollution is a huge problem worldwide, and often, many of the plastics we throw into recycling bins are incinerated or end up in landfill,” said Erwin Reisner, professor, Cambridge.
In early tests, CO2 was converted into syngas, a building block in sustainable liquid fuels. Plastic bottles were converted into glycolic acid, a common ingredient in skin care products. The research team said the system can be readily tuned to produce different products by changing the catalyst in the reactor.
The device addresses two of the major environmental problems faced by humanity today: waste plastics and greenhouse gases. Powering the process with solar energy helps curb further emissions that would otherwise be expelled by traditional power sources.
Rather than traditional silicon-based solar cells, the Cambridge team opted for a light absorber based on perovskite technology. The perovskite-based photocathode in the reactor was selected as it enables the integration of different CO2-reduction catalysts.
“Developing a circular economy, where we make useful things from waste instead of throwing it into landfill, is vital if we’re going to meaningfully address the climate crisis and protect the natural world,” said Reisner. “And powering these solutions using the Sun means that we’re doing it cleanly and sustainably.”
The research was supported by the European Union, the European Research Council, the Cambridge Trust, Hermann and Marianne Straniak Stiftung, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Erwin Reisner is a Fellow of St John’s College, Cambridge.
The Cambridge team said it plans to develop the reactor to produce more complex molecules over the next five years. The researchers said similar processes could be used to develop an entirely solar-powered recycling plant.

Academics from universities in Ukraine, Latvia, and Slovakia have assessed the impact of vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV) on electric vehicle mileage. They used a 2017 Volkswagen e-Golf 7 series EV in Kyiv to determine the distance that solar electricity could power it on a single, full charge of its battery. They compared the results of a fixed VIPV system to a single-axis tracking system.
The group determined that the vehicle’s available rooftop area was 1,468 mm x 1,135 mm. Based on those dimensions, they assumed the car’s roof could accommodate two 120 W solar panels and one 50 W monocrystalline module from Chinese manufacturer Xinpuguang. They connected the three panels in parallel, resulting in a maximum power of 257.92 W.
The researchers then calculated PV electricity generation on typical days in January, April, July and October. Using data from car tests by the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the academics compared the additional distance the EV could travel using solar energy. They assumed the solar modules could only charge the EV batteries while parked.
The results show that the fixed-VIPV system could produce 1,587 Wh of electricity in July, allowing the EV to travel 7.98 km according to the EPA standard, or 12.64 km according to the NEDC.
“These are 3.99% and 6.32% of the maximum range of the trip on a full charge of the battery, respectively,” the scientists said. In January, the fixed system produces 291 Wh, or a range of 1.55 km (EPA) and 2.32 km (NEDC), 0.77% and 1.16% of the maximum range, respectively.
The tracking system produces the same energy as the fixed system in summer, but its yield is superior in spring, autumn, and winter. The best results were in January, when the EV could travel 3.01 km (EPA) or 4.52 km (NEDC), which corresponds to 1.51% and 2.26% of the maximum possible mileage on a single battery charge, respectively.
“The real advantages can be lower than the ones provided … due to the energy spent to adjust the sun-tracking roof platform and to possible constraints preventing perfect orientation,” the authors noted.
While the tracking VIPV system powers the EV for an extra 1.46 km to 2.2 km in January, the solution’s LCOE is 40% higher than the fixed-tilt system’s, the scientists claimed. According to their calculation, the LCOE of the PV system with zero degrees inclination is $0.6654/kWh. For a system with 20 or 80 degrees of inclination, the LCOE is $1.1013/kWh. The payback time of each system is 5.32 and 5.07 years, respectively.
“Given the small difference in the [payback period], an ordinary EV’s driver can be satisfied with the system without inclination adjustment, since a sun-tracking roof platform requires significantly higher initial investment expenditures and makes more difficult the installation,” the scientists concluded.
The scientists described their findings in “Application of photovoltaic panels in electric vehicles to enhance the range,” which was recently published in Heliyon.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/09/community-solar-on-new-jersey-self-storage-facility-benefits-low-income-residents/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,NEW JERSEY",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Community solar on New Jersey self-storage facility benefits low-income residents,"Solar Landscape, a community solar owner and operator, today announced that the solar developer connected a community solar project to the grid in Neptune, New Jersey. This is the second of 46 projects in approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) in Year 2 of the Community Solar Energy Pilot Program, which approved approved 164 MW of new community solar projects, with the capacity aimed at serving low-to-moderate-income (LMI) households.
The community solar program is administered by New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program, which provides access to solar energy through a subscription-based model. It is open to residents in Neptune City, Neptune Township, Asbury Park City, Avon-by-the-Sea, Belmar Boro, Bradley Beach Boro, Ocean Township, Tinton Falls, and Wall Township.
The solar energy generated on the Extra Space Storage facility rooftop is sold at a guaranteed discount of at least 21% on their electricity usage. The discounts would begin appearing on community solar subscribers’ first utility bill in some cases, although in other cases they may take up to 90 days once a project is activated. 
The project is located on the 800,000 square foot rooftop of an Extra Space Storage facility, and is the first of 10 planned installations on facilities owned by the national self-storage company. This first installation will generate approximately 500 kW of energy. With the additional installations, Solar Landscape is expected to generate 6.5 MW of renewable energy on Extra Space Storage rooftops, or enough to power more than 1,400 nearby homes.
“The activation of this project will extend solar access to Monmouth County residents who would otherwise be unable to benefit from clean energy, while also making crucial progress toward achieving New Jersey’s clean energy goals. Thank you to Solar Landscape, and everyone who worked to bring this project to fruition,” said Vin Gopal, New Jersey State Senator from Monmouth.
Through the New Jersey Community Solar Energy Pilot Program’s Year 1 and 2, Solar Landscape has 70 MW of solar energy built or under construction. The Community Solar Energy Pilot Program is part of Governor Murphy’s clean energy plan to expands access to renewable energy for those who previously could not install solar panels for reasons such as high costs, lack of roof control, or a shaded property. 
Regulators awarded 78 MW across 45 projects during the pilot program’s first year, exceeding a 75 MW goal. While the pilot required that at least 40% of all approved projects reserve at least 51% of their capacity for low- and middle-income households, all of the approved renewable energy projects met that goal. Regulators also said that the state will transition the two-year-old pilot community solar program to permanent status. The decision to move to a permanent program now rather than wait for a third year of the pilot to commence was driven by the pilot’s early success.

Ltd., a manufacturer of solar, energy storage and EV products, announced that its U.S. subsidiary Solar4America has started volume production of 410 W and 550 W M10 solar modules from its Sacramento, California module factory.
SPI Energy’s Solar4America solar module manufacturing facility now produces 700 MW with capacity to ramp up to 2.4 GW later this year.
The new production line adds 550 MW of solar module manufacturing capacity to its existing production volume. The company will deliver 410 W American-made modules for the residential market and 550 W all-black, American-made modules for the commercial and industrial market from the Sacramento facility.
Current Solar4America production lines include the 330 W/60 cells and 410 W/72 cells, 410 W/108 half cut cells all black modules for the residential market, and 410 W/72 cells (silver) and 550 W modules for the C&I market.
“Our California production facility will ensure that our customers receive high-quality, consistent, American-made products they can feature to their customers,” said Denton Peng, chairman of Solar4America. “Producing these products at our facility in Sacramento boosts our capacity and capabilities to meet our customer demand in a timely manner and brings more stable supplies of Made in USA products to the market.”
Solar4America announced plans for manufacturing of the M10 modules in March 2022. SPI’s module product SolarJuice has since rebranded as Solar4America.
In September 2022, SPI Energy registered its U.S. solar wafer manufacturing business, SEM Wafertech Inc., for production of wafers starting this year with initial capacity of 1.5 GW, with plans of expanding manufacturing capacity to 3 GW in 2024. At the same time, SPI Energy hired Franz Feuerherdt as VP of Sales & Marketing to lead the Solar4America module production business. Feuerherdt joins Solar4America from Mission Solar Energy, and held prior roles at Flex and SolarWorld.
The Inflation Reduction Act created attractive incentives for companies to produce solar wafers and modules in the U.S. Under the IRA, solar wafer manufacturers will receive $12 per square meter for solar wafers produced.
Solar4America Product Line:
Formed in 2006, SPI Energy is based in McClellan Park, California, and generated $161.9 million in net sales in fiscal year 2021, a 17% increase from $138.6 million in 2020.
The Chinese company went public in January 2016 and its EV affiliate Phoenix Motorcars went public in January 2022, with the companies trading on Nasdaq at $31.6 million and $23.2 million market capitalizations, respectively.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/09/tennessee-manufacturer-to-power-operations-with-526-kw-rooftop-solar-array/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,ILLINOIS,KENTUCKY,NORTH CAROLINA,SOUTH CAROLINA,TENNESSEE",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Tennessee manufacturer to power operations with 526 kW rooftop solar array,"Solar Alliance, a residential and commercial solar provider, announced it has completed design, engineering, and installation of a 526 kW rooftop solar array. The project was developed on the roof of a manufacturing site for advanced seal manufacturer AESSEAL. 
Once activated, the Rockford, Tennessee rooftop solar installation is expected to provide on-site renewable energy that AESSESAL said will meet the power demand of a large portion of the assembly, quality control, engineering, and customer service divisions. The project is a step along the way toward the company’s goal of achieving net-zero emission. 
Commercial rooftop arrays can call for a variety of engineering solutions to best fit the mounting surface. In this design, Solar Alliance used a combination of ballasted and flush mounts to secure the solar modules to the roof. The array is among the largest rooftop installations in the region. 
AESSEAL also designs water management systems, that along with seals, help conserve billions of gallons of water and millions of dollars for their customers. 
“Water management is another way to meet sustainability goals,” said Chris Staackmann, operations manager, AESSEAL. “We’re committed to our customers; we’re committed to the environment. 
Solar Alliance provided the engineering and electrical support for the project, as well as coordination with its East Tennessee based construction crew to install the system, which covers most of the 50,000 square foot facility. 
Since it was founded in 2003, Solar Alliance has developed $1 billion of renewable energy projects that provide enough electricity to power 150,000 homes. It has served a wide array of customer sites, including homes, farms, manufacturing sites, professional buildings, data centers, retail centers and utility installations. The company operates primarily in Tennessee and Kentucky, along with North and South Carolina and Illinois. 
 
REAP the benefits 
Solar Alliance has developed several projects that qualify for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Energy for America (REAP) Grants. The REAP grant provides grants and low-interest loans for small business owners in rural areas.
The REAP program awards grants between $2,500 and $500,000 for solar projects, energy efficiency grants of $1,500 to $250,000, and a loan and grant combination with an amount exceeding $1,500 for the grant portion. The maximum incentive one can receive within this range is 25% of the total project cost and is anticipated to increase in the near future to 50% of allowable project costs per updated federal programs.
The program is available not just to farmers and small agricultural practices, but to small businesses as defined by the Small Business Administration. Solar Alliance said businesses with 500 or fewer employees have qualified for REAP grants. Eligibility starts with location and is focused on rural areas where 50,000 or fewer people live.
“I think the mission of the grant is very straightforward: Lower your operating costs, become more competitive, sell more products at an equal or improved value, create more jobs, create a larger tax base, grow the community” said Harvey Abouelata, vice president, Solar Alliance.
“I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to spread the word about the grant availability. If the money does not get used in your state, it goes back to the federal fund to get redistributed to other states around the country. This is your tax money; keep it at home working for you,” said Abouelata.
Longtime Loudon County family business Wampler’s Farm Sausage has utilized REAP to support its development of several energy efficiency and solar energy projects. Wampler has since become an ambassador for the benefits of REAP and working with a developer like Solar Alliance.
“It’s important when you have a partner that’s going to come in and do a project for you, that they know not just the technical side of how to install but dealing with the tax credits and the accelerated depreciation, and all the things that are involved in helping you justify the project and know what the payback’s going to be,” said Wampler.

The Center also seeks records on FEMA’s plans to transition its investments away from fossil fuels and toward renewables.
The group requested the spending records in late 2021 under the Freedom of Information Act, but FEMA “has neither produced any records nor provided any anticipated timetable” for doing so, the lawsuit says.
Two other groups said early in 2021 that FEMA’s $9.6 billion allocated for Puerto Rico’s grid reconstruction after hurricanes Irma and Maria should be used to support rooftop solar and storage. The two groups, Cambio and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, found that distributed solar and storage could provide 75% of the U.S. territory’s power by 2035, at potentially lower cost than the existing grid and generation mix.
“The public has a right to know how many billions of taxpayer dollars FEMA is spending to help prop up the fossil-fuel industrial complex and worsen the climate emergency,” said Augusta Wilson, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. “FEMA should be leading the way to construct rooftop solar and storage, not doubling down on the dirty energy status quo.”
A Center report last year outlined steps that the President and Executive Branch could take, including with FEMA programs, to “address the climate crisis,” the group’s lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said the Center “has spent and will continue to spend financial resources” advancing its climate campaign, “which requires a better understanding” of how FEMA is carrying out its post-disaster programs.
The Center said in a statement that a 2021 FEMA report titled “Resources for Climate Resilience” and the agency’s 2022 to 2026 strategic plan “do not mention any efforts to reduce the agency’s reliance on fossil fuels” in its disaster response programs.
The Center’s lawsuit also names as a defendant the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the supervision, management and control of FEMA’s activities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/09/photocatalytic-water-splitting-with-9-2-solar-to-hydrogen-efficiency/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,MICHIGAN,UNITED STATES",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Photocatalytic water splitting with 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency,"From pv magazine global
University of Michigan researchers developed a new photocatalytic water splitting system that is reportedly able to reach a 9.2% solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency.
The proposed system uses the higher energy part of the solar spectrum to split water and the lower part of the spectrum to provide heat that encourages the reaction. The extra heat also allows the hydrogen and oxygen to remain separate, rather than renewing their bonds and forming water once more.
It works in an indoor environment and uses pure water, concentrated solar light, and an indium gallium nitride photocatalyst. The semiconductor catalyst, a forest of nanowires of indium gallium nitride grown onto a silicon surface, is able to become more efficient during use, according to the scientists. The device absorbs photons and converts them into electrons, which are used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
The nanowires are peppered with nanoscale balls of metal, 1/2000th of a millimeter across, that use those electrons and holes, positively charged gaps left behind when electrons are liberated by the light, to help direct the reaction.
“A simple insulating layer atop the panel keeps the temperature at a toasty 75 C, or 167 F – warm enough to help encourage the reaction while also being cool enough for the semiconductor catalyst to perform well,” the scientists said.
They claim that the system is nearly 10 times more efficient than other solar water-splitting systems of the same kind. They said that the final cost of hydrogen could fall with a bigger semiconductor.
“We reduced the size of the semiconductor by more than 100 times compared to some semiconductors only working at low light intensity,” said researcher Peng Zhou.
The research group described the system in the study “Solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of more than 9% in photocatalytic water splitting,” published in Nature.
“This temperature-dependent strategy also leads to an STH efficiency of about 7 % from widely available tap water and sea water and an STH efficiency of 6.2% in a large-scale photocatalytic water-splitting system with a natural solar light capacity of 257 watts,” they said.
They claimed that the next challenge is to further improve the efficiency and generate ultra-high purity hydrogen that can be directly fed into fuel cells.
