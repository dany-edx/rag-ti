The acquisition brings Adapture Renewables‘ total solar portfolio to 239 MW across the country, including 95 MW in Texas.
Rippey Solar entered service last April and uses Q CELLS’ Q.PEAK DUO L-G8.3 and L-G8.2 modules. Rippey Solar is the largest project in Adapture’s generation portfolio, which consists mostly of smaller utility-scale installations, usually under 15 MW in capacity.
Adapture has had a stake in Rippey since day one: the company financed the project with in-house capital.
Of note, Adapture Renewables’ solar portfolio also includes roughly 24 MW of company-owned solar in Montana. That capacity makes up nearly 35% of all solar in the state; all of Adapture’s projects there entered service in 2017.
As a result, Adapture’s  projects have had an outsized impact on Montana’s total solar installations.
Adapture is an Oakland, California-based solar developer, owner, and operator. It owns solar projects in California, Oregon, Utah, Nebraska, Minnesota, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Rhode Island.

The two groups and three others hired the consulting firm Synapse to “correct several flaws” and prepare an alternative resource plan using the EnCompass utility model.
That alternative plan would add 16 GW of solar, 10 GW of storage, and 2.5 GW of onshore wind in North Carolina by 2035, and would reduce system costs by $7.2 billion compared to Duke Energy’s least-cost plan, say the groups in a separate filing. The three groups joining that filing are the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Sierra Club, and Natural Resources Defense Council.
The alternative resource plan would add 3.1 GW of the selected renewable capacity by 2026, assuming “reasonable limits” on annual renewable capacity additions, which are assumed to rise over time due to industry learning and improved resources.
NCSEA, with 174 member businesses, and trade association CCEBA say that the Synapse modeling corrected only some of the issues that their five expert witnesses and Synapse identified, while it kept many of Duke’s assumptions.
The alternative plan would retire coal based on Duke’s earliest practicable retirement schedule and build no new gas, while deploying solar and battery storage capacity and maintaining a 17% reserve margin.
“Without direction from the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Duke plans a massive buildout of gas power plants,” said a statement from the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
A utility’s resource plan typically serves as the basis for an application for a certificate to build a new power plant, notes a filing from SACE, the Sierra Club and NRDC.
The filings are available under the North Carolina Utilities Commission’s Docket E-100 Sub 165.

The company said the installation covers about 8 acres and represents Bridgestone’s first ground-mounted solar array to provide power directly to its manufacturing line. The company said it worked with developer Solar Alliance and owns the project, which went online in December 2020.
The tire plant recently partnered with Clemson University, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to use its solar array as a pilot project to develop a sustainable ground covering.
The Aiken County tire plant was LEED certified by the U.S. Green Building Council and is a Certified Habitat by the National Wildlife Habitat Council.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/02/utilities-agree-to-expand-fast-charging-locations-to-boost-ev-adoption/,"EV,MARKETS,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 2, 2021",Utilities agree to expand fast charging locations to boost EV adoption,"Six utilities said they plan to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers travel across major parts of the country with ready access to a network of DC fast chargers.
The charging stations would be sited along major highways from the Atlantic Coast, through the Midwest and South, and into the Gulf and Central Plains regions.
The plan was released by the Electric Highway Coalition, made up of American Electric Power (AEP), Dominion Energy, Duke Energy, Entergy Corp., Southern Co., and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The companies are each taking steps to provide EV charging within their service territories.
The utilities are not alone in building EV charging networks. EVgo has fast charging stations in 34 states and 67 metropolitan areas across the country. It has deployed fast chargers and Level 2 chargers at shopping centers, parking garages, grocery stores, and hotels, among other locations.
And in January, Electrify America’s commercial arm said it would provide charging equipment, networking, and services to support Arizona Public Service Co.’s Take Charge AZ initiative. The venture includes five charging stations across the state with four individual chargers each.
Electrify America expects to install around 800 charging stations with about 3,500 DC fast chargers by December. Chargers are planned for 29 metro areas and 45 states, including two cross-country routes.
Range anxiety is a barrier to EV adoption. The utility EV coalition said it plans to ease that concern and help consumers benefit from EV ownership. The stations will provide chargers that are capable of getting drivers back on the road in 20-30 minutes.
TVA is working to bring up to $40 million in programs to support EV adoption in the next five years in and around the Tennessee Valley. It said its goals include enabling more than 200,000 EVs to be on Valley roadways by 2028.
TVA also recently announced that it and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation will develop and fund a fast-charging network across interstates and major highways in the Volunteer State. TVA also said it plans to work with state agencies in other states to develop a fast-charging network across the Tennessee Valley.
In 2018, AEP Ohio launched a $10 million program to deploy 375 charging stations in partnership with local governments, workplaces, and multi-family dwellings to increase publicly available charging sites and demonstrate the benefit of public-private partnerships as part of the Smart Columbus initiative.
And, Duke Energy previously launched a program to expand EV charging both internally and externally through several utility pilot programs. An internal Electrify By Example initiative includes an effort to install chargers at all work locations to enable employees to drive electric.
In Florida, the company’s Park and Plug pilot has installed more than 570 EV public charging stations. Fifty of the 570 are fast charging stations connecting areas of Florida previously underserved by EV fast charging infrastructure.

If passed by Congress and signed into law, the bill would make available up to $8 billion in federal tax credits to spur domestic manufacturing of advanced energy technologies in rural communities hit by a loss of manufacturing and jobs in coal mining and coal-fired power production.
Manchin is chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Stabenow also sits on that committee as well as the Senate Finance Committee.
The bill would update Section 48C of the Internal Revenue Code, Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit, to provide tax credits for manufacturers and other industrial users. Credits would be used for investments in advanced electric grid, energy storage, fuel cell equipment, renewable energy and energy efficiency equipment, and advanced light- medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles, among other categories. The bill would include a $4 billion carve out for use in places where coal mines have closed or coal power plants have retired.
A number of groups endorsed the legislation, including, Third Way, BlueGreen Alliance, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund, American Automotive Policy Council, United Steelworkers, Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Electric Drive Transportation Association, Zero Emission Transportation Association, Stellantis, United Mine Workers of America, Ford Motor, General Motors, Information Technology Industry Council, League of Conservation Voters, American Automotive Policy Council, and Alliance for Automotive Innovation.
EDF Renewables North America announced a power purchase agreement for the second tranche of the Space City Solar Project with a unit of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. for 100 MWac / 132 MWdc. The project’s total capacity is up to 345 MWac / 455 MWdc. Space City Solar is southwest of Houston, and is expected to break ground this summer. The project will use bifacial PV modules.
Nextracker said it was tapped by Brazilian EPC firm Andrade Gutierrez and developer Elera Renováveis (formerly Brookfield Energia Renovável) to supply 830 MW of its NX Horizon single-axis solar tracker technology for Phase I of the 830 MW Janaúba solar complex in Brazil. The plant will be one of the largest of its kind in South America and is scheduled to enter service by early 2022. Nextracker’s local office will support the project with engineering help as well as commissioning, asset management, and data analytics services for preventive maintenance.
Brazil is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in Latin America, and has 7.4 GW of cumulative solar installations to date.
