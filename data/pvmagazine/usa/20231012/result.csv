The utilities also plan to build 53 GW of new gas capacity by 2030, up “nearly 40%” from last year, the environmental organization said.
The Sierra Club cited studies showing that clean energy is less expensive than 99% of existing coal and new gas generation.
The analysis covers 77 utility companies owned by the 50 utility parent companies that had the most coal and gas generating capacity as of 2021. The Sierra Club assigned a grade to each utility based on its projected progress in transitioning to renewables through 2030. Considering all the utilities together, the club assigned them a composite grade of D.
“Utilities are failing,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous, “and even worse, they seem to be OK failing to protect our health and our collective future.”
The Public Service Company of Oklahoma earned a grade of A and a perfect score of 100. The utility has reported plans to replace all of its coal and gas generation by 2030 with 1.6 GW-ac of solar and 2.8 GW-ac of wind capacity. The analysis does not report any utility’s planned additions of storage capacity.
Five other utilities also earned an A grade:
Twenty-nine utilities received a grade of F, including 12 with a score of zero. The scoring system gave points for planned new renewable capacity and coal plant retirements, and subtracted points for any planned new gas capacity. The full dataset is available through a Tableau dashboard.
To compile data on planned solar and wind capacity additions, the Sierra Club referred to integrated resource plans for utilities that file them publicly, corporate announcements of solar and wind projects, and the S&P Global Market Intelligence database.
The Sierra Club presented three case studies of the utilities it analyzed. Duke Energy Corporation’s five investor-owned utilities, said Cara Fogler, managing senior analyst at the Sierra Club and coauthor of the report, has the most coal capacity and the second most planned gas capacity of any parent company analyzed, and “must build five times as much” solar and wind capacity as it currently plans “to replace their massive fossil fuel generation.”
Ameren Missouri has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, but Fogler said that in its most recent resource plan, “the utility remains committed to operating its massive coal-burning plant into the 2040s.”
NextEra subsidiary Florida Power and Light, Fogler said, “is one of the leading utilities” transitioning to clean energy, “but still has room to improve,” as the utility’s planned solar and wind capacity would replace about “one-third” of its fossil fuel generation.
The Sierra Club’s analysis consists of the Tableau database and a written report titled “The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges,” and is the third in an annual series that began in 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/12/solar-pv-lcoe-expected-to-slide-to-0-021-kwh-by-2050-dnv-says/,"COST AND PRICES,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 12, 2023","Solar PV LCOE expected to slide to $0.021/kWh by 2050, DNV says","From pv magazine Global
By 2050 the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar PV will be $0.021/kWh, the international registrar and risk management company DNV, based in Norway, predicts in a new report published today. The Energy Transition Outlook 2023 – a 211-page document charting global and regional renewable energy trends until mid-century – prophesizes some solar PV’s LCOE will be already close to $0.020/kWh by 2025.
A reduction in unit investment costs, now valued at $870/kW, led to the decline, the report states. “As solar PV installations continue to double, these numbers are bound to drop, landing below $700/kW shortly after 2030 and shrinking further to $560/kW by 2050.”
The learning rate for solar is predicted to decrease from 26% to 17% by 2050, with the figure settling as cost components “adjust to decreasing expenses.” By the middle of the century, solar PV will retain its position as the world’s cheapest energy source, with a combined capacity of 15.3 TW – a 13-fold growth from 2022. But as solar grows so will storage, with the report stating, “We predict most of the global solar capacity additions to integrate storage”.

The Energy Transition Outlook 2023 expects solar to reach 54% of installed generation capacity by 2050, but only represent 39% of the world’s grid electricity generation. “The efficiency or the capacity factory of solar power stations trail behind other renewable energy sources like wind and hydropower,” the document states, “nevertheless, the underlying cause of solar’s rapid proliferation lies in its dwindling costs.”
DNV expects China and the United States to continue leading global solar PV installations for the next two-and-a-half decades, however, both countries will experience “a slight dip” by 2050 as they reach installation saturation. India, the Middle East and North Africa will creep up in the solar hierarchy, nearly tripling their shares, from 6% and 3% in 2022 to 14% and 12% by mid-century, respectively.
Solar taking over fossil fuel generation will differ per country and respective policies, with the report predicting solar surpassing fossil fuel generation in Europe in 2030 because of the region’s, “world-leading decarbonization agenda and supportive solar policy.” But this “overwhelming surge in solar” will have a knock-on effect on other renewable energy generators and the nuclear sector, leading to a slight decrease in shares.

Non-fossil fuel energy – solar PV, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and nuclear – is expected to make up 52% of the primary energy mix by 2050, which is a different prediction from DNV’s 2022 forecast, the new outlook report states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/12/ferc-commissioner-allison-clements-describes-the-path-forward-for-renewables/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 12, 2023",FERC Commissioner Allison Clements describes the path forward for renewables,"The renewables industry has a “really important game-changing opportunity,” said Commissioner Allison Clements with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), at a forum held by the trade group ACORE. Yet aligning the federal regulatory framework “with what’s happening in the world” is part of a “really difficult, complex puzzle that has to get solved.”
Clements said that while FERC is a technology-neutral economic regulator, “cheaper resources, opportunities for increased reliability—those things all line up with the opportunity for the energy transition.”
Now that FERC has issued the interconnection rule known as Order 2023, the “low-cost easy changes” should be implemented first, Clements said, mentioning grid-enhancing technologies but not advanced conductors.
After that, “the most important thing” FERC can do is finalize the regional transmission system planning rule that the commission proposed last year, and “align our interconnection process with our regional planning process,” Clements said. Doing so would provide “a chance at moving system planning out from under this ill-suited interconnection process, where this planning is, de facto, taking place.”
Next, Clements advised “thinking about” harmonizing interconnection processes with state solicitations in states “where that is relevant.”
“Another thing to do,” she said, is to facilitate “a focused interconnection process.” There has been experience with this in Europe and in Texas, she said, “where you think about getting resources hooked up for energy-only service, and then think about what to do after that.” That process is known as connect and manage.
At last month’s RE+ conference in Las Vegas, Melissa Alfano, director of energy markets and counsel for the solar trade group SEIA, said that many of that group’s members had expressed interest in connect and manage.
After facilitating connect and manage, Clements said “we still need interregional connection; the winter storms tell us that over and over again.”
“And finally, there’s market development” in the West and Southeast, Clements said, noting she is “pleased” to see progress on market development in the West, where regulators with “wildly diverse policy interests” are “really listening” to each other. Clements predicted success for that effort, saying “the dominoes are going to fall.”
“With all that, we can go out and have a beer,” Clements remarked. Still, she said, “there are so many policy makers, decision makers, members of industry, investors, who are going to be required to come together to make progress.”
Responding to a question from ACORE President and CEO Gregory Wetstone about how that organization can be most effective, Clements pointed to a proposed offshore grid off New England. When the New England states “bake it outside of the commission and bring it to us, that’s really helpful,” she said, as it helps the commission “understand that there’s a broad alignment there.” ACORE, Clements said, has “played an important role” in that process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/12/vermont-utility-announces-emissions-free-zero-outages-initiative/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,VERMONT",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 12, 2023",Vermont utility announces emissions-free “zero outages” initiative,"If ever a reader needed an example of an electric utility’s confidence in renewable energy to provide resilient, reliable power, one could look to Vermont’s Green Mountain Power, which recently launched a first-of-its-kind initiative to have zero power outages following infrastructure upgrades through 2030.
Green Mountain Power is a 100% carbon-free generation electric utility that sources more than 78% of its generation from renewable energy. It recently launched its Zero Outages Initiative, which “will deliver an energy system by 2030 where customers stay powered up across the state while reducing costs.”
The utility said this initiative is needed urgently following a devastating year of sever climate change-driven storms. Much of the state suffered widespread damage from floods in the Summer of 2023.
The plan calls for rapid acceleration of proven energy storage programs, proactive transmission line undergrounding, and system storm-hardening.
“We all see the severe impacts from storms, we know the impact outages have on your lives, and the status quo is no longer enough,” said Mari McClure, Green Mountain Power president and chief executive officer. “We are motivated to do all we can to combat climate change and create a Vermont that is sustainable and affordable, but we must move faster.”
The initiative leverages circuit-level resiliency data, topography, and other networks to determine the appropriate resiliency approaches for each of the utility’s 300 circuits. The approach is expected to ensure all customers experience zero outages, whether in a remote area of densely populated downtown.
The regulatory filing for the Zero Outages initiative calls for an investment of $280 million over the next two years, $250 of which call for undergrounding and storm-hardening lines, and $30 million for energy storage.
Major storms have caused over $115 million in damages in the utility’s service area, $45 million of which occurred in 2023. This spending gets customers reconnected after storm damage, but does little to prevent future outages, which are expected to become more frequent due to climate change.
“Projects to reinforce the grid and integrate energy storage are more important than ever. We know that we will continue to see an increase in extreme weather events, and research shows that every dollar invested in disaster preparedness and mitigation ultimately saves several times more in avoided response and recovery costs, while also preventing health and safety impacts,” said Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University’s Climate School.
Green Mountain Power
The Zero Outages Initiative will also incorporate a variety of energy storage and microgrid approaches to boost resilience. It includes incorporating emerging technologies like vehicle-to-home storage. The initiative also includes funds to provide residential batteries to customers in remote locations, with a goal for all customers to have energy storage.
Green Mountain Power has displayed cost-effective programs in both microgrids and energy storage in the past, including home battery programs, community microgrid and Resiliency Zones, and a resilient all-electric neighborhood which is under construction now.
Vermont regulators recently agreed to GMP’s request to lift the enrollment cap on its home battery programs. There are currently 5,000 home customer batteries in the utility’s network, which also includes utility-scale batteries, controllable devices like EV chargers, and school bus batteries through vehicle-to-grid operations.
The filing for the Zero Grid Initiatives will undergo a public review process through the Vermont Public Utility Commission. If approved, the first projects would begin in mid-2024.

Bill Mulligan, Maxeon’s CEO, said in the statement that the company has decided to “streamline” operations, invest in new technologies and develop a mix between DG and utility-scale markets due to the “rapidly changing market and industry conditions.”
“We believe that Maxeon is well positioned to weather this market disruption and come out stronger on the other side,” he said.
The press release mentions that the company’s largest North America-based DG customer recently “breached their payment obligations” and the company paused shipments in late July as a result.
“While this customer has recently made several payments on their outstanding balance and is now close to becoming current, we continue to pause our shipments and engage in good faith towards [the] resolution of certain ongoing claims of breach under the Master Supply Agreement,” Mulligan explained.
“We do not have visibility into how quickly such resolution can be achieved. It is our position that we have firm quantity and pricing contracts in place.”
The 35-year-old Maxeon – based in Singapore but with a presence in 13 0ther countries – expects its third quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of $224—$229 million, with shipments between 622 MW—632 MW. The company’s EBITDA, meanwhile, is slated to drop by roughly $30 million in Q3 2023 due to the reasons listed above and “inventory adjustments.”
The company will provide further details on Q3 2023 results and Q4 2023 guidance, as well as more information about restructuring activities, during its Q3 2023 earnings call, currently scheduled for November 15, 2023.
