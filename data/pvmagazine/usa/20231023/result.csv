Department of Public Utilities (DPU) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of a 27 MW behind-the-meter solar and battery energy storage portfolio.
Three energy-intensive sites, including the Fresno-Clovis Regional Wastewater Reclamation Facility and two surface water treatment facilities, will host the solar arrays and co-located storage. Once completed, Fresno-Clovis project will be among the largest metered solar energy and battery storage projects in California, adding 17 MW of solar and 2.3 MW of energy storage.
The project is developed in partnership with ForeFront Power, a solar and energy storage developer operating in the U.S. and Mexico. ForeFront will develop, own and maintain the portfolio, and the City of Fresno will purchase the electricity generated at a fixed rate power purchase agreement (PPA).
The PPA enabled the City to develop the portfolio at no upfront cost and without using bond funds. The City of Fresno achieves a fixed, below-market rate for electricity, aiding with budget certainty.
The DPU solar projects are part of the City of Fresno’s plan to lower energy costs, improve resiliency and reduce emissions. In a rising energy cost environment, DPU projects the plan will save the city $100 million in taxpayer dollars by 2045.
Construction of the ground-mounted projects will be conducted by the IBEW Local 100 local union labor group. Development of the city’s solar and storage portfolio has created 192 local jobs, with the three solar and storage projects accounting for 120 local jobs.
The three solar projects are expected to lead to the avoidance of 37,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. This is equivalent to removing the emissions of 7,000 gas-powered vehicles or offsetting the emissions by planting 550,000 trees.
“With over 300 days of sunshine per year, the City is harnessing one of its most abundant resources to protect pocket books, the air, and the climate all at once,” said Rachel McLaughlin, senior vice president of sales and marketing, ForeFront Power.
In addition to the DPU portfolio, the City of Fresno is currently working with ForeFront Power to develop new behind-the-meter solar and storage assets, including a project at a new airport terminal building, a bus yard, and at police and fire stations.
The City of Fresno procured its solar energy and smart battery storage assets by leveraging the Renewable Energy Aggregated Procurement (REAP) program. REAP provides public sector buyers with pre-negotiated contracts, pricing, and standardized terms. ForeFront Power was selected by the City of Fresno through the program via an integrated Request for Proposals (RFP) process.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/23/bipartisan-farmland-act-acknowledges-that-agrivoltaics-are-part-of-americas-future/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 23, 2023",Bipartisan Farmland act acknowledges that agrivoltaics are part of America’s future,"U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Protecting Future Farmland Act, legislation that aims to provide a framework for protecting agrivoltaic farmland. The bill amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 and aims to modify the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP).
Agrivoltaics, defined by the bill authors as “a system under which solar energy production and agricultural production, including crop or animal production, occurs in an integrated manner on the same piece of land through the duration of a solar project.” According to research firm Allied Analytics, agrivoltaics can represent a win-win for farmers and solar developers. It forecasts the agrivoltaic market can reach $9.3 billion by 2031, growing at an annual rate of over 10%.
Researchers at Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States, and that an area the size of Maryland (13,000 square miles) would be needed. While that is only 1% of current U.S. farmland, the goal of the Farmland Act to help support farmers who plan to deploy solar on their land. At a global scale, it is estimated that 1% of all farmland could produce the world’s energy needs if converted to solar PV.
While these figures are appealing to clean energy advocates, stewards of farmland are concerned because of the strong appeal of turning vast acres of flat land in sunny regions into agrivoltaic systems. Recent modeling by the American Farmland Trust (AFT) estimates that 83% of new solar deployment is likely to take place on farmland if policy steps are not taken.
The bipartisan legislation aims to ensure that federal investment in rural energy projects prioritizes both land stewardship and responsible deployment of renewable energy. Additionally, the senators are concerned about the condition of the land after a solar lease ends.
AFT is in support of the bill, stating that the bill would help ensure the current renewable energy buildout benefits rural communities, protects farmland and strengthens farm viability.
“Solar deployment can be an opportunity to strengthen farm viability and keep land in farming, but to do this right will require action,” said Tim Fink, policy director of American Farmland Trust. “We applaud Senator Baldwin and Senator Grassley’s Protecting our Future Farmland Act for introducing a bill with common sense, timely, and necessary policies that will empower USDA to advance a smarter solar buildout.”
Specifically the Protecting Future Farmland Act intends to achieve the following:
The bill was introduced into Congress on September 26, 2023 and may be considered by committee next. In addition to the AFT, the bill has been endorsed by American Soybean Association, the Nature Conservancy, Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, Wisconsin Farmers Union, and Wisconsin Soybean Growers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/23/tesla-steps-in-as-challenger-to-rooftop-solar-inverter-duopoly/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 23, 2023",Tesla steps in as challenger to rooftop solar inverter duopoly,"Two inverter suppliers dominate the United States rooftop solar market: Enphase and SolarEdge. The former provides microinverters, which pair an inverter with each solar module, while the latter provides string inverters tied to module-level power optimizers.
Together, the two represent about 90% of the United States market share. Roth Capital Partners said an industry note that Enphase holds about 50% market share, while SolarEdge represents about 40% to 45%.
Residential solar is currently in a wounded state, with SolarEdge and Enphase stocks down as much as 70% from their highs last December. High interest rates and changes to solar export compensation rates have caused a significant peel back in demand for new installations.
Phil Shen, managing director, Roth Capital Partners issued an industry note, warning that these forces may continue to weigh down residential solar through 2024. He forecasts a 12% market contraction nationwide in 2024. This can spell doom for the share price of high-growth companies like the two inverter duopoly players.
What’s more, Roth has warned that Tesla may make a move to gobble up some market share in the rooftop solar inverter space. It is currently a major provider of home batteries in its Powerwall offering, a leading home EV charger supplier, and despite a 48% pullback in its rooftop solar business, Tesla is a significant player in residential solar.
Tesla offers a string inverter, similar to SolarEdge’s product. String inverters generally fetch a lower price, bringing down upfront system costs. The low upfront cost is particularly attractive to customers right now, who are faced with high interest rates that drive up the sticker price of a solar lease or loan. Roth said Tesla’s pricing has been coming in lower than Enphase and SolarEdge.
In a survey of 26 residential solar installers, Roth found that collectively the installers expect Tesla inverters to become about 15% of the overall market share in 2024. The survey results showed that installers expect about 10% of the 15% points to come from SolarEdge’s share, while the other 5% points would come from Enphase’s share.
“When we asked why two-thirds of the TSLA share shift would come from SEDG vs. one-third from ENPH, the answer was due to ‘frustration’ with SEDG quality, while there is ‘more stickiness’ and loyalty with ENPH,” said the Roth note.
Roth has noted after a ramp-up of Tesla inverter-only sales, request for Tesla inverter quotes has begun to plateau on merchant sites like EnergySage. Reports of commissioning issues and high failure rates early on in adoption have tempered Roth’s expectations for a Tesla residential inverter market takeover, though a 15% share grab is still significant.
Furthermore, Tesla will begin to sell its Powerwall 3 home battery in 2024 or 2025. The Powerwall 3 is only compatible with Tesla string inverters. This strategy could carve out a significant market share for the automaker, challenging the U.S. residential solar inverter duopoly.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/23/the-hydrogen-stream-industry-groups-set-2026-target-for-eu-us-hydrogen-trade/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"OCTOBER 23, 2023",The Hydrogen Stream: Industry groups set 2026 target for EU-US hydrogen trade,"From pv magazine Global
The US Department of Energy (DoE) says it has earmarked $7 billion to launch seven nationwide Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) for the rapid deployment of low-cost clean hydrogen. The H2Hubs aim to collectively produce 3 million metric tons of hydrogen per year, contributing to nearly one-third of the 2030 US production targets. The funds will also support clean hydrogen storage, delivery, and end-use. The seven selected hubs are as follows: the Appalachian Hydrogen Hub between West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; the California Hydrogen Hub in California; the Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub in Texas; the Heartland Hydrogen Hub between Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Mid-Atlantic Hydrogen Hub between Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey; the Midwest Hydrogen Hub between Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan; and the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub between Washington, Oregon, and Montana. The H2Hubs selectees are investing $40 billion.
The Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) – in cooperation with RMI, Systemiq, Power2X, and industry leaders – has set up the Transatlantic Clean Hydrogen Trade Coalition (H2TC) to enable the initial shipment of clean hydrogen from the United States to Europe by 2026. H2TC will provide members with access to regulatory and infrastructure requirements analysis, supply and demand matching, and integration with capital markets. The coalition seeks to connect US fuel producers with heavy-industry consumers in Europe, facilitating the first shipment of clean hydrogen-based fuels by 2026. Their aim is to expand transatlantic trade to 3 million metric tons per year by the end of the decade.
ITM Power says it will launch bidding on projects in the US market, offering its electrolyzer stack for both CE and ASME territories. The UK electrolyzer producer says it will pursue a streamlined, asset-light entry into the US market, capitalizing on existing relationships in North America. By standardizing production processes and supply chains, it aims to simplify operations and achieve economies of scale.
SSAB, LKAB, and Vattenfall have completed a month-long commercial test of Hybrit’s hydrogen storage on the electricity market. Vattenfall stated that by introducing storage, the variable cost of hydrogen production could be significantly reduced, by 25% to 40%. The mission aimed to produce hydrogen using fossil-free electricity at varying electricity prices, optimizing cost-effectiveness, especially during times of abundant weather-dependent electricity generation. The hydrogen was continuously supplied to SSAB for fossil-free iron production in Luleå, Sweden. The hydrogen storage facility, operational since the summer of 2022, will continue testing activities until 2024. This pilot plant measures 100 cubic meters and contains hydrogen gas pressurized up to 250 bars.
Portugal‘s Secretary of State for Energy and Climate, Ana Fontoura Gouveia, has announced an upcoming auction for green hydrogen and biomethane injection into the natural gas grid, with expectations of the European Commission’s opinion on the Portugal, Spain, and France green hydrogen corridor project in November.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/23/u-s-solar-generation-has-grown-12x-in-a-decade/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 23, 2023",U.S. solar generation has grown 12x in a decade,"The past decade has shown a rise in renewable energy from an alternative source to an increasingly important feature in the United States energy mix. Environment America showed in its Renewables on the Rise annual report that solar now generates 12 times as much electricity as it did in 2013.
The U.S. produced enough solar energy to power 19 million homes in 2022. Cumulatively, over 153 GW of solar capacity has been installed through the first half of 2023. And the growth has only begun to ramp up. Over 32 GW of installations are expected in 2023, representing a 52% growth over 2022 totals. 
Solar represented 54% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the first quarter of 2023, according to Wood Mackenzie, which projects that cumulative installations will more than double by 2028 to 375 GW.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) forecasts strong growth in solar for years to come. It expects over 83 GW of “high probability” solar capacity additions through August 2026. This dwarfs the 4 GW of natural gas additions expected through that date. 
FERC said that the 83 GW of “high probability” solar additions may be quite conservative. There is over 214 GW of solar additions in the three-year project pipeline. 
Other renewables are rising alongside solar as well. Environment America reports that the U.S. sourced nearly 17% of its electricity from solar, wind, and geothermal sources in 2022. This is up from just over 5% in 2013. Fourteen states produced more than 30% of total electricity from those three emissions-free sources in 2022, up from just two states in 2013.
Over that period, wind energy has grown 2.6 times, achieving enough generation to power the equivalent of 41 million typical U.S homes.
Nearly one million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in 2022, a nearly 10x increase from 2013. Electric vehicle chargers have also scaled in that time, reaching 151,000 new installations in 2022, an 18-fold increase.
Energy storage is also scaling to support the intermittent cycles of renewable energy generation. The U.S. had 8.9 GW of battery energy storage at the end of 2022, which is 60 times more than 2013 totals. Energy storage grew an astonishing 85% year-over-year from 2021 to 2022.
Alongside the buildout of renewables is a push for improved energy efficiency. Environment America said efficiency improvements installed in 2021 will save 300 TWh of power over the lifetimes of the installed technologies. These efficiency savings alone save the equivalent power demand of 28 million homes per year.
Environment America released a state-by-state dashboard for tracking these improvements through the years. The Renewables on the Rise dashboard can be viewed here.
“This incredible growth will be key to achieving our vision of a clean energy future — one in which we can all live greener, healthier lives in a world powered solely by clean, renewable energy,” said Environment America.
A report from Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) showed total investment in clean energy, clean transportation, building electrification and carbon management reached $213 billion over the last year (from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023).
The $213 billion invested represents a 37% leap over 2021/2022 investments of $155 billion. Clean investment continues to strongly increase each year. In 2018/2019, total investments reached $81 billion, and it has climbed each year since.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/23/overhaul-regional-grid-operators-to-speed-renewables-says-energy-lawyer/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 23, 2023","Overhaul regional grid operators to speed renewables, says energy lawyer","The power industry “is in the early phase of a technological revolution,” but the entities that hold power and influence in regional grid operators are largely “last century’s power players,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School, in a thread on media platform X.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), he said, treats each “discriminatory rule” set by regional grid operators as an “isolated incident,” rather than “tracing them all to faulty governance that perpetuates the status quo.”
The result, he said, is that the power industry is slow to connect new renewables projects, build more transmission, and adopt advanced transmission technologies.
Peskoe noted that 25 years ago FERC approved newly-formed grid operators—widely known as RTOs/ISOs—and that FERC has the legal authority to ensure their independence. He recommended that FERC promote “under-represented voices” in RTO/ISO governance, such as state regulators, “who can be a counterweight to entrenched power.” The map below from the Sustainable FERC Project shows the RTO/ISO regions.

Peskoe based his thread on his forthcoming paper titled “Replacing the Utility Transmission Syndicate’s Control,” to be published in the Energy Law Journal.
When RTOs/ISOs were formed, Peskoe says in the paper, their primary purpose was to achieve non-discriminatory transmission service to enable new power plant developers to participate in interstate electricity markets and allow power prices to be set through competition.
But investor-owned utilities “exercise formal authority and exert informal influence” in developing regional market and transmission rules, Peskoe says, and can “stack the rules against new entrants that might threaten their dominant positions and undermine their business models.”
Peskoe says that FERC itself maintains that it has jurisdiction over RTO/ISO governance, and that FERC’s legal framework “demands” regulation of “utility alliances.” FERC should “revive its independent governance agenda,” he says.
Beyond Peskoe’s call for FERC to require RTOs/ISOs to add “under-represented voices” to their boards, he makes technical recommendations to spur reforms with “the independent entity variation,” support independence with a transparency principle, and “revisit” RTO/ISO filing rights, member sectors, and rulemaking processes.
FERC Commissioner Allison Clements recently stated five priorities for FERC and the RTOs/ISOs: implementing advanced transmission technologies; finalizing FERC’s regional transmission system planning rule; facilitating a connect-and-manage interconnection process; interregional transmission connection; and market development in the West and Southeast.
Law professor Shelley Welton has argued for consideration of public control of RTOs/ISOs, to speed interconnection of utility-scale renewables and storage. Peskoe’s thread on X cites Welton’s work and that of other scholars who have proposed reforms to RTO/ISO governance.

Supported by the Inflation Reduction Act, the program intends to help expand access to cost-saving clean energy projects in underserved communities with tax incentives for solar and wind projects across the country.
When combined with other incentives, solar and wind projects in low-income communities could receive as much as a 70% credit, according to Jennifer Granholm, secretary of energy. The program provides an increase of 10 percentage points to the Section 48 investment tax credit (ITC) for qualifying solar and wind energy facilities that are less than 5 MWac located in low-income communities or on Indian Land, and an increase of 20 percentage points for facilities that are built as part of a Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project, or as part of a Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project.
The program allows for up to 1.8 GW of eligible solar and wind capacity to be allocated in credits each year. Treasury and the IRS established the program under section 48(e) to promote cost-saving clean energy investments in low-income communities, on Indian land, as part of affordable housing developments, and benefitting low-income households.
“The Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit program will help community-based projects deliver direct benefits to families, making solar and wind energy more affordable and more accessible — revitalizing communities and exemplifying our whole-of-government effort to support low-income and Tribal communities in their energy transition efforts,” said Granholm.
Eligible applicants can participate in the program immediately through the program’s new applicant portal. DOE is accepting applications for the initial application window over the next 30-days for the 2023 program year. After the initial 30-day application window closes, applications for 2023 will be considered on a rolling basis.
DOE’s Office of Economic Impact and Diversity is administering the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program on behalf of Treasury and IRS.
