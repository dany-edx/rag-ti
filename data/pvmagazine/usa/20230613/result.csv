The cuts are proposed under a bill called the “Build it in America Act.”
“In less than a year these pro-business, pro-growth policies have spurred more than 65 gigawatts of clean energy manufacturing announcements around the country,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). 
“Repealing the IRA will destabilize the $35 billion solar market and harm thousands of small businesses in the process. More than 255,000 Americans rely on their solar and storage job to support their families, and Congress must act to protect them,” said Ross Hopper.
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith introduced the Build It in America Act (H.R. 3938), which contains the potentially devastating cuts to clean energy incentives. The Investment Tax Credit offers a 30% credit for installed system costs, from residential to utility-scale projects, while the Production Tax Credit incentivizes electricity generation from clean sources.
The “Build it in America Act” contains cuts to the two cornerstone tax credits. The Act also makes cuts to the federal electric vehicle tax credit, both for new and used EVs. Furthermore, the Act terminates Superfund funding, which helps support the treatment of hazardous waste in the United States.
The full package of proposed laws, which are a clear bane to the environment and the clean energy transition, can be found here.
“As we traveled to communities across this country, Americans from all walks of life – workers, parents, farmers, and small business owners – have shared their concerns with today’s chronically high prices, climbing interest rates, labor shortages and supply chain failures, as well as the challenge of competing with China,” said Chairman Smith.
“These policies will provide relief for working families, strengthen small businesses, grow jobs, and protect American innovation and competitiveness,” concluded Chairman Smith in a press release.
However, Smith’s view on the effect of these critical incentives on U.S. jobs, energy supply chains, and small businesses may be an inverse from reality.
Since the new clean energy incentives have been announced, over 21,000 new U.S. manufacturing jobs have been created, along with nearly $200 billion in capital investment.
“Despite strong opposition from some House Republicans, the vast majority of this new investment is bringing economic development to rural counties in red states all across the nation,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer, American Clean Power Association. “We’re confident that the clean energy tax provisions will be sustained as lawmakers continue to see the benefits their constituents are enjoying from new jobs and affordable, domestic clean power.”
This is the second attempt by a coalition of House members to overturn the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit, two policies that are at the core of the United States push toward low cost, carbon-free electricity. The first attempt, which smuggled IRA cuts into the debt ceiling raise bill, was thwarted in negotiations that led to expedited environmental reviews for energy projects of all types.

“We urge Congress to remove the Inflation Reduction Act’s solar and storage credits from the House Ways and Means tax package,” said Ross Hopper.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/13/green-hydrogen-market-to-grow-six-fold-to-1-4-trillion-said-deloitte/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 13, 2023","Green hydrogen market to grow six-fold to $1.4 trillion, said Deloitte","A report from the Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress (DCSP) outlined the potential of green hydrogen, or hydrogen fuel produced by renewable energy sources, to meet the demands of heavy industry. 
The report set global market milestones of $642 billion by 2030, $980 billion by 2040, and $1.4 trillion by 2050, with growth in the industry split among the major global economies relatively evenly by mid-century, as seen below. This level of investment would represent a cumulative $9 trillion push by the global economy by 2050. 
Hard-to-abate sectors like steelmaking, chemical manufacturing, aviation and global shipping require high amounts of energy dispatch, something that can be difficult for electrochemical batteries to achieve. While batteries may serve mobile devices, electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage, hydrogen may present a viable path forward for decarbonizing these high-dispatch use cases.
The report said that these sectors may drive hydrogen demand and use six-fold by 2050, leading to nearly 600 million tons of hydrogen fuel use. While hydrogen electrolysis requires large amounts of electricity, the only byproduct of burning hydrogen fuel is water, making it an emissions-free source when created by renewable sources.
However, based on current green hydrogen project announcements, the global community could only provide a collective production capacity to meet one quarter of the projected demand in 2030, said Deloitte.
The firm estimates that green hydrogen could abate 85 gigatons of cumulative emissions by 2050, which equates to more than twice the annual total emissions in the year 2021.
Deloitte said that decisive climate action can help push the competitiveness of green hydrogen. After about 10 years, green hydrogen can become cost-competitive, said Deloitte, leading to the creation of 2 million jobs per year between 2030 and 2050. The firm said that as much as 70% of this job growth could occur in developing countries.
“Money is not the problem—though the average annual investment over the time period is significantly less than the $417 billion that was spent on oil and gas production in 2022 globally,” said Prof. Dr. Bernhard Lorentz, founding chair of the DCSP. “It’s just a question of redirecting the investment to clean energy sources, and Deloitte sees that the global finance industry has an increasing appetite for major investments.”
The projections come from Deloitte’s Hydrogen Pathway Explorer (HyPE) model, which delivers analysis of the global hydrogen supply. Deloitte’s outlook provides extensive detail into the cost, production, and market of hydrogen, even analyzing the business challenges facing the successful implementation of clean hydrogen, and providing insights into various market dynamics, such as optimal infrastructure sizing, investment needs, and technology choices.
“This analysis reveals a compelling opportunity for private and public leaders to accelerate the green energy transition,” said Joe Ucuzoglu, global chief executive officer, Deloitte. “While wind, solar, and other more traditional forms of renewable power are essential to a net-zero future, Deloitte’s research demonstrates how clean hydrogen can help tackle decarbonization of some of the world’s most emissions intensive and hardest-to-abate sectors, further mitigating the effects of climate change while fueling economic growth, particularly in developing countries.”
Deloitte notes that interregional trade and diversified transport infrastructure may be a large driver in green hydrogen development adoption.
“Regions that are currently able to produce cost-competitive hydrogen in quantities that exceed domestic needs are already positioning themselves as future hydrogen exporters—supplying other less-competitive regions and helping to smoothly facilitate the energy transition,” said the report.
Notably, interregional hydrogen trade is projected to generate more than $280 billion in annual export revenues by 2050.
Deloitte has undergone some recent actions to support green hydrogen adoption, including the establishment of a Hydrogen Investment Corridor initiative to help establish multilateral collaboration across key hydrogen trade and investment pathways, with an initial focus on Germany, Australia, Africa, and Japan.
The firm also launched the Deloitte Global Hydrogen Center of Excellence, which helps hydrogen developers scale up their businesses through advisory, implementation, and operational guidance services.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/13/cubicpv-receives-103-million-commitment-for-u-s-wafer-manufacturing/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MASSACHUSETTS,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 13, 2023",CubicPV receives $103 million commitment for U.S. wafer manufacturing,"CubicPV announced that it has secured new firm equity commitments in excess of $100 million dollars in support of its U.S. factory plans and tandem solar product roadmap. 
The first $33 million will be released immediately. The second tranche investment is tied to specific project milestones. The capital was committed by shareholders, led by SCG Cleanergy (a wholly owned subsidiary of SCG) with contributions from Hunt Energy Enterprises and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a set of investment funds founded by Bill Gates.
“With its deep experience in silicon wafer production and ownership of highly innovative proprietary technologies, Cubic is ideally positioned to play a key role in the world’s embrace of solar powered electricity generation. We continued to be impressed with the strength of the team, their progress against plan and their commitment to manufacturing and innovation excellence,” said Tim McCaffery, global investment director, SCG.
Late last year, CubicPV announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
CubicPV said it continues to make progress in its plan to build U.S. wafer manufacturing capacity, having completed its conceptual design and scoping for the project. The company narrowed its site selection decision to two final possible locations, and engaged with an industry-leading project management company. It also indicated that financing is on track, having received term sheets that indicate that it will exceed the required total equity for the new factory.
“Today’s announcement underscores the considerable progress we’ve made, the depth of our engineering competence and the strength of our technologies to deliver a more powerful solar future,” said Frank van Mierlo, chief executive officer of CubicPV. “We thank SCG Cleanergy for their confidence in our manufacturing goals and product roadmap.
Not only is CubicPV moving forward with its manufacturing plant, but the company announced the appointment of David Gustafson as president of the new wafer facility. In this role, Gustafson will head up the planning, design, ramp, and operation of Cubic’s factory. He brings extensive manufacturing leadership and engineering experience, most recently leading the manufacturing functions for 5,000 people, across seven states and eight U.S. factories for a Fortune 500 company. Gustafson received his Bachelor of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his Master of Science degree from Vanderbilt University. He also served in the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps as Company Commander for Navy Mobile Construction Battalion 74.
CubicPV was formed in 2021 from the merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, a company that was founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bedford, Mass. 1366 Technologies was known for its direct wafer technology, which forms wafers directly, using molten silicon, instead of silicon ingots sawn into wafers.
The process results in lower losses due to a kerfless wafer production that does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers. This eliminates a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon.
In addition to plans to produce wafers to fill a much-needed gap in the U.S. solar supply chain, the company said it will continue research and development of its tandem modules, which reportedly offers more than 30% greater efficiency than the highest efficiency conventional modules. The design stacks two solar cells, with silicon on the bottom, powered by CubicPV’s Direct Wafer technology, and perovskite on the top, the company claims that the tandem design “will dramatically increase the power of every acre of solar deployed.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/13/ny-senator-submits-unforced-errors-and-propaganda-in-bad-faith-clean-energy-bill/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NEW YORK",,"JUNE 13, 2023",NY senator submits unforced errors and propaganda in bad-faith clean energy bill,"A bill submitted to the New York legislature by a Republican state senator aims to amend multiple state laws, redefining “clean electricity infrastructure” by limiting its scope to wind and solar facilities and electric cars. According to this proposal, these entities can only be classified as “clean” if the energy used to manufacture them is sourced from wind and solar.
Introduced as S6732, the bill was forwarded to the New York legislature in May and later referred to the floor of the Energy and Telecommunications Committee. No votes have been cast on this bill, and the legislative session in New York concluded last weekend.
The proposed legislation consists of five succinct, similarly worded amendments. The initial amendment reads:
To require that the manufacture and distribution of electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar collectors and infrastructure to upgrade the power grid is conducted using only wind and solar energy and does not use any power derived from fossil fuels, nuclear energy or any form of combustion. This subdivision shall apply to all mining and material processing required to obtain and create materials used, all industrial operations, fabrication and assembly, and all distribution to end users.
This stance on “clean energy” recalls the bold actions of environmental activist Greta Thunberg. To underscore the challenges of transitioning to clean energy, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic in a carbon-neutral ship, an inconvenient journey taking 14 days each way. Her voyage conveyed a powerful message about the need for innovation, development, and construction to create an appealing, clean future. Thunberg’s commitment highlights the delicate balance between leveraging technology and resources that benefit society and those that might pose a threat, while recognizing clearly that we are currently dependent on fossils.
The press release from the bill sponsor includes an erroneous claim that solar panels “require” rare earth elements. Although thin-film solar panels from First Solar do require tellurium, a rare element, First Solar’s manufacturing capacity constitutes about 2% of the solar market worldwide. Projections indicate that by 2025, when First Solar is expected to hit 10 GW per year of manufacturing capacity, the global manufacturing capacity of solar panels should exceed 1,000 GW per year. Thus, the assertion that solar panels “require” rare earth minerals appears to stem from deliberate ignorance and bad faith.
The concluding statement of the bill sponsor’s press release suggests delaying the rollout of new clean energy technologies until all such technologies are produced using clean energy. Delaying clean energy infrastructure would result in continued dependence on heavily polluting fossil fuel infrastructure.
The Global Electronics Council recently published a standard aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of solar panel manufacturing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/13/brookfield-renewable-to-acquire-dukes-commercial-renewable-business/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA,NORTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 13, 2023",Brookfield Renewable to acquire Duke’s commercial renewable business,"Duke Energy reached an agreement to sell its commercial renewable energy business which comprises close to 3.5 GW of utility solar, wind and energy storage projects for cash consideration of $1.1 billion and the assumption of $1.7 billion total debt.
The North Carolina investor-owned utility initiated a sale process for its commercial renewables business in September 2022 with sellside advisor Morgan Stanley. In November, the company said the value for the renewables business could exceed a book value of $4 billion, and on its Q4 2022 earnings call the company continued to defend the broad valuation of its commercial renewables business.
Despite a back and forth with industry analysts about the division’s valuation on its recent earnings calls, the utility saw a haircut valuation for the commercial division in its announced sale, with the $2.8 billion enterprise value reflecting a 30% discount to the valuation its management discussed on earnings calls.
The utility will utilize sale proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet and avoid additional holding company debt. This will allow the company to focus on the growth of its regulated businesses, including investments to enhance grid reliability and help incorporate over 30 GW of regulated renewable energy into its system by 2035.
In November 2022, Duke launched an auction for its commercial renewable energy platform, which is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The sale is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
“As one of the country’s largest renewable energy operators, Brookfield has the resources to support the continued growth and success of the Commercial Renewables’ portfolio,” said Lynn Good, president and chief executive officer of Duke Energy. “This sale is an important step in our transition into a purely regulated company with significant grid and clean energy investment plans that will deliver benefits to our customers and stakeholders.”
The primary business operations of Duke’s commercial renewables business will remain in Charlotte, N.C. and the Duke employees that support the business will transition over to Brookfield to maintain business continuity for its operations and customers.
Connor Teskey, chief executive officer of Brookfield Renewable said:
With this acquisition, we are adding a scale operating renewable platform with a full suite of in-house capabilities and a proven management team experienced in operations and development. We are also adding to our pipeline of renewable development projects, solidifying our position as one of the largest renewable energy businesses in the U.S. with almost 90,000 megawatts of operating and development assets.
Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities advised Duke Energy on the sale, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom was its legal advisor.
Separately, Duke Energy is continuing to progress on the sale process for its distributed generation business, which is also expected to close by the end of the year.
The sales represent a trend over the past few years of regulated utility companies separating their regulated operations from power generation and commercial renewables business assets.
New York’s largest utility Con Edison in October 2022 closed the sale of its 7 GW Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses to German power and utility company RWE AG in a $6.8 billion transaction, which represented the largest corporate solar mergers and acquisition deal of the year.
