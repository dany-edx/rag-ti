https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/04/north-carolina-court-to-rule-whether-hoas-can-block-rooftop-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 4, 2022",North Carolina court to rule whether HOAs can block rooftop solar,"Solar access laws are commonplace in the United States, especially in communities managed by homeowner’s associations (HOA). Often, solar-hopeful customers can be blocked from exercising their choice to purchase and own locally generated clean energy in the form of rooftop PV.
In North Carolina, a case has elevated to the state’s Supreme Court, one that is set to challenge the solar access laws that have been in place since 2007. The case, Belmont v. Farwig, raises a question of when planned communities are allowed to use an exception in the access laws to prevent street-facing solar panels from being installed.
Tom Farwig argues his HOA cannot block his rooftop solar plans, as the community rules don’t expressly prohibit it. Conversely, Belmont Community Association, argues that Mr. Farwig’s solar array can be considered an “improvement,” which is something that the group has the authority to reject, regardless of whether it is an improvement explicitly listed by HOA rules.
Belmont found favor in the state’s Court of Appeals, but the rooftop solar industry, environmentalists, and North Carolina’s attorney general have filed statements in support of Farwig’s complaint.
“If an HOA, completely subjectively, does not like the look of solar panels, these homeowners are essentially forever denied access to solar,” said Bryce Bruncati, director of residential sales for 8MSolar, a member of the Sustainable Energy Association.
Roughly 40% of North Carolina homes are controlled under 14,000 HOAs throughout the state. The ruling could have a large impact on rooftop solar deployment going forward.
Like many solar companies, Farwig’s chosen rooftop solar developer Blue Raven solar does not schedule an installation until HOA approval is achieved. Blue Raven has an entire division devoted to dealing with HOA rules, and it testified in a brief to the court that it has lost at least 500 potential solar customers in the state due to HOA interference.
In this case, a mistake was made, and Blue Raven installed the panels before securing final HOA approval. The company supplied a permit after installation when the community requested it five months later, and even supplemented the permit with signatures of 22 Belmont residents that supported the installation of their neighbor’s panels. However, Belmont denied the permits several times.
The reason for denial? Belmont found that the array would “be aesthetically unpleasing as viewed from the public street.”
Then, Belmont began charging Farwig $50 a day to keep his property out of foreclosure, which he paid.  The HOA then placed a lien on his home. This is when Mr. Farwig decided to countersue, alleging that solar access laws had been violated.
Since the conflict began, Mr. Farwig has paid over $52,000 in fines to his HOA for having thin rectangles of electricity-producing silicon on his otherwise unproductive roof. Blue Raven has publicly committed to paying the fines for Mr. Farwig, taking responsibility for the mistimed approval request.
Language in the 2007 solar access law suggests that HOA’s cannot ban solar explicitly or effectively, and that it can only bar front-facing solar arrays if it explicitly lists them in its community rules. “This statute is putting developers and associations on notice: ‘If you want to try to ban this very important access, you have to put it in your declarations,’” said James Galvin, Farwig’s representation.
Furthermore, General Assembly law ensures that homeowners must have a say in the operation of their HOA. If the HOA wants to add further barriers to solar, it must be approved with a two-thirds majority vote by residents.
Last year, the state’s House of Representatives passed legislation that removed the front-facing exception, and instead gave control to HOAs to dictate panel placement, as long as there isn’t more than a 10% impact on production. This may be a more solar-friendly law in effect, as moving panels to the wrong azimuth can have dramatically negative effects on production.
Belmont attorney Brian Edlin argued that legislation, and not the courts, would be the best place to determine North Carolinians’ right to go solar. Edlin said if homeowners want to expand their solar rights, “they can go to the legislature and they can pass a new law that deletes (the exemption)”.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/04/jupiter-powers-flower-valley-ii-energy-storage-facility-comes-online-in-texas/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 4, 2022",Jupiter Power’s Flower Valley II energy storage facility comes online in Texas,"Flower Valley II, one of the largest energy storage projects in Texas, has begun operations. The 200MWh Flower Valley II installation is the second battery facility on the site, which together represent an investment of more than $70 million. The company expects a total of more than 650MWh of dispatchable energy storage capacity to be operational before mid-summer in Texas.
Flower Valley II, Jupiter’s first transmission connected project, is a 100MW energy storage facility, enough power to meet the electricity needs of 20,000 homes at peak demand in Texas. The site is providing power to the ERCOT grid for use by Texas consumers, both through energy capacity and grid-firming ancillary services.
“Projections show that Texas will continue to lead the US in the addition of wind and solar generation,” said Bill Flores, former US Congressmen, Energy & Commerce Committee. “Renewable resources, however, add increasing complexity and reliability challenges to grid management, but the addition of significant energy storage and related technologies will help mitigate these challenges to help improve grid resilience and reliability as part of an ‘All of the Above’ energy solution to provide power while reducing emissions.”
Texas burns more coal and emits more sulfur dioxide than any other state, so the operation of Flower Valley II will help move the state toward a cleaner future. Recent research conducted at Rice University is modeling least-cost paths to a renewable energy future for Texas. The myriad of health and climate-related harms caused by coal do not need to persist any longer, according to the researchers. The research team found that just a third of the wind and solar projects proposed to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) by June 2020 could replace almost all of the state’s coal generation. Since June 2020, dozens of those projects have been built, and the queue of proposed solar projects has doubled.
Flower Valley II adjoins Flower Valley I, an existing distribution-connected Jupiter battery energy storage facility. Jupiter has two other transmission connected projects, each 200MWh, currently in commissioning in West Texas, with all capacity expected to be operational before the hot summer season in ERCOT territory.
This new facility puts Jupiter many steps closer to its goal of building and operating more than 650MWh of energy storage capacity in ERCOT.
“Our utility-scale energy storage projects provide fast-responding, dispatchable energy that is essential for allowing the grid to better match renewable resources with customer demand,” said Andy Bowman, Chief Executive Officer, Jupiter Power. “Jupiter Power is committed to pioneering strategies that both make the grid more resilient and bring the most affordable energy to customers when and where they need it, not just in the ERCOT market but also across the country.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/04/solar-leasing-risks-rewards-other-topics-on-day-2-of-the-tax-finance-buyers-seminar/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 4, 2022","Solar leasing risks & rewards, & other topics on day 2 of the Tax, Finance, & Buyer’s seminar","Day one of the Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA) Tax, Finance, & Buyer’s seminar started with the BBB and ESG in NYC, while day two delved deeply into taxes and leases with multiple presentation tracks.
The first batch of presenters were commercial real estate managers and owners giving advice on how to interact with them, asset owners, and their tenants leasing space.
One of the more important points made was that many tenants are researching renewable and clean electricity on their own. Sometimes tenants had already procured their own supplies, and some tenants had required building managers and owners to meet certain – higher – standards (like absolute verifiability) so that they were able to meet their own corporate goals.

A second important datapoint came as a surprise: corporations committed to clean energy have shown a willingness to pay grid price (parity) – versus demanding pricing discounts. A few limited cases found corporations that were even willing to pay a premium price for clean energy, in order to meet their own corporate clean energy goals.
Another nuance to these corporate clients, according to Blackstone’s Eric Duchon, is that customers are seeking to “take back the meter” from the utilities. To take back the meter means to gain budget certainty on electricity pricing. Specifically, they are looking for explicitly defined electricity escalators within their power purchase agreements to defend against ongoing price increases, and events like the Texas super storm that “smacked” some customers with large bills.
Several speakers touched on the subject of solar developers’ and financiers’ risk perception as it relates to tenant occupancy rates. When tenants move away or go out of business, compensation for a leased solar structure falls to wholesale rates — or worse, as certain projects are required to entirely shut down electricity exports. Countering these fears is the reality that building managers and owners have a shared interest in filling their buildings with tenants. And as US unemployment rates continue to fall, it seems likely that investors’ positive long-term outlook will outweigh their concerns.

Next up were two lawyers. Brianze Szopinski and Michael Hecker from Hodgsun Russ LLP. To be very honest, these folks spoke quickly and intelligently on a host of topics that were above this author’s expertise — suggesting that if you are in need of legal help in New York State, these are the people to reach out to!
Some of the topics covered included assignment rights, cure periods, sales and tax transfer challenges, and considerations for assignment of membership interests.
Wood Mackenzie Renewable & Power team led a presentation speaking on the challenges of onsite commercial and industrial (C&I) solar power — and the near decade-long stagnation of deployed capacity in this sector. The clearest way to show this was in graph form:

As 2017 wound down with California and New England C&I slowing, the rest of the nation stepped up — but only so much as to keep the vertical steady. The bump projected in 2023 by WoodMac is based on those seeking to deploy before the investment tax credit ends.
A beautiful 20 acre, 3.8 MWdc project was shared by Beam Living. The facility added nearly 10,000 modules across many rent controlled structures that sell their electricity into New York’s Community Solar program. The power plant took a year to install, and involved temporary apartment evacuations for some tenants as solar modules were lifted onto the roof via cranes.
Even though Beam’s owner – Blackstone – has a standard return on investment requirement of 10%, they considered the solar project’s 6% annual ROI to be sufficient, within the context of global solar payback rates. The power plant offsets 6% of the onsite electricity usage, and 2.4% of the housing project’s total emissions.

Aimed at expanding the opportunities for low-income residents to access renewable energy through an increased focus on installing community solar projects in the state, HB 1814 creates a new $100 million incentive program, beginning in 2023, that will provide funding for low-income households and low-income service providers’ installing solar. Like the state’s previous solar incentive programs, Washington State University (WSU) Energy Extension will manage the $100 million in funding, providing grants to community solar projects around the state.
“Everyone needs to be a part of the green energy future,” said Shewmake. “In the past, solar energy incentive programs have primarily benefited people who can dole out cash for the panels and installation. We can do more to include everyone in the transition to a green economy and together, with this bill, we will.”
From 2017 to 2018, Washington State ran a rooftop solar incentive program, through WSU’s Energy Program, which provided $110 million to customers who completed residential and commercial solar energy installations. The program led to the installation of nearly 7,500 residential energy systems, 380 commercial energy systems, and more than 100MW of solar capacity.
The new program is in part the result of a three-year effort by Olympia Community Solar, a small non-profit, to pass policy that recognizes the growing need for equity in the energy economy. The organization’s first community solar installation in Washington was the Hummingbird Project a 117kW rooftop project located at the Hands On Children’s Museum in Olympia, WA. In February 2021, Olympia was granted $341,732 by the Washington State Department of Commerce to install a 126 kW solar system at an affordable housing complex in Olympia. Generation from the solar project will offset residents’ electric bills.
“The benefits of solar energy should be accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or their income,” said Mason Rolph, president of Olympia. “This legislation is a small step in Washington’s progress toward a clean, affordable, and just clean energy transition. Projects resulting from the fund will not only reduce pollution, they will also reduce poverty.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/04/peco-to-support-commercial-ev-charging-with-rebate-program/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,PENNSYLVANIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 4, 2022",PECO to support commercial EV charging with rebate program,"A pilot program is being launched by Pennsylvania utility PECO to support the deployment of Level 2 commercial vehicle charging stations in its territory. The pilot comes as part of a $1.5 million EV charging infrastructure plan administered by the company.
The rebate provides commercial and industrial customers with financial incentives to ease the cost of installing EV chargers. All PECO customers are eligible for the rebate regardless of retail electric supplier. PECO-territory located projects can receive up to $2,000 per charging port or 50% of eligible installation costs, for up to 20 ports.
In Environmental Justice Areas, PECO is increasing the rebate to $3,000 per port or 75% of make-ready costs. These areas are defined by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as any census tract where 20% or more individuals live at or below the federal poverty line, and/or 30% or more of the population identifies as a non-white minority. A map of qualifying areas can be found here.
This infrastructure plan is part of PECO’s overarching clean energy roadmap, called PECO’s Path to Clean. Path to Clean includes goals for PECO and the entire Exelon utility collective to reduce operational emissions by 50% by 2030 and net-zero by 2050.
“Supporting clean electric transportation is critical to reducing our carbon footprint and bringing cleaner air to our communities, and it is an important part of our company’s Path to Clean,” said Liz Murphy, PECO Senior Vice President of Governmental, Regulatory & External Affairs. “We are proud to offer this new rebate program to support the equitable buildout of EV charging infrastructure across southeastern Pennsylvania.”
PECO also offers an online EV toolkit that informs customers of the potential cost savings of owning an electric vehicle.
This February, the utility released a request for proposals (RFP) seeking to purchase 8,000 alternative energy credits from Pennsylvania-based solar generators and aggregators this year. Eligible contracts are for 10 years of credit sales, with a minimum of 200 credits delivered each year. PECO said the average winning bid price for the program is $34.07 per AEC. Applications close on April 5th.
Through the ten-year program, 160,000 renewable energy credits will be purchased by the utility, representing the production of about 2,400 average Pennsylvania solar homes. This will effectively double PECO’s investment in credits, said the company.
At an average bid price of $34.07 per credit, this would represent nearly $5.5 million in solar credit investment over ten years by a company that reports an “annual economic impact” of $4.5 billion in Pennsylvania.
Currently, Pennsylvania sources only about 0.39% of its electricity from solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA reports 855MW installed statewide, enough power for roughly 112,000 homes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/04/accelerate-the-energy-transition-to-protect-national-security/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 4, 2022",Accelerate the energy transition to protect national security,"With Russia’s unconscionable invasion of Ukraine, an energy crisis precipitated by the volatility of global fossil fuel markets has once again brought home that our nation’s continued reliance on fossil fuels leaves us vulnerable to unsavory foreign actors and the gyrations of unpredictable global markets. The undeniable reality is that to secure our economy against geopolitical disruptions, we must transition to a clean-energy future.
Wind turbines and solar panels generate power with zero fuel costs – and no foreign dictator can cut off our access to the sun and wind. Renewable power enhances the security, reliability and resilience of the electric grid and has proven more readily resilient in the face of extreme weather conditions than other electricity sources.
The Biden Administration’s top environmental officials have made clear that rising energy prices are the product of fossil fuel dependence. In fact, at the American Council on Renewable Energy’s Policy Forum last month, EPA Administrator Michael Regan argued that more clean energy deployment could have insulated Americans from price volatility, while White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said the crisis is proof that “we cannot increase our dependence on fossil fuels.”
National security experts agree on the importance of accelerating the transition to renewable power. Deputy Secretary of Defense Dr. Kathleen Hicks recently said that renewable energy was “not just critical to addressing the threat of climate change, but also to our national security as we work to secure US competitiveness in rapidly shifting global energy markets.” Former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus argued that “only by pushing the world economy to renewable sources like wind and solar — which are controlled locally and essentially bulletproof from foreign manipulation — can nations regain their economic sovereignty.” My predecessor as head of the American Council on Renewable Energy, Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, USN (Ret), recently wrote that “U.S. leadership for rapid national and global expansion of clean, sustainable renewable energy will increase our energy security, economic security and environmental security.”
Thankfully, market forces are already driving the transformation of our energy systems. Renewable energy is a critical component of the nation’s power mix today, outcompeting fossil sources of electricity in much of the country. With more than $50 billion in U.S. investment last year, renewable energy is also one of the nation’s most important economic drivers.
But to accelerate the transition to a renewable energy economy, we need congressional leadership, a whole-of-government approach, and a level playing field in the tax code. It is no secret that, unlike China and nearly every other developed economy, we have no energy policy in the US that propels the transition to renewable power outside of incentives in the tax code. While fossil fuel tax incentives like resource depletion allowances and special treatment for “intangible drilling” have been on the books for more than a century, incentives for renewable energy have repeatedly expired since their inception in the 1990s, depriving the renewable energy sector of the policy certainty so important for business planning. Today the tax credit for solar power is phasing down, and the credit for new wind energy projects has, once again, expired. Meanwhile, permanent incentives for fossil fuels are still going strong.
Thankfully, the Biden Administration and Congressional leaders are taking steps to finally provide the renewable energy industry with the stable long-term policy support the fossil sector has long enjoyed. In his State of the Union address, President Biden renewed calls for tax incentives to accelerate renewable energy deployment, noting that the administration’s energy proposals would save American families an average of $500 a year. The President has also launched a whole-of-government approach to facilitate the renewable energy transition, including groundbreaking steps like the Department of Defense’s effort to transition to carbon-free electricity sources, and inter-agency partnerships to streamline siting and permitting for renewable development on public lands and offshore. Congressional leaders and the administration have also prioritized critically important efforts to promote domestic manufacturing that strengthens clean energy supply chains and secures access to critical minerals. Just this week, the President’s FY2023 budget proposal included $200 million for a Solar Manufacturing Accelerator, while the Administration is expected to invoke the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production of critical minerals used in large-capacity batteries to store renewable energy.
And of course, the national security imperative for a rapid transition to homegrown renewable energy includes the dire necessity to protect our climate. A recent IPCC report warned that our climate is changing faster than humanity can adapt, which will cause “dangerous and widespread disruptions” across the planet.
Our adversaries have shown they will not hesitate to weaponize our dependence on fossil fuels. Let’s make sure this is the last time they have that opportunity. Policies that help speed the transition to renewable energy, like the climate provisions in budget reconciliation proposals, are critical to our national security and the effort to address the looming climate threat. It’s time to deliver the renewable energy future that American businesses and consumers are calling for and scientists say we desperately need.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/04/uc-berkeley-digs-400-foot-hole-on-campus-in-geothermal-study/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 4, 2022",UC Berkeley digs 400 foot hole on campus in geothermal study,"Geothermal heat pumps use the thermal properties of subsurface rock to help heat and cool buildings, and when powered by solar, they eliminate the use of fossil fuels. While geothermal is becoming the new clean heating and cooling system for residential use, they can also be used in commercial or community installations. At the University of California Berkeley, a team of engineers has been digging a massive hole eight inches wide and 400 feet deep in order to study the properties of the bedrock to see if it’s a good candidate for a geothermal heat pump system. If so, the clean energy system would help push UC Berkeley closer to energy goal of moving off of all fossil fuels by 2030.
“Nobody has ever drilled this deep beneath the campus,” said Kenichi Soga, the Chancellor’s Professor and Donald H. McLaughlin Chair in Mineral Engineering at UC Berkeley. “Most of the boreholes that we have on campus are used for designing new buildings and typically only go down to 60 or 80 feet. Now, we’re going to 400 feet. It’s going to let us see what is happening at that depth and better understand the possibility of using geothermal heat pumps on campus.”
The campus is currently heated with steam and electricity from its 30-plus year old on-campus natural gas-fired cogeneration plant that serves over 100 buildings and 12 million square feet.

While the cogeneration plant is nearing the end of its life and will need to be replaced, it is also a major emitter of greenhouse gases, responsible for 71% of the 190,00 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent produced by the campus every year. If the school turns to geothermal for all of its heating and cooling needs, Berkeley will be the first University of California campus to achieve on-site zero-carbon energy goals and meet the State’s intent to get large emitters to reduce emissions to levels below Cap-and-Trade thresholds, according to the Berkeley Clean Energy Campus committee.
Geothermal heat pump systems use the thermal properties of the near underground to provide heating and cooling through a network of water pipes that run through shallow boreholes that extend approximately 400 to 500 feet below the surface. The way the systems work is by taking heat that is generated by cooling buildings during the summer and storing it underground, where it can be used to heat buildings during the winter.
By replacing the cogeneration plant with a new geothermal system that uses electricity for power and thermal needs, and providing the electricity from wind and solar, the campus’s future power, heating and cooling needs would be entirely carbon-free.

To determine the feasibility of geothermal for campus-wide use, the research team will be making detailed measurements of the geological conditions hundreds of feet below the campus
“We need to replace this cogeneration plant because its useful life is almost over, and we want to pivot and build something for the future,” said Kira Stoll, chief sustainability and carbon solutions officer at UC Berkeley. “Our goal is to have the campus transition to using 100% clean energy to heat and cool our buildings by 2028. I’m looking forward to finding whether we do have geothermal potential on the campus and whether we can integrate that into our plans to make a very efficient clean energy system.”
Typically, ground source heat pumps are used for residential homes and are not as commonly used for larger installations, such as for a campus community. But for three years, through a project sponsored by the US Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office, researchers from UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab have been investigating how communities can use ground source heat pumps and other geothermal technologies to provide clean energy to communities.
Before the school can commit to geothermal, the team will need to thoroughly explore the geological conditions hundreds of feet below the surface of campus.
“Designing geothermal systems correctly is very important for reducing costs and ensuring their overall effectiveness,” Nico said. “The better you understand what’s happening underground, the better you can design and build your system.”
To make its geological studies, the research team will install a variety of instruments to monitor the conditions underground. These instruments, which were donated by Berkeley Lab or funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, include a geothermal heat loop, which will pump water deep into the borehole and back out again, allowing the team to monitor how the trip underground impacts the water temperature. In addition, fiber optic cables will measure the temperature and vibrations at different strata of the soil, and pressure gauges will measure the groundwater pressure at different depths.
Taka’aki Taira, a research seismologist at the Berkeley Seismology Lab, will also be installing a device called a geophone to measure seismic activity. Data from the geophone, along with the Seismology Lab’s network of seismic sensors, will be used to explore micro-earthquake activity near the campus.
“If you put the sensor deep in the ground, you can minimize the noise caused by cars or humans,” Taira said. “It makes it easier to see small vibrations, such as those caused by the Hayward Fault.”
The data gathered from the borehole will allow the research team to build a “digital twin” of the campus heating system, which is a detailed model of both the heating needs of the buildings above ground and the rock and groundwater conditions below ground.

With this model, the researchers will be able to run simulations to determine the most efficient design for the new system.
When installing geothermal for a residence, only one or two boreholes are needed, as opposed to a large system such as that required on the Berkeley campus. To heat and cool its large buildings they may need hundreds of boreholes. And because drilling boreholes is one of the largest costs associated with geothermal heat storage, it is critical to know how many are needed, how deep they should be, and where they should be located
“Our research is looking at whether these systems are more efficient using a centralized field of ground source heat pumps, where you have a lot of boreholes placed in one location, or whether it better to have boreholes placed in discrete locations across campus,” said Soga.
In addition to contributing to a new clean energy system on campus, the project is also helping to train the next generation of scientists and engineers on how to design and implement these systems in the future. Soga said he hopes the undergraduate and graduate students working on the project start to see how these different technologies, including geothermal heat pumps and renewable energy, can work together to help decarbonize our energy needs.
The primary support for this initial borehole was provided by The Green Initiative Fund, a grant program funded by UC Berkeley student fees and administered by a student-majority committee.

According to SEIA, companies of all sizes that work in any space, from residential to utility-scale projects, can and should complete the survey. This will provide a holistic and qualitative sense of how those working in the solar industry every day expect the anti-circumvention investigation to impact their businesses and workforce.
Alongside the general survey, SEIA is also encouraging developers of larger-scale projects, meaning 1MW and above, to submit project-level data. According to the organization, this data will be valuable to show policymakers detailed and concrete impacts of the anti-circumvention investigation and will require little extra effort from the developer. Since projects under development larger than 1MW are required to submit EIA form 860 annually, with that requirement moving to monthly as they get closer to construction, any delays and cancellations related to the antidumping investigation would already be reported, however EIA doesn’t make the data that it receives public until two or more months after the forms are filed
According to SEIA, the implementation of AD/CV tariffs would result in the loss of 16GW of new solar installations, a figure which represents more than half of what was installed in the US last year. In addition to project delays and cancellations, SEIA estimates that enacted tarifs could put put 70,000 U.S. solar jobs at risk.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/04/irec-aims-to-help-35-states-speed-interconnection-of-distributed-storage/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 4, 2022",IREC aims to help 35 states speed interconnection of distributed storage,"Interconnection rules in most states have not yet been updated to account for distributed storage, with its unique ability to deliver energy when the grid needs it.
The outdated rules lead to review processes that “may be more likely to reject an interconnection request” for distributed storage or solar-plus-storage, or to “require grid upgrades that may not be necessary,” says a press statement for a new toolkit to help states update their interconnection rules.
Updating interconnection rules can make it easier to add storage to distributed solar, the statement said, increasing the distribution grid’s hosting capacity for solar and in some cases doubling the hosting capacity.
The Interstate Renewable Energy Council led development of the toolkit, and the Electric Power Research Institute, most of whose board members are utility executives, served as one of eight project partners. EPRI said in a press statement that the toolkit “provides vetted, consensus-based solutions” to eight regulatory and technical barriers to distributed storage interconnection.
IREC will now work with partners to provide training and outreach to “drive adoption” of the solutions, with a goal of supporting regulators in “at least 35 states,” said IREC Vice President Radina Valova. The trainings will also be open to interested utilities and advocacy groups.
The toolkit recommends word-for-word updates to state interconnection rules, based on the model rule used by many states known as the Small Generator Interconnection Procedures, developed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The toolkit says that states that followed other model rules “should easily be able” to incorporate the changes.
State public utility commissions may need technical guidance in implementing the toolkit’s recommendations, said Valova with IREC. The nonprofit already engages as a public interest stakeholder in state interconnection proceedings, providing technical assistance on topics such the IEEE 1547-2018 smart inverter standard.
 The toolkit was developed through the BATRIES project, funded by the US Department of Energy. Other BATRIES project team members besides IREC and EPRI were the solar trade group SEIA, the California Solar & Storage Association, utilities PacifiCorp and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative, and law firm Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger. The Energy Storage Association was a project partner before it merged with the American Clean Power Association.
Ten states have already updated their interconnection rules to facilitate distributed storage interconnection, says the toolkit: Hawaii, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New York, plus the District of Columbia. An additional four states are in the process of doing so: New Mexico, Illinois, Massachusetts and Maine.
While the toolkit’s recommendations are designed to remove eight types of technical and regulatory barriers to the interconnection of distributed storage, an appendix notes additional barriers that await further solutions development.
A webinar discussing the toolkit is set for April 26. The project website takes requests for toolkit training.

Senator’s anti-solar state legislation fails, now targeting county zoning law Kansas state Senator Mike Thomas has made several attempts at legislation that is considered anti-solar in his state, and at times he has shared false information about the health and economic impacts of renewable energy.
Duke seeks to procure an additional 700MW of solar in 2022 If approved, the new procurement would raise Duke’s total 2022 solicitation to 1,300MW, a figure equivalent to 30% of all the solar the company has installed in North Carolina to date.
