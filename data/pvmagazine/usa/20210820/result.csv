J.B. Pritzker recently signed into law a bill to regulate the power that homeowners associations have over rooftop solar, an HOA and local government are moving forward with legal action against a homeowner.
The city of Bellville in southwest Illinois and an HOA association for the community of The Orchards are suing the Bassler family for installing solar panels on the front of their home, facing the street. The HOA asserted that panels are only allowed on the back of the home. The Basslers told local news outlets that panels on the front are necessary to meet their generation needs.
Prior to the passage of HB 644, HOAs could tell their members where rooftop solar panels would be allowed. Under provisions of a 2011 law, however, HOAs were barred from specifying placement that would “impair the effective operation of a solar energy system.”
The new law expands on the idea of “effective operation,” stating that any placement bylaws enacted by an HOA cannot reduce the annual maximum output of a system by more than 10% of the original design.
(Read “Bill would expand the ITC to include integrated solar roofs.”)
Paul McKnight, owner of the company that installed the panels on the Basslers’ home, told local press that adhering entirely to the community bylaws would lead to a 35% reduction in the system’s capacity .
The issue then became whether or not the HOA bylaw would impact the system’s operation under the old law, or if the case would be considered under the new law, which was enacted after the installation was completed and the lawsuit was filed. The Basslers argued that other homes in the community have been allowed to install panels on the front of their homes.  Their motion to dismiss the case was rejected.
Illinois State Rep Dan Didech, who introduced HB 644, called the HOA action “unreasonable” and said that such resistance is part of the reason why he introduced the legislation in the first place.
Some of the Basslers’ neighbors, also quoted by local press, said that they had no issue with the installation, and that others in the neighborhood had expressed interest in installing their own solar systems.
The two sides will return to court later in August.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/20/solar-on-schools-a-smart-solution/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,ARIZONA,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES,VIRGINIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Solar on schools: A smart solution,"When thinking of how to improve schools, the first thoughts often turn to newer books, better-paid teachers, and an improved curriculum. 
Energy is second only to teacher salaries when it comes to cost, according to NREL, and U.S. schools spend more than $6 billion a year on the line item. Solar presents an opportunity for schools to alleviate budget pressure, often at little or no upfront cost, freeing up funds for more educational benefits.
Schools often sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) when going solar, allowing the school to buy the electricity produced by the solar installation for 10-25 years at a discounted rate, serving up cost savings from day one. About 90% of installed school systems since 2014 have entered the PPA model, and the little-no-upfront cost or ongoing maintenance costs make it a nimble operation for tight-budgeted schools, according to SEIA.
The deployment of solar on schools has grown in recent years, but many schools have not taken that step. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that through 2019, some 7,332 solar schools were equipped across the U.S., representing 5.5% of K-12 institutions.
Average system size for these schools was 182 kW, and over 1.3 GW had been activated. Roughly 9.4% of all students attend a solar school, according to the SEIA report. The “valedictorian” state was California, with one-third of the nation’s solar schools and 45% of the total installed capacity, at 616 MW.
Between 2014 and 2019, SEIA reported a 139% growth in cumulative installed capacity. In that five-year span, schools accounted for roughly 8-10% of cumulative installed capacity of nonresidential projects.
While growth has been strong, one group, Generation180, thinks the U.S. can do better. The group is dedicated to helping boost the attach rate, and provides resources to help guide decision makers at schools navigate the solar process and understand the benefits.
Generation180 runs a national campaign for solar advocacy, and offers a toolkit as a step-by-step grassroots organizing guide. Once the school district has buy-in from the community, decision makers can use Generation180’s how-to guide for going solar.
In the guide, eight steps are laid out for getting started:
Some schools have undergone this process and offer an example for other districts to learn from.

For example, the San Francisco Unified School District (SSFUSD) includes 136 schools and 55,000 students. In 2017, the school district adopted a carbon-neutral resolution that called for phasing out fossil fuels by 2040 and generating all power on-site by 2050. The district installed its first solar projects 10 years ago, and over the past decade has saved more than $20 million on energy bills.
Developed in partnership with ENGIE, SSFUSD has installed over 2 MW of PV capacity, implemented high energy-efficiency technologies, and has reduced its energy expenditures by over 75%. The solar was installed in two main phases, with 1.68 MW added in phase one on fifteen school locations. Phase two added three more sites, totaling 352 MW. The installations were mounted on carports, athletic stadiums, and academic buildings.
Another example is the Discovery Elementary School in Arlington, Virginia. Opened in 2015, it became one of the largest buildings in the country to be certified as zero energy. The building was designed to be 66% more energy efficient than the district average by optimizing solar orientation and shading, in addition to installing smart energy efficiency upgrades on heating and cooling, lighting, and more.

The 496 kW, 1,700 panel system produces more energy than the school uses, and it saves roughly $100,000 a year in energy costs. It sits upon single-axis trackers to maximize output. In planning for construction of the school, it was discovered the building would cost $262 per square foot without solar, and $316 per square foot with it.
While solar made a sizeable impact on the building’s construction costs, it helped the school achieve net zero, and it is expected to produce a net financial benefit in energy bill savings. Plus, with solar falling steadily in cost since the school’s construction in 2015, and more incentives coming online across the country in that time, the cost-effectiveness of solar on schools has only improved.

Energy storage appears to be fully charged for exponential growth. Lithium-based energy storage volumes are expected to grow by multiple orders of magnitude in the coming years, with a 1,000% capacity increase by 2023.
Blackouts and high utility prices are driving solar and storage adoption, SunPower survey says. The survey of 1,500 homeowners shed light on the home solar energy experience and motivating factors behind solar purchases.

The 25.6 MW project, considerably large as far as community solar installations go, is being developed by CEP Renewables on the site of the former Combe Fill North Landfill Superfund site. The EPA’s Superfund program is responsible for cleaning up some of the nation’s most contaminated land and responding to environmental emergencies, oil spills and natural disasters.
Once complete, the project will be among the largest solar installations developed on a capped landfill in the nation, and will provide clean power for over 4,000 homes. Furthermore, assuming the project was awarded under one of the first two rounds of New Jersey’s community solar pilot program, more than half of the customers who receive power from the installation will be low- and middle-income customers.
One of the core missions of the EPA’s Superfund program is to make tangible, long-lasting changes to the communities that surround these heavily contaminated areas, and providing access to clean energy and bill savings for residents who have been subject to the adverse effects of an improperly-closed landfill is certainly a start.
As of now there is no public timetable for project development and construction, nor has it been made available what hardware CEP Renewables plans to use on the installation. The project is expected to help Mount Olive recoup nearly $2.3 million in past taxes.

The result was confirmed by China’s National Center of Supervision and Inspection on Solar Photovoltaic Product Quality (CPVT).
“We are proud to announce the latest achievements developed by our technical team, to realize the batch efficiency over 23.5% for larger-area 210mm high-efficiency PERC cells in production,” said Yifeng Chen, head of the company’s high efficiency cell and module R&D center. “This demonstrated that 210 cells can achieve very high efficiency in reality. Our technical team will continue to focus on transfer innovative technologies to manufacturing to consolidate our technology leadership in high efficiency cells mass production.”
The company improved by 0.5% the efficiency achieved for the panel in early July. That result was certified by  Germany’s standards bodies TÜV Rheinland and TÜV Nord. At the time, Trina said its scientists developed a new Multi-Musbar (MBB) technology to improve optical shading, and developed a new hybrid soldering technology to minimize the gap between cells, without providing further details.
