The Bezos Earth Fund is a Jeff Bezos-led initiative that announced a $10 billion commitment to fund scientists, activists, NGOs, and other actors to drive climate and environmental solutions. GRID’s grant was one of 44 awarded by the Bezos Earth Fund today, with total investment summing $443 million.
According to GRID, the grant will allow the Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund to scale up its impact in reaching indigenous communities. The program will provide training for careers in solar and clean energy and enable exploration of emerging technologies like clean mobility and energy storage.
While GRID has partnered with more than 40 tribes since 2010, the Tribal Accelerator fund was officially launched in 2018, with a $5 million commitment from Wells Fargo.
“There is a long history of extractive energy exploitation in Indigenous communities and the Tribal Accelerator Fund was created to support tribes in developing and owning renewable energy infrastructure that will lead to their respective energy resilience and energy sovereignty goals,” said Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund Director, Tanski Clairmont.
In total, the Bezos Earth Fund granted $38 million to organizations supporting Native communities.
A 2018 National Renewable Energy Laboratory study found that Native American tribes could install 61 gigawatts of utility-scale solar, and sell the resulting electricity wholesale at a profit.

The DART craft, which was carried out of orbit last month by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, intentionally crashes itself into an oncoming asteroid, using kinetic energy to redirect the asteroid’s trajectory. It is designed to be propelled by an electric thruster that is powered by solar arrays.
The craft is designed to propel itself at about 250 miles per hour, guided by an onboard camera and autonomous navigation software, directly into the path of the asteroid. The DART test will make contact with the Didymos system’s moonlet that is headed into orbit in September 2022.
When the DART intercepts the Didymos moonlet, it will only change its speed by a fraction of one percent, but this change will increase the moonlet’s orbital period by several minutes, enough time to study the body with telescopes on Earth.
The solar arrays are designed to roll out when deployed, using the same iROSA arrays that were attached to the International Space Station this June. The state-of-the-art arrays were built to have bolstered radiation defense and improved power-per-mass that’s about 1.7 times more efficient that conventional panels.
The NEXT edition gridded ion thrusters used on DART can produce 6.9 kW thruster power. The thrusters use electricity to accelerate a xenon propellant at speeds of up to 90,000 mph, thereby moving the craft through space. A successful 48,000-hour (5.5 year) test was run on the NEXT propulsion system in 2009, showing little signs of degradation and operation-as-expected.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/06/sec-investigating-tesla-over-alleged-solar-system-fire-negligence/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 6, 2021",SEC investigating Tesla over alleged solar system fire negligence,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened an investigation into Tesla in response to a 2019 whistleblower complaint alleging that the company failed to properly notify its shareholders, customers and the public of fire risks associated with solar panel system defects. According to the Reuters, the defects were a known hazard for several years.
The issue was originally brought to light by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla field quality manager, who filed a whistleblower complaint on the solar systems in 2019. Henkes recently filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the SEC on the status of his complaint, which is when the regulator disclosed the existence of the investigation.
According to Henkes’ complaint, Tesla and SolarCity, which was founded by Elon Musk’s cousins, Peter and Lyndon Rive, and acquired by Tesla in 2016, failed to disclose “liability and exposure to property damage, risk of injury of users, fire etc., to shareholders” of SolarCity solar modules, both prior to and after the acquisition.
In 2019, Walmart filed suit against Tesla over fires that the company alleged originated at PV installations designed, installed, owned and maintained by Tesla/SolarCity at its stores in three states.
Walmart counted seven fires in total, but only four that occurred on systems under contracts with Tesla and not SolarCity before the acquisition. These four started from March through November 2018, and include an array that was supposed to be de-energized but still caught fire in November 2018.
Walmart said that inspections of the systems revealed “widespread, systemic negligence and had failed to abide by prudent industry practices in installing, operating, and maintaining its solar systems,” and that this greatly increased the risk of fires. Company inspections allegedly found a large number of microcracks, hotspots and backsheet damage, which suggested the installation of damaged solar panels.
The lawsuit was settled shortly after filing.
Elon Musk, personally, is also facing an approximately $2.2 billion lawsuit filed by shareholders over Tesla’s purchase of SolarCity, which the suit alleges was an attempt to bailout Musk’s cousins’ struggling company, of which Musk was the largest investor and chairman. The shareholders’ suit also accuses Tesla’s board of having a lax approach to corporate governance.

The two separate bond issuances support the purchase of clean electricity to serve over 2.5 million residents and businesses in the Bay Area and Central Valley of California. Historically, it has been industry standard practice for municipal utilities to use the prepayment structure to reduce costs of natural gas. Now, these bonds apply the structure to the purchase of clean electricity.
A Clean Energy Project Revenue Bond is a prepayment for wholesale electricity in which three parties (a tax-exempt public electricity supplier, a taxable energy supplier, and a municipal bond issuer) enter into long-term power supply agreements for zero-emission clean electricity. The municipal bond issuer, in this case, The California Community Choice Financing Authority (CCCFA), issues tax-exempt bonds to prepay for energy that is to be delivered over a period of thirty years. The energy supplier provides a discount (historically 8 to 12%) to the tax-exempt electricity supplier (the CCA) on the power purchases based on the difference between the taxable and tax-exempt rates.
The two Clean Energy Project Revenue Bonds prepay for the purchase of over 450 MW of clean electricity, or enough to power 163,000 homes. These transactions will reduce renewable power costs by almost $7 million annually for the first 5-10 years.
“CCAs are known for being innovative and nimble in our efforts to provide our community with electricity from cost-effective, clean sources,” said Girish Balachandran, CEO of Silicon Valley Clean Energy. “For SV Clean Energy, we are working to advance innovative decarbonization solutions across sectors, and in this case, we have applied a new approach to how we finance our clean power projects, furthering the financial savings enjoyed by our customers.”
The first of these bonds, which was issued by CCCFA to the benefit of East Bay Community Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy, was underwritten by Morgan Stanley. It generated nearly $1.5 billion in proceeds, after having received an investment grade “A1” rating from Moody’s and a “Green Climate Bond” designation from Kestrel Verifiers, making it the largest ever issuance of prepayment bonds for clean electricity.
“While it took a lot of time and attention to apply the structure to electricity, issuing these green bonds exemplifies the commitment and competitive edge we bring as an industry. By leveraging a decades-old process available for natural gas procurement savings and making it work for clean electricity, we’re picking it up and repurposing it to meet the needs of today,” said Nick Chaset, CEO of East Bay Community Energy and Chair of CCCFA.
The second transaction, issued by CCCFA to the benefit of MCE, was underwritten by Goldman Sachs. The very successful bond sale produced approximately $700 million in bond proceeds and generated significant investor demand. The issue received an investment grade “A2” rating from Moody’s Investors and a “Green Climate Bond” designation from Kestrel Verifiers.
“MCE began exploring prepayment bonds three years ago as a pathway to reduce the cost of our renewable energy portfolio,” said Dawn Weisz, CEO of MCE.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/06/residential-solar-paired-with-heat-pumps-outperforms-propane-in-cold-isolated-climates/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 6, 2021","Residential solar paired with heat pumps outperforms propane in cold, isolated climates","An international research team has sought to quantify the techno-economic characteristics of solar-powered heat pump solutions for residential buildings in isolated areas without natural gas supply in cold climates, and has found that, by resorting to the electrified solution, homeowners may reduce costs by up to 20%.
“The majority of studies in North America compare heat pumps to natural gas, which is logical given [the latter’s] dominance as a heating fuel,” the scientists explained. “Rural customers relying on, more expensive fuel oil or propane, however, represent a better opportunity for heat pumps and no studies were found using these fuels as a baseline comparison.”
Their work considered, in particular, isolated areas in the U.S. Upper Midwest and the northeast of the nation, and archetypal buildings that were modeled under four levels of electrification, for each of which PV sizing analysis was conducted. The four levels are described as follows: A baseline case in which propane serves all heating needs; a case where a heat pump is used for producing hot water; full electrification of the building’s heating system; and a second fully electrified level that also provides cooling in the summer.
The economic performance of the four levels was evaluated through total life cycle cost (TLCC) and a self-consumption pricing model. The analysis also took into account the envelope efficiencies of residential buildings and the Midwestern generation mix available today. “Economic sensitivities are analyzed on capital costs, electricity and propane prices, and discount rates,” the scientists emphasized. “Climatic, construction, occupancy behavior, and economic boundary conditions are taken from Michigan but are considered representative of most buildings in North America’s cold climate zones.”
The technical analysis was carried out by identifying a project’s primary energy renewable fraction (PREF), which considers all energy sources used in the final supply of electricity and heat to the building. The maximum capacity of a PV system must be equal to a household’s electricity load over the year.
Through the analysis, the academics found that heat pumps are already economically competitive with propane in isolated areas in northern climates, regardless of whether a PV system is installed or not. The cost-optimal solution was found to be that of the second level, in which the solar-powered heat pump is used for hot water production, assuming that solar module costs will further drop in the future. “The high capital cost of PV remains a barrier, however past work has shown … the majority can still gain access to capital [and] take advantage of existing support programs and/or third-party business models,” the researchers explained.
According to their calculations, homeowners would face no lifecycle economic costs when heat pumps are a drop-in replacement. “Even with 50% higher capital costs than average market prices, the lower operational costs of heat pumps compensate,” they emphasized, noting that heating electrification solutions such as solar heat pumps may reduce cost by up to 20% and carbon emissions by 30%.
They also warned, however, that their conclusions are strictly dependent on the region’s electricity prices. “Lower retail prices benefit heat pumps but harm PV while higher sell-back prices help support PV even when electricity prices are lower, suggesting that a trade-off can be made with utilities, where lost revenues from distributed PV can be more than compensated by the increased demand from heat pumps,” they highlighted.
The model is described in the study Decarbonizing rural residential buildings in cold climates: A techno-economic analysis of heating electrification, published in Energy and Buildings. The research group includes scientists from the Michigan Technological University, in the United States, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/06/three-vastly-divergent-solar-deployment-projections/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 6, 2021",Three vastly divergent solar deployment projections,"On December 1, the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggested the United States will install 178 GW more renewable energy from 2022 through the end of 2026. Just a few weeks earlier, S&P Global Market Intelligence published a projection that the United States could install 71 GW of wind and solar power in 2022 alone.
On a third path, Rystad Energy believes it is possible that 50% of global utility scale solar capacity might be cancelled or postponed.
According to the IEA’s Renewables 2021 analysis, 2021 will be a record peak deployment year for the US, adding over 39 GW of new wind and solar capacity. Following this record year, however, the IEA predicts a downward trajectory for deployment.
 

 
From 2022 through 2026, the IEA sees 26.6, 28, 29, 25.6 and 26.9 GW of solar power being deployed, respectively. In total, the IEA estimates that 270 GW of solar capacity would be installed by the end of 2026 – nearly three times the 100 GW currently deployed as of January of this year.
IEA also included an “accelerated” deployment projection for the next five years, which would add 53.7 GW of capacity to their estimate. This addition would raise deployment projections from 178 GW to 231 GW of utility and distributed solar, plus on and off shore wind. These numbers may appear optimistic, but the group has gained infamy in the energy community after 20+ years of releasing laughably underestimated solar capacity growth estimates.
On an upward path, S&P sees potential for 44 GW of solar and 27 GW of new wind in 2022. The first year of the S&P’s projected capacity increase is equivalent to nearly 40% of the 5-year IEA growth estimates.
 

In 2023, the S&P anticipates that solar will increase by nearly 33%, while wind capacity deployments will stay flat, or slightly decline. Combined, S&P believes we will see 156 GW of combined wind and solar additions in 2022 and 2023 – that’s 87% of the IEA’s five year projection, in only two years.
Since the release of S&P’s report, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Build Back Better/Reconciliation package. S&P has noted that if the package gets through the Senate with the main solar incentives in place, some of the 2022 solar volume might fall into 2023 or 2024. 
Sitting amongst all of these cheery projections is one analyst suggesting that supply challenges could have a massive, negative impact on 2022 growth.
The group says that polysilicon pricing has increased by more than 300%, and shipping costs for a container have grown by over 500%. These increases have added 6-8¢/kWh to the cost of solar panels, and 2.5¢/watt to shipping.
Roughly, 75% of the United State’s 2022 capacity projections are expected to come from utility scale projects.
Watching over all of this noise, Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Jenny Chase is pushing her own team to increase their solar power projections, noting “there is always at least a bit more solar than you think there is“ – while concurrently calling out the IEA (cowards!) for their shortchanged numbers.

That would have been enough to install an additional 95 GW of solar capacity during the period, in terms of the industry’s pre-supply-chain-shock prices, the Paris-based body has calculated.
As usual, the report presents a glass-half-full, glass-half empty appraisal, with the IEA anticipating the world will have installed a record volume of solar this year, spelling out how it would be possible to unlock an additional 25% of renewables plants on top of the huge volumes expected to 2026 … and then pointing out that would still not keep the world on track for net zero in 2050.
The international organisation believes a record, near-160 GW of solar will have been added worldwide this year, with 17% more added than came online in 2020, and predicted the world will be adding 200 GW per year of photovoltaics in five years’ time. Dealing with the familiar list of solar industry grumbles out to 2026 – sluggish permitting, grid integration issues, social acceptance, inconsistent policy, insufficient financial incentives, and costly developing-world finance – could raise that number to almost 260 GW per annum by the time the 2026 numbers are tallied, estimated the IEA.
The report’s authors spell out the sort of effort required to achieve its ‘accelerated case’ outlook for solar: China must define how its renewable portfolio standard – requiring generators to produce a specified volume of clean power – and the green certificates for renewable energy will function, and must support residential arrays after their feed-in tariff (FIT) is wound down this month. Even without those remedies, the IEA said, China will continue to lead the way with 1.2 TW of solar and wind capacity by 2026. That would be enough, wrote IEA executive director Fatih Birol, to ensure the nation “could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030,” as a government target stipulates.
Elsewhere, to further ramp solar deployment, according to the IEA, the U.S. should extend the investment tax credit for solar; India should get the finances of its power companies in order, extend grids and better incentivise small-scale, ‘distributed-generation‘ arrays; the EU should smooth permitting rules for participation in big solar capacity auctions, and expand the ambition of the procurement rounds, and could also support rooftop systems with its post-Covid recovery and resilience funding; Japan must smooth the transition from FITs to premium payments topping up the wholesale electricity price; and governments in the Middle East and North Africa could hold capacity auctions more often and expand their grids faster.
Even if that perennial wish list remains unfulfilled, the report’s authors stated, the world can be expected to add almost 1.1 TW of solar over the next five years.
In the best of all worlds for solar, however – an ‘accelerated-case’ jamboree of friction-free permitting, bags of cash for rooftop solar, and grids accelerating at a rate of knots – the extra 25% of solar panels that would be installed would still have to double to keep the world on track for net zero in 2050.
And that’s not to mention the IEA’s fear a year of continued high panel prices – driven by more costly polysilicon, steel, copper, aluminium and shipping costs – could wipe out three year’s worth of cost reductions, not to mention the threat of central banks raising interest rates and, thereby, project finance costs, or the plethora of trade measures imposed on solar imports. Those listed in the IEA study ranged from the duty slapped on solar panels by the U.S. in 2022 through to India’s plan to apply a 40% duty on foreign panels and a 25% charge on solar cells, from April.
So the question remains, is our glass half-full or half-empty?
