Under the agreement, Big Y is subscribing to 19 solar projects across Massachusetts, representing a total of 57 MW of capacity.
Community solar subscribers are allocated a portion of a project’s output and receive discounted credits on their utility bills. As an anchor off-taker, Big Y will receive 50% of the energy credits generated by the 19 projects.
Based in Springfield, Mass., Big Y has nearly 80 stores throughout Connecticut and Massachusetts, and more than 12,000 employees.
The chain has installed solar panels at several stores and operations centers. “The opportunity to participate in the Nexamp community solar program fits perfectly with our long-term sustainability goals as an organization,” said Gary Kuchyt, manager of energy and sustainability at Big Y.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/28/top-10-distributed-solar-policy-trends-of-2020/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 28, 2021",Top 10 distributed solar policy trends of 2020,"Forty-six U.S. states and the District of Columbia took some form of action on distributed solar policy and rate design changes during 2020, according to a new report from the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center (NCCETC).
A total of 257 state- and utility-level changes were proposed, pending, or enacted by year’s end. The states taking the greatest number of actions included Virginia, California, New York, Maine, and South Carolina.
In the latest edition of its quarterly “The 50 States of Solar” report, NCCETC highlighted the top 10 distributed solar policy trends of 2020:
1. Utilities proposing additional fees based on system capacity
For distributed generation (DG) rate design, attention has shifted from demand charges to charges based on a customer’s DG system capacity. The New York Public Service Commission approved a net energy metering (NEM) successor tariff including a monthly customer benefit contribution based on DG system capacity. Both Evergy in Kansas and Dominion Energy in South Carolina proposed new fees based on DG system capacity during 2020.
2. States adopting unique NEM successor policies
NCCETC said states continue to operate as laboratories of innovation, adopting a wide array of NEM successor policy designs. In 2020, Arkansas and New York regulators opted to maintain retail-rate NEM for certain customers and approve new monthly fees. The Utah Public Service Commission established net billing credit rates compensating customer-generators at a rate between retail and avoided cost for exported energy. Iowa lawmakers chose to move forward with a value-of-solar approach, with rate changes not occurring until at least 2027.
3. States facing challenges with low-income community solar participation
Although the majority of state community solar policies include special provisions to encourage participation by low- and moderate-income customers, NCCETC found many states are still having trouble achieving this goal. In New Jersey, regulators are considering rule changes to streamline the income verification process, and in Oregon, regulators delayed the requirement for community solar project managers to reach the state’s low-income subscription target.
4. NEM successor tariffs being considered on a utility-by-utility basis
In Kentucky, three utilities filed tariff design proposals in 2020 as part of general rate cases, and in Michigan, regulators approved DG tariffs for Indiana Michigan Power and Consumers Energy. In South Carolina, Duke Energy and Dominion Energy have both filed successor tariff proposals, which are significantly different. Arkansas regulators are allowing utilities to propose NEM alternatives beginning in 2023.
5. States and utilities increasingly considering time-of-use crediting for NEM customers
In Utah, Rocky Mountain Power requested approval for time-varying credit rates for its net billing tariff, although the commission did not approve the proposal. Both Duke Energy and Dominion Energy filed NEM successor tariff proposals that include time-varying crediting in South Carolina.
6. Utilities continue proposing fewer and smaller residential fixed charge increases
In 2020, NCCETC found that 19 utilities proposed residential fixed charge increases. That compared to 31 in 2019, 34 in 2018, 41 in 2017, and 47 in 2016. The proposed increases were also smaller than in past years. The median increase proposed in 2020 was $2.47. That compared to $3.00 in 2019, $3.87 in 2018, $4.00 in 2017, and $4.07 in 2016.
7. Interest growing in minimum bills
NCCETC said utilities and other parties are increasingly interested in minimum bills as a DG rate design element, particularly as an alternative to demand charges, capacity-based charges, and fixed fees. In South Carolina, Duke Energy and solar stakeholders filed an NEM successor tariff proposal including a monthly minimum bill, while Virginia regulators authorized a minimum bill for shared solar customers. In Kansas, Evergy proposed a minimum bill as an alternative to a DG capacity-based charge.
8. States considering expansion of existing community solar programs
In 2020, South Carolina regulators reviewed existing community solar programs and directed utilities to make filings for new programs. In Virginia, lawmakers enacted bills establishing a shared solar program and a multi-family shared solar program, building on the state’s utility-led community solar program. New Jersey legislators also considered a bill making the state’s pilot community solar program a permanent program, with the Senate passing the bill during the year.
9. Strong movement away from mandatory residential demand charges
NCCETC said no investor-owned utility proposed a mandatory residential demand charge in 2019 or 2020, indicating a shift away from demand charges as a rate design feature for residential DG customers. The Kansas Supreme Court also ruled in April 2020 that Evergy’s mandatory DG customer demand charge was in conflict with state law. Evergy was the only investor-owned utility with a mandatory DG customer demand charge in effect, according to NCCETC.
10. States establishing timelines for NEM successor transitions
Many states are setting specific dates or aggregate capacity thresholds for the consideration or implementation of NEM successor tariffs. Virginia lawmakers enacted a bill increasing the NEM aggregate cap and directing regulators to develop a NEM successor when a certain installed capacity threshold is reached. In Arkansas, regulators authorized utilities and other stakeholders to file NEM alternatives beginning in 2023, and Iowa legislators enacted a bill directing regulators to develop a value-of-solar methodology for future tariffs in 2027.
“As states consider changes to the mechanisms by which customer-generators are credited for their exports, the stage is set for further evolution in the future,” said Brian Lips, senior policy project manager at NCCETC. “In 2020, policymakers in a number of states opted to retain their current net metering policies while opening the door to new rules in the future.”
NEM reforms led distributed solar policy activity in 2020. Autumn Proudlove, lead author of the report and senior manager of policy research, said NCCETC expects to see this trend continue in 2021.

Built by sPower, which merged with AES’ clean energy business early this year, Spider Solar is a 20 MW installation in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. The 47,000-panel array began operating at the end of 2020. The university it will offset up to 60% of the institution’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Energy generated by Spider is acquired by the university through a power purchase agreement (PPA) with sPower.
Spider Solar is also one of the integral pieces in sPower’s larger 500 MW project in Spotsylvania County. In total, the project contains four interconnected phases:  Spider Solar (20 MW), Pleinmont Solar 1 (75 MW), Pleinmont Solar 2 (240 MW), and Highlander Solar Energy Station 1 (165 MW).
Spider Solar is the university’s second PPA. In 2016, the university built the first solar array in the Commonwealth under Virginia’s PPA pilot program, installing 749 solar panels on the roof of the Weinstein Center for Recreation and Wellness.

“There were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building… But now we [have] a little more bandwidth. We’re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly. So, I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar,” Musk said.
For Tesla, industry-leading pricing is central to its solar strategy. “[Getting the cost structure where it needs to be] is something that we’ve accomplished over the last year,” the company’s CFO, Zach Kirkhorn said, without providing specifics.

Achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall, the Tesla Retrofit Solar, and the Tesla Roof is also an integral part of Telsa’s solar plans, Musk said. He said the company is focused on reducing the amount of time and the “complexity of the install, and we’re making great progress in that regard.”
Improvements to Tesla’s solar retrofit strategy, including simplification, cost reduction, and improved pricing, drove an 18% increase that lifted solar deployments to 205 MW in 2020. Even though Tesla missed analysts’ Q4 earnings estimates, the company reported that total year-over-year quarterly revenue rose 46% to $10.74 billion, largely driven by growth in vehicle deliveries.
During Q4, Tesla said that storage deployments and solar deployments came in at 1.584 MWh and 86 MW, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, storage deployment ballooned by 199%. Solar deployment increased by 59% compared with 2019.
On the storage side, 2020 was the first year in which total battery deployments surpassed 3 GWh in a single year, Tesla said. That was  an 83% increase against 2019. The company attributed much of this growth to the popularity of its utility-scale storage product, Megapack.
“We are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward, in what we continue to believe is the best renewable development environment we have ever seen.” That was Jim Robo, NextEra’s CEO  during his company’s Q4 earnings call on January 26.

According to Robo, NextEra is positioning its business to be the preferred strategic partner for commercial and industrial customers (C&I). For NextEra, C&I companies’ interest in improving their ESG performance opens new markets and business opportunities. The economics of renewable are also aligned with the C&I interest in sourcing clean energy, he said.
“We are looking at the business in a holistic way – where we can provide clean energy solutions across the board – it’s wind, it’s solar, it’s storage, it’s hydrogen, it’s mobility… It’s an energy management services capability. It’s analytics. All of the things that we’ve done for decades, we could now offer to C&I customers, and we’ve got a huge head start,” Robo said.
NextEra is in advanced discussions with a number of potential industrial customers from the food processing, specialty chemicals, and refineries sectors about developing clean energy solutions that can yield more efficient green production processes.
The company said that one potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. This project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock. When not producing hydrogen, the project’s solar power would offset a portion of the plant’s energy consumption, further decarbonizing operations.
“Having the largest solar fleet in North America positions us for storage add-on,” Robo said. Standalone storage is imperative for renewables growth, and, according to Robo, energy storage attach rates are at about 60% on all new renewable projects that NextEra delivers.
During the earnings call, NextEra said that it plans to continue to push its transmission business, which made a record $100 million in net income last year.

According to Robo, the biggest inhibitor to renewable energy in the U.S. is not consumer demand or a lack of federal or state-level interest in getting renewables built, but the “fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country.” With the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a “new opportunity to fix that,” he said. Robo asserted the belief that NextEra’s transmission business is a prime example of what FERC Order 1000 can do “when you get competition going in the transmission world.”
For the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Inc. reported a $5 million net loss, on a GAAP basis. It said the loss was largely driven by a $1-1.2 billion write down linked to the company’s investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline. The loss was small against NextEra Energy’s full year $2.9 billion income.
Citing progress in 2020 and its originations success, NextEra raised its 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10.5 GW to 12.7 GW, roughly 3.5 GW above its previous expectations. NextEra added that its expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to expectations laid out in 2019. The company also set its 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectation at 12.15 GW to 17.3 GW.
“This is by far the largest expected two-year development program in our history,” said Rebecca Kujawa, the company’s CFO.
“Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed,” Robo said, “if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/28/granholm-focuses-on-jobs-and-clean-tech-in-doe-confirmation-hearing/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 28, 2021",Granholm focuses on jobs and clean tech in DOE confirmation hearing,"Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm sat before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on January 27 and made her case to lead the Department of Energy.
She was introduced by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who praised the former governor, saying she “demonstrated in Michigan the vision and leadership we need to tackle the challenges we now face at the national level, including climate change, while ensuring no worker is left behind and our energy security remains uncompromised.”
Granholm’s opening remarks included stories of her family’s emigration in poverty from Canada when she was a child, and her grandfather’s suicide when he was left unemployed and “hopeless.” She offered those as examples of what she said was her commitment to transferring to a clean energy economy without sacrificing jobs, a key theme of her testimony.
If confirmed by the Senate, she would be the second woman to lead the Energy Department, which employs more than 14,000 people and has an annual budget in excess of $30 billion. DOE was formed in 1977 and is the chief federal agency that oversees the nation’s nuclear stockpile as well as energy. Hazel R. O’Leary was the first female DOE secretary, and served from 1993 to 1997.
In her opening remarks, Granholm outlined three objectives that she said she will work on immediately, if confirmed:
Granholm emphasized boosting domestic battery manufacturing, saying “One-third of all North American battery production is in Michigan. We can buy electric car batteries from Asia, or we can make them in America.”

She used this point to push the need for investment in cleantech innovation through DOE loan programs. She acknowledged that although a small percentage of the supported companies could fail or have problems, she said that “States are bringing a knife to a gunfight” when it comes to competing against China on jobs and technology innovation.
In response to a question from Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Granholm said the goal is to create 10 million jobs transforming energy systems. When he asked if she would acknowledge “there will be irreparable underlying damage” to communities if aggressive action isn’t taken to combat climate change, she replied, “I do.” 
Granholm said she is “enthusiastically supportive” of securing critical mineral supply chain, when pressed on the issue by Sen. Lisa Murkowksi (R-AK). Using the moniker of “responsible mining,” Granholm highlighted examples of China’s lithium-ion and the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s cobalt production, and their record of human rights violations, forced labor, and child labor, as a way to highlight the need of mining in a responsible way. She said that domestic mining ventures can be an effective source of jobs.
Disagreements with the Senate panel arose over President Biden’s signing of an Executive Order to pause and review oil and gas leasing on federal lands. Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) expressed concern about the effect this order may have on jobs and on the future of fossil fuels as a viable energy resource.
In response, Granholm said, that the roughly 10,000 licenses that currently are in force would not be disrupted. “They can continue to permit and deploy.” She said the leasing pause is temporary and would give the administration “time to be able to work on creating jobs and diversifying.”
She said that while she wants to make strides towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, she she would work to achieve that goal “without necessarily leaving fossils in the dust.”
Granholm repeated her support for research and investment into carbon capture technologies. And she repeated her belief that oil, coal, and natural gas have a place in the country’s energy future, as do the people who work in those industries.

The BESS, a stand-alone energy storage facility for local capacity, will provide up to 400 MWh of energy to Southern California Edison customers.
The facility includes Advancion 5 batteries provided by Fluence, an AES and Siemens joint venture.
AES recently announced the merger of sPower, a leading solar energy provider, into its AES Clean Energy business. That business line now manages projects that are operational, under construction, and under development, including the operation of around 2.5 GW of renewable projects with nearly half located in California and a contracted 2.6 GW pipeline nationwide with almost 20% of them in California.
The AES Alamitos BESS is contracted under a 20-year power purchase agreement with SCE and is located at the AES Alamitos Energy Center.
A little more than a month after electric truck maker Nikola and Republic Service fell out of love over a plan to electrify trash trucks, Romeo Power has wooed Republic into a new, initially less ambitious relationship.
The pair entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement to develop Romeo Power’s battery technology for use in Republic’s electric garbage trucks.
As part of the Agreement, senior leaders from each company will sit on a steering committee that will monitor and guide the alliance. The companies will work to determine the key performance metrics of Romeo Power’s battery packs that will suit Republic’s specific needs.
Nikola Corp.
As part of the Agreement, the two agreed to a retrofit test program. Diesel engines and related components will be removed from two of Republic’s vehicles and replaced with electric motors and Romeo Power battery packs, with a goal of delivering the retrofitted trucks by the end of 2021.
Tim Stuart, Chief Operating Officer of Republic Services, also joined the Board of Directors of Romeo Power.
Romeo Power has a 7 GWh-capable manufacturing facility in Los Angeles. Its core product is focused on the medium-duty short haul and heavy-duty long haul trucking markets.
In December, Nikola Corp. and Republic scrapped their collaboration on refuse truck development. The pair had been working to design and build a refuse truck based on a zero-emissions battery-electric drive platform and body. Republic planned to buy 2,500 electric trucks from Nikola with the potential for up to 5,000 orders. Initial testing was to have begun in Arizona and California, with wider-scale testing in 2022 and full deployment by 2023.
Energy consultancy Lux Research published a top 20 list of startups in 2020. Companies were evaluated based on their technology, business strategy, leadership, and market positioning. Startups were categorized into four trend areas: evolving energy networks, industry decarbonization, optimal use of resources, and future energy for mobility.
The startups include Ampaire, Amply Power, CarbonCure Technologies, Cheesecake Energy, Cuculus, EnergySource Minerals, Framergy, Greenbird Integration Technology, Ionic Materials, Lithium Americas, Lithium Werks, MagniX, Onzo, Peak Power, Piclo, PolyPlus Battery, SolidEnergy Systems, Svante, UniEnergy Technologies, and Virta.
ReneSola closed its previously announced registered direct offering of 10 million American Depositary Shares, each representing 10 ordinary shares, at a purchase price of $25.00 per ADS. H.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. Roth Capital Partners and Raymond James acted as financial advisors in the offering. The company said it will use the net proceeds to expand its solar project pipeline (including combined solar/storage initiatives), fund possible strategic acquisitions, and meet general working capital needs.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a settlement that will enable utility PSE&G to develop electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the state.
The utility said that it will invest $166 million over six years to help build out the state’s EV charging infrastructure. The investments are designed to increase the availability of vehicle charging and ease range anxiety, the fear that an electric vehicle will run out of power before reaching a place to plug in.
NREL
The program includes supporting the infrastructure for residential charging equipment, EV chargers at multifamily buildings, government facilities and at public parking lots, as well as fast charging infrastructure along high-traffic corridors such as the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. The program also includes provisions for discounted charging during off-peak hours.
The utility will not own EV chargers, but instead will support the infrastructure needed to place chargers throughout its service territory.
The regulatory action follows its approval in September of the utility’s $1 billion investment in energy efficiency, and its decision earlier in January to allow PSE&G to invest approximately $700 million to provide its 2.3 million electric customers with smart meters.
