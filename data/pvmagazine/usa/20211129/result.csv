PVKONCEAL is module skirt which conceals the front face of the solar PV array, protecting mechanical and electrical components underneath, as well as creating an aesthetically sleek finish.
The skirt is made of corrosion-resistant aluminum with a prefinished black polyvinylidene fluoride finish, which is the same style of paint finish used to coat the metal roofs PVKONCEAL is intended for. S-5! said the hardware is rated to last the life of the solar array and the metal roof.
The solution can be used in two orientations and can cover module frames from 30-46 mm thick.
PVKONCEAL is intended for use with S-5!’s PVKIT product line, a mounting line developed for standing seam metal roofing. PVKIT 2.0 utilizes clamps designed to grab and attach onto metal roofs, both at the edge and across the surface. The kit’s pre-assembled components enable installers to attach PV modules to the metal roof’s structural seams or ribs vs. a traditional rail mounting system.
While not physically penetrating the roof, PVKIT is designed for resilience in high-wind applications. Project developers of two rooftop case studies featured in pv magazine USA said they both chose the system for its resistance to wind.
One of the case-study installations also features an S-5! snow-guard system, as metal roofs are typically installed in the northern U.S. for their ability to shed snow.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/29/renewables-deserve-better-approaches-to-resource-adequacy-acore/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",Renewables deserve better approaches to resource adequacy: ACORE,"Although the major revenue sources for renewable and storage projects will be the sale of energy and environmental attributes, their capacity value remains “an important source of value,” said Rob Gramlich of Grid Strategies, in a webinar presenting a report from the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
The report’s top recommendation on resource adequacy is for regional authorities to set non-discriminatory capacity values for clean energy and other resources. This recommendation “came out strongly” in interviews conducted by Grid Strategies, said Gramlich, “and reflected frustration from clean energy interests who are active in the RTOs,” or regional transmission organizations that set capacity values in some regions. In other regions, capacity value is set by an ISO (independent system operator).
One move toward non-discriminatory capacity values would be to assign solar and storage a higher capacity value when both are present on a regional grid, as each increases the capacity value of the other, the report said.
Another would be to recognize that “a solar farm without solar, or a wind farm without wind, is the same as a turbine without gas supply,” said webinar panelist Michelle Gardner with NextEra Energy Resources. If a resource isn’t able to give assurances that it can always be there based on fuel supply, it should have a correspondingly lower capacity value, she said.
Expanding on the report’s recommendation to develop new metrics for reliability, panelist John Brodbeck with EDP Renewables said “we want market solutions, we don’t want state intervention.” The energy market “is a natural market as opposed to a contrived market, that gives us better information, and allows us to better value the generation assets” that EDP Renewables builds and manages.
The more information we can get from the market, he said, “the better we can value that, the more likely we are to make the appropriate investments, and convince our investors to give us money to build.”
Resource adequacy measures aim to ensure that electricity supply meets demand at all times.  The entire U.S., except for the ERCOT region in Texas, has some form of physical resource adequacy requirement.
The report “demonstrates the need to re-evaluate current approaches” to resource adequacy, said ACORE President and CEO Gregory Wetstone, and makes nine recommendations to do so.
The report, Ensuring Low-Cost Reliability: Resource Adequacy Recommendations for a Clean Energy Grid, was prepared by Grid Strategies LLC for ACORE, and produced in collaboration with the American Clean Power Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association. It includes legal and technical appendices.

The deal provides the two companies opportunities in collaboration across their project pipelines, and accelerates expansion of iSun’s commercial, industrial and utility businesses into new geographic markets, while advancing the company’s involvement with clean energy solutions including solar + storage, brownfield redevelopment and dual land-use/agrivoltaic initiatives. iSun said the investment was made to support organic regional growth through expanding relationships with existing industrial and utility customers.
One innovation that has gained Encore Renewables attention is its work with London-based Highview Power to develop the United States’ first long-duration, liquid-air energy storage system in northern Vermont.
Set to be sized at around 50 MW, with more than eight hours of storage delivering an excess of 400 MWh, the project uses off-peak or excess electricity to chill and liquefy air at -320°F, storing the liquid air in insulated low-pressure tanks. When it’s time for use, the system exposes the liquid air to ambient temperatures to rapidly return it to gas, expanding to 700 times its liquid volume, thereby powering turbines to generate electricity. According to Highview, the system can be configured to also make use of waste heat.
In September, iSun acquired SunCommon in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The deal is expected to double the company’s projected revenue for 2021.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/29/your-next-package-delivery-could-be-solar-powered/,"EV,RESEARCH,NORTH AMERICA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",Your next package delivery could be solar powered,"MiaSolé, Solar Cloths, and Renault have teamed up to release a “shatterproof” 300 watt solar panel to be attached to the wind deflector of Renault trucks. The solar panel’s purpose is to help the vehicle run electric items while the truck is turned off. The panel can reduce or eliminate fossil-burning engine idling, thus reducing emissions.
The solar panel is made of MiaSolé’s thin film solar cells, and is combined into a custom solar panel by Solar Cloth. Although the product is not intended to directly increase the truck’s range, MiaSolé’s kits can replace diesel auxiliary power units, which typically burn diesel. Indirectly, then, this increases range by eliminating fossil fuel consumption used to power onboard electrical equipment when parked.
MiaSolé uses a solar cell with at least 18.64% efficiency, which produces a nearly 17% efficiency from the assembled solar panels. The company’s Solar Ride Kit datasheet from 2018 offers five different kits composed of one or two of its solar panels and a charge controller.
The data sheet lists the charge kit’s maximum power at 530 watts; however, the 60 Amp charge controller suggests up to 3.2 kW of maximum solar output. In addition to the shatterproof kit, MiaSolé’s website boasts a product line which can cover part, or even all, of a truck trailer.
These larger kits are more customizable, but they are still based on the charge controllers, and of course MiaSolé’s solar panels.
There is still much to debate over the solar energy generation benefits of moving a vehicle versus powering only its electrical equipment. However, the market has been getting creative, and evolving quickly.

Of course, extreme versions of solar powered vehicles exist — like the solar car races across Australia, and the Solar Team Eindhoven’s SolarCoach that recently traveled across Europe.
Fortunately, more accessible options have been appearing as well.
Sono has launched an IPO to raise money to develop and build its small, solar-powered city car. Tesla’s Cybertruck is expected to come with an option for solar panel option to cover its cargo bed, with the company suggesting that it would add 15 miles of range per day.
China’s SPI Energy also has announced its EdisonFuture EF1-T, a CyberTruck-esque vehicle which comes with a rooftop and cargo bed-covering solar panel kit.
Developments have not been confined to land-based transportation. Some boat manufacturers have equipped yachts with solar as a primary power source, as well as yachts with amenities complemented by solar power.

And while some may choose to scoff at the apparently low numbers of miles-per-day that vehicle-mounted solar panels provide, real world data suggests that we should give the prospect some serious consideration.
For one thing,  the average driving distance in the U.S. is somewhere between 20 to 40 miles per day. If a solar roof can add 10 miles or more, roof panels would provide 25 to 50% of miles driven purely on free sunlight, without even plugging in.
For another, it’s worth noting that Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems is advancing vehicle integrated solar panels.
In fact, Fraunhofer has put together a full team to help develop this research line. Work is focused both on large delivery vehicles, like the truck above, as well as technologies that integrate solar into car roofs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/29/discovery-boosts-perovskite-solar-cell-efficiency-by-up-to-18/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",Discovery boosts perovskite solar cell efficiency by up to 18%,"Research engineers at Rice University achieved what they said was an efficiency benchmark for 2D perovskite cells, which are atomically thin photovoltaic cells. The researchers found that sunlight contracts the space between the cell’s atomic layers, increasing observed efficiency by up to 18%.
The Texas researchers said breakthroughs in perovskite efficiencies often happen at fractions of a percent at a time. In 10 years, perovskites have improved from about 3% efficiency to greater than 25%, they said.
“We’re on a path to get greater than 20% efficiency by engineering cations and interfaces,” said report co-author Siraj Sidhik. Sidhik said 2D/3D tandems could approach efficiencies near 30%, something he said would make a compelling case for commercialization.
(Read “U.S. decarbonization goals hinge on scaling up heterojunction cell tech.”)
Perovskites consist of cube-like crystal lattices that are highly efficient at gathering sunlight. The contraction effect the researchers observed shrinks the top-to-bottom thickness of the perovskite cell by 1%. They said this lessening of space between atoms increases conductivity threefold and boosts efficiency.
The team found that layering organic cations between the iodide on the top and the lead on the bottom enhanced the interaction between layers, resulting in efficiency boosts of up to 18%.
One drawback, however, is that perovskites degrade at a rate faster than conventional silicon photovoltaics. A solar panel is expected to last 20 to 25 years or more, so resiliency is a key to future perovskite development. The Rice team said it sees potential applications of 2D perovskites as a layer on top of a more-stable silicon panel, or possibility for 2D/3D perovskite tandems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/29/next-generation-solar-technologies-will-drive-a-lower-lcoe/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,GUEST POST,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",Next-generation solar technologies will drive a lower LCOE,"We all know that our power grid is outdated, making it highly susceptible to environmental elements that could lead to interruptions or even destruction. Our power supply is also largely antiquated, relying mainly on power production that is dirty and expensive, such as fossil fuels and other non-renewables.
Solar energy is a big part of the solution to this problem, but harnessing solar energy on a large and reliable scale is not easy, especially since not everywhere in the U.S. is optimally suited for solar power production. However, as we move toward a carbon-neutral future, coal power and fossil fuels do not fit into this equation.
We believe that the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of utility-scale solar power could be significantly cheaper than non-renewables at a cost as low as $16.89/MWh over the lifecycle of a solar power production site. Rapid advances in intelligent software and data, utilization of large-format photovoltaic modules, and two-in-portrait (2P) solar tracker designs may be the keys to unlocking maximum cost savings.
The past decade has shown the energy industry a glimpse of what solar power technology can achieve. We have seen transformative price declines, allowing solar to become a viable energy source for widespread power production. While the global COVID-19 pandemic seems to disrupt all aspects of life, renewable power generation has not seen a downward trend in 2020.
Instead, costs continue to drop, along with the LCOE, bringing into the same overall range as new capacity fired by fossil fuels, such as coal. The cost reductions we are looking at are significant – between 2010 and 2020, utility-scale PV fell 85%.
LCOE is the metric used by the energy industry to determine how long it will take to pay back the system design and installation and begin turning a profit, similar to the concept of payback in residential and commercial energy systems. The metric determines energy production needs and whether it’s viable to build and integrate into the grid, along with how much money needs to be made per unit of electricity to see a return on investment (ROI).
LCOE is made up of a numerator and denominator to determine the equation. The numerator has two specific contributors: capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX). CAPEX is the budget spent on purchase of the equipment and the labor spent to build the power plant.
OPEX is the day-to-day costs incurred to maintain the business operations and the power plant. The numerator which is the sum of CAPEX and OPEX makes up the life cycle cost of the power plant.
Solar panels would perform best when they are perfectly aligned for optimal sun exposure in an ideal world on perfectly flat terrains. There is no way to get this type of land parcel easily; sites vary topographically and this needs to be factored into the yield algorithm at the site. Using innovations like these that account for environmental and site specific variations, we can produce more solar energy from the investment made into the plant.
To figure out the LCOE, we need to determine how much power a given system will produce for 25-30 years. This will determine the ROI (return on investment) of the plant and whether or not to move forward with the capital investments.

To improve the overall LCOE, the CAPEX and OPEX must be reduced, while the yield needs to be increased.
The most straightforward way to reduce CAPEX is to use higher wattage modules as it drives the labor costs down, and uses less steel for racking systems, less labor for installation, less copper for energy harvesting, and less land for achieving energy targets.
To drive down OPEX, we need autonomous systems that can monitor, control, and operate energy generation for the life of the project. This would require innovation in the algorithms to respond to excursions seen at the site due to changing weather conditions, to malfunctions in the system due to aging, and any other unplanned events like fire or earthquakes. To achieve this, there has to be smart integration of sensors, drones and robots which collectively will enable high uptimes for the power plant. Underlying all of this is the data collected from the sensors that is vital to perform analytics, draw inferences, and drive course corrections.
The best way to optimize energy yields from the silicon investment is by implementing solar tracking technology, which can increase production by up to 20% simply by tracking the sun. And like most evolving technologies today, there are always concerns that need to be addressed, including how to select the best tracker design for the site.
There are pros and cons for each of these tracker types: 1P and 2P. 1P tracker has a lower height profile which is meaningful when there are height restrictions at a site. But 1P trackers are longer in length (90 meters), which can lead to layout constraints if the land is irregular in shape.
There are challenges with 2P trackers, especially when it comes to wind stability as they have larger plane-of-array area.

There are challenges with 2P trackers, especially when it comes to wind stability as they have larger POA (plane-of-array) area and hence have to withstand higher wind loads. But the current state of the art of 2P trackers have successfully addressed these issues through the use of multiple mitigating strategies, including, damping technologies, locking technologies, and stowing at non-zero angles. Whichever strategy is used, these have to be validated through wind-tunnel studies and field-experiences.
To see solar power reach its full potential, LCOE must be optimized to prevent a slow-down of adoption. We need to use all of the tools at our disposal to drive down the CAPEX and OPEX.
Through the application of 2P technology and our innovative trackers, FTC Solar demonstrates that we can reduce installation costs (CAPEX) and optimize solar production (OPEX) by using machine learning to maximize tracker efficiency.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/29/u-s-decarbonization-goals-hinge-on-scaling-up-heterojunction-cell-tech/,"GUEST POST,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",U.S. decarbonization goals hinge on scaling up heterojunction cell tech,"In September, the United States Department of Energy released the Solar Futures Study which outlines how solar energy could produce 45% of the nation’s electricity by 2050.
In order to reach this target, the U.S. would need to deploy 1,570 GW of solar by that date. The target also hinges on the existence of a concerted policy effort, aggressive cost-reductions, extensive deployment of other clean technologies, and expansions of the transmission system, as well as large-scale electrification of end uses.
Research and development is vital to maintaining or, ideally, accelerating solar photovoltaic technology cost-reduction trajectories for continued industry growth. There is a particular opportunity for the U.S. to establish itself as a global leader and achieve national decarbonization goals by supporting domestic manufacturing of next generation solar cell technologies.
For several years, crystalline silicon solar cells have dominated the market and have become the industry standard against which all alternatives are compared. In 2019, about 83% of the total PV market in the United States was crystalline silicon-based products. Under the umbrella of crystalline silicon cells, monocrystalline p-type passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) undisputedly dominate the market.
PERC cells are expected to reach an efficiency plateau at around 24% in mass production. With mass production efficiency approaching 23%, PERC seems to be approaching its limits of possible efficiency and performance enhancements. PERC will continue to play a major role in PV deployment in the coming years as manufacturers attempt to close the gap between actual and maximum efficiency. But the race to overtake PERC is already well underway.
The successor to PERC is yet to be determined but it’s safe to say that it will be based on one of the high efficiency n-type-based cells that help overcome the limitations of p-type-based cells. Reports indicate that the market share for n-type cells could grow to 28% in 2028 from barely 5% in 2021.
Image: Heliene
One such limitation of the p-type cell is bifaciality, or the ratio of rear efficiency in relation to the front efficiency subject to the same irradiance. The introduction of bifacial technology has enabled higher energy generation from solar systems. The ease with which monofacial PERC cells can be converted to bifacial has contributed to the PERC’s dominance in the market.
But PERC’s bifaciality is limited to roughly 75%, while n-type cells can achieve more than 90% bifaciality depending on the cell structure.
Another limitation of the p-type cell is its high temperature coefficient, which reduces the performance of the modules when operating at higher temperatures. PERC cells have temperature coefficients of power in the range of 0.35%/oC to 0.40%/oC. N-type wafer-based cells inherently have lower temperature coefficients.
There are two main n-type cell technologies: Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contacts (TOPCon) and Heterojunction (HJT). Both technologies have the potential to exceed 25% efficiency in mass manufacturing, with HJT having the potential to go even further.
TOPCon cell manufacturing involves depositing a nanometer scale layer of silicon oxide, followed by a thicker polycrystalline silicon layer, between the silicon wafer and metal contacts. Because the cell architectures are so similar, TOPCon cells can be made by upgrading existing PERC mass production lines with relatively small equipment expense. This gives TOPCon an edge in terms of ease of manufacturing expansion over other n-type cell technologies.
HJT cell manufacturing consists of significantly fewer steps than PERC or TOPCon.

HJT cell manufacturing involves deposition of an amorphous layer of silicon on both the top and bottom of the wafer followed by transparent conducting oxide deposition and making of metal contacts. HJT cell manufacturing consists of significantly fewer steps than PERC or TOPCon.
However, HJT cell production lines are currently more expensive than TOPCon and have to be newly built. HJT cells also use more expensive metallization paste. HJT cells are by nature bifacial, with bifaciality rates above 90 percent, the highest of any cell technology. Temperature coefficient of power of HJT cells is in the range of 0.25%/oC to 0.30%/oC. Higher bifaciality and lower temperature coefficients result in higher energy output compared to TOPCon cells. HJT cells in mass production are expected to reach about 27%.
One of the most interesting developments in the solar industry is the research and development of tandem cells using HJT as the bottom cell. Laboratory efficiencies of 29% have been obtained using these cells, making HJT cells even more advantageous than TOPCon cells.
HJT technology has started to be more regularly adopted by residential and light commercial installers.

As things stand, HJT cells are more expensive to produce than TOPCon cells. This explains the embrace of TOPCon technology by utility-scale solar developers, who are more sensitive to price increases. HJT technology has started to be more regularly adopted by residential and light commercial installers because they address property owners’ demands for enhanced aesthetics, higher durability and increased output.
While HJT modules may currently have a higher initial price tag, property owners are willing to pay for the superior performance and longer lifespan.
Remember the Solar Futures Study’s 2050 goal of 1,570 GW solar deployment? We are roughly at 110 GW in cumulative deployment, which is less than 1% of the needed deployment over the next three decades. The U.S. gave up solar innovation and manufacturing leadership more than a decade ago; the tariffs on foreign imports over this period did nothing to bring it back. The good news is, HJT cell (and module) development presents a tremendous opportunity for the U.S. to regain solar leadership.
HJT technology fills an existing innovation gap in the residential and commercial rooftop PV market, which today entirely consists of standard crystalline silicon modules. With additional policy support, HJT modules can provide the required cost reductions to drive continued growth beyond rooftops and into the utility scale segment.
For these reasons, the U.S. would benefit from scaling domestic manufacturing of HJT solar cells and modules. In doing so, the U.S. can reclaim leadership in solar cell technology and achieve ambitious decarbonization goals.
Policies like the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which was recently signed into law under the infrastructure bill, will help reduce the capital intensity of new manufacturing facilities to cost-effectively scale next generation PV cell technologies, boosting U.S. cleantech competitiveness.

Researchers at South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) have demonstrated a highly transparent, colorful solar cell based on silicon that they claim shows unprecedented flexibility combined with remarkable power conversion efficiency.
Conceived for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), the solar cell was designed to be built with a 100μm-thick n-Si wafer and by punching, via photolithography, micro-holes that can allow light to be transmitted through the cell itself.
The holes are arranged in the shape of a periodic array within the device, which ensures, according to the research team, that the cell is highly flexible, with a bending radius of 6mm. “The periodic hole array structure uniformly distributes the stress across the device and suppresses the generation and propagation of microcracks,” they explained, noting that the structure was implemented by controlling the dry etching process.
In order to make the cell colorful, the scientists added organic dyes into its polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. PDMS is an organic-based polymer that is commonly used in solar module backsheets. After it was embedded in the cell, however, the bending radius decreased to 3mm.
The demonstrated device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.38% with an average visible light transmittance (AVT) of 45%, and an efficiency of 5.52% with an AVT of 60%. “The solar cells with PDMS encapsulation show high flexibility and long-term stability without significant degradation, even after cyclic bending deformations up to 1,000 cycles and 1,500 hours of the standard damp heat test,” the academics emphasized.
The solar cell is presented in the paper Colorful Transparent Silicon Photovoltaics with Unprecedented Flexibility, which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.

Though scientists have been able to rapidly reach high solar cell efficiencies using perovskite materials, the specific mechanisms allowing for these is not fully understood, and research carried out to date shows that what is going on inside the material is quite to different to crystalline silicon and other common PV cell materials.
Since perovskite films are typically made up of more individual elements, they end up with a disordered structure and a range of different defects. Different elements of this structure have been shown to both help and hinder efficiency and stability in the solar cell, and understanding why this is could allow scientists to tailor materials to have more of the “good” and less of the “bad”
This was the aim of scientists led by the University of Cambridge in the UK, who used a range of different imaging techniques to gain a full picture of the perovskite at the nano-scale. “What we see is that we have two forms of disorder happening in parallel,” explains PhD student Kyle Frohna, “the electronic disorder associated with the defects that reduce performance, and then the spatial chemical disorder that seems to improve it.”
Using different techniques that focused individually on the chemical, structural and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite, including a trip to the UK’s diamond light source synchrotron facility, they were able to paint a fuller picture of the material’s behavior. “The idea is we do something called multimodal microscopy, which is a very fancy way of saying that we look at the same area of the sample with multiple different microscopes and basically try to correlate properties that we pull out of one with the properties we pull out of another one,” continued Frohna. “These experiments are time-consuming and resource-intensive, but the rewards you get in terms of the information you can pull out are excellent.”
Their findings are available in the paper Nanoscale chemical heterogeneity dominates the optoelectronic response of alloyed perovskite solar cells, published in Nature Nanotechnology. The results show that gradients in the structure push the charge into areas of the cell with fewer electronic disorders, and away from ‘traps’ that would reduce performance. “What we’ve found is that the chemical disorder – the ‘good’ disorder in this case – mitigates the ‘bad’ disorder from the defects by funneling the charge carriers away from these traps that they might otherwise get caught in,” said Frohna.
With this understanding, the group will be able to start working on ways to further mitigate the effects of one without also losing the positive effects. “Through these visualizations, we now much better understand the nanoscale landscape in these fascinating semiconductors – the good, the bad and the ugly,” said Cambridge University Assistant Professor in Energy Sam Stranks. “These results explain how the empirical optimization of these materials by the field has driven these mixed composition perovskites to such high performances. But it has also revealed blueprints for design of new semiconductors that may have similar attributes – where disorder can be exploited to tailor performance.”

The company said it intends to use the net proceeds to execute its long-term strategic growth plans, including investing in its battery storage business and growing its storage pipeline, and for general corporate purposes.
It said it may use a portion of the proceeds to invest in or acquire businesses, assets, or technologies, including possible investments to strengthen its portfolio of  solar power projects that it has developed, and that may be monetized in markets such as Europe and Brazil.
Canadian Solar has around 430 MWp of solar projects in operation, nearly 7 GWp of projects under construction or in backlog, and another 17 GWp of projects in its pipeline. The company has been publicly listed on the NASDAQ since 2006.
