Approximately 15,000 families of the Navajo Nation do not have access to electricity, creating barriers to obtaining clean water, healthy food, healthcare, and using the internet. Together the two will help more Diné/Navajo families gain access to low-cost and clean energy and provide workforce training opportunities that will support an even greater number of solar installations in the region.
An annual commitment of $10,000 and additional resources from Lightstar is expected to double the annual number of solar installations as well as providing solar installation training for residents.
“We are deeply inspired by Gallup Solar and their work to support solar energy access and job training for Diné / Navajo community members. It’s essential to provide access to solar to folks who need it most and fully aligns with Lightstar’s mission to support solar for both the land and the community,” said Lucy Bullock-Sieger, Lightstar’s vice president of strategy.
“We are humbled and honored to expand the impact of Gallup’s solar installation and training program, in a culturally respectful way that honors the original stewards of this land.”
Gallup Solar is a non-profit company that has been facilitating solar installations for low-income residents of the Diné/Navajo communities for 15 years. In Gallup Solar’s home of Gallup, New Mexico, unemployment is currently at 13% and even higher on nearby reservations. Gallup Solar offers training as part of its certification program, which gives local residents opportunities for future employment. With training from Gallup Solar, local residents install the systems themselves, which is seen as a winning proposition—local residents ensure their homes or homes of elders have a reliable electricity source, and the installers are gaining valuable work experience.
“We know that access to clean energy impacts more than just where people get their power. It opens opportunities for better health, better shelter, and better access to fresh food,” said Bill Bright, president of Gallup Solar. “The opportunity to expand our training and increase solar installations with Lightstar’s support means more people can thrive in their own homes and lives.”
Lightstar is a community solar developer and long-term owner with a pipeline of over 500 MWs of community solar farms in the United States. The company’s mission is to be good stewards of the land and the communities that the company serves.

Georgia ranks 7th nationally in the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) solar deployment tracker, with over 4.3 GW installed to date. The state holds over 4,400 solar jobs, houses 176 solar businesses, and roughly 4% of the state’s total electricity comes from solar energy.

The state currently has enough solar capacity to power over 500,000 homes. SEIA projects the state will install nearly 2 GW over the next five years, ranking it 16th in the nation over that period.
Solar policies
The Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) recently approved investor-owned utility Georgia Power’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), a forward-looking roadmap for the utility that is released every three years. The plan calls for the retirement and decertification of all but two of the utility’s coal burning facilities by 2028, and replacing that capacity with 2.3 GW of renewable energy along with 500 MW of battery energy storage. And the plan is even more ambitious for the future, with an anticipated 9 GW of renewables by 2035.
Georgia Power’s IRP also includes proposals for the creation of distributed energy resource (DER) and income-qualified community solar pilot programs. The DER program would enable participating customers to receive a resiliency service via a company-owned, operated and maintained DER. Participating customers could elect to receive a credit in exchange for the company’s ability to access the DER for the benefit of all customers during a system reliability event, like peak demand reduction or load-shifting.
The community solar pilot program would provide income-qualified customers access to Community Solar generated energy at discounted prices.  The discount would be made available by participating corporate sponsors who would receive corresponding Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).
In addition, the PSC voted unanimously to create a collaborative “Distributed Generation Working Group.” The group is expected to be comprised of representatives from utilities, the solar industry, and PSC staff, which will develop recommendations for growing the distributed energy market in Georgia.
A net metering policy was spelled out in Georgia Power’s 2019 rate case, enabling Georgia Public Service Commission to offer net metering with monthly netting to 5,000 rooftop solar customers or 32 MW of capacity, whichever comes first. Georgia allows for net metering on residential systems of up to 10 kW or commercial of up to 100 kW commercial. A full list of Georgia state incentives for solar can be found here.
Notable installations
RWE Renewables activated the Hickory Park Solar project, a 195.5 MW solar facility with 40 MW, two-hour battery energy storage co-located. The project is located in Mitchell County Georgia, and RWE is the operator/manager of the facility, selling energy and renewables certificates to utility Georgia Power through its Renewable Energy Development Initiative (REDI) program. It will sell power to the utility has part of a 30-year power purchase agreement.
The project uses 650,000 solar panels covering 1,800 acres. Its integrated a DC-coupled storage system that allows the project’s energy yield to be optimized and increases the predictability of the facility’s energy supply.
Commercial installations have been completed by some well-known retailers such as Anheuser-Busch and Ikea. Ikea installed a 1 MW solar system at its location in Port Wentworth.
The last stop on the pv magazine tour of the 50 states of solar was South Carolina, and next we will continue to travel through the sunny South Atlantic, stopping off in Florida.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/06/inside-the-renewable-energy-production-tax-credit-ptc/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 6, 2022",Inside the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC),"The solar industry celebrated when the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) was extended at 30% for the next decade. Its lesser-known counterpart, the Production Tax Credit (PTC) was also implemented with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.
The PTC involves paying owner-operators of generating assets for producing and delivering electricity to the grid. For the first time since 2006, solar facilities qualify for the PTC. There are a few wrinkles to how the PTC works, and developers may be eager to get started constructing projects quickly, as there is an advantage to early movers.
The renewable energy PTC is available until the end of 2024, after which the PTC will transition to a technology-neutral credit. Energy from solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydropower and other eligible projects will be paid a base credit of 0.3 cents per kWh, with a fivefold higher credit of 1.5 cents per kWh paid to projects that are built with workers paid a prevailing wage that have undergone apprenticeship requirements.
However, that credit is currently significantly higher at 2.6 cents per kWh if construction of the project commences before the “Act Beginning Construction Deadline” which will occur 60 days after the IRS releases guidance regarding the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
A 10% adder is applied to the PTC for projects that reach domestic content requirements. To qualify, 100% of any steel or iron that is a component of the facility must be produced in the United States, and 40% of all components of the facility must be produced in the United States. Products will be deemed to have been produced domestically if not less than 40% of the total costs across all such manufactured products of such facility are attributable to manufactured products that are mined, produced or manufactured in the U.S.
Another 10% adder is available to projects constructed in “energy communities.” To qualify the facility must be installed on a brownfield site, or in a community that has, or had any time during the period beginning in 2010, 0.17% or more direct employment or 25% or more local tax revenues, in either case related to the extraction, processing, transport, or storage of coal, oil or natural gas. The community must also have an unemployment rate above the national average for the previous year.
A third qualifying site for the 10% “energy community” adder is a census tract in which a coal mine has closed after 1999 or a coal-fired electric generating unit was retired after 2009. Adjacent census tracts would also qualify.
The PTC will be available via direct pay, meaning a cash payment can be made, and tax appetite is not needed to enjoy the benefits of the credit. The credits are also transferrable to other entities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/06/residential-flow-batteries-and-inverter-updates-from-the-floor-at-re/,"MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 6, 2022",Residential flow batteries and inverter updates from the floor at RE+,"On day 2 of the RE+ trade show, we made an attempt to visit many of the lesser-known manufacturers, rather than visiting only the big names. Of course, when the big names brought new technology, it was time to say hello to them, too!
See our RE+ Day 1 solar panel update
RedFlow’s residential flow battery is available in the United States on a ‘developing regional basis’. What this means is that while the company is officially selling in the U.S., they are restricting their residential sales to regions that are expected to produce higher sales volume, so that operations and maintenance costs will become financially viable.
This might be the first residential flow battery that is available for sale in the USA.

Currently, the company is deploying a 2 MWh facility in California made from 192 of its 10 kWh 48 V ZBM3 building blocks (each similar to the residential unit above).
The company representative suggested that selling ten or more units in a tight geographic area would make sense as the company scales into the US marketplace.  This looks like an opportunity for a hard working residential solar sales person to get into a new market.
SolarArk is a Texas solar inverter manufacturer that I think everyone (including myself) needs to learn more about. The feature rich on/off grid hardware looks to be built like a tank – the company describes their units as being ‘Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened’.
 

SolarArk and RedFlow announced that their hardware is certified to work together in commercial setups. This aligns with SolarArk’s announcement that they now have larger 30 and 60 kW commercial units available for sales.
BYD displayed a mock up of their ‘blade’ battery cells. This hardware is a third generation battery technology that increases product density. Originally designed to be deployed in cars, these cells have moved into the stationary market as higher energy density has been demanded.

The lithium phosphate battery can be assembled in a new BYD commercial cabinet – below – which is inverter agnostic. The cabinets accept up to twelve 7.5 kWh battery racks allowing up to 90 kWh total per unit.

BYD also released a new slim residential battery that can be stacked vertically in 5 kWh increments, or mounted on a wall
Kehua Tech has been making UPS systems since 1988 – that’s thirty-four years. In that time they’ve learned to design systems that, when the electricity goes out, have a transfer time from grid electricity to battery of just 20 milliseconds.
That experience is carried over to their hybrid inverters and storage solutions.

The company is launching this new hybrid inverter line that varies from 7.6 to 12 kW, and can be stacked – up to four units. These LFP batteries are 5 kWh each and can themselves be stacked in three to eight unit combinations.
The company is seeking US distribution channel partnerships.
EPC Power was recently purchased by Goldman Sachs. Based in the US, EPC Power is one of the manufacturers of utility scale inverters that qualify for the domestic content requirements found in the recently signed Inflation Reduction Act.

Data from individual solar panels passes through the microinverters to its individual wifi connection, and is relayed through a mesh network to other microinverters and to an Energy Communication Unit (ECU-R, ECU-C, or ECU-B). The ECU models are gateway units that connect to the internet and AP Systems data dashboards three times faster than power line communications (PLC).

Fox ESS is another company that is expanding into the United States. Fox is currently deploying a portfolio of 50 projects into the country, and they are seeking new partners. The company is partially or completely owned by Tsingshan Group, a mining company (batteries above). The representative touted Tsingshan ownership as one of the company’s strengths, ensuring pricing and supply chain stability.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/06/new-york-needs-20-gw-of-new-renewables-by-2030-plus-transmission-says-grid-operator/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 6, 2022","New York needs 20 GW of new renewables by 2030, plus transmission, says grid operator","New York needs 20 GW of new renewable generation by 2030 and an additional 75 GW of zero-carbon resources by 2040 to meet state targets, said the state’s grid operator NYISO in a report.
NYISO modeled a near-term scenario adding 9.5 GW of renewables, representing new renewables contracted by the New York agency NYSERDA, which procures renewable energy certificates from large-scale renewables projects. That scenario, with 4.3 GW of solar, mostly upstate, and 5.2 GW of wind, mostly offshore, would constitute nearly a fivefold increase in large-scale renewable capacity beyond the current level.
Without any major transmission upgrades, the scenario would increase transmission congestion 23% statewide by 2030, NYISO said.
Transmission congestion, according to the consultancy Grid Strategies, means that there is insufficient transmission capacity to deliver energy from lower-cost generation resources to customers, requiring the use of higher-cost generators closer to customers. Grid Strategies reported that NYISO’s transmission congestion costs were $462 million in 2019.
Energy storage “when dispatched effectively” would help to increase the utilization of renewable generation, NYISO said, but “storage alone cannot completely resolve the transmission limitations.”
NYISO highlighted three “pockets” where near-term transmission needs are greatest, whether to accommodate already-contracted wind and solar generation in a region served by 115 kV transmission, or to take advantage of untapped wind and solar resources, or to transmit generation from up to 20 GW of offshore wind capacity.
Dispatchable resources
NYISO said that as more renewables and storage are added, dispatchable emission-free resources (DEFRs) must also be developed and deployed, or fossil generation must be retained, to serve system demand when intermittent generation is unavailable. NYISO modeled DEFRs as providing as much as 36% of generation in downstate New York by 2040. NYISO did not give examples of technologies that could meet its criteria for DEFRs.
To meet New York’s target of a carbon-free electricity sector by 2040, without “investments in research, development, and commercialization of DEFRs,” NYISO found that in the scenario with the most DEFR capacity, at 45 GW of DEFRs, 30 GW of offshore wind and 40 GW of energy storage could substitute for DEFRs. NYISO cautioned that those values represent a “directional proxy that would not fully substitute for the attributes provided by either today’s fossil-fueled fleet or by future DEFRs.”
Transmission plans
NYISO reported that a new transmission line has recently been completed in western New York, while two more transmission lines are under construction. In scenarios looking to 2040, NYISO modeled three additional transmission projects not yet under construction: one project to upgrade existing 230 kV lines in northern New York to 345 kV, and two HVDC transmission lines, one from Quebec to New York City, and another from upstate New York to New York City. Those three projects have received “certain approvals” from the New York Public Service Commission to help meet renewables targets, NYISO said.
New York’s clean energy targets, set by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, call for the state to reach 70% renewable energy by 2030, including 10 GW of distributed solar and 3 GW of storage; to reach 9 GW of offshore wind by 2035; and to reach a carbon-free electricity sector by 2040.
The NYISO report is titled “2021-2040 System and Resource Outlook.”
