As components, shipping and grid interconnection costs rose and trade wars unfolded, supply chains struggled to keep up with planned projects. The drop in deployment occurred in a year where 30% growth was expected.
The American Clean Power Association (ACP) reported that renewable energy deployment began to ramp up in Q4 of 2022. Developers added 131 projects across 36 states in Q4, 2022, adding roughly 30% of the projects brought online in 2022. Texas accounted for 44% of Q4 installations.
Despite this increase in activity late in the year, Q4 2022 showed the lowest fourth quarter deployment since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q4, 2019.
The 16% decline in clean power installations in 2022 versus 2021 can be explained in part by the mass of projects that have experienced project delays in 2022, the ACP said. More than 48 GW of clean power projects reported delays in 2022 and have not yet come online.
Solar accounts for 64% of the capacity of delayed clean power deployment. More than 4 GW of clean power projects have been permanently terminated since the beginning of 2021.
However, solar had its strongest Q4 yet, adding 4.7 GW, 3% higher than Q4, 2021. Solar commissioned the most capacity among renewable energy projects, adding 12.7 GW in 2022. For the year’s sub-total, solar added 5% less capacity in 2022 than in 2021. This fell short of the anticipated 30% year-over-year growth.
Total operating clean power capacity, which ACP tracks as solar, wind, and energy storage development, has reached 227 GW, enough to power more than 61 million American homes.
Texas leads the nation in terms of total operating clean power capacity (54 GW), as well as total land-based wind capacity (40 GW). California places second overall at 29 GW online, but first for solar (18 GW) and battery storage (5 GW). Iowa ranks third overall with 13 GW, almost all of which is wind power (12.7 GW).
Solar now represents 59% of the clean power capacity in development, gaining 4% in share, the ACP said. Texas leads with 17 GW of solar in development, representing 21% of the national solar development pipeline. This quarter California fell from second place in development, surpassed by Indiana with 6.2 GW in development. California has 6 GW of solar in its development pipeline.
Regionally, 95% of the non-ISO Southeast’s pipeline is solar, followed by MISO, with a pipeline of 77% solar. Solar makes up the smallest portion of the pipeline in ISO-NE at 16%.
Battery energy storage had a record year, adding 4 GW / 12.2 GWh, a significant leap over the 2021 total of 3 GW / 9.5 GWh. Storage capacity increased 80% in 2022. Following small declines in the second and third quarters, battery energy storage rebounded in Q4, growing 17% from Q3. As of December 2022, ACP said there was 16.7 GW/45.6 GWh of storage in development. Nearly 70% of the capacity is paired with on-site solar or wind capacity.
Hybrid projects, or ones that co-locate energy storage, have changed their profile considerably over the years. Almost 75% of all operating hybrid capacity is part of a solar plus storage project. That percentage increased by an average of 7% each year over the past decade, said ACP. Wind plus storage projects, which represented close to 75% of operating hybrid capacity a decade ago, now represents just 17% of operational capacity. The hybrid pipeline is 97% solar plus storage capacity and 3% wind plus storage project capacity.

Appalachian region solar developer Solar Holler and Coalfield Development Corporation, a non-profit job recruitment organization, jointly announced a partnership to train 100 new workers over the next 18 months for solar careers.
Following the recently announced award to the ACT (Appalachian Climate Technology) Now Coalition, the two entities will collaborate on strategies to recruit, train and employ local workers in the growing renewable energy industry in West Virginia and around the Appalachian region.
ACT Now is a coalition formed by Coalfield Development to grow sustainable energy, infrastructure and industry in southern West Virginia. It includes the state’s two universities, several unions, and more than 50 private company employers, which includes Solar Holler. One piece of ACT Now is the Repower Appalachia Initiative, which seeks to increase solar and other renewable energy deployments by ten times in West Virginia.  The initiative projects $100 million of annual investment into workforce training with a goal of installing 750 rooftop solar projects per year from companies such as Solar Holler.
In 2022, the coalition competed against nearly 600 other nationwide groups as part of the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s Build Back Better Regional Challenge. ACT Now was one of 21 winners and received a federal award of $62.8 million to spur job development activities in the Mountain State.
“Solar has never been more promising in Appalachia, not just because we’re bringing affordable power to more and more folks every day, but because of the ripple effects,” said Dan Conant, chief executive officer of Solar Holler. “In the beginning, we set out to strengthen local communities and give folks the opportunity to stay and build careers in their hometowns. This partnership will help see that we continue to do just that.”
Solar Holler has developed a training program with the local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and carpenters union.  On February 2, Solar Holler announced a high school apprenticeship program in partnership with Wayne High School and Pioneer Career Launch program, which will allow participating students to shadow Solar Holler installation crews to learn the industry basics through hands-on experience.
As of the announcement date, five Wayne High School seniors have been selected to kick off the solar apprenticeship program. Upon completion, the students will have the  opportunity to be hired into full time positions with Solar Holler or other solar developers.
Formed in 2013, Solar Holler is a licensed solar developer based in Shepherdstown, W. Va., providing residential and commercial solar installation and financing solutions in West Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, and Ohio. The company was started by Dan Conant, who previously worked at SunCommon and the Department of Energy’s SunShot initiative.  Solar Holler’s first two West Virginia solar projects at Shepherdstown Presbyterian Church and Bolivar-Harpers Ferry Public Library received national and statewide recognition for using crowdfunding during development.
Based in Wayne, W. Va., Coalfield Development has created over 250 new jobs, trained over 1,200 people, and assisted in bringing $20 million of new investment into the Appalachia region. Its enterprises include construction job training, deconstruction of old properties and use of reclaimed materials for furniture making training and employment in solar installation, mountain top mining land reclamation, and other support solutions.
Interested parties seeking job opportunities in the Appalachian region can apply or receive more information on the coalition’s online job board.
According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), West Virginia was the second-largest coal producer in the nation in 2020 and accounted for 13% of U.S. total coal production, and coal accounted for 88% of the state’s electricity net generation.
With only 20 MW of solar installed, West Virginia is currently ranked 48th in the nation for solar energy installations. Over the next five years the Mountain State is projected to see 671 MW of new solar development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). When EDF Renewables’ 92.5 MW Wild Hill Solar project is complete, it is expected to be the largest solar installation in the state. It will then be eclipsed by a 250 MW project by SEVA WV, to be built on the site of a former coal mine. Total project cost is estimated at around $320 million, which is considerably more than the $54 million in total solar investment in the state previously, according to the SEIA.
FirstEnergy, an electric utility serving West Virginia, recently announced that it will permanently retire a coal ash facility and build a 6 MW site as part of a larger 50 MW solar portfolio.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/20/retaining-value-for-solar-customers-under-california-nem-3-0-rule-change/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 20, 2023",Retaining value for solar customers under California NEM 3.0 rule change,"Rooftop solar is considered an important part of the evolution of our grid. It requires less transmission buildout than traditional, centralized power generation, is more resilient in events that disrupt the grid, and saves land. Analysis by Environment California found that, based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW of solar through 2045, rooftop solar could prevent the development of 148,000 acres of land versus a centralized utility-scale-only model. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles that could be preserved. 
NEM has enabled 1.3 million customers to install roughly 10 GW of customer-sited renewable generation. NEM systems reduce the demand on the electric grid by as much as 25 percent during midday when the sun is shining, said the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Across the county, we’ve been witness to policy battles in California, Florida, Indiana, Idaho, Michigan, and North Carolina. California represents roughly 50% of the U.S. residential solar market. This market is set to undergo a major change as the California Public Utilities Commission adopted Net Energy Metering 3.0 this past December. As is often the case in the tech world, the U.S. will be watching California’s response to the rollout of NEM 3.0 as an indicator for how their state’s respective utility commissions will adopt rulemaking changes and how its market participants pivot around new rules. 
There is no denying that sharply cutting net metering export rates presents a challenge for distributed solar installers. ROTH Capital Partners projected that residential solar demand may fall 30% in 2023 following the adoption of Net Energy Metering 3.0 in California. NEM 3.0 moves from the current retail time-of-use based rates to a far lower rate based on the “avoided cost calculator”.
This new rate, which is on average 75% lower than the legacy rate, is designed to avoid the “cost shift”, in which non-solar owners cross-subsidize solar owners. While this cross-subsidization has been proven to exist, there is some disagreement between third-party analyses by national laboratories and internal utility commission analysis on exactly how much cost rooftop solar owners are shifting onto their neighbors. Regardless, the rulemaking decision has been made, and NEM 3.0 will take effect on April 15 this year.
Trade organizations like the Solar Energy Industries Association and the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) called for a more gradual phase-down of net metering credit values, giving the industry time to adapt their products and services to offer a clear benefit to their customers. However, rates are going to be a fraction of what they were, essentially changing overnight. In 2017, when Nevada cut its rates by a similar amount and tacked on a $35 fixed charge to solar customers, it led to a 90% drop in residential solar adoption. To make matters more complicated, the Avoided Cost Calculator can be revised on an annual basis, and it will likely be the target of intense scrutiny and litigation by the distributed solar sector and its advocates. 
This kind of regulatory environment whiplash is a heavy burden on installers as it places a lot of doubt in consumer evaluation of the benefits of solar. As a former residential solar salesperson, this author can personally attest to the difficulty of offering an attractive customer value proposition when there is so much uncertainty. The piecemeal fashion of federal and state incentive adjustments made it difficult for my customers to confidently make a decision to move forward. This is one of the reasons the solar and storage industry rejoiced when the Inflation Reduction Act extended the 30% Investment Tax Credit for the next decade, as it created certainty for the long-term.
(Read: “California cuts rooftop solar net metering: An industry reacts“)
What options remain for prospective residential solar customers when NEM 3.0 takes over? And how does a residential solar installer win in this new environment? 
Customer expectations for the benefits of rooftop solar will need to be reset. EnergySage said the payback period under NEM 3.0 will shift closer to 9 to 10 years, up from today’s average of about 5 to 6 years. It said that customer savings will be roughly 60% less than what they were under NEM 2.0.
As such, installers will be selling as many NEM 2.0 systems as they can before the sunset date of April 14, 2023. By then customers must submit a complete interconnection application, a signed contract, and a single-line diagram, to be grandfathered in for the next 20 years. This could prove difficult for installers as ongoing supply chain constraints may push out installation dates for months as they try to source components.
Installers will have to work hard to establish strong partnerships with component suppliers and to set transparent customer expectations that projects may face long delays as a glut of applications come in. Systems must be fully installed and connected to the grid by April 14, 2026, to retain NEM 2.0 status.
Those who adopt solar after the sunset date will be faced with a new set of options under NEM 3.0. Dr. Ahmad Faruqui, a grid controls expert, economist-at-large, and California rooftop solar owner, addressed this question in a case study published in <b>pv magazine</b>, which can be read by scanning the QR code onscreen. Dr. Faruqui sees three main options for residential solar customers in California: 
While these options can represent marginal savings to customers, Dr. Faruqui is skeptical that rooftop solar will continue to flourish as it had before. 
In the pv magazine Op-Ed article, he wrote,
“The only thing I can think of that will validate that assertion is that rooftop solar installations, either with or without batteries, will plummet and thus the so-called cost shift from the poor to the rich will diminish. Maybe that’s the real intent of the unanimous decision. But what will also diminish is California’s pursuit of net zero carbon emissions.Telling consumers that large-scale solar costs only 4 cents/kWh rings hollow when they are paying 30 cents/kWh. In the coming decade, electricity rates will continue to rise in the billions of dollars, as stated by the utilities. They won’t be able to blame NEM for the rate increases. However, the one option consumers have today for lowering bills while staying connected will be taken away by this unanimous decision. This will also represent a setback for the state’s electrification goals. What’s the primary reason that heat pump installations are rare in California? The high cost of electricity mentioned above. Heat pumps become cost-effective when customers have installed rooftop solar panels. The same can be said for EVs.” Ahmad Faruqui, economist-at-large.
Under the new net metering rule, systems paired with batteries are expected to have the same payback period as standalone systems. As such, California’s solar installers will look to to add battery energy storage to their offerings to remain competitive. 
One of the main benefits of storage that is increasingly attractive to customers across the US is backup power during grid outages. Nonprofit organization Climate Central reports that weather-related power outages in the U.S. increased by 78% from 2011 to 2021 over the ten years preceding it. An aging grid and increased extreme weather continue to push this number higher.
A SunPower survey of prospective solar customers found that over 92% of respondents cited energy bill relief as the main motivation for adopting solar, but this benefit was followed closely by the desire for resiliency in power outages. Over 88% of respondents said backup power during outages was a main motivator for shopping for solar. Installers will likely look to abandon sales pitches focused purely on savings and instead will need to frame solar and battery energy storage as an improved service over traditional grid-provided energy.  
A market focused on backup power and self-consumption only limits the true power of distributed energy, though. Battery energy storage paired with distributed rooftop solar presents a handful of emergent revenue streams that can improve value for both the homeowner and the installer. Grid services, battery aggregation, demand response and peak demand shaving, and virtual power plant services are all being adopted and tested, often with promising results. 
Take a study by the University of Otago in New Zealand for example. In the study, researchers operated grid-connected connected solar-powered batteries over several neighborhoods and aggregated them in a demand-response export system. The researchers found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% for peak shaving. This is a clear example of how solar plus storage can be a benefit for California’s evolving needs. 
Residential installer Sunrun has been a pioneer in aggregating batteries in the U.S. In 2019, the residential installer secured a 20 MW bid to participate in New England’s ISO 2022-2023 forward capacity market, one of the first contracts of this type in the United States. 
As part of the bid, Sunrun said it would deploy distributed solar and battery storage to about 5,000 customers in Massachusetts. It will be required to offer the grid 20 MW of power, 24 hours a day for the one-year period. In return, Sunrun will be paid $3.80/kW/month, representing a $912,000 total contract value. Homeowners who signed up for the program agree to allow their battery to be discharged overnight. In exchange, they receive an upfront cash incentive as either a payment or a reduction in the upfront cost of their system. This month, Sunrun announced it partnered with Lunar Energy to expand its battery aggregation and virtual power plant business. 
A VPP can reach past solar and storage, as well. Jigar Shah, director of the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, wrote about VPPs in a recent issue of pv magazine. He said, 
“A VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.” 
Shah said that the growth of VPP is held back not by technological innovation, but lack of debt financing for unfamiliar technologies, and the ability of innovative grid-scale solutions to tap into viable business models. 
VPP’s have shown promise for serving renters, too. PearlX, self-described as a flexible energy provider, recently announced the launch of a multi-family virtual power plant (VPP) service in California. 
“Project Flexifornia” is a solar and storage VPP for California renters, initially targeted for a set of 1,400 apartments across five communities in Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) territories. The new VPP service follows the company’s implementation of a VPP multi-family project in Texas earlier this year. 
Under the program, tenants will gain access to solar, storage, and electrification services on-site, including smart thermostats and EV charging. PearlX said renters will receive a 5% to 10% discount on electricity bills at no cost. Renters will also have the benefit of backup power via battery energy storage during grid blackouts. 
The company said the platform addresses multi-family renters of all incomes. Low-income with past credit issues can access the service via a custom “non-credit” underwriting process. Property owners who participate will hold a cash-yielding asset at their housing community at no cost to them, actualized through annual lease payments from PearlX. 
“In September 2020, FERC Order 2222 opened the door for VPPs in the United States. Nearly two years later, VPPs are just beginning to compete in organized capacity, energy, and ancillary services markets at a meaningful scale at the regional level. To truly unlock VPP’s potential, wide reaching deployment at the national scale is needed,” concluded Jigar Shah in his Op-ed. 
The rollout of NEM 3.0 and similar net metering cuts nationwide creates a hurdle for residential and commercial installers, but the larger market and policy environment should offer some wind in their sails. 
In addition to the emergent possibilities unlocked by energy storage and VPPs, we are only six months removed from the Inflation Reduction Act, which set aside a record $369 billion for climate and energy spending. Over $60 billion in private funds have been announced in the six months since the landmark law passed. Just this week, the Internal Revenue Service released guidance on qualifiers for making the most of its rich set of tax credits, which serve everything from upstream to downstream, manufacturing and installation, jobs and workforce training, serving disadvantaged energy communities, and more. 
In his recent State of the Union address, President Joe Biden shared that over 100,000 clean energy jobs have been created in the short time since the IRA was passed. Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association said that number will reach over one million US jobs over the next several years. 
Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said, “By 2032, there will be five times the amount of solar that’s installed today, which is enough electricity to power every home east of the Mississippi River. People in every zip code will be breathing cleaner air and working in stable, family-supporting clean energy careers.” 
Analysis by Princeton University said investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under the previous policy landscape. The Act may lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade.

Located 35 miles southwest of Chicago, the city of Joliet, Illinois is now home to the 75th community solar project to open in the Prairie State.
Earlier this month utility Commonwealth Edison, an Exelon company, unveiled the 2.5 MW Speedway Solar facility, built by Summit Ridge Energy, a commercial and industrial solar developer. Located 10 miles outside of Joliet, the Speedway project will provide clean energy to more than 350 local Joliet customers. The facility includes more than 2,300 solar modules on 31 acres in Elwood, Illinois.
By the the end of 2023 ComEd expects to double its current installation rate to have more than 150 community solar projects installed, serving more than 36,000 customers across its more than 11,400 square mile service territory in northern Illinois.
“The completion of 75 community solar developments in our service territory is a major milestone on our path to a clean energy future,” said Scott Vogt, vice president of strategy and energy policy, ComEd. “Our collaboration with Summit Ridge Energy is expanding customer access to clean and affordable renewable energy and contributing to the goal of reducing carbon emissions in our communities.”
Local utility customers earn credits on their monthly utility bills for their portion of the energy produced by the Speedway Solar facility. Energy generated by community solar flows to the electric grid to become part of the overall energy supply in ComEd’s service territory.
Based in Arlington, Virginia, Summit Ridge is the largest commercial solar developer across the state of Illinois, with a portfolio of more than 250 MW across the midwestern state, according to ComEd. Summit Ridge develops commercial and industrial rooftop as well as community solar across several Midwest, MidAtlantic and Northeast states.
In December, the developer partnered with 548 Enterprise, Ecademy and the Power52 Foundation to launch the “Sustainability Hub” on Chicago’s West Side to train more than 10,000 residents over the next decade.
The solar apprenticeship program is a 13-week (450 hour) training program targeting veterans, formerly incarcerated citizens returning to the workforce (returning citizens), and high school-aged adults from underserved communities. Upon completion, participants can participate in on-site training at one of Summit Ridge’s community solar projects in Illinois.
548 Enterprise and Ecademy, which provide workforce outreach and clean energy online training, announced that their respective campaign will raise $20 million to support curriculum development, program resources, and credentialing services for the Sustainability Hub.
A Power52 representative previously told pv magazine USA  that guidance around solar apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship recognition related to the Investment Tax Credit pertaining to the Inflation Reduction Act was still at an early stage. The company is in the process of getting the training program recognized by Department of Labor as a Clean Energy Apprenticeship program.  Further details on the solar apprenticeship can be found here.
The first participants of the hub will begin training this year. Click here to participate or learn more about the Chicago-area solar training program.
Illinois introduced a community solar offering under the Illinois Shines program in 2019, and has a healthy mix of residential, commercial, and community solar installations. The utility-scale sector had its landmark year in 2021, and this is expected to continue to accelerate. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects Illinois will add 4.94 GW of solar over the next five years, placing it within the top 10 states for solar development outlook.
Electrified School Buses
In addition to being the fictional hometown of “Joliet Jake” Blues from “The Blues Brothers,” Joliet, Ill., entered the vernacular of clean energy enthusiasts this past year when Canadian-listed electric bus company Lion Electric produced its first all-electric school bus from its facility in the Illinois city.
On November 2, 2022, Lion Electric, a manufacturer of all-electric medium and heavy-duty vehicles, announced production of its first zero-emission LionC school bus in Joliet, a 900,000 square foot manufacturing facility with 20,000 vehicles per year production capacity. The production of the first LionC bus occurred at a time when market demand for all-electric school buses is gaining momentum.
Accelerated by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean School Bus Program, under which the EPA has awarded funding for over 2,200 all-electric buses to school districts nationwide with $968 million first round funding out of the $5 billion multi-year electric bus program.   In addition, federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act will drive an additional $30 billion in tax credits, loans and grants to domestic production of consumer, commercial and industrial electric vehicles.
Under the EPA Clean School Bus program, a subsidy of $375,000 per school bus, or up to 100% of the cost, and $20,000 in funding towards charging infrastructure, can be awarded to producers of electric buses and integrated charging facilities.
Prior to opening its U.S. facility, Lion Electric’s main facilities based in St.-Jerome, Quebec, produced at 2,500 vehicle annual capacity of buses and trucks.  The company has 1,350 employees as of late 2022 and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange with a $527.5 million market capitalization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/20/new-york-transmission-upgrades-to-make-room-for-renewables/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 20, 2023",New York transmission upgrades to make room for renewables,"The New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) authorized electric utilities to develop 62 local transmission upgrades designed to reduce congestion in three upstate regions as called for New York’s Climate Act.
“New York is making significant upgrades and additions to the State’s existing transmission and distribution systems to integrate new large-scale renewable energy projects into the State’s energy supply, and we must ensure that these investments are smart and cost-effective,” said Commission Chair Rory M. Christian.
New York’s clean energy targets, set by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, call for the state to reach 70% renewable energy by 2030, including 10 GW of distributed solar and 3 GW of storage; to reach 9 GW of offshore wind by 2035; and to reach a carbon-free electricity sector by 2040.
Grid operator NYISO indicated in a recent report that the state needs 20 GW of new renewable generation by 2030 and an additional 75 GW of zero-carbon resources by 2040 to meet state targets. Even adding just 9.5 GW of renewables will increase transmission congestion, NYISO contends.
“The Commission recognizes the need to address congestion in certain parts of the State where renewable energy is already bottled and where additional generation projects are in development or likely to be developed in the future,” said Christian.
Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm, said that transmission congestion means that there is insufficient transmission capacity to deliver energy from lower-cost generation resources to customers, requiring the use of higher-cost generators closer to customers. Grid Strategies reported that NYISO’s transmission congestion costs were $462 million in 2019.
The lack of transmission capacity in upstate New York negatively affects ratepayers by increasing the costs of renewable energy resources and curtailing the production of clean energy. The New York PSC said that the $4.4 billion estimated cost of the transmission upgrades to construct leverages at least $1 billion in direct benefits to New York companies and localities and avoids billions in excess payments to renewable power producers.
In the recent New York decision, the Commission approved the requests of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, New York State Electric & Gas Corporation, National Grid (upstate), and Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation for authorization to develop 62 local transmission upgrades that will reduce congestion in three existing generation pockets in the Capital Region, the southwest, and northern regions of the State.
In total, the 62 projects will create 3.5 GW of capacity for clean energy, or enough electricity for more than 2.8 million average-sized homes. Climate mitigation is the primary purpose and benefit of these projects are climate mitigation, which the PSC points out benefits all New Yorkers. Further benefits include hundreds of high paying construction jobs and significant tax payments to local municipalities arising from the $10.3 billion in expected capital investment related to the projects, according to the PSC.
In a 2021 order, the PSC recognized that renewable generation output in the three upstate regions was already being curtailed due to the lack of adequate transmission capacity. The PSC recognized that these areas are likely to see additional renewable generation development in the future, especially in light of state Climate Act’s renewable energy goals. The 2021 order directed the utilities to identify cost-effective transmission upgrades that would address both existing and future congestion on their systems.
The utilities proposed local transmission upgrades for each region, which resulted in 62 projects that will include upgrades to existing transmission lines, upgrades to existing substations and construction of three new substations. The projects are expected to be completed between 2024 and 2030.
The development and construction of these local transmission upgrades received strong support from most stakeholders that filed comments on the proposed upgrades, including the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, Inc.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/20/innovations-in-long-duration-energy-storage/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,CANADA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",TRISTAN RAYNER,"FEBRUARY 20, 2023",Innovations in long-duration energy storage,"From pv magazine 02/23
As the penetration of renewables into the grid increases, storing intermittently supplied energy becomes increasingly valuable. The benefits of long-duration energy storage (LDES) are evident: storing intermittent clean energy and pouring said solar and wind electricity back into the grid at periods of peak demand, ideally cheaper than conventional fossil fuel power.
The trick remains storing energy at scale. Yet where the green shoots of ideas and promise for LDES technology sprout, the roots are tangled among a graveyard of failed concepts.
Duration or application?
LDES is roughly defined as systems capable of delivering eight or more hours of storage capacity, though some place the cutoff point at 10 hours. A report by U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently tried to shift the focus of the definition from duration to application, arguing storage duration “does not indicate how the stored energy is used or the value it provides to the grid.” That said, it settled on a definition of “greater than 10 hours,” offered up by fellow government body the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E). That description does fit most purposes and covers technologies that are new to the grid and those that have been in use for generations, such as hydropower.
Battery power
Lithium-ion batteries have capacity and power coupling issues that make them vastly expensive for long-duration storage. Cyril Yee – director at Massachusetts-based clean energy body the Grantham Foundation, and former chief innovation officer at climate technology entity Third Derivative – told pv magazine lithium-ion batteries have significant problems of scale and lifetime.
“Something I’m not crazy about for lithium is the cycle-life, which isn’t very long – we’re talking around 3,000 cycles,” says Yee. “Grid assets are usually 20-year assets, that’s what utilities are used to dealing with. There’s no way a lithium battery will last 20 years and, for the most part, other battery technologies and chemistries are just as high-risk. In general, we’re bullish on the [LDES] space.”
Sam Lefloch focuses on industrial decarbonization as industry sector lead at Third Derivative, and emphasizes the point further. “If you go to tens or hundreds of hours of storage, you have to linearly increase the cost of the equipment that is used to charge and discharge.”
Funding issues
While LDES appears to be essential, and with investment more readily available from innovation and climate funds – both Yee and Lefloch say startups finding access to capital wasn’t an issue – the sector has struggled to go from promising ideas to promising businesses, with monetization a key issue.
“One concern we have is [LDES] near-term monetization, because the grid doesn’t necessarily need it until you get to very high penetration rates for renewables – 50-plus per cent,” says Yee.
Wood Mackenzie Senior Research Analyst Kevin Shang says utilities are particularly cautious. “The LDES ecosystem and novel technologies have been in labs and research institutes, but they are relatively new for utilities and still at a very early stage,” says Shang. “For utilities, their priority is to ensure resilience, stability, and safety of the power system. So it’s understandable that they have been slow, but things are improving.”
Lukewarm heat
One particularly tough field is thermal energy storage (TES), a technology which has attracted funding and early commercialized installations but has largely faltered to scale well. Wind engineering and power conversion supplier Siemens Gamesa has now ended its large scale and award-winning demonstrator project in Hamburg, Germany. The demonstrator site stored up to 130 MWh of energy as heat for as long as a week, using volcanic rock. Gamesa’s Verónica Díaz López was able to confirm to pv magazine that the project had ended despite proving technically feasible.
“Siemens Gamesa decided in the beginning of May 2022 to discontinue the demonstration operation of electrothermal energy storage,” says Díaz López, who put the decision down to a “lack of a commercial market for large scale storage.”
Among other contenders only Azelio, a Swedish company that stores energy as heat in recycled aluminum at up to 600 C, has managed to commercialize its solution. The company reports that it currently has 13 systems, known as TES. PODs. It is commercially operating across the UAE, Sweden, and South Africa, with its largest installation supplying up to 1.3 MWh of storage capacity.
Berlin-based TES company Lumenion says it has shifted to only storing energy for use as heat for systems with a capacity under 100 MWh. Elsewhere, Australian-based 1414 Degrees is now reworking its thermal energy storage system. MAN Energy Solutions, in Switzerland, found limited interest. Raymond Decorvet, a senior account executive at MAN, says that while the company has enormous demand for its industrial heat pumps, its TES business is less active. “I haven’t seen big movement on that, not on energy storage,” he says. “On heat pump storage, absolutely. I think it’s because of the question: who pays for it? Who benefits from it? We have to bring the barriers down.”
One of the remaining TES hopes is Malta Inc, a company spun out of Google-owner Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” X, which has received more than $85 million in investment. Malta has a pumped-heat energy storage demonstration facility installed at the Southwest Research Institute, a Texas-based non-profit group.
Compression hopes
Another major LDES hope, compressed air energy storage (CAES), has a 50-year track record, second only to pumped hydro in terms of installed scale. Two operations have been in use reliably since 1978 and 1991, in Germany (with a 290 MW capacity) and Alabama (110 MW), respectively. A study produced in 2002 by the Electric Power Research Institute found that some 80% of US geology was suitable for CAES.
The technology stores energy by compressing air and storing it in an underground cavern or a container. The air is later released to drive a turbine. The technology has a fast startup time, can store large amounts of energy, and improvements are still being made. CAES plants have boomed in China, where developers are utilizing disused mines. The world’s largest CAES site, at 350 MW/1.4 GWh, has begun development in a Shandong salt mine and may expand to 600 MW.
Hydrostor, a Canadian company with patented advanced compressed air energy storage technology, is one of the larger players outside China. With a $250 million war chest, Hydrostor counts Goldman Sachs among its investors. Among its projects, Hydrostor is developing a 300 MW to 500 MW advanced-CAES facility in Ontario and the company has secured a power purchase agreement (PPA) from community electric company Central Coast Community Energy for a proposed 500 MW facility in California.
Hydrostor CEO Curtis VanWalleghem says the company aimed to improve traditional approaches to CAES by eliminating the constraints of geology. Hydrostor advanced-CAES can be placed “anywhere there is competent hard rock at 600 m depth,” says VanWalleghem, which is “more than 50% of the world.”
“Hydrostor’s A-CAES technology can provide the same megawatts and megawatt-hours as pumped hydro power while using up to 10 times less land and up to 20 times less water,” added VanWalleghem.
The CEO claims his company’s solution is 60% to 65% efficient, with capital expenditure for the system “in the $2,500/kW range for eight hours, or $250 to $300 per kWh of storage capacity, for an asset with a 50-plus year life without performance degradation.” The system is monetized via PPAs.
Batteries flow
One of the biggest LDES electrochemical hopes is Form Energy, an alternative battery player with deep pockets. The company has raised more than $800 million for an iron-air battery that it says can store 100 hours of energy at system costs that are competitive with conventional power plants. Form’s first battery manufacturing facility is set for Weirton, West Virginia, with finished batteries expected in 2024.
Flow batteries represent another vector of hope. Vanadium-based redox flow devices are well understood, and a 2022 Chinese project installed a 400 MWh system. Other approaches using different materials – principally moving away from expensive vanadium – are also gaining market interest.
NYSE-listed iron flow battery specialist ESS recently expanded into Europe and with renewables investment in the U.S. exploding, is readying supply for expected demand. Hugh McDermott, senior vice president for business development and sales at ESS,  told pv magazine how the company is ramping up production: “As fast as possible!” he says. “We’re moving quickly to do our part to meet expected demand in the LDES market. McKinsey predicts that we will need 30 TWh to 40 TWh of LDES in the US alone by 2040.” ESS’ first fully automated battery assembly line has an annual production capacity of 75 MW, with McDermott noting plans to expand capacity to 200 MW.
“On a total cost of ownership, our energy storage systems are significantly less costly to own than lithium-ion,” adds McDermott. “This is partly due to the fact that our technology has no cycling limits and our products are designed for a 20-plus-year life with no degradation or need for augmentation.”
Technology company Third Derivative has backed half a dozen flow battery startups, including new generations of flow chemistry that use organic compounds and alternative materials to vanadium, such as zinc-air. But greater investment is required, says Wood Mackenzie’s Shang, adding, “The key thing is that deployment of [LDES] at large scale has a lot of benefits. As a society, the reward is great. But what we need to do now is more planning, more investment, and more action. We must invest today to reap the rewards of tomorrow.”
