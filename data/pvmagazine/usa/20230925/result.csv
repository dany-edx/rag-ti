For the United States and Canada, that paradigm shift comes with a $12 trillion price tag by 2050. And while that sounds like a lot, when compared with the inefficiencies of today’s fossil fuel-based economy, the savings are considerable.
A report from global risk assurance company DNV said that the intrinsic efficiencies brought on by renewable energy will lower the overall cost of energy from 4% today to about 2.5% in 2050 for the United States and Canada.
Capital expenditures for renewables will finally overtake fossil fuel by 2040, said DNV. By then, the firm expects domestic demand for fossil fuels to fall by about 60% by midcentury. Electrification of transportation and the power sector will drive down demand, said DNV, but the firm expects fossil fuel exports to remain relatively stable through 2050.
DNV said consumers burdened with high electricity bills should see significant relief by 2050, with household energy expenditure potentially being cut in half through energy efficiency and a cleaner, more stable energy mix.
Along this path toward more affordable renewable energy, DNV said the U.S. and Canada will need to increase its cumulative renewable energy capacity by 250% by 2050.
DNV warns that bottlenecks in transmission lines are still a major barrier to building more solar and wind projects in North America, but it noted that transmission and distribution system operators will likely be driven by unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on the vast market for renewable power.
“The cost efficiencies of renewable power are proving irresistible even in the land of big oil,” said Remi Eriksen, group president and chief executive officer at DNV.  “The $12 trillion to be spent on renewables and grid infrastructure in the U.S. and Canada should be viewed as an opportunity to put the region at the heart of technologies essential to the global energy transition, such as hydrogen e-fuels, whilst reducing energy bills for households.”
There is still much progress to be made to achieve this renewable energy future. Currently, fossil fuels account for about 80% of the energy supply in the U.S. and Canada. This will drop below 50% in 2050, said DNV. Coal production is expected to decline 85% by midcentury due to its inability to cost-compete, and oil consumption is expected to decline 75% as North America electrifies its vehicles.
DNV said that natural gas consumption has already reached its peak in North America as well and may be halved by midcentury. However, DNV expects both natural gas and oil exports to remain stable through 2050, a boon to the North American economy, but a bane to global efforts to decarbonize.
“Although the policies enacted in North America are accelerating the energy transition, the U.S. and Canada will not reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050,” said DNV. “CO2 emissions are forecast to drop 75% by 2050 as fossil fuels, especially natural gas, will still play a role in the energy mix and the emissions of hard-to-electrify industrial processes like cement production will remain significant.”
DNV said that to remain in accord with the Paris Agreement, North America would have to become net-zero by the early 2040s, a target that is currently unlikely to be hit at current levels of clean energy deployment.
“This would require the type of American focus that ushered in the atomic age and the space age,” said DNV.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/25/california-childrens-hospital-to-build-resilient-clean-energy-microgrid/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023",California children’s hospital to build resilient clean energy microgrid,"A microgrid project is getting underway at Valley Children’s Hospital in Madera, California, led by the State of California through the California Energy Commission, and joined by Faraday Microgrids and Redflow, providing zinc bromine flow batteries.
Faraday Microgrids, project developer said that the project is “groundbreaking in the advancement of the total capacity and duration of emergency power support.” Located in an area of the country that’s vulnerable to power outages, the microgrid is designed to provide resiliency to the pediatric facility.
The project received funding from Department of Energy (DOE), which announced up to $325 million for 15 projects across 17 states and one tribal nation to accelerate the development of long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies. The DOE funding supports the DOE’s Long Duration Storage Shot, which establishes a target to reduce the cost of grid-scale energy storage by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of duration within the decade.
The Children’s Hospital Resilient Grid with Energy Storage (CHARGES) project is intended to enable the hospital to replace diesel generators with cleaner, more cost-effective resources, while also serving as a roadmap for other hospitals to use to build similar systems. Faraday Microgrids has been working closely with the California Energy Commission to develop and demonstrate the capabilities of renewable energy microgrids as a source of backup power in hospitals.
The CHARGES project will install a 34.4 MWh behind-the-meter, zinc bromide flow battery system from Redflow Limited. Redflow, an Australian company, produces zinc-bromine flow batteries designed to work in harsh conditions in deep cycling, LDES applications in the commercial & industrial sector. The company recently announced that  its energy storage solutions have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as part of the state’s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP). With SGIP approval, Redflow expects its flow batteries to be more economically attractive, as the state incentives support wider deployment across disadvantaged communities within the state.
“Our batteries are ideally suited for daily use in the Central Valley’s extreme heat, and we’re proud to provide the resources the hospital needs to ensure safe, reliable operations,” said Redflow CEO and managing director, Tim Harris. “This combination of our technology leadership, Faraday’s trusted microgrid solutions, and the funding provided by the CEC and DOE all assist in transitioning communities to a cleaner, more energy-efficient future.”
In addition to Redflow batteries, the microgrid will be paired with solar and other renewable energy resources such as fuel cells to support decarbonization and to ensure that the hospital stays up and running in the event of wildfires, earthquakes and other events that cause power outages.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/25/panasonic-introduces-half-cut-hjt-residential-solar-module-and-more/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023",Panasonic introduces half-cut HJT residential solar module and more,"Panasonic drew some attention at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas, Nevada as it brought in Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps to promote its new products, including a new series of residential solar modules, a home battery and a home energy management system.
“Panasonic’s long-standing commitment to sustainability, including developing the technologies to create a cleaner future such as high-performance solar panels and home energy storage, is why I have chosen to work with them this year to outfit my own home with a Panasonic solar energy system,” said Phelps.
The major panel supplier revealed the 430HK2/420HK2 Black series modules, made with heterojunction (HJT) technology, half-cut cells, and gapless connections. The 430 W and 420 W modules are the company’s most powerful available and sport efficiencies of 22.2% and 21.7% respectively.
The Evervolt HK2 series are backed by a 25-year warranty for performance, product, parts and labor. Panasonic said the panels have a low degradation rate of 0.25% annually, leading to at least 92% of the original output by year 25. The company said its modules benefit from minimal low induced degradation and potential induced degradation.
Read more about module performance in our recap of the Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) PV module index.
Along with the HK Black series, Panasonic displayed its modules with passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) technology and half-cut cells, which are slightly less powerful but offer a lower price point. The 405PK2 and 400PK2 series offer 20.8% and 20.5% efficiencies respectively and power ratings of 405 W and 400 W.
The modules offer a power output of at least 84.8% at the end of 25 years of operation. These modules are offered the same 25-year warranty on performance, product, parts, and labor.
“Our variety of premium modules offer various capabilities and price points, allowing more flexibility and options for both consumers and installers,” said Mukesh Sethi, director of solar and energy storage at Panasonic Eco Systems North America.
Home battery
Along with the new modules on display was a home battery announced in June. The new generation Evervolt home battery is a a modular energy storage device that supports both DC and AC coupling.
The storage system includes a hybrid inverter and lithium-ferro-phosphate battery. It also includes the SmartBox, a home energy management device.
Each battery is modular in increments of 4.6 kWh of usable energy, offering up to 18.4 kWh per battery. Up to four EverVolt batteries can be connected to one SmartBox, achieving up to 30 kW of power and 72 kWh of usable energy. Up to 15.2 kW of solar modules can be connected to three maximum power point trackers. The battery offers up to 7.6 kW of continuous backup power in a single battery.
The battery’s 160 A AC current helps keep more appliances running continuously, and it can use both 120 V and 240 V with no transformer needed. It is rated for a 6,000 cycle lifespan and has a 98% peak efficiency rating and 97.5% CEC weighted efficiency. It also enables 200% PV oversizing, meaning solar capacity can exceed inverter capacity by up to 200%.
The battery operates on multiple operating modes, including back-up, self-use, time-of-use and custom modes which can be set through a mobile app. The device is connected with a Wi-Fi monitoring system connected to Panasonic’s app.
Homeowners can track battery levels, view energy consumption data, and view alerts and instructions on how to troubleshoot errors. The system can receive firmware updates in real time via over-the-air software.
The EverVolt battery has black-start functionality to restart a system with solar power after a grid power outage. It is compatible with generators of up to 125 A to support the home during long power outages. The SmartBox allows for the backup of up to six electrical panel loads.
The battery system can be installed indoors or outdoors and is UL9540A certified for unit level thermal runaway. Panasonic includes a 12-year product warranty that covers product, performance and labor across all major systems and components of the solar installation.
“With the increased focus on clean energy, the EverVolt Home Battery System provides homeowners with a new, enhanced solution for energy management that is easy to install and can be used with new and existing solar systems,” said Sethi.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/25/honeywell-invests-in-ess-to-advance-adoption-of-iron-flow-battery-energy-storage/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023",Honeywell invests in ESS to advance adoption of iron flow battery energy storage,"Honeywell and ESS are collaborating on advancing development of iron flow battery (IFB) energy storage systems based on ESS’ patented IFB design with Honeywell’s advanced materials and energy systems expertise.
The Honeywell Company dates back to 1885 with an invention that was a precursor to today’s thermostat. Fast forward many decades, acquisitions and spinoffs later, and one of the company’s many areas of expertise is in utility-scale battery energy storage systems. In 2021 the company developed flow battery technology intended for pairing with wind and solar resources and partnered with Duke Energy to field test the long-duration energy storage (LDES) product.
ESS, founded in 2011, manufactures iron flow batteries using widely available, Earth-abundant materials. Designed for applications that require up to twelve hours of flexible energy capacity, the batteries are used in utility-scale renewable energy installations, remote solar-plus-storage microgrids, solar load-shifting and peak shaving, as well as other ancillary grid services.
At a recent ceremony at RE+ 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce awarded ESS an Export Achievement Certificate for expanding global deployment of its American-made, innovative long-duration energy storage technology. In response to domestic and global demand, the company announced that it will boost its manufacturing capacity at its Wilsonville, Oregon facility up to 2 GWh annually. 
“The demand for long-duration energy storage represents a compelling market opportunity within the  energy transition and the combination of Honeywell and ESS technology can accelerate decarbonization for the commercial, industrial and utility sectors,” said Bryan Glover, chief growth officer, Honeywell  Performance Materials and Technology (PMT) group. “Our strategic collaboration with ESS will accelerate Honeywell’s ability to bring comprehensive solutions to our customers while working to  advance long-duration energy storage across all industries requiring expansive energy storage.”
The collaboration between Honeywell and ESS enables Honeywell to integrate ESS technology into its global offering, and ESS gains license to Honeywell’s flow battery intellectual property. Additionally, the two plan to work together on continual technology advancement, cost reduction and packaging of IFB systems.
ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, the battery modules, electrolyte, plumbing, and other components may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance. The battery, for example, is expected to experience zero degradation over 20,000 cycles. Read more about its duration here.
Honeywell has invested $27.5 million into ESS common stock; purchasing 16.5 million shares at $1.67 per share. Honeywell also received a warrant to purchase an additional 10.6 million shares for $20 million at $1.89 per share. Honeywell also announced its intention to purchase up to $300 million of ESS products, with $15 million prepaid.
In addition to the investment, ESS receives exclusive license of Honeywell IP related to flow batteries
“Today, we are creating superior technology in the critical long-duration energy storage industry,” said  Eric Dresselhuys, CEO of ESS. “Combining ESS’ innovative technology and deployment experience with  Honeywell’s storage and control system expertise will enable us to drive the clean energy transition and  deliver value to our customers, shareholders and communities.”
Honeywell and ESS are teaming up at a time of huge growth in long-duration energy storage. According to the Department of Energy’s ‘Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Long Duration Energy Storage’ report, the U.S. grid needs 225 to 460 GW of LDES capacity for power market application for a net zero economy by 2060.  The global LDES market is estimated to be $50 billion per year and forecast to grow significantly with a cumulative investment of up to $3 trillion by 2040, according to the LDES Council and McKinsey & Co.
As the shift to renewable energy accelerates, challenges associated with the intermittency of renewables are becoming more apparent. The solution is to embrace safe and sustainable long-duration energy storage technologies, which can address the intermittency of renewables by ensuring stored energy is available to balance fluctuations in electricity demand and supply.
“Long-duration energy storage is critical to meet local, regional and global net-zero decarbonization goals,” Julia Souder, chief executive officer of the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, told pv magazine USA. “LDES complements rapid renewable growth by offering flexibility, reliability, affordability and security. This partnership allows us to work together to accelerate the various markets and contracts even faster to deploy diverse LDES technologies.”
ESS held a webcast conference call on Monday, September 25, 2023 to discuss the  partnership with Honeywell and it will be available on ESS’ Investor  Relations website.

Utilities in Los Angeles, Austin and Vermont have aggressive plans to reach 90% or more carbon-free power by 2030, while some smaller utilities have even more ambitious targets, as shown with red bars in the bar chart below.

SEPA’s 2030 Club also includes a separate category of about a dozen utilities with a goal of reducing their emissions by at least 80% by 2030, compared to emissions in a baseline year. The 2030 Club aligns with SEPA’s new 5×25 initiative focusing on resilience, storage, transportation, emerging technologies and policy: five key areas to accelerate carbon reduction over the next two years. The 5×25 effort was formally announced by SEPA CEO Sheri Givens at RE+ 2023.
SEPA has identified about 500 U.S. utilities with a target for either cleaner generation or reduced emissions, said Trevor Gibson, a research analyst at SEPA, at a presentation at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas. “A good amount of those utilities have mandatory targets set by states,” he said, adding that “our hope” is that the 2030 Club project “encourages more of them to accelerate their commitments.”
“We’ve seen that utilities have come out with goals of net zero by 2050,” Gibson said, “and they’ve accelerated those goals by five years, 10 years.” He anticipated that showing the data for utilities in the 2030 Club and sharing what those utilities are doing to meet their aggressive targets “will help spread more action” across the utility sector.
Strategy mix
The leading utilities on carbon-free generation identified by SEPA are pursuing a range of strategies, as described on their websites.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power plans to reach 80% renewables by 2030 by adding 3 GW of renewables, with its planning benefiting from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s “LA100” renewable energy modeling study.
Austin Energy obtains half its power from utility-scale wind and solar projects in Texas, using power purchase agreements.
The Vermont Electric Cooperative relies on hydropower and nuclear power for about three-quarters of its generation.
Vermont’s investor-owned utility Green Mountain Power primarily uses hydro and nuclear power, plus 11% solar and 10% wind generation; it currently sells some renewable energy credits.
The Platte River Power Authority, a generation and transmission cooperative utility in Colorado, owns 225 MW of wind power and plans to secure up to 400 MW of solar power.
The Colorado utility Holy Cross Energy has reached 50% renewables, primarily from wind power plus some biomass, solar and hydropower.
The Pasadena Water and Power Department in California is engaged in a resource planning process to meet a new goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030.
Municipal utilities serving Snohomish County, Washington and Eugene, Oregon have substantial hydropower generation, while the municipal utility in Concord, Massachusetts purchases renewable energy credits.
The Kauai Island Utility Cooperative in Hawaii, which has a goal of 100% renewables by 2033, is not in SEPA’s 2030 Club. The utility generates 40% of its power from utility-scale and distributed solar, and 20% from hydropower and biomass.
