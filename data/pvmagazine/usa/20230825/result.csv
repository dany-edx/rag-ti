The study, Evaluating Potential Land Use of Utility-Scale Photovoltaics (Solar Panels) on Farmland in Tennessee, sought to determine the amount of land needed to accommodate the increase in solar installations in Tennessee. The researchers found that Tennessee’s current operational and contracted utility-scale facilities would generate 1.4 GW of energy and require between 8,197 to 14,743 acres of land, equating up to 0.056% of the state’s total land mass or up to 0.137% of the state’s agricultural lands. Most of these utility-scale solar facilities are in the western portion of the state.
Last year the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federally owned utility, stated goals of targeting up to 10 GW of solar by 2035. TVA serves 10 million people across an 80,000 square mile territory in the southeast U.S., a territory that spans seven states.
While some of that 10 GW of growth could come from small-scale and rooftop installations, Tennessee lacks support for distributed rooftop solar for small and medium businesses and homeowners. Instead, the state’s small solar exposure is largely characterized by large-scale projects built for corporations in pursuit of environmental and social governance goals (ESG).
With TVA installing utility-scale solar, its operating and contracted solar capacity grew 77% in FY 2021. The first TVA-built utility-scale solar and battery projects are underway and expected to be online by 2024 to 2025. The utility expects to have about 2.8 GW of solar in TVA operation by 2024.
The Tennessee study finds that an additional 10 GW of solar would require another 55,600 to 100,000 acres of land. In theory this solar capacity could be spread across all seven states in the TVA territory, but if it were located in Tennessee exclusively, the additional land use would represent from 0.21% to 0.38% of the state’s total land mass or 0.52% to 0.93% of Tennessee’s farmland.
When so much land is considered for massive solar installations, looking at a dual-use application, such as agrivoltaics is an option. The study looked at the extent to whichTennessee farmland has already been lost to urban and residential uses, finding that from 1997 to 2017, Tennessee’s land in farms decreased from 11.99 million acres to 10.87 million acres. The reduction of 1.11 million acres amounts to about 9% of Tennessee’s farmland. The study indicates that a growing population is the main reason for loss of farmland, and it the losses are expected to continue. The American Farmland Trust ranks Tennessee third among all U.S. states in terms of acres of nationally significant agricultural land projected to be converted to urban and highly developed residential uses by 2040.
In looking at the potential for agrivoltaics, which is when land is used for both solar generation as well as crop production, the study noted that “the simultaneous use of land for both agriculture and solar energy production can provide mutual benefits and ease concerns over the removal of productive land from agriculture.”

Solar installations within an agrivoltaic project can be constructed at a height that allows for equipment and workers to pass underneath, while also allowing room for crop growth. The Tennessee study cites other research that outlines advantages to agrivoltaics, such as reducing the amount of water needed for crops, but it indicates that future research could examine soil quality specifically of Tennessee land being used for solar.
One challenge to citing agrivoltaics on existing farmland is proximity to electric infrastructure such as substations and high voltage power lines. Infrastructure may have to be enhanced in order to make existing farmland amenable to agrivoltaics, however, the study notes other research that indicates gains in both productivity and cost savings when farming operations are paired with solar power generation.
The University of Tennessee study was funded by the Tennessee Solar Energy Industries Association, with support from GreenGo Energy U.S. and the Solar Energy Industries Association.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/25/sunlight-financial-struggles-for-survival/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 25, 2023",Sunlight Financial struggles for survival,"Sunlight Financial released an 8-K on August 23, 2023, indicating it had performed a 10:1 and 25:1 reverse stock split on their Class A and Class C shares, respectively. The effective 20:1 reverse stock split became active on the trading day of August 23rd.
According to the New York Stock Exchange regulations, a company risks delisting if its shares trade below $1 for more than thirty days. If a stock goes below $1/share and is delisted, many prominent investors either won’t or cannot invest, which can drive negative business spirals. For several months, Sunlight Financial’s stock had been trading below the $1 mark and, following the announcement of $550 million in underwater solar loans, plummeted to just over $0.10/share.

In anticipation of the 20:1 reverse split, the share price started to bubble up, reaching nearly $2.80/share the day before. It subsequently dipped to approximately $2/share, mirroring the pre-split $0.10/share valuation.
Ken Beiser, a reader of pv magazine USA from StarkPoint Capital Advisors, comments:
Splits are of no economic consequence for a firm in this situation, they neither add nor subtract value. However, stock exchanges require minimum share prices to continue a listing.   I expect that is why we saw this action.
Beiser clarified that neither he nor his firm have any stakes in Sunlight Financial.
As previously highlighted by Ohm Analytics, segments of the residential solar market are grappling with financial difficulties stemming from rising interest rates. The boom in residential solar growth over the prior several years was partially powered by federal interest rates near zero for an extended duration. This environment enabled companies like Sunlight to propose long-term deals to homeowners, providing both ownership and electricity savings with no upfront costs.
Furthermore, Sunlight’s financial product structure considered the cash flow necessities of smaller solar firms, ensuring they could manage their payroll even before the completion of solar projects.
These broad financial strains have caused some solar businesses to shutter, while others have ventured into new territories. Nationally, the sunset of California’s net metering 2.0 may act as the silver lining, preserving a positive growth rate for the year. However, except for a handful of specific residential markets, the country is on track for a decline in residential solar growth in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/25/el-nino-threatens-u-s-winter-solar-generation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 25, 2023",El Niño threatens U.S. winter solar generation,"From pv magazine global
This coming winter is more likely than not to see below average irradiance across most of North America, as the impacts of El Niño bring cloudier, wetter conditions across the continent. Analysis of Historical Time Series data from El Niño years using the Solcast API, shows that irradiance is significantly impacted in these years.
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has declared that we are in El Niño’s Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase, and that there is a 90-95% probability this will continue into the upcoming winter.
NOAA has further forecast a 60% chance that this will be a “strong event,” so solar producers across the continent should be anticipating this to change their expected performance through the winter.
Analysis of December-February months from previous El Niño events (2006-07, 2009-10, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2018-19) shows the historic impact on global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). This image shows a comparison of the average GHI in the El Niño episodes with the neutral and La Niña phases of the ENSO climate cycle.

The clear observation is that most of the Continental U.S. experienced reduced irradiance during El Niño winters. California, the Midwest, Southern states, and Mexico in particular see higher precipitation, as well as cloudier conditions.
Conversely, the Northeastern USA and neighboring Canadian provinces depict the opposite. These regions experienced increased irradiance during El Niño intervals.
This trend correlates with decreased precipitation during such periods, another trend these regions might expect in the coming winter.
As the solar energy sector leads into the lower-producing winter months, El Niño is likely to bring even lower than normal production through winter. The increased rain may result in decreased dust soiling for panels that aren’t already being cleaned regularly.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/25/driving-down-cost-of-solar-key-to-unlocking-a-green-hydrogen-future/,"GUEST POST,HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 25, 2023","Driving down cost of solar, key to unlocking a green hydrogen future","Global additions of renewable power capacity are expected to jump by a third this year, according to the IEA. This is due to a combination of factors including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the war in Ukraine, and the technology adoption cost curve. Yet, we’ve only begun to tap solar’s immense potential. According to Jim Tyler, CEO of solar technology company Erthos, reducing the cost of solar electricity will be the key to unlocking the next chapter of the energy transition: a green hydrogen economy.
In a recent interview, Tyler explained how driving down solar’s levelized cost of energy (LCOE) can accelerate the adoption of solar for green hydrogen production. While the startling drop in solar panel prices (from $5/W in 2005 to around $0.25/W today) has fueled the industry’s growth, ongoing LCOE reductions remain imperative.
“You have to get to below $20 a megawatt hour,” said Tyler of the solar electricity price needed to produce competitive green hydrogen. “There are ways to do that. There are ways to get to below $20.” The 2023 LCOE report by Lazard put solar on parity with wind at $24/MWh.
Enter Erthos, founded by Tyler in 2019, which slashes costs through a novel “solar skin” design that eliminates racking and piles by placing panels directly on the ground. The technology is being embraced by developers like Industrial Sun, which announced a 100 MWac project using Erthos technology in Dec. 2022. This approach reduces steel usage by 35 tons per megawatt, halves installation time and real estate needs, and lowers O&M costs. The carbon footprint of steel manufacture is 1.4-1.65 tons of CO2e/ton of steel.
The flat to ground solar also reduces mechanical stress and microcracking on panels, boosting energy yield and project ROI according to a white paper by Erthos. What about periodic flooding of the solar array that flat mounted solar might encounter in the field, you ask? Tyler, who was VP of EPC for First Solar in a previous life, points to the intrinsic waterproof design of both solar panels and BOS that can withstand periodic flooding.
By streamlining the system, Erthos delivers an estimated 20% lower LCOE compared to single axis tracker based solar construction. While industry observers initially doubted putting panels on the ground, Erthos has now contracted over 200 megawatts of its revolutionary design. “It’s just a matter of time until all module providers recognize that and ultimately sign up to this technology,” said Tyler, noting 9 leading module manufacturers have already partnered with Erthos.
Others are pushing LCOE lower in different ways, like tracker manufacturer NexTracker introducing systems with fewer parts. But why does shaving cents off the cost of solar matter so much? Because it can make the difference in scaling up green hydrogen to displace fossil fuels.
“I’m a very firm believer that we are not going to electrify our way out of the [climate] problem,” stressed Tyler. “We have to solve the problem another way. We have to find a renewable replacement for fossil fuel.”
That replacement is hydrogen. Clean hydrogen produced by splitting water with renewable electricity offers a sustainable fuel for transportation, industry, and more. But historically high production costs have limited adoption.
“I’m 100% firm believer that hydrogen is that [fossil fuel] replacement. It’s just too expensive. That’s just the bottom line,” acknowledged Tyler.
The newly passed Inflation Reduction Act provides crucial support, including tax credits for clean hydrogen. However, driving down the single biggest cost component—the solar electricity input—is vital to make green hydrogen cost competitive at scale.
In fact, Tyler suggests one solution is taking solar off-grid altogether to avoid the years-long interconnection queues hindering larger grid-tied solar projects today. Ultra-low-cost off-grid solar plants dedicated to hydrogen production could accelerate the technology’s adoption.
“When you disconnect us from the grid [avoiding interconnection costs and delays], solar will grow even faster for several years,” Tyler predicted.
While challenges remain, from supply chain constraints to electrolyzer availability, the industry leaders driving solar innovation are confident the path is clear. “There are ways to get to below $20,” reiterated Tyler.
With solar progress unlocking the hydrogen opportunity, Tyler sees a bright future. “That’s the industry of the future. And when you do that, solar will grow like you wouldn’t believe.” The race is on to make cheap renewable hydrogen from cheap renewable electricity a reality.
When I first spoke to Tyler he provided additional context on Erthos’ disruptive technology and his storied career pioneering utility-scale solar. He first entered the industry in 2006, working on thin film solar manufacturing equipment. Seeing early solar farms under development, he joined OptiSolar in 2007 as they acquired land and interconnection queue positions to facilitate growth.
After building OptiSolar’s first Canadian project, Tyler moved to First Solar as VP of EPC. There he helped scale their technology as crystalline silicon advanced, before co-founding DEPCOM Power in 2014. DEPCOM grew into a top utility-scale EPC, giving Tyler immense experience with trackers. But after building over 8 gigawatts, he contemplated: what if module prices hit zero?
This sparked the idea for flat to ground mount solar. Tyler determined it made economic sense around 50 cents/W, as modules dropped below 30 cents/W. After verifying solar panels and BOS can survive on the ground, Tyler founded Erthos in 2019 to pursue this inevitable disruption.
With 9 tier-one module partners and over 170MW contracted, Erthos is crossing the chasm into broader adoption. But Tyler explains the shift hinges on LCOE gains trumping perceived risks, just as trackers prevailed for their 5% yield boost despite concerns. With 20% lower LCOE, Erthos should likewise win out.
Still, the transition takes ardent learners willing to embrace ground-mount solar’s advantages. Tyler compares it to next-gen trackers circa 2010 – early adopters tested the waters as bankers and others gradually recognized their value. Now developers like White Pine Renewables and Industrial Sun prove Erthos’ commercial viability.
Ultimately, Tyler sees electrification as insufficient to meet climate goals. Low-cost solar-powered hydrogen production holds the key through its scalable replacement of fossil fuels. He envisions massive off-grid complexes supplying clean fuel, with Erthos slashing solar input costs to under $20/MWh. For Tyler, ushering in this new era through innovation is what drives him.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/25/sunpower-survey-finds-education-is-essential-to-scaling-residential-solar/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"AUGUST 25, 2023",SunPower survey finds education is essential to scaling residential solar,"Even with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), fewer than 5% of domestic homes are solar-powered today. To find out why, SunPower Corporation surveyed 2,005 individuals aged 18 plus. Data was collected over ten days between February 17 and 27 this year by polling agency Wired Research. SunPower published its findings in its Energy Switch Index 2023. 
Investigators learned that presumed high costs of installing solar coupled with a lack of understanding and, in some cases, awareness of the IRA were the primary reasons respondents didn’t move to install solar systems at home. 
While 78% of those surveyed said they thought getting solar would lower their monthly energy bills, they didn’t do it because of presumed high cost. Moreover, 55% of respondents earning under $50,000 a year also expressed being unable to afford solar, even though 75% of those individuals believe switching to solar energy would lower their utility costs.
Youger respondents had the same perception. SunPower found that 23% of millennials and 20% of Generation Z were exploring a second job to afford their energy bills. For single women, three out of four believed they couldn’t pay for a solar system, despite that demographic outpacing single men concerning purchasing homes. 
Even so, more than half of the survey respondents would install solar systems if they received government incentives, “which is exactly what Congress passed in late 2022 with the IRA,” SunPower reports. This legislation is meant to scale the electrification of domestic homes while creating more jobs that can design build and preserve clean energy infrastructure. 
The IRA includes a solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), giving consumers up to a 30% recoup of the cost of installing clean energy-saving and storage systems. Residents have until 2032 to take advantage of this reduction, which is available to single-family and multifamily unit renters and owners.  
The problem, SunPower reports, is that many members of low-income communities still need help to afford the cost of going solar, even with the passing of the IRA. SunPower suggests low-income households and those living in rural areas spend more than their share on utility bills. They also make up almost half of the total residential market for solar due to suitable rooftop area and generation capacity potential. 
Federal organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have incentivized local stakeholders to construct community solar gardens. As such, residents of economically disadvantaged areas also benefit from a solar-powered home. The EPA’s Solar For All program awards $7 billion to up to 60 qualifying states tribal governments municipalities and nonprofits. The funds are meant to support the construction of residential rooftop and community solar projects in low-income neighborhoods. 
Lack of IRA awareness and understanding  
Despite its publicity, SunPower found that a quarter of the domestic population had never heard of the IRA. Furthermore, many of those who had needed clarification about its benefits. “About 51% of people who knew about the IRA didn’t know the bill offered clean energy tax credits for making home improvements and 39% didn’t realize they were eligible,” SunPower reports. That includes a quarter of Millenials and a third of Gen Z who also thought they didn’t qualify to participate in the IRA. 
Additionally, only a quarter of respondents earning less than $50,000 a year knew about the IRA, and less than half had plans to take advantage, “compared to 57% of higher-earning peers,” SunPower reports. 
Suzanne Leta, Head of Policy and Strategy at SunPower, says individuals should release the perception that residential solar is only for the wealthy. “In addition to those who rent homes or apartments, they should know there are policies and programs in place to help enable them to qualify for the IRA,” she says. 
The Department of Energy’s tax credits and New York Green Bank’s Community Decarbonization Fund are two examples of programs intended to further decrease the cost of adopting solar in low-income residential areas. “SunPower’s 25×25 initiative is designed to ensure the benefits of solar and storage serve all American families job seekers and businesses regardless of income or zip code,” SunPower reports. 
According to lobbying group Rewiring America, $1.27 trillion of federal funds are available. SunPower stresses the importance of educating the public on the IRA and how to leverage it. Those respondents who heard about the IRA were 50% more likely to say they planned to install energy-efficient appliances in their homes than those who hadn’t.
