This major increase in solar installations will also require a major increase in professionals to develop these projects.
“This is the largest wealth creation opportunity of our lifetimes,” Jigar Shah, solar entrepreneur and Department of Energy professional. “There will be nothing else that will produce more wealth, more jobs, more work.”
PV Intel is a solar intelligence company that provides actionable insights and customized solutions by compiling, analyzing, and distilling data to accelerate the energy transition. PV Intel has gathered a network of experts to share their solar development knowledge and experience through its Solar Development Training consulting service. Skilled industry professionals, such as licensed electrical and civil engineers, provide the training and documents needed to develop solar projects at scale. PV Intel also provides the knowledge and tools to find a suitable parcel of land to develop your solar project from the very start.
Part of the training includes working through a real project with the potential to evolve into an actual solar development opportunity.
The focus here is on solar PV projects that are sized in the 250kW to 7MW range, which generally involves an investment of between $500,000 to $10,000,000. The US will deploy an estimated 950 million solar panels by 2030 as part of the $370 billion allocated for renewables and climate resilience in the recent Inflation Reduction Act.
“One of the biggest things that distinguishes our training curriculum is that we focus on a smaller, more manageable size range for projects.” According to PV Intel’s CEO, Jason O’Leary. “This entry point into the market is more approachable and agile, compared to larger utility-scale projects in the 200 MW+ range, for example. Those projects are already well represented by the very big players. Part of democratizing the process of energy transitions is offering affordable, reliable tools and skills to entrepreneurs and other smaller investors who want to get started in the solar power market, but just don’t know how.”
Ideal candidates for the training program include entrepreneurs, land owners, land professionals, lawyers, real estate developers, financiers, investors.
The PV Intel team has more than 40 years of combined professional experience in disciplines ranging from construction and development to media and communications – all focused exclusively on the solar industry. The training experience is customized to provide exactly what is needed to get started developing projects in the solar industry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/02/managing-uncertainty-in-the-solar-module-supply/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",Managing uncertainty in the solar module supply,"As 2022 draws to a close, the industry is still riding the “solar coaster” of ongoing policy issues in the United States. In March of this year, the Department of Commerce announced it would investigate the circumvention case brought forth by Auxin Solar. Within one month, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reported that 70% of projects had been canceled or delayed, directly impacting the more than 230,000 Americans currently employed by the solar industry at more than 10,000 companies. Investors were also concerned; in 2021, the solar industry generated nearly $33 billion of private investment in the American economy.
Fortunately, in June, some relief came to the industry when President Biden announced a temporary moratorium, creating a 24-month PV module supply bridge for developers as domestic manufacturing scales. However, the months of uncertainty had already pushed developers to look for new sources of module supply, causing another concern: quality assurance for these new products. In a tighter procurement environment, it’s critical that as developers look to secure modules, the process for maintaining quality in the supply chain is maintained.
By August, the passage of the historic Inflation Reduction Act brought a new wave of optimism to the industry, along with investments of approximately $369 billion for clean energy projects. The law extended and expanded the solar Investment Tax Credit from 26% to 30%, while also providing tax credits for stand-alone energy storage projects. However, according to Wood Mackenzie, the industry isn’t expecting to feel the impacts of these investments until 2024. In the meantime, solar project developers may be wondering how to best procure high-quality PV modules for their near-term projects.
Below, PVEL and PI Berlin, both members of the Kiwa Group, outline the steps that companies can take to ensure that the modules they are deploying in their projects meet quality standards for the U.S. market. These steps are best practices when working with established suppliers, and are especially critical when working with new market entrants to the U.S. PV module supply landscape.
Minimum requirements for U.S. market entry
For EPCs and developers on the hunt to find new module suppliers, there are several steps that procurement managers need to consider before committing to an order. To begin with, they should have a clear understanding of the minimum bankability requirements for market entry into the United States. These go beyond basic product certification requirements and are more focused on what independent engineers and project investors are focused on for acceptable due diligence.
First, module manufacturers should submit their products to a suite of comprehensive testing with an accredited lab. PVEL’s Product Qualification Program (PQP) is a series of extended reliability and performance tests that have become the de facto standard set of tests used to evaluate PV modules for downstream market acceptance. Each PV module undergoes a sequence of testing that has been designed by PVEL based on regular feedback from the market including downstream buyers, independent engineers, manufacturers, and leading research institutions around the world.
The PQP process begins with a factory production witness of the test samples to be shipped to PVEL. While onsite, factory inspectors will oversee the production of each sample module, from the opening of raw materials process to wrapping the completed pallet in tamper-proof tape.  This is done to ensure the components actually used to build the modules submitted for testing are independently verified, which is not a requirement for certification testing. Once the samples are received at PVEL’s labs, they are evaluated across a series of tests, including damp heat, thermal cycling, mechanical stress, hail stress, potential-induced degradation and other tests to identify known module failure modes.  Ultimately, the PQP reports help inform the bankability reports that developers need in order to access and optimize financing for their projects.
Second, it’s important that the buyer requires independent audits of the factory or factories that will produce the modules for specific projects.  These are often undertaken by factory inspectors such as PI Berlin who work on behalf of the buyer.  The audits ensure that the quality of the manufacturing process meets well defined expectations before production commences.  Then a combination of regular production supervision, module inspection and testing ensure that quality expectations are maintained throughout the production build and before the modules leave the factory. A key aspect of this work involves checking that the components used to build the modules for the project are the same as those used for the extended reliability and performance testing.
How to handle module acceptance at the project site
After modules have shipped and arrive onsite, service providers such as PI Berlin and PVEL can assist developers with on-site module acceptance. Module acceptance testing can help verify modules have not been damaged in transit from the factory to the project site. By testing a statistically significant sample from every week’s delivery as a recurring service throughout the delivery schedule, developers can have better insights into potential issues before they ultimately accept and install the modules.
Don’t underestimate small changes
Results from over ten years of testing at PVEL across 400+ bills of materials (BOMs) show that specific components can dramatically impact product performance and reliability. It is therefore recommended that developers and module suppliers proactively communicate to prevent potential issues. If a supplier asks to change a BOM component, the developer can require additional testing per PVEL guidelines to ensure that additional risk is being mitigated.
With policy uncertainty continuing to dominate the solar industry, these tools are critical to help buyers evaluate the quality, reliability, and performance of the PV modules produced for a given project. By working with technical advisory professionals like PVEL and PI Berlin, developers can ensure that quality is maintained even in the face of a shifting supply environment.
 Tristan Erion-Lorico is vice president of sales and marketing at PVEL  He has over 15 years of solar and electrical industry experience that spans manufacturing, testing, project development and operations and maintenance. As vice president of sales and marketing at PV Evolution Labs (PVEL), Tristan oversees PVEL’s commercial activities including collaborating with PV module buyers, investors and manufacturers to develop innovative test programs for product qualification. 
Ian Gregory is managing director at PI Berlin North America. He manages a multi-disciplinary team that assists banks, investors, developers, and utilities in assessing and managing solar power equipment quality and performance. With over 19 years in the solar industry working in a mix of technology development, product management, marketing and sales roles with major companies, Ian has gained a wealth of experience that can be leveraged the company’s clients. Ian founded SolarBuyer in 2011 and successfully grew the company until its takeover by PI Berlin in 2018 and the subsequent acquisition of PI Berlin by KIWA in 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/02/commerce-department-ad-cvd-ruling-calls-for-continued-tariffs-on-solar-imports/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",Commerce Department AD/CVD ruling calls for continued tariffs on solar imports,"Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a preliminary determination that certain companies in Southeast Asia are circumventing Anti-Dumping/Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD) imposed on Chinese solar products.
This is in response to the AD/CVD case filed in February by Auxin Solar (a small U.S.-based panel assembler) against Malaysia, Thailand, and now Cambodia. This filing came just months after the Commerce Department tossed out an earlier similar request by an anonymous group of solar companies that sought tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules. About 80% of US crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. Auxin claims Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to these countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
“We’re obviously disappointed that Commerce elected to exceed its legal authority. As a basic fact, solar cell and module manufacturing greatly exceed the anticircumvention statute’s ‘minor or insignificant processing’ limitation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
At the time of the filing, SEIA estimated that the implementation of AD/CV tariffs would result in the loss of 16 GW of new solar installations, a figure which represents more than half of what was installed in the U.S. last year. In addition to project delays and cancellations, SEIA estimated that enacted tariffs could put put 70,000 U.S. solar jobs at risk.

Hopper said that the only good news about today’s announcement is that Commerce didn’t target all imports from the subject countries. “Nonetheless, this decision will strand billions of dollars’ worth of American clean energy investments and result in the significant loss of good-paying American clean energy jobs. While President Biden was wise to provide a two-year window before the tariff implementation, that window is quickly closing, and two years is simply not enough time to establish manufacturing supply chains that will meet U.S. solar demand,” she said.
Whether or not tariffs have ever worked to increase domestic production is a “question of folklore,” writes John Fitzgerald Weaver in a recent pv magazine usa article. The article states that data shows that the United States saw paltry amounts of solar capacity growth preceding the Inflation Reduction Act. Immediately after the IRA act was signed, the industry was booming.
Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance, pointed out that the Commerce decision makes it clear that the solar supply chain is deeply challenged. “We need to accelerate investments in solar manufacturing in low-carbon economies to build out a better solar supply chain,” he said. “PV purchasers like Lightsource bp, D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments and Silicon Ranch are demonstrating the important role buyers play in accelerating the build out of this more diverse, resilient solar supply chain. Buyers can send a powerful market signal through long-term supply agreements with low-carbon manufacturers to help ensure the development of robust PV manufacturing capacity for the future,” Parr said.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s recent, U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmarks, With Minimum Sustainable Price Analysis: Q1 2022 show that prices soared throughout the U.S. economy between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022 due to disruptions including the AD/CVD filing. Reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that while developers had planned to install 17.8 GW in the first half of 2022, only 4.2 GW was installed and brought online—pointing to module supply challenges, which led to cancellations and delays.
“This is a mistake we will have to deal with for the next several years,” Hopper concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/02/cep-renewables-and-cs-energy-construct-largest-north-american-landfill-solar-project-at-25-6-mw/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW JERSEY",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",CEP Renewables and CS Energy construct largest North American landfill solar project at 25.6 MW,"CEP Renewables and CS Energy announced the completion of what is reportedly the largest North America landfill solar project, in Mount Olive, NJ, at 25.6 MW(DC).
Located at the former Combe Fille North Landfill Superfund site, the large brownfield solar project will provide the township of Mount Olive with close to $2.3 million in past tax revenues while creating a future revenue-generating renewable energy asset.
With 10,000 closed landfill sites in the U.S., there has been an 80% increase in the number of landfill solar project developments at brownfield sites in recent years, according to the EPA.
“This is our eighth project with CEP Renewables, our seventh project with Lindsay Precast and our fourteenth landfill solar project with Terrasmart. Our strong partnerships with each of these industry leaders also enabled us to efficiently deliver this high quality landfill solar project, which will provide significant financial and environmental benefits to this community long-term,” said Mike Dillon, director of operations at CS Energy.
According to New Jersey’s Environmental Protection website, the capped Mount Olive landfill is a 65-acre brownfield site that ceased accepting waste in 1981.
The project was developed by CEP Renewables and CS Energy. Lindsay Precast supplied steel skids for the project and Terrasmart supplied its Glide fixed-tilt, ballasted mounted rack systems.
NJR Clean Energy Ventures, a subsidiary of investor-owned utility New Jersey Resources, will own and operate the solar facility under a long-term agreement.
Besides its size and local tax benefits, the Mount Olive project is noteworthy because it involved the purchase of the landfill by way of the redevelopment and tax lien foreclosure process.  As a result, the project won the 2021 Award for Innovation in Governance from the New Jersey League of Municipalities.
Under New Jersey’s 2019 Energy Master Plan, the Garden State outlined a goal of producing 100% renewable energy assets by 2050 with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 2006 levels.  The state identified 30 prospective and development-stage brownfield landfill solar sites at the time of the master plan.
CEP Renewables has constructed 141.5 MW of solar projects to date in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  Mount Olive is the company’s second New Jersey landfill solar project after the 13 MW South Brunswick project was installed in mid-2018.
CS Energy, an American Securities portfolio company, has installed about 180.1 MW of landfill solar projects to date around the Northeast U.S. out of a 1.5 GW operational solar portfolio.
Landfill solar
Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) developed a comprehensive report, “The Future of Landfills is Bright,” designed for elected officials, policymakers, planners, and developers, to learn how landfill solar can be part of a broader clean energy and land-use strategy to achieve ambitious community-wide climate, sustainability, and environmental justice goals.
RMI said there are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the country. It said more than 63 GW of solar power plant capacity could be located at less than half of US landfills, generating 83 terawatt hours of electricity each year across all 50 states. The plants also could generate more than $6.6 billion annually in electricity revenue. 
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, around 428 MW of utility-scale landfill solar across 126 projects had been installed at the end of 2019. Notably, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are home to 73% of all US utility-scale landfill solar projects.

The two companies are working together with an EPC contractor to finalize the delivery schedules for the first approximate 650 MW project in Texas.
“Solar Proponent recognizes that our superior tracking technology is not only ideal for hurricane zones around the Texas Gulf Coast but also has a long track record of zero wind damage in areas with up to 105 mph wind speeds,” said Philipp Klemm, CEO of Ideematec North America. “We look forward to delivering the first project and working with Solar Proponent to supply GWs of our L:TEC product into the Texas region.”
Phoenix, Arizona-based Ideematec’s tracker is powered by a patented decoupled drive technology and locked sprocket system. Along with safeTrack Horizon, Ideematec offers both 1P and 2P, and capacity from one to 12 strings on one tracker.
Last year its trackers were chosen for use in a 100 MW community solar portfolio in New York State.  The trackers were chosen for their resilience in withstanding upstate New York’s extreme weather environments, streamlined installation process, and bankability, according to Osea Nelson, partner at LightEdison. Eco Engineering/LightEdison led the portfolio’s procurement efforts as a joint venture in partnership with Source Renewables.
Ideematec was founded in Germany in 2003, after entering that market with a rooftop mounting system. Eighteen years later, and the company reports that it supplied the tracker for the world’s largest 2P system. The company has over 50 approved patents and over 3.5 GW of trackers installed worldwide. The company has also adapted the Horizon L:TEC tracker specifically for agricultural applications, with a design that can be adjusted for height and rotation. The Tracker’s height can be increased to a maximum of approximately 11 feet, and rotation can be increased to 70 degrees to allow extra space for machinery to pass through.
The title was amended on 12/5/2022 to reflect the fact that the company is not providing trackers to the full 7 GW pipeline, but is supporting 650 MW.

The company said economic conditions surrounding revenue from Europe and China could have resulted in an additional $3 million revenue boost without the stronger dollar denomination.
Despite a higher third quarter, the integrated solar company lowered its Q4 22 guidance to $44 million to $49 million, compared to the market consensus of $73 million, reflecting recent acquisitions of European assets taken on its balance sheet.
After installing a 10.2 MW Hungarian project in October, ReneSola decided to withhold 110 MW of Poland and Hungarian solar project sales in Q4 22, which includes notice to proceed stage assets, forgoing $20 million of revenue in Q4 22 based on the company’s European shift to an IPP business model.
The company expects to energize the remainder of the 100 MW European portfolio in Q3 23.
Quarterly Activity:
In September, ReneSola closed the acquisition of a 50 MW UK solar farm portfolio from P&T Global Renewable Energy for $41 million. The acquisition establishes ReneSola as a European independent power producer. In October, ReneSola announced the launch  of a 10.2 MW utility-scale solar project Csomád 1-2 in Hungary. In the same month, the company acquired Emeren, an Italy-based solar and storage developer, for $16 million in an all-cash transaction. The target has a 2.5 GW project development pipeline.
Also in October, ReneSola closed on the sale of a 70 MW portfolio of Pennsylvania solar projects to asset manager AB CarVal Investors.
Full-Year Guidance:
Due to its European IPP shift, ReneSola reduced its full year 2022 revenue range to $85 million to $90 million, from prior quarterly estimates of $100 million to $120 million for full year 2022.
ReneSola’s management highlighted a 4 GW portfolio of deploying mid to late-stage projects in 2023, an increase from its current pipeline of 3 GW, driven by European growth.
The company said it plans to sell the majority of its 165 MW Chinese operating portfolio in 2023.
With a $305.5 million market capitalization, ReneSola shares trade at $4.55 today, down from $6.06 per share a year ago.  Since going public in 2008, ReneSola has shifted from being a local maker of solar wafers to an international solar IPP developer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/02/artificial-intelligence-helps-solar-to-shine/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",Artificial intelligence helps solar to shine,"Far removed from dystopian sci-fi, artificial intelligence (AI) now serves as an omnipresent facilitator across industries and markets. While we may not think about it, AI and machine-learning algorithms are already integral to common daily activities, but intelligent technology is also very much at work on a larger scale.  
The potential for AI in the green energy industry is rapidly gaining momentum. As another year of extreme weather is hitting the world, the urgency of stemming the tide is profound. While there is no single solution to the problem, maximizing clean energy production and storage is one of the things that can, hopefully, help us protect our planet.  
Renewable energy sources such as solar are complex and unreliable due to constantly changing weather conditions, but AI can be a force for good in this industry in particular, helping remove obstacles and unleash the true power of solar.   
Solar forecasting 
In 2018, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the central entity responsible for predicting the country’s electricity production, began allowing national solar farms to “self-forecast.” A number of large-scale solar sites chose to partner with Solcast, an Australian solar forecasting vendor that offers a model featuring an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)—a complex, trained and multi-layered computing system with an architecture directly inspired by the biological brain—to predict the hourly solar power generation of a given photovoltaic (PV) module. The sophisticated Solcast satellite “nowcasting” system detects and predicts weather and sky characteristics through geo-codes, quality controls, solar irradiance estimates, real-time solar farm power data feeds and ground-based sky images of local cloud coverage. The system produces more than 600 million calculated forecasts per hour that are shared within seconds with customers. This forecasting approach is paying off for customers with a 10 to 15 percent improvement over the previously-relied-upon AEMO predictive models.  
Asset maintenance 
Another field where AI turns out to be very useful is asset maintenance, which includes inspection and cleaning. Traditionally, solar farm maintenance would require a team of workers who would manually inspect the panels. The process can easily become tedious and expensive and cannot be consistently accurate or performed daily for an entire deployment. Operators have turned to AI to speed up the process and improve accuracy, thus reducing the costs of quality control of entire facilities. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)—or drones—are the most effective and common tools used by AI in solar to collect data and deliver aerial imagery. The captured images are then run through a deep learning algorithm trained to identify and classify visible signs of defects from a large quantity of previously processed datasets of labeled images.   
Soiling mitigation solutions 
Cloudy weather is not the only natural cause that can hamper solar energy production. “Soiling,” which happens when  dust, bird droppings, pollen and other particles accumulate and harden on PV panel arrays, hinders the penetration of sunlight and can sometimes even damage components. A recent study estimated that the global cost of soiling could rise to over $6 billion by 2023. Usually, solar farm operators would turn to soiling stations to solve this problem using a comparative energy-loss measurement method. However, these stations can lead to unnecessary cleaning costs due to inaccurately measured soil levels. Today, AI-powered platforms can make use of the vast data streams that flow from solar panels to determine when and how panels should be cleaned helping increase efficiency and reduce costs.    
Thanks to AI, the creation and use of sustainable energy has never been in a better position to proliferate. But mostly, these examples illustrate how AI can increase the reliability of solar energy and make it possible for more farms to operate successfully to help mitigate fossil energy production and climate change.

Heat pumps are already cost-competitive with gas boilers in some mature heating markets, according to the “Future of Heat Pumps” report, which was recently published by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
“Based on average 2021 equipment prices and [projected] fuel prices … a new heat pump to heat an average home in a cold climate is cheaper than a natural gas condensing boiler in most of the main heating markets, often even without subsidy,” said the report.
The United States, Canada, Japan, Italy and China are among the countries in which unsubsidized heat pumps are already cost-competitive with gas boilers, according to the IEA. However, in markets such as the United Kingdom and Germany, subsidies are still required to make them cost-competitive.
“Even where the cost of a heat pump over its lifetime is already the cheapest heating option, financial incentives, including grants and low‐interest loans, may still be needed to reduce the initial cost burden, which may deter the building owner from installing a heat pump in the first place,” the report said.
The IEA found that financial incentives for heat pumps are already available in more than 30 countries, which together account for more than 70% of current heating demand. The agency said it expects heat pump sales to reach new highs by 2030, after growing by nearly 15% in 2021. Last year, heat pump sales rose by around 35% in the European Union, followed by North America at around 15%, Japan and South Korea at around 13% each, and China at around 12%.
However, heat pumps accounted for just 10% of buildings’ global heating needs in 2021, according to the report. The current total installed capacity of heat pumps in residential and non-residential buildings is more than 1,000 GW, with nearly half of that capacity installed in North America. Europe has the second highest installed capacity, followed by Japan, South Korea, and China. The rest of the world combined has less installed capacity than any of these countries.
“Many units are used in mild-to-warm climates, where they are used primarily for cooling yet still represent the primary heating source (for a few months of the year),” the report said. “However, the penetration of heat pumps today is highest in the coldest parts of Europe, meeting 60% of total buildings heating needs in Norway and over 40% in Sweden and Finland thanks to long-standing policy support.”
Heat pump sales in Europe could rise from 2 million in 2021 to 7 million by 2030 if governments succeed in hitting their emission-reduction targets and energy security goals, said the IEA. The region is expected to reach almost 500 GW of heat pump capacity in buildings by 2030. The agency forecasts China’s installed capacity to see the strongest growth between 2021 and 2030, overtaking Europe as the second largest heat pump market by 2030. North America is expected to remain the market leader until then.
