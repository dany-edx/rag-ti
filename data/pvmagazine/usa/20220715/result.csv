According to constellation, the PPA is for 78 MW of energy from the 600 MW Mammoth Central solar project, the third and final phase of Doral Renewables LLC’s Mammoth Solar project in Starke and Pulaski counties in Indiana. PNC will receive roughly 148 million kWh of energy per year, which it will use to power nearly 50% of its legacy operations in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, District of Columbia, and parts of Illinois.
“This collaboration with Constellation is an exciting next step toward meeting our environmental goals of reaching 100% renewable purchased electricity by 2025 and reducing carbon emissions and energy use 75% by 2035,” said Kate Zettl, vice president and energy manager with PNC Bank’s Realty Services.
In 2021, PNC shares that it purchased enough renewable energy and affiliated credits to meet 46% of the company’s purchased electricity use.
In total, the Mammoth solar project, which also includes the Mammoth North, Mammoth Solar I, and Mammoth Solar II installations, will amount to 1.3 GW once the project is completed. The Mammoth Central project is expected to be completed in late 2024.
In addition to PNC, Constellation announced in June that Bank of America signed on for a 15-year, 160 MW power and renewable energy credit supply agreement with Mammoth Central. That deal is expected to cover 17% of Bank of America’s global annual energy consumption.
Constellation says that it has two unannounced PPAs remaining for the Mammoth Central project, with these agreements totaling 62 MW. These purchases in total will cover 300 MW of the Mammoth facility’s planned 600 MW of capacity.
Mammoth Solar I, meanwhile, has a long-term PPA in place with utility AEP Energy, a unit of American Electric Power for the entirety of its 480 MW capacity. Mammoth Solar 1 is expected to reach commercial operation by the second quarter of 2023. It will sell energy into the PJM market.

The comments respond to EIA’s proposed three-year extension and changes to its Electric Power and Renewable Electricity Surveys. The two groups approved of EIA’s proposed changes, and said EIA should also provide data that would speed adoption of renewables and help meet federal and state climate goals.
“We hope EIA will recognize the opportunity before them and consider changes that would ultimately improve transparency and speed solar adoption,” said David Gahl, executive director of the Solar and Storage Industries Institute. He encouraged industry partners to “weigh in” by the comment deadline of July 22.
Interconnection delays for both large-scale and distributed projects are a “major roadblock” for the solar and storage industries, said the comments, calling for detailed information on interconnection queues and timelines, and data on upgrade costs for all projects, including projects that are withdrawn after receiving a cost estimate.
EIA should also standardize and aggregate interconnection queue reporting across regional grid operators and utilities, the groups said, to aid transparency and help federal and state regulators as they work to streamline interconnection application and approval processes.
To aid hosting capacity analysis for additional grid resources, the comments called for monthly reporting on the locations and characteristics of both transmission lines and substations, and distribution lines and substations.
Because information on utility system outages would aid storage providers in adding storage where it is most needed, distribution utilities should report on system outages and “close calls,” when system outages were prevented through demand response calls, the comments said, noting that in most states, this information is collected by state public utility commissions and “should be readily available.”
To illuminate manufacturing, assembly and supply chains for solar and storage, EIA should collect capacity and production data for silicon metal, polysilicon, ingots, wafers, inverters, and rechargeable battery cells, the comments said.
EIA should also publish more of the information it now collects on shipments of cells and modules, as currently “so much of the information is redacted” that the product of the survey “sheds very little light on the key issues.”
To assess employment, EIA should collect and publish data on the number of employees at all generating plants, “not simply renewables projects,” during both construction and operations phases, the comments said. EIA should also publish the data on plant costs that it already collects, to “greatly improve” transparency and utility accountability in regulatory proceedings.
As location-specific data on the usage of electric vehicle fast chargers could help guide the buildout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, EIA should collect data on electricity sales to EV fast chargers, ideally by location, the comments said.
To help policymakers better assess the evolution of the distributed energy system, utilities should report data on each system or project interconnected to their distribution system, the comments said, noting that such detail is already collected and published by many states at the zip code level.
EIA has broad statutory authority to collect data on energy in the United States, said David Gahl.

The goal of the RFI is to choose a selection of projects that will chart a course to guide future projects, as they seek to navigate the long and complex federal, state, and local rules that regulate siting and grid interconnection.
The renewables program – part of the RE-Powering America program – has received $500 million in funding as part of the 2021 Infrastructure Plan. If you’ve got good opinions on how this program should be run, with the program number being DE-FOA-0002811, please register and submit via the link.
The RFI noted a recently launched Environmental Protection Agency tool, the Repowering Mapper, to share screened sites with renewable potential. The tool has a collection of 43,476 sites from the EPA, including Superfunds and Brownfields, as well as 147,500 sites across twenty two state programs. 60 GW of landfill solar potential is also on the list.

The tool suggests that across all sites, mines and non-mine sites, there are hundreds of gigawatts of “technical” solar possibility. The document describing the tool says that these technical maximum potentials are based on land availability, not on items such as market conditions, interconnection capacity, or state programs.
For example:
The filter tool allows users to specify the type and location of solar projects, and includes more specific information about each of the individual sites. Filters allow users to determine the distance from each site to the nearest roads, railways, transmission lines and substations, as well as the voltages of said electrical gear.

When filtering for mines, the online tool suggests that as many as 541 utility scale (>5 MW) solar facilities could be built, as well as 7,182 distributed (<5MW) systems. The size of the potential systems range from small rooftops systems to large scale ground mounts of hundreds of acres.
The EPA’s Repowering Mapper factsheet noted that the Elizabeth Mine Superfund Solar Project has been a success of the solar mining program. The project was built on a site with ongoing mining since the 1800s, which had polluted water sources above and below ground.
The 7 MW facility, completed in 2017 using approximately 20,000 individual 350 watt Hyundai solar modules, cost $65 million to construct and is located on 45 acres of land. The higher than average priced facility included 10 miles of fiber optic cable to allow the utility to control the system remotely, an upgrade of four miles of utility power lines, and an upgrade to the regional substation.
The mine has ongoing monitoring and cleaning activities shared via the website of the local town of Strafford.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/15/partnership-formed-to-develop-pv-integrated-steel-for-active-green-buildings/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 15, 2022",Partnership formed to develop PV integrated steel for active green buildings,"Tata Steel UK and Swansea University announced the two have entered a three-year research collaboration to test the ability of buildings to generate, store, and release their own supply of energy.
The project leverages the concept of “active buildings,” bringing together energy generation and energy efficiency of many varieties. Buildings account for 76% of all electricity use and 40% of all primary energy use in the U.S.
One such element of these active buildings is Tata Steel’s micro-perforated steel, which is designed for the south wall of buildings. Called a “transpired solar collector” the pre-finished steel has enhanced thermal absorption properties, which heats the air outside the building’s steel “skin.” The warmed air is pulled in through a ventilation fan and fed into the building for heating.
Along with micro-perforated steel, the research collaboration is exploring ways to integrate perovskite solar cells in active buildings. Perovskite solar cells are flexible, and can be printed, meaning they can be directly deposited onto coated steel.
“This technology will help us tackle the energy crisis and the climate crisis at the same time. The future is about solar energy technology being built in, not added on afterwards. These printable solar cells can be built into the fabric of our homes, shops and offices, allowing them to generate the power they need, and more. We know the concept works as we’ve demonstrated it in our Active Buildings in sunny Swansea. This new collaboration with Tata Steel will enable us to develop its potential more quickly, identifying new types of steel products that actively work to generate electricity.” Dave Worsley, head of materials science and engineering at Swansea University. 
Perovskites are highly efficient, requiring less energy than traditional silicon solar cells to produce. They are lighter and cheaper than silicon cells, but degrade more rapidly, so research teams across the globe are actively looking for solutions for improving their stability.
“Getting this technology into widespread use could hardly be more timely. In the UK and elsewhere it can reduce reliance on fossil fuel energy such as imported gas. It would also ease the pressure on national electricity networks, for example by enabling us to charge up electric vehicles with surplus energy generated by our homes,” said Worsley.
“We are buoyant with the possibilities that the perovskite technology brings to the table – especially in integration to the building and construction solutions – across different value streams in Tata Steel,” said Sumitesh Das, R&D director at Tata Steel UK.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/15/californians-will-still-get-burned-under-solar-killer-proposal/,"EMPLOYMENT,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,NET METERING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"JULY 15, 2022",Californians will still get burned under solar killer proposal,"Once again, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is trying to kill off net metering, which compensates owners of rooftop solar energy arrays for the local clean electricity they generate and export to the grid. The CPUC’s latest proposal, dubbed NEM 3.0, replaces a proposal that received an avalanche of community criticism earlier this year. Now, the CPUC is back with what it is advertising as a new approach, but it’s still a threat.
Don’t be fooled, NEM 3.0 is another attack on net metering in California, designed to further enrich the state’s corporate utilities. SoCal Edison, SDG&E and PG&E see the value of our solar sector, and they do not want to share that value with everyday Californians. We must not allow utilities to colonize our emerging clean energy future —  to control our solar energy — by hoarding profits and power.
Utilities know that if they can game the system so that they are the only ones who can afford to generate solar energy, we Californians will have to keep paying our rising utility bills and covering the costs of their infrastructure failures. Just like the CPUC’s previous proposal, this plan would be disastrous for locally produced solar energy and harm people of color and other vulnerable communities who want access to local solar and jobs.
The CPUC must stop trying to kill off rooftop solar by making it too expensive for average people and completely out of reach for frontline communities in particular. The CPUC must stop its false claims that frontline communities are overburdened with energy costs because of “cost shifts” from utility-free solar generation.
Ratepayers are indeed overburdened, but it’s not our neighbors with solar who are at fault. We are overburdened by corporate utilities that pile additional costs on ratepayers, from bailouts for utility-caused wildfires, to hefty pay and benefits for corporate heads. These utilities prioritize profits over managing their own transmission infrastructure and adapting to the demands of a clean-energy future.
As a longtime environmental health and climate justice organizer, I bear witness to the horrors of families and workers who have borne the brunt of environmental racism. From gas-fired power plants to waste incineration, we pay for dirty energy with exorbitant utility bills, with our health, and even with our lives. While we struggle to make ends meet, the utilities have no qualms about leaving our communities in the dark.
I urge the CPUC to expand net-metering and ensure equitable access to clean, renewable solar energy for all Californians. Frontline communities in particular want the opportunity to produce a healthier utility system that also helps build local wealth and clean energy jobs. It can do this by incentivizing and expanding community-owned and community-based models like shared solar, virtual net energy metering, and solar cooperatives. We also need microgrids of island-able solar generation, and energy storage that can keep the power on during crises, blackouts and power shut-offs.
We refuse to continue to prop up the failed corporate-controlled dirty electricity sector —  the same sector that has perpetuated environmental injustices that make us sick, drain our bank accounts, and sometimes even kill us through pollution, utility fires, and the growing climate crisis.
California must ramp up incentives that advance local clean energy solutions and undo the legacy of environmental injustice. Our low-income communities of color are not sacrifice zones for pollution, utility wildfires and climate chaos. Nor are they bargaining chips for multi-billion-dollar corporations.
I urge the CPUC to do the right thing and scrap NEM 3.0. Locally generated clean energy is true clean energy. We demand clean power by the people, for the people.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/15/doe-invests-56-million-in-solar-manufacturing-and-recycling/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 15, 2022",DOE invests $56 million in solar manufacturing and recycling,"Through the Department of Energy (DOE) the Biden Administration has announced a commitment of $56 million to spur domestic manufacturing and recycling of solar modules, with DOE announcing another $18 million to be directed toward overcoming challenges to commercialization for department-backed technologies.
According to DOE, the manufacturing and recycling funding is split between two initiatives: the FY22 Photovoltaics (PV) Research and Development funding opportunity and the FY22 Solar Manufacturing Incubator funding opportunity.
The Research and Development funding opportunity will make available $29 million to support projects that increase the reuse and recycling of solar technologies, develop PV module designs that reduce manufacturing costs, and advance the manufacturing of PV cells made from perovskites. $10 million of the project’s total financing will come from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, with these funds to be directed toward the recycling aspect of the program.
The remaining $26 million in funding will go toward the Manufacturing Incubator and will support projects aimed at commercializing new technologies that can expand private investment in US solar manufacturing. While any projects that ready new technologies and manufacturing processes for commercialization, DOE places a specific focus on boosting thin-film module manufacturing made from cadmium telluride.
“This administration wants to seize US leadership in solar energy, from manufacturing to recycling, and that means making the right investments to ensure these technologies are made right here at home,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. “Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, DOE is able to invest in our nation’s innovators so they can improve manufacturing and strengthen the domestic solar supply chain—lowering energy bills for Americans and businesses and driving toward an equitable clean energy future.”
Both of these funding avenues take a heavy focus on the commercialization of technology breakthroughs, a considerable hurdle when bringing innovation out of the lab. In additional support of this critical step in product development, DOE is investing $18 million in funding through the Technology Commercialization Fund for seven proposed National Laboratory projects focused on easing commercialization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/15/tigo-energy-files-patent-lawsuit-against-sma-solar-in-the-us/,"BUSINESS,LEGAL,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 15, 2022",Tigo Energy files patent lawsuit against SMA Solar in the US,"From pv magazine global
US-based power optimizer manufacturer Tigo Energy has filed a patent lawsuit against SMA Solar Technology America LLC, the US unit of German PV inverter maker SMA, at the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
The lawsuit is related to six alleged infringement claims regarding the US patents 8,823,218, 8,933,321, 9,584,021, 9,966,848, 10,256,770, and 10,333,405.
“The complaint is focused on various systems and methods used in module-level rapid shutdown units that are attached to photovoltaic panels,” Tige Energy said in a statement released, noting that the complaint alleges that SMA and some of its suppliers copied Tigo innovations included in Tigo Flex MLPE solutions, which comply with rapid shutdown requirements of the NFPA 70 – the US National Electrical Code (NEC).
“This is not about all SMA’s units worldwide, but exclusively about SMA America LLC,” a spokesperson from the German inverter maker told pv magazine.” The company does not want to comment on the details of an ongoing legal dispute, but points out that the US Patent Office had previously launched an investigation into some of the Tigo patents related to the new lawsuit.
The SunSpec Alliance, a US group of energy industry participants pursuing standards for Distributed Energy Resource (DER), had previously  challenged the validity of two of Tigo Energy’s patents in July 2021. It applied to the US Patent Office for an inter partes review (IPR).
SunSpec’s filings challenged the validity of certain claims in US Patent Nos. 8,933,321 and 10,256,770, which also appear in the lawsuit against SMA’s US subsidiary, and in which Tigo previously alleged patent infringements against APsystems. Tigo has claimed that these patents are relevant to the SunSpec Rapid Shutdown specification. However, SunSpec considers this allegation to be “unsubstantiated and inaccurate” and decided to file the IPR filings to defend itself against Tigo’s allegations.
The US Patent and Trademark Office began the process of reviewing and reexamining the patentability of Tigo’s ‘321 and ‘770 patents in late January. A hearing is planned for this November.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/15/accelerating-the-clean-energy-transition-requires-national-strategy/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,EMPLOYMENT,EV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 15, 2022",Accelerating the clean energy transition requires national strategy,"Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) released the report “Realizing America’s Clean Energy Opportunity,” which describes the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that America has to promote and invest in the clean energy transition. The report outlines a four-pronged approach of demand-pull, de-risking, infrastructure deployment, and supply chain resilience, and it also proposes a strategy in which development of a clean energy supply chain serves to empower regional communities.
The transition that we are seeing now is real. According to the report, in 2021, global investment in the energy transition stood at $784.4 billion, more than 25 times what it was in 2004. One thing that has changed is the diversity of the investments. Where it was originally in the power sector, today growing markets include the transportation sector, heating technologies, energy storage, green hydrogen, and more. In just about that same time period, global solar power–generating capacity increased from 5.5 GW in 2005 to 789 GW by the end of 2020.
And while we look back to 2004 for this data, the energy transition began long ago. The RMI report says the fight against climate change began with Germany’s feed-in tariff program back in 1990. Fast forward to 2004, and Germany accounted for two-thirds of global demand for solar panels and thus began what the report calls “the economically significant” market for a clean energy technology.
The report contends that we are faced with a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to make investments that will develop technologies, infrastructure, and products that lead to good jobs, empowered communities and a strong, resilient supply chain.
A recent study estimates that this transition will create positive gross domestic product (GDP) growth in every region of the country and more than $3 trillion in new economic value. “Clean energy is likely to become so cheap, in fact, that total expenditure needed to reach net zero will likely be a fraction of what the United States has historically spent on energy.
Regional effects
The energy transition is happening at different speeds in different regions of the United States, which can be an advantage because different regions can focus on specific clean energy technologies. For example, the Atlantic region will benefit from investments in offshore wind. The Midwest region, known previously for automotive manufacturing, will benefit from investments in EV and battery manufacturing. The Gulf Coast may become a hydrogen hub, etc.
Infrastructure
While there is strong agreement about what infrastructure is needed to support the clean energy transition, there is much debate over how and where it should be built. But in addition to building new infrastructure, the report points out that if we can clear some of the regulatory red tape, the clean energy transition offers an opportunity to consider our buildings, where people live, and how we travel. For example emerging technologies can help revitalize cities and transform urban landscapes while addressing cost of living.
Domestic supply chain      
The recent upheavals caused by COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have made us more aware of the tenuous supply chain and the need for domestic manufacturing in order to ensure resiliency as we begin to deploy clean energy technologies at scale. The report acknowledges that none of the supply chain will be 100% domestic and “nor should they be if the cost competitiveness that drives clean energy deployment is to be maintained”. The steps laid out include leveraging existing national manufacturing programs, expanding R&D, investing in workforce development, creating new public-private partnerships, and establishing regional clean energy industrial clusters. While boosting domestic manufacturing is important, the report notes that procuring materials or products from at-risk areas increases supply chain vulnerabilities. It cites as an example the DOE’s aim to eliminate the use of cobalt in lithium-ion batteries by 2030, reducing manufacturers’ reliance on imports from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where child labor is an issue. On the flip side, the US is looking at the strengths in its supply chain and investing in those areas. Steel, aluminum and glass, as well as cadmium telluride and pervoskites are all manufactured in the United States and used in concentrated solar power (CSP) and thin film solar technologies, which the DOE has made core priorities.
