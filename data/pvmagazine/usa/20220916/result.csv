The merger brings official non-profit status to SolarRecycle, a website that was launched in 2021 as a clearinghouse to share resources about reuse, resale, and recycling of end-of-life solar equipment.
“Joining forces with The Atmosphere Conservancy allows us access to greater resources and a platform for future growth. The more we ensure that stakeholders have ready access to information about sustainable end-of-life solutions for our materials, the more our industry will align with its environmental values and climate efforts,” stated Kate Collardson, co-founder of SolarRecycle.org.
Collardson told  pv magazine that SolarRecycle.org was created from a realization that there was a lack of information about what to do with solar products at the end of their lives. The team of volunteers put together a website that lists places where folks can donate their end of life equipment that still has useful life left in it. There are also options for reselling that equipment. And then if the equipment doesn’t have any useful life left,  there is a list of recyclers.
Another mission of SolarRecycle is to track state policies, and there’s a tab with an interactive map that lists all of the policy that they’ve identified around the different around different states.

“The exciting thing about this merger with the Atmosphere Conservancy is that they have the non-profit status that’s needed to go after grants and those kinds of funds,” Collardson said.
The next step is to raise the funds necessary for making more resources available such as on-site and balance-of-systems components, pallets, and other shipping-related packaging.  They also plan to add a decommissioning calculator, along with a lot of resources on decommissioning. As Collardson said, it’s an “entirely misunderstood topic.”
The team behind SolarRecycle.org will play the operational and visionary role required for programmatic implementation, and the partnership will continue to use SolarRecycle.org as the primary source of information for these initiatives.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/16/nearly-one-in-ten-k-12-schools-in-the-u-s-have-adopted-solar-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",Nearly one in ten K-12 schools have adopted solar energy,"Schools from grades K-12 are adopting solar energy at an accelerated pace as they target improved sustainability and reduced energy costs. Since 2015, solar for schools has tripled, and now 9% of schools source electricity from PV, said a report by Generation180.
Energy is second only to teacher salaries when it comes to cost, according to NREL, and U.S. schools spend more than $6 billion a year on the line item. Solar presents an opportunity for schools to alleviate budget pressure, often at little or no upfront cost, freeing up funds for more educational benefits.
Schools often sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) when going solar, allowing the school to buy the electricity produced by the solar installation for 10-25 years at a discounted rate, serving up cost savings from day one The report found that 87% of schools enter third-party power purchase agreements, while the remainder own their systems. Nearly half (47%) of the public schools that have invested in solar are eligible for the Title 1 Schoolwide Program, which serves a large population of low-income students.
“The benefits of solar energy are now reaching a broad range of schools across the country, including schools in under-resourced communities that stand to gain the most from the energy cost savings and educational opportunities that solar technology provides. We are striving for all schools and communities, regardless of their size, geography, or wealth, to have access to clean and affordable power,” said Tish Tablan, lead report author and director of Generation180’s Solar For All Schools Program.
The report found the U.S. is home to 8,409 solar schools, with over 6.1 million students in attendance. Many K-12 schools are giving students hands-on STEM learning opportunities and job training for solar careers, using solar development and installation as a case study. In Denver Public Schools’ Renewable Energy Academy, high school students begin preparing for employment as solar installers. Solar installation is expected to become one of the country’s fastest growing occupations over the next decade.
Schools are also pairing solar with battery storage to manage their energy consumption from the grid and provide back-up power to their buildings. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, the solar and storage under installation at Atrisco Heritage Academy High School will soon enable the school to reduce electricity bills by bringing down peak energy demand. The district plans to make it a resilient campus that can stay open for both students and community members during power outages and climate emergencies.
Across the nation, over 1.6 GW of solar capacity has been installed for schools, enough to power 300,000 homes annually.
“While we’re excited to see growth in solar uptake, too many schools are still missing out. We hope this report inspires more schools to take part in our country’s clean energy transition and enjoy the significant benefits solar brings,” said Tablan.
Generation180 offers guidance for schools interested in solar in its Clean Energy School Leaders Network and providing educational resources and technical assistance. The report website includes an interactive map of solar schools across the nation, along with other resources to help school districts go solar.
The organization also runs a national campaign for solar advocacy, and offers a toolkit as a step-by-step grassroots organizing guide. Once the school district has buy-in from the community, decision makers can use Generation180’s how-to guide for going solar.
In the guide, eight steps are laid out for getting started:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/16/start-up-plans-solar-manufacturing-in-disadvantaged-communities/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",Start-up plans solar manufacturing in disadvantaged communities,"An ambitious startup, CHERP, seeks to launch a new ‘no hot spot’ panel, using non-profit micro solar module assembly facilities, to be distributed across disadvantaged communities. CHERP stands for Community Home Energy Revolution Project.
In a presentation hosted by Seneca Solar, CHERP put forth their nationwide vision to deploy 1,000 factories, each producing 100,000 solar modules per year. CHERP says each turnkey facility will cost about $6 million to put in place and will employ approximately 91 people.
The business plan requires public funding to support the construction of each facility, and seeks to combine 501C3 non-profit with for profit models. The group hopes that these facilities will be able to feed their local market’s solar panel demand, installed by local crews, thus creating a virtuous cycle – keeping cash local, and the economy healthy.
CHERP is seeking local 501C3 partners and investment groups with a tax appetite to develop these facilities.
The CHERP solar panel is marketed under the IdealPV name, and details can be found on the now-aged product specification page.

During the presentation, the company suggested that their module would have the lowest degradation and highest possible efficiency produced with regularly available components – a result of eliminating reverse-bias with their novel ‘no hot spot’ hardware design.
CHERP also says the modules have the ability to shut themselves down in milliseconds if they don’t sense an inverter – due to a ‘mass trick based on Einstein’s original equations’. Part of the benefit of the new design is that the units won’t have arc faults.

The group published a paper in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics in July covering the result of a solar panel being tested with the new technique. The abstract describes the key tool that makes their module so special:
An alternative control method has been suggested by Kernahan (Kernahan, 2015) that senses in real time the dynamic conductance |dI/dV| of a string of cells and adjusts its operating current so that a partially shaded cell is never forced into reverse bias.
While the company doesn’t have a UL certified product yet, CHERP told pv magazine USA that they expect to send modules to ETL for testing and certification by the end of this month. The company says the factory is currently running and making panels, with opening scheduled for October.
ETL certification is expected later this year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/16/a-case-for-residential-solar-sharing/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,GERMANY,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",A case for residential solar sharing,"From pv magazine Germany
In the town of Dietfurt, Germany, Technische Universität München (TUM) simulated the energy system of the future for a period of six months. Seven households were involved in the “BASE.V” project, which tested electricity trading between neighbors.
The project was designed to investigate what would happen in the power grid if the number of households that produce their own electricity with PV systems, storage and electric cars continues to increase in the future. The results show that the purchase and sale of electricity can reduce consumption peaks and avoid grid bottlenecks when there is an economic incentive. In other words, grid stability benefits from smart energy management.
The industrial partner for the research project, which was funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, was German battery provider Sonnen. It equipped the seven test households in Bavaria with PV systems, batteries and electric cars with charging stations. The participants could then buy or sell the electricity via a central peer-to-peer trading platform. The individual trading orders were executed via “smart contracts,” which were processed via a blockchain run by German automation solutions specialist Moxa.
“The special requirements of a field experiment have confirmed the easy remote maintenance capability of our IoT platform. Not a single change required an on-site visit from our experts,” said Martin Jenkner, project manager for Moxa Europe. “We were able to remotely manage any update we wanted to the gateway throughout the trial.”
The successful pilot test was also an important indicator for the involved network operators.
“More than 350,000 decentralized generation systems are already feeding into the regional power grid of Bayernwerk Netz GmbH. In addition to the increasing number of decentralized photovoltaic systems on the generator side, there are more and more heat pumps and electric cars on the consumer side,” said Stefan Bergermeier, a project manager for Bayernwerk Netz. “Together with a high level of simultaneous consumption and generation, this represents a major challenge for the local grid.”
The project showed that incentives-based, neighborhood electricity trading complemented the necessary grid expansion in a sensible manner.
“Peer-to-peer trade between households is not a dream of the future, but can be implemented today with the technical possibilities,” said Susan Käppeler, country manager for Sonnen DACH. “Both in terms of storage options and intelligent control. In order to make such solutions accessible to people, we need a digital energy infrastructure in which smart meters are the absolute basic requirement.”
