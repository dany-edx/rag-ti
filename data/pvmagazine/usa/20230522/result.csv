https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/22/caiso-transmission-plan-to-support-17-gw-of-solar-within-a-decade/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 22, 2023",CAISO transmission plan to support 17 GW of solar within a decade,"The California grid operator CAISO has recommended in its 2022-2023 Transmission Plan 45 transmission system expansion and upgrade projects that will allow interconnection of more solar, wind and storage. The plan has been approved by CAISO’s board of directors.
The projects will enable in-state generating resources of 17 GW of solar, 3.5 GW of wind, and 1 GW of geothermal, plus the import of 4.5 GW of out-of-state wind power. CAISO said the projects would also provide access for battery storage projects co-located with renewable generation, and stand-alone storage located close to major load centers.
The transmission projects “would be phased in over lead times of up to 8-10 years,” CAISO said, and completed “over the next decade or so.” The grid operator estimates the total infrastructure investment at $7.3 billion, and expects to launch a competitive solicitation process for three of the higher voltage projects.
CAISO expects the transmission projects will support more than 40 GW of new resource development “identified by the California Public Utilities Commission as cost-effective and needed to meet the state’s clean energy goals over the next 10 years.”
The California Community Choice Association has said that the state must deploy 7.3 GW of renewables per year through 2045 to meet the state’s renewables target, assuming straight-line growth.
CAISO expects that next year’s transmission plan will “identify the need” to add 70 GW of resources by 2033, “eventually growing to 120 GW” to support a carbon-free power system by 2045.
The grid operator said it developed its transmission plan in coordination with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy Commission, with input from utilities and “other key stakeholders.”
The plan reflects a “new, more proactive approach” to synchronize transmission planning, interconnection queuing and resource procurement, CAISO said, as it identifies added transmission and resource capacity “associated with designated geographic zones that make the most economic and operational sense for such development.”
The CPUC will “provide clear direction” to utilities to “focus energy procurement in those key transmission zones in alignment with the transmission plan,” CAISO said.
CAISO will give priority to interconnection requests for projects within those same zones, it said.
The national solar trade group SEIA and the California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) previously said they support transparency on available and planned transmission capacity, in comments on a CAISO “straw proposal” for “Track 1” of an initiative to improve its interconnection process.
But SEIA proposed in its comments that CAISO apply readiness requirements to reduce the burden of interconnection studies, rather than limiting new projects to areas with existing or planned transmission. CESA offered a number of proposals to ensure high-quality and viable applications, and to enable CAISO to more efficiently process a high number of applications.
In its straw proposal, CAISO said that “even within zones that are a priority, the volume of interconnection requests receiving detailed study must be tempered.”
CAISO’s board approved the grid operator’s Track 1 interconnection improvement plan as well as its transmission plan. CAISO said it planned to post a straw proposal on “Track 2” of its interconnection initiative by the end of this month.
CAISO’s transmission plan includes a map showing the regions identified for the transmission projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/22/rfp-alert-pge-seeks-176-mw-of-front-of-the-meter-solar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 22, 2023",RFP Alert: PG&E seeks 176 MW of front-of-the-meter solar,"California utility Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) has issued a request for offers (RFO) for solar projects sized between 500 kW and 20 MW, seeking a total of 176.15 MW of capacity.
The RFO is issued as part of the utility’s Green Tariff Shared Renewables (GTSR) program, which aims to procure front-of-the-meter solar projects. The GTSR program includes two sister programs, Solar Choice and Regional Renewable Choice.
Solar Choice projects have a deadline of December 31, 2024 to reach commercial operations, and Regional Renewable Choice projects must be activated within 36 months of contract execution. The projects will be built in various locations across the utility’s service area and will contribute to the growth of each program.
The Solar Choice program offers customers a pathway to adopt solar without installing rooftop arrays. Through the program, customers can purchase either 50% or 100% of their electricity from projects located in Central and Northern California. An online map displays the locations and specifications of each project that contributed to the program, and it will be updated as the new projects begin development and are activated.
The Regional Renewable Choice program offers customers the opportunity to subscribe to renewable generation from a community-based project within PG&E service area. It was launched by Senate Bill 43, enacted in 2015, which mandated expanded access to renewable resources. The transaction structure is comprised of a customer-developer agreement, a customer energy statement credit, and a power purchase agreement. Program-specific requirements for developers can be found here.
Offers for the two RFOs are due by June 16, 2023. PG&E said it anticipates executing agreements and seeking approval from the California Public Utilities Commission this summer. More information on PG&E wholesale electric power procurement efforts can be found here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/22/graded-industrial-solar-project-shows-advantages-for-brownfield-solar-development/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PRODUCTS,GEORGIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 22, 2023",Graded industrial solar project shows advantages for brownfield solar development,"Landfills, refineries, and designated Superfund sites have become popular sites for solar development based on financial incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, which prioritizes such sites as Energy Communities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that there are currently over 450,000 brownfield sites across the U.S. that stand to provide clean power resources despite their dirty past.
As of the end of 2022, the EPA reported 106 completed superfund projects, combining for 512 MW of generation capacity. Solar makes up most of the portfolio, contributing 372 MW across 86 projects.
Shaw Industries, a building products company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, is developing an industrial solar project situated on a steep slope grade at a carpet tile manufacturing facility in Adairsville, Ga. The half-acre installation will add 300 kW of capacity once complete later this year.
The project is unique in that it incorporates brownfield project capping and artificial membrane technologies designed for landfill solar use. It uses the PowerCap photovoltaic (PV) system, developed by Watershed Solar and its geosynthetics infrastructure product group.
In addition to providing solar energy to the Georgia industrial facility, the industrial solar installation offers versatile siting location based on the PowerCap and ClosureTurf technology and materials used in its construction. PowerCap is installed on top of synthetic turf at inactive landfill sites using Watershed’s ClosureTurf system which provides grading and erosion controls for brownfield sites to allow for solar installations.
PowerCap is a direct surface attachment and “plug and play” integrated wiring technology which allows for PV installations at steep slopes of up to 22 degrees incline, as well as large flat surfaces of environmental closures such as landfill caps.
The brownfield solar system is capable up providing up to one MW per two acres of degraded land reused for solar generation, up to 300% larger capacity than typical ballasted metal racking used in such applications. The PowerCap system provides up to 60% greater fill factor due to the slope and panel density per unit area. The solution is well-suited for closed landfills, impoundments and stand-alone slope applications.
The PowerCap system uses a PV embedded rail attachment, which gives the array a smooth look and allows the system to conform to the siting sub-grade, providing various suitable degrees of installation on sloped surfaces.
Solar installations can be configured between monofacial, bifacial and dual-glass solar panels, allowing various panel types and thicknesses to be attached to the rail system.
Watershed’s PowerCap technology improves solar output and boosts project economics using:
To date, ClosureTurf products have been installed at more several thousand acres of brownfield solar sites, including landfills across the U.S. Over the years, the product membrane solution was used as a landfill closure method at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated Superfund sites.
Watershed Solar provides peace of mind to ClosureTurf site owners and operators due to the combined geotechnical engineering of Watershed Geosynthetics and solar energy expertise of ISM Solar Development.
The company prioritizes a “do no harm” strategy to ensure the long-term integrity and performance of ClosureTurf. Watershed Solar Development integrates ClosureTurf and solar maintenance to provide maximum financial benefit, quality assurance, and risk management to its customers.
“The demonstration installation at Shaw’s manufacturing facility provides us with the ideal way to showcase the possibilities of our PowerCap technology to more customers, more readily, which stands to accelerate adoption and the positive impact we can all have on people and the planet,” said Mike Ayers, chief executive officer, Watershed Geosynthetics.
Initially Shaw Industries supplied turf membrane to Watershed Geosynthetics, but in October 2021 Shaw acquired an interest in the geosynthetics company and in February 2023, acquired the solar business, Watershed Solar, according to a news release.
The geosynthetics business services the environmental and civil sectors, with more than 3,300 acres of projects completed across 41 states and three continents.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/22/rooftop-solar-installed-on-california-new-construction-mutlifamily-housing/,"ACQUISITIONS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 22, 2023",Rooftop solar installed on California new construction mutlifamily housing,"Distributed solar installer Aspen Power announced it has completed the initial phase of solar projects for The Michaels Organization, covering a new multifamily housing construction with rooftop PV. 
The Davis, California site is expected to generate 476,000 kWh of electricity in its first year of operations, offsetting an estimated 380 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to avoiding burning 781 barrels of oil. The project will meet an estimated 20% of the building’s electricity needs and is expected to save residents an average of 5% on their Pacific Gas & Electric utility bills. 
Aspen Power self-originated the project and managed each stage from development and engineering through procurement, installation and utility interconnection. The installer owns the project and is responsible for maintenance of the equipment over the life of the project. 
The installation satisfies California’s Title 24 requirements, which mandates multifamily properties to generate renewable energy on-site. Additionally, as of January 1, 2020, all new construction homes, from single-family homes to three-story high multi-family homes, are required to install on-site solar arrays. Exceptions apply to properties with too small a roof or too much shade to be feasible for rooftop solar. 
“By incorporating clean energy technology, we can offer our tenants the dual benefits of environmentally friendly power and reduced energy costs,” said Scott Cooper, vice president, The Michaels Organization. 
The Michaels Organization has over $11 billion in assets under management and has developed over 57,000 units. It has over 200,000 residents across its 596 housing communities, opening the door for a large commitment to distributed rooftop solar. The company said its business model focuses on solutions to communities that help jumpstart housing, education, civic engagement, and neighborhood prosperity, and has paid over $12 million in resident scholarships to date. 
California also voted in 2021 to require the installation of solar and battery energy storage on most new commercial buildings and high-rise residential constructions. The mandate went into effect January 1, 2023, as administered by the state’s Building Standards Commission. 
Homes and buildings make up 70% of California’s electricity use and about a fourth of its greenhouse gas emissions, said the Commission. Over 30 years, the Commission estimates the emissions abated from this mandate would equal taking 2.2 million cars off the road.
Acquisition
Aspen Power recently acquired Safari Energy, increasing its exposure to the commercial and industrial solar market. The acquisition came with more than 70 projects in California combining for over 38 MW of solar capacity. The company has stated goals of reaching a GW scale of distributed solar capacity by mid-decade.
The acquisition follows a banner year for merger and acquisition (M&A) in the solar industry in 2022, according to a report by Mercom Capital. Mercom noted that solar funding dipped in 2022, but M&A activity was the highest since 2010.
There were 128 M&A transactions in 2022, with Essen, Germany-based RWE AG’s acquisition of Consolidated Edison’s clean energy group for $6.8 billion representing the largest deal of the year. The Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses consist of  3 GW of operating assets with a 7 GW development pipeline.
In 2022, 66 GW of solar projects changed hands, with developers acquiring a 35.7 GW majority of the assets put on the auction block, representing the second highest project-level acquisitions since 2010.
As for funding in the solar market, $5.9 billion or 84% of equity deals in 2022 went to project development companies, while photovoltaic suppliers raised $864 million and balance of system companies raised $83 million. Intersect Power ($750M), Longroad Energy ($500M), Yellow Door Energy ($400M), Palmetto Solar ($375M)  and Aspen Power Partners ($350M) represent the five largest corporate funding transactions in 2022 among the largest funded segment for project development or downstream category.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/22/community-solar-collective-to-deploy-500-mw-of-projects-on-farmland/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 22, 2023",Community solar collective to deploy 500 MW of projects on farmland,"The Great Plains Institute (GPI), a farming research non-profit group, found that of the 2,870 counties in the lower 48 U.S. states, only about one-third had recorded principal-use solar installations of 1 MW in late 2021. Of the counties with solar installations, a large majority (93.5%) had less than 0.5% of their total land used for solar development. Taylor County, Georgia, according to GPI, had the greatest portion of any county’s total acreage in solar development at 4% of the total county area.  
Aggreko Energy Transition Solutions (ETS), a business unit of Scottish modular power equipment distributor Aggreko Ltd., announced it would become the capital partner to the Farmers Powering Communities (FPC) platform, a farmland community solar development collective. With preservation and non-profit groups Edelen Renewables, the American Farmland Trust and community solar aggregator Arcadia, the FPC platform is focused on building out 500 MW of community solar projects over the next decade sited on rural farmland. 
Formed in September 2022, Aggreko ETS is focused on developing, owning, and operating clean energy infrastructure projects in North America through long-term investment and partnerships from within its parent company’s dealer network.

“Expanding access to community solar, which offers a cost-efficient way for people to use solar energy, aligns with our mission to accelerate the energy transition through clean energy infrastructure that delivers reliable, economic energy,” said said Prashanth Prakash, chief commercial officer, Aggreko ETS. “Working together, we are confident of our success in bringing the economic and environmental benefits of community solar to small-town America.” 
The 500 MW community solar portfolio represents a $1 billion investment opportunity to bring co-located clean energy generation to America’s crops and food growers, said Adam Edelen, chief executive officer, Edelen Renewables. 
The farming community solar program will advance projects of 25 to 50 acres to provide green energy to the many residents who don’t have access to rooftop solar or a local clean energy source. These could be low- to middle-income residents who may not be able to afford solar, people who rent and don’t own their roof, or people whose homes are not situated to take advantage of the sun’s energy.
“Farmers are on the frontlines of climate change, experiencing extreme weather events that impact their crops, livestock and livelihoods,” said John Piotti, president and chief executive officer, American Farmland Trust. “We also know that farms can be part of the solution to the climate crisis. Farmland can draw carbon from the air to rebuild soil when farmed using climate-smart practices like cover crops and reduced tillage. We need to dramatically ramp up solar energy production while retaining our farms and ranches.” 
The platform will adhere to AFT’s Smart Solar framework, which encompasses accelerating solar energy development, strengthening farm viability, and safeguarding land suited for farming and ranching. 
The Smart Solar framework guides solar development where it has the least negative impact on land suited for farming, ensures that agricultural land where projects are sited can be farmed in the future, and promotes agrivoltaics, creating opportunities for both farming and solar energy on the same land. 
A common misperception among rural communities is that solar development replaces farmland and deters from the production value of hundreds of acres of farmland. According to GPI’s studies, it’s worth noting that solar development has not conflicted with cultivated agriculture land use at a large enough scale to risk county-level economic agricultural bases. Even if high levels of solar are deployed in farming regions, the land use required is orders of magnitude smaller than land currently in cultivated agriculture. 
The results of GPI showed that for no region does the average percentage of both existing and queued solar in a county surpass a 0.5% ratio of solar developed of the county’s total land. 
Grafton Solar 
The American Farmland Trust highlights the Grafton Solar project, the first agrivoltaics and shared land use solar project in Massachusetts, which began producing squash and reintroduced cattle onto its land in July 2022. Developed in cooperation between AES and Bluewave Energy, Grafton Solar is a 2 MW ground-mounted solar with 1.4 MW energy storage project situated on the Knowlton Farms, located just nine miles east of Worcester, Mass. 
BlueWave developed ground-mounted panels on 19 of the farm’s 300 acres for dual-use solar. The panels are elevated to 10.5 feet with spaced rows, allowing farm machinery, livestock, crop and soil sciences to easily function within the array underneath. The project is owned by AES and serves as the research site trial for the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO). The project also provides power to local community solar subscribers.   
Grafton Solar started to generate revenue for the New England state’s SMART clean energy program in October 2022, and is expected to reach its full potential for agricultural production in 2025.

The homes are designed with climate and storm resiliency in mind with each home equipped with Tesla Powerwall batteries charged by an 8 kW rooftop solar system. There will also be a community microgrid with utility-scale batteries to keep the whole neighborhood powered up.
The neighborhood plan includes a mix of 155 single-family, multi-family and “permanently affordable” homes, according to utility Green Mountain Power (GMP). The three homes listed as currently available on the Hillside website range in price from about $599,000 to $770,000 for three-bedroom homes. The mixed-use neighborhood will include walking trails, playgrounds and a dog park. It is the second phase of a development that the Hillside website says will include a variety of residential styles, access to employment opportunities, shopping, dining, and more.
Senator Welch joined Governor Phil Scott and Evan Langfeldt, president and chief executive officer of construction firm, O’Brien Brothers, along with Mari McClure, president and chief executive officer of GMP for a groundbreaking celebration.
“Vermonters are facing two overlapping challenges: a dire housing shortage and the ongoing climate crisis,” said Senator Welch, a longtime environmental steward and co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. “This project helps tackle both problems head-on, creating more than 150 100% fossil fuel-free homes using Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. It’s the kind of ambitious project we need more of — in Vermont and across the United States.”
In addition to solar and backup batteries, the all-electric homes will have cold weather, ducted heat pump systems for heating and cooling, all electric appliances and a Span Drive level 2 EV charger in the garage. Span Smart Panels will also be installed. These electrical panels double as a home monitoring system that let the homeowner monitor energy use through a mobile app. The panels work with the Span Drive charger. All power lines will be buried underground to add to the resiliency of the neighborhood during high winds and winter storms.
Homeowners will pay an estimated $85 a month for the resiliency package of home batteries paired with solar panels with no upfront costs, according to GMP.
The utility reports that it was the first in the world to earn B Corporation certification, indicating that it meets rigorous social, environmental and accountability standards for its customers. The utility’s annual energy mix is 100% carbon free and 78% renewable.
“This is the future of the grid happening right here in Vermont. Our customer programs for energy storage, heat pumps, discount EV charging and smart panels are pulled together to bring real resilience to this community, decentralizing the grid and lowering costs for all customers,” said GMP’s McClure. “ Devastating climate impacts are here and we must move quickly to use this innovative model to bring solutions to Vermonters all over the state.”
“The energy efficiency measures, solar power generation and battery storage capacity will all work together to significantly decrease homeowners’ carbon footprints, strengthen the overall power grid and help Vermont move towards its climate goals, all while providing housing to 155 families,” said Langfeldt.
 The community will be built in multiple phases with the first units ready for occupancy estimated for the fall of 2023.
