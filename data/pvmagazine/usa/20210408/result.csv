Just a few weeks ago, Spruce Power announced that it would be expanding into integrated smart energy systems.
The partnership now opens the door for Spruce’s 50,000 existing residential solar customers to upgrade their home solar systems with a battery storage solution. The two companies are also early in talks to create virtual power plant (VPP) projects in emerging distributed energy resource (DER) aggregation markets such as New York and California that have programs to support the growth of behind-the-meter storage systems.
Existing Spruce customers have the option to add the sonnenCore 10 kWh home battery system to their solar installation and can use the company’s newly-launched online Battery System Sizing Tool to determine the size, configuration, and backup duration for a home battery system upgrade. The sonnenCore system provides homeowners with a source of energy in the case of emergencies or blackouts, as well as the ability to extract cost savings by managing time-of-use charges.
According to sonnen, it has deployed more than 12.6 MWh of VPP projects built around the sonnen ecoLinx battery. The two companies hope that some of the customers that choose to add storage to their solar system will also choose to enter into their VPP projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/08/indiana-regulators-slash-a-net-metering-rate-advise-solar-owners-to-buy-a-battery/,"LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIANA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 8, 2021","Indiana regulators slash a net metering rate, advise solar owners to buy a battery","A coalition of solar, environmental, and consumer advocates condemned a recent decision by Indiana utility regulators that will “considerably set back” the rooftop solar market in southwest Indiana.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) delivered a final order (Cause No. 45378) that reduces the credit received by future solar owners served by CenterPoint Energy unit Vectren South. The decision also changed the period for earning credits so that more customer-owned solar generation is credited at the new lower rate.
In its decision, the commission ruled that instantaneous netting would “reasonably result” in new distributed generation customers paying for the energy they are supplied by Vectren South, “no more and no less.”
The green energy groups called the ruling “a dramatic setback” for customer-owned solar in the utility’s service territory. They said it would solidify the utility’s “monopoly stranglehold on captive consumers.”
One solar installer told regulators that Vectren South’s proposal would cut the net metering rate of 14.3 cents for residential and 9.3 cents per kWh for commercial customers to about 3.1 cents per kWh. He said that the utility’s proposed instantaneous netting methodology would “drastically reduce or dry up” his company’s business, and he said the proposal would more than triple the expected customer payback period from 7-10 years to about 25 years.
The utility based its net metering rate on the average marginal price of electricity that Vectren South paid during 2019. It averaged that price at Vectren South’s SIGE.SIGW load node, which it said represents the marginal price the utility paid for energy. That price of $25.47 per MWh was used in a formula to yield $31.83 per MWh.
In its ruling, the commission said it found no support for continuing what it said was subsidization by non-solar customers of solar customers’ system payback periods. The utility testified that the cost to manage distributed generation customers–from interconnection evaluation to billing–are greater than those for other customers. Similarly, the utility’s witness testified that outflow produced by customer-owned resources does not reduce power plant, distribution, or transmission system costs.
The commission said that distributed generation customers could install a commercially available battery to make greater use of their solar system’s production. It acknowledged that such technology is expensive and may lengthen a solar system’s payback period. However, it rules that a longer payback period does not require Vectren South to continue allowing customers that own distributed generation resources to “use Petitioner’s electric system as their battery.”
It said that the fact that solar customers are generating behind the meter and, it said, buying less electricity, “will generate value and return on their private investment.”

The bank  is set to buy more than 58 MW of solar capacity from the Blackburn Solar project in North Carolina.
Blackburn is a 60 MW installation planned on 600 acres in Catawba County north of Charlotte It will be developed, owned, and operated by a unit of NextEra Energy Resources, and is scheduled to come online as early as 2022.
The power generated will offset about 50% of the bank’s energy usage in the state and will supply around 8% of the company’s annual global electricity.
Since 2017, Wells Fargo has met all of its annual global electricity requirements with renewable energy, primarily through the purchase of renewable energy credits, satisfying the first part of a two-pronged 2020 renewable energy goal set in 2016. The second part of that commitment, an effort to move to a higher mix of long-term renewable energy contracts for projects near its largest load centers while also expanding onsite solar generation, is currently underway.
In March, Wells Fargo announced its goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including its financed emissions.
Duke has had consistent success with GSA in North Carolina. Wells Fargo marks the fourth large-scale renewable energy buyer, along with Duke University, the City of Charlotte, and Bank of America. Those four customers represent 219 MW of the North Carolina GSA’s 600 MW capacity.
The utility recently expanded the program to South Carolina, following approval from the state’s Public Service Commission. This program is smaller, totaling 200 MW in capacity. It sets aside 35 MW for local government and university customers for nine months, with the remaining 165 MW reserved for large non-residential customers. This capacity is further divided into 125 MW for Duke Energy Carolinas and 40 MW for Duke Energy Progress.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/08/nypa-agrees-to-test-a-1-mwh-zinc-based-energy-storage-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,NEW YORK",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 8, 2021",NYPA agrees to test a 1 MWh zinc-based energy storage system,"The New York Power Authority (NYPA) signed an agreement with Zinc8 Energy Solutions Inc. and the University at Buffalo to deploy a Zinc-air Energy Storage System (ZESS).
The project will demonstrate a 100kW/1MWh ZESS. Vancouver, British Columbia-based Zinc8 won a contract to accelerate the technology in the Innovation Challenge, a partnership between NYPA and the Urban Future Lab at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering.
The Buffalo deployment will provide peak shaving capability and increase campus resiliency. It will also aim to validate the system’s performance reliability and help determine O&M and life cycle costs. The university will also explore alternative uses such as emergency back-up for campus buildings.
In a profile that appeared last year in pv magazine, Zinc8 claimed to have solved the “dendrite problem” which leads to clogging of the membranes used in flow batteries. Solving this challenge, along with the broader technology development, cost more than $80 million over the course of 14 years, according to the company. The investments produced a product with a 65% to 70% round trip efficiency.
In simple terms, the technology works this way. Power from the grid or renewable source is used to generate zinc particles in a zinc regenerator. Oxygen is released to the atmosphere as a by-product. The zinc particles are flowed to a storage tank and maintained in potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte until required. Whenever power is needed, the zinc particles are delivered to a power stack, recombining them with oxygen to generate electricity. The zinc oxide (ZnO) by-product is returned to the storage tank for later regeneration.
Under the agreement with Zinc8, NYPA will contribute to the installation costs and share data generated during the demonstration period. Zinc8 aims to achieve full commercialization of its technology in early 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/08/watch-texas-solar-project-gains-financial-backers-as-construction-moves-ahead/,"RACKING,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 8, 2021",Watch: Texas solar project gains financial backers as construction moves ahead,"Financing is set for a 200 MW solar power plant in south Texas.
The North American Development Bank, a syndicate of three other lenders, and developer BayWa r.e. signed a credit agreement for up to $216.1 million to finance the design, construction, and operation of the 200 MW Corazon Solar Project located on nearly 2,000 acres of private land.
NADB chipped in a $62.9 million loan and served as coordinating lead arranger on the deal. Worley is the engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) firm.
Electricity and renewable energy credits from the project will be sold to a retail energy solutions provider through a long-term power purchase agreement, and in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) wholesale electricity market.
The PV solar resource at the site ranges from 5 to 6 kWh/m2/day, meaning the project is expected to generate roughly 537.30 GWh of electricity in its first year of operation.

A total of 66 inverters will be installed to transform direct current into alternating current, with an efficiency of 97.7% and a modular design for maintenance. The inverters will transform the electricity to 34.5 kV.
A network of underground electric cables will collect energy from the modules. One step-up substation will be built to transform the electricity from 34.5 kV to 345 kV. The project will be interconnected to an existing 345 kV station operated by ERCOT through a new 3.7-mile aerial transmission line.
A SCADA system provided by Trimark Associates will monitor, operate, and track the facility remotely, as well as document the performance of the PV system relative to its projected output.

New Jersey regulators said they received 410 applications to participate in the second year of the state’s Community Solar Energy Pilot Program. Applications represent 800.5 MW of total capacity, and all but one project committed to serving low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities, a program focus.
The pilot program is administered by New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program and aims to provide access to solar energy through a subscription-based model. The model allows residents and businesses to virtually connect to a solar installation within their electric distribution company’s service territory. This design offers customers who are usually excluded from the solar market with a chance to benefit from clean energy.
In January, the first community solar projects were energized as part of the pilot program’s first year. Projects included 7 MW in Perth Amboy, near New York City, constructed by New Jersey-based developer Solar Landscape.
The program’s second year is expected to allocate 150 MW of award capacity (double that of Year 1) and includes a 40% earmark for projects serving mostly LMI households.
The regulatory authority will process and score the 410 applications based on an evaluation criteria that emphasizes LMI and environmental justice inclusion, low-impact siting, and community engagement. Projects must score a minimum of 50 points for consideration.
The Navajo Nation is moving forward with a 200 MW solar plant on tribal land in Arizona after tribal leaders finalized lease details for the Cameron Solar. A committee of the Navajo Nation Council approved the lease in an earlier action. Salt River Project is the expected energy off-taker, although a power purchase agreement has not yet been signed.
ReneSola Ltd. sold a 10 MW portfolio of solar development projects to Greenbacker Renewable Energy. The portfolio consists of three ground-mounted commercial distributed generation sites in Utah. The projects are behind the meter and will sell electricity directly to two off-take parties. The projects are being sold at the “Notice to Proceed” stage, and Greenbacker will complete the construction and retain long-term ownership. Financial details were not disclosed.
In late March, Greenbacker said that Rawhide Prairie Solar, a 22 MW project in Colorado, began commercial operation. An onsite Tesla battery pack is capable of storing up to 2 MWh of energy. The project was Greenbacker’s first solar-plus-storage project. DEPCOM Power handled the plant’s engineering and construction and will manage the project and deliver output to Platte River Power Authority, which signed a 20-year power purchase agreement.
Intersolar North America (ISNA) and Energy Storage North America (ESNA) said that their combined conference and tradeshow is “impossible to hold in person” in 2021 due to the ongoing risks of Covid-19. New dates are set for Jan. 13-15, 2022 at the Long Beach Convention Center in Long Beach, California. ISNA and ESNA will host a two-day digital summit July 14-15, 2021.
A new report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) said that flow batteries could provide several days of electricity storage and could address some of the shortcomings of today’s dominant energy-storage technology, lithium-ion batteries.
The report called on Congress and the Department of Energy to “push this technology and others like it forward” by accelerating investments in R&D, testing, and demonstration.
Flow battery architecture can use a broad range of chemicals, including some materials that are cheap and highly abundant. But the report said that the most serious barrier for flow batteries is the absence of “first markets” that would rapidly accelerate development and cost reduction.
It called on DOE to create a path to R&D funding for universities and companies through a program dedicated to grid-scale storage, while also supporting test facilities and demonstration projects at national labs and elsewhere.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/08/power-quality-issues-challenge-utilities-as-solar-is-added-to-the-grid-survey-finds/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 8, 2021","Power quality issues challenge utilities as solar is added to the grid, survey finds","Backfeed may be growing as a concern to North American utilities, especially given the growing number of energy customers adopting solar panels.
When the flow of energy takes place in the reverse of its typical flow, backfeed occurs. It sometimes results from the bi-directional flow on the grid due to renewable integration or distributed energy resources (DERs).
This reverse flow poses safety risks in the form of electric shock. For example, a downed line may become reenergized through intentional or unintentional backfeed, potentially putting linemen at risk of being injured.
A downed line may become reenergized through intentional or unintentional backfeed, potentially putting linemen at risk of being injured.

More than 80% of the responding utilities said they do not currently measure backfeed. The study said that one reason could be the inability to gather accurate data. The issue could grow in importance as electric vehicles grow in popularity, along with vehicle-to-grid connectivity. The survey said that more than 20% of the utility respondents plan on integrating EVs onto their grids within the next five years. This move reinforces that backfeed is an issue that must be “urgently addressed,” the survey said.
The report said that power quality issues manifest themselves in the forms of voltage swags, swells, flickers, harmonic distortions, power interruptions, and voltage imbalances. From a safety standpoint, poor power quality can result in electrical fires or overheating of electrical networks.
Safety was named as a top power quality concern for 77% of the survey respondents. The top power quality concerns were voltage sags (51%), harmonics (49%), and voltage surges (45%).
The survey also looked at the increased reliance utilities have on digital tools to better manage legacy infrastructure systems. More than two-thirds of the responding utilities said they had started implementing grid connectivity applications, and half said they have already implemented outage detection and service restoration solutions.
Leveraging digital tools does not come without some challenges. According to the survey, 51% of the responding utilities said integration with internal and external IT systems was the most challenging aspect of implementing grid measurement and management systems.
