https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/republican-debt-ceiling-bill-guts-clean-energy-in-inflation-reduction-act/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 20, 2023",Republican debt ceiling bill guts clean energy in Inflation Reduction Act,"A bill proposed by Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) proposes to raise the national debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion and promises to slash federal spending by $4.5 trillion. 
The “Limit, Save, Grow Act” would make cuts to renewable energy spending while supporting domestic oil and gas production. Provisions within the bill would gut the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes nearly $400 billion in federal spending to support the energy transition. 
The bill proposes to revert discretionary spending caps to fiscal 2022 levels while limiting growth to 1% annually over the next decade.  
President Biden has expressed no interest in negotiating with McCarthy on the bill. Instead, Biden said he would negotiate on a “clean” debt limit increase that is decoupled from other policy measures. 
The bill seeks to repeal “market distorting green tax credits,” slashing credits for solar, wind, electric vehicles, energy storage, and more. It would repeal the Production Tax Credit, the Investment Tax Credit, and other core IRA provisions. 
Since the IRA passed, over $150 billion in private investments in the U.S. clean energy economy have been announced, said the American Clean Power Association (ACP). This unprecedented level of investment exceeds the total investment in utility-scale clean power projects brought online in the five previous years combined, spanning 2017 to 2021.  
The IRA has already spurred 46 utility-scale clean energy manufacturing facility announcements, adding an estimated 18,000 or more U.S. jobs in eight short months. 
“The American Clean Power Association is interested in working with Republicans and Democrats on permitting reform, energy security, and the real challenges facing the energy sector and our economy. Congress should not waste time or energy on political messaging bills that do not advance the national interest,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer, ACP. 
While the House has a Republican majority, the bill is considered unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate. Biden also has the ability to veto the bill if it reaches his desk. The Hill said the bill is considered a Republican wish-list and an attempt to bring Biden to the table for negotiation.
Advanced Energy United said the Inflation Reduction Act may lead to $4.4 billion in consumer savings, while moving the U.S. away from volatile fossil fuel prices and combating inflation. 
“Rolling back the IRA now would undercut long term efforts to improve America’s fiscal health. We would urge Congressional lawmakers to pass a clean debt-limit increase and refocus on forging bipartisan, bicameral legislation that reforms permitting for critical mineral production, transmission, and advanced energy projects, further expanding our economy and strengthening U.S. energy independence,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director, Advanced Energy United.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/sunnova-secures-3-billion-for-virtual-power-plant-loan-program/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 20, 2023",Sunnova secures $3 billion for virtual power plant loan program,"Sunnova Energy International secured a $3 billion conditional loan from the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office to support a new solar loan channel called “Project Hestia.”
Project Hestia is designed to increase access to solar and virtual power plant (VPP) services for disadvantaged communities who otherwise may not be able to secure loans for residential solar projects. The company will receive indirect and partially guaranteed cash flows for the loans associated with these customer accounts.
To be eligible for the program, each installation must be outfit with Sunnova’s energy management system, which customers can access via smartphone or other electronic devices. The system will make recommendations for demand response behaviors, offering customers opportunities to save on energy costs while helping balance the grid during times of peak demand.
If issued, the DOE loan would support loan origination for solar, storage and other Sunnova Adaptive Home technologies equipped with VPP capabilities. The loan guarantees are expected to lead to up to $5 billion in loan originations, lower the weighted average cost of capital, and generate interest savings.
The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2023, and the company said it plans to issue its first securitization in the first half of this year. Sunnova was advised by Atlas SP Partners and Citi on the transaction, while Baker Botts served as legal advisor. Kramer Levin acted as legal advisor to the financial advisors.
“DOE’s conditional commitment is expected to support grid reliability, improve access to clean energy, and enhance ratings and advance rates on our senior bonds,” said Robert Lane, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Sunnova. “This financing would allow Sunnova to realize issuance spreads commensurate with the expected credit uplift and introduce new, investment-grade investors to Sunnova’s long-term strategy.” 
VPP services have been under focus for the DOE’s Loan Programs Office as the availability of debt financing for unfamiliar technologies has been a bottleneck for adoption.
A VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants. Jigar Shah, director, U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office
Sunnova has agreed to provide monthly servicing reports, and hardware and software deployment information to DOE. It will also measure the reduction in greenhouse gases associated with the project. As part of the conditional loan, Sunnova will be required to deliver collateral pools that realize agreed criteria related to FICO distributions for disadvantaged communities.
“Project Hestia would make possible a historic private sector investment in disadvantaged American communities and energy infrastructure,” said William J. Berger, chief executive officer of Sunnova. “The DOE financing would accelerate the adoption of solar and storage, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and expand the availability of reliable, clean, and affordable energy to those communities who benefit the most from low-cost energy.”
According to an industry survey run by Aurora Solar, 77% of homeowners reported either having solar or expressed interest in purchasing it. Supplemental technologies like energy storage and electric vehicles have gained in interest as well, as 82% of solar professionals reported increased interest in battery energy storage, and 79% said electric vehicle adoption is driving interest in residential solar.
Sustainability research, publication, consulting, and lecturing provider Rocky Mountain Institute recently announced the creation of the Virtual Power Plant Partnership. Called VP3, the initiative aims to catalyze the industry and transform VPP policy, removing barriers to adoption.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/tesla-energy-storage-deployments-increase-by-360/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 20, 2023",Tesla energy storage deployments increase by 360%,"Tesla’s energy storage business is growing significantly, but its solar business continues coasting.
On Wednesday the company released its first-quarter earnings report, highlighting 360% year-over-year quarterly growth in its energy storage business. Tesla booked a strong 3.89 GWh of energy storage, compared to 846 MWh deployed a year ago. The first quarter record surpassed the prior record of 2.46 GWh from Q4 2022 by 58%.
Over the past twelve months, Tesla has booked 9.6 GWh of energy storage capacity.

The increase in energy storage deployment is a result of the company’s continuous efforts to boost production capacity at the Megafactory in Lathrop, California, aiming for an annual output of 40 GWh of Megapacks. Currently each Megapack provides 3.9 MWh of energy storage capacity.
Tesla recently announced a second 40 GWh Megafactory in Shanghai. The Chinese facility will come online in 2024. The company also manufactures about 3 GWh of Megapacks in Nevada.
Tesla also set a record in “energy generation and storage” revenue, reaching just over $1.5 billion. This value is up 148% from $616 million in Q1 2022 and up 17% from the $1.3 billion in Q4 2022.
The energy group has been profitable for the last two quarters, following three quarters of losses.

When asked by an investor if Tesla Energy would be bigger than the company’s automotive business (which Elon Musk has cited multiple times), Musk replied, “bigger than Auto from a standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed, so it’s possible automotive revenue may be higher.”
In Tesla’s recently published third Master Plan, the company estimated that 112 TWh of batteries would be needed for the world’s vehicle fleet, with 46.2 TWh of “e chem” (Megapack style) batteries required to green and electrify the power grid.
Tesla’s Solar Roof was not mentioned in the call nor in the quarterly documents. This comes after analysts suggested that Tesla had only installed 3,200 Solar Roofs nationwide, and Tesla responded via Twitter that this value was “incorrect by a large margin.”
Tesla executives did not touch on the solar business during the Q1 2023 earnings call. 
Tesla reported 67 MW of solar deployments in the latest quarter, growing 40% compared to Q1 2022. However, this number is somewhat disappointing, as the prior three quarters averaged 100 MW deployed.
Over the past twelve months, Tesla has booked 367 MW of solar power.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/national-urban-league-traces-the-past-and-present-of-environmental-justice-concerns/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 20, 2023",National Urban League traces the past and present of environmental justice concerns,"“America is segregated, and so is pollution,” said Robert Bullard, a professor at Texas Southern University, in a special section of the “2023 State of Black America” report from the National Urban League, addressing the climate crisis and how renewable energy development can help address historic inequities. Trade group the American Council on Renewable Energy partnered with the League in releasing the special section.
Bullard’s essay, one of four published in the special section, traces the origins of the environmental justice concept, saying it was “largely absent” from the first Earth Day in April, 1970. The “dominant view of ‘environmental protection for all’” began to emerge, Bullard said, “when Black people began demanding environmental protection as a basic civil right.”
With environmental justice now encompassing employment opportunities in clean energy, Bullard said Black Americans, who constitute 13% of the U.S. population and labor force, hold only 8% of the jobs in renewable energy, energy efficiency and related fields. He also called for alleviating energy poverty and energy insecurity in Black and Latino neighborhoods, citing a study on racial inequity in household energy efficiency.
Bullard focused on the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund under the Inflation Reduction Act as a means to “begin closing the racial income and wealth gap.” That fund, designed to leverage private capital for “clean energy and clean air investments,” will “create good-paying jobs,” he said, and “needs to support millions of low-income and working families that need it the most.”
Also contributing essays were Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Shalanda Baker, director of DOE’s Office of Economic Impact and Diversity and Secretarial Advisor on Equity. The chief executive officers of the National Urban League and ACORE contributed a joint essay.
Baker said in her essay that “the fossil fuel industry requires a substantial, toxic footprint,” and that “certain communities,” like her father’s hometown of Port Arthur, Texas, have “become sacrifice zones” that are “more prone to an array of health and environmental hazards.”
Bullard said that frontline communities are demanding from the Biden Administration that Justice40 benefits—a plan to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of climate investments to disadvantaged communities—actually flow to meet the needs of those communities, making the “millions of good paying jobs and businesses accessible to Black and Latino workers and owners.”
Granholm noted in her essay that Black Americans have higher exposure to air pollution and associated health burdens than white Americans, and that Black households spend 43% more income on energy costs than white households. She said that DOE has “begun to make significant progress” toward achieving its Justice40 goals, and has launched an Equity Access Plan to help underrepresented groups access DOE resources.
The National Urban League is partnering with the Edison Electric Institute to identify opportunities for Urban League affiliates to partner with energy companies to diversify their talent pipeline, said the League’s CEO Marc Morial and ACORE CEO Gregory Wetstone in their essay. To aid Black and brown business owners to “expand their presence in the renewable energy supply chain,” the essay says that ACORE’s Accelerate initiative “offers important potential, but must be expanded and embraced more broadly by key organizations in the renewable sector to truly address the problem.”
The NUL-ACORE essay added that the Inflation Reduction Act’s “energy communities” provision, by encouraging renewable energy development in communities economically reliant on the fossil fuel industry, “will provide new employment avenues where they are needed most.”
Environmental justice and injustice
In reviewing the origins of the environmental justice movement, Bullard recounted a 1979 lawsuit challenging the siting of a solid waste facility in Houston, protests in North Carolina in 1982 over the dumping of toxic waste at a landfill located in the Black community, and a 1987 national study by a faith-based Black civil rights organization that correlated waste facility sites and demographic characteristics.
Bullard’s own 1990 textbook on environmental justice was the first to show that environmental vulnerability “mapped closely” with historical patterns of racial discrimination, he said.
Bullard cited research from the past few years documenting many more injustices:
Baker added in her essay that “the coal industry’s barbaric practice of blasting the tops off mountains has also left deep scars on poor, white communities.” These white communities “should tie their fates to those fighting for energy justice in Black and brown communities,” she said.
In a statement introducing the essays, the special section presented survey results showing that Hispanic/Latino and Black Americans, “who have been disproportionately affected by our nation’s energy system for decades,” are “more likely to be alarmed or concerned about global warming than are Whites.”
Placing the concept of environmental justice in a larger framework, Bullard said in his essay that “Environmental justice embraces the principle that all people and communities are entitled to equal protection of environmental, health, employment, education, housing, transportation, energy, and civil rights laws.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/sunergy-to-go-public-in-475-million-valuation-spac-merger/,"ACQUISITIONS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,FLORIDA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 20, 2023",Sunergy to go public in $475 million valuation SPAC merger,"Sunergy Renewables, a New Port Richey, Florida-based residential solar and energy efficiency installer, announced plans to go public at $475 million enterprise value.
The company announced its intent to combine with ESGEN Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, in a transaction that would result in the combined company becoming a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq exchange.
For 2022, Sunergy installed more than 2,400 solar systems, generated $123 million of revenue and $11 million in earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization, or EBITDA, a common financial performance and corporate valuation metric. The Florida company provides rooftop solar installations as well as battery storage systems and energy efficiency solutions which include insulation and roofing systems in various states such as Florida, Texas and Arkansas.
Sunergy sells residential solar systems through a proprietary sales approach that maximizes lead generation and conversion processes. The company uses a custom software platform to augment sales and uses a customer relationship management system to track key performance indicators across the sales cycle. The installer is a SunPower elite dealer and certified Tesla Powerwall energy storage systems installer.
“We believe this combination represents a transformative step on our path to grow as a vertically integrated company,” said Tim Bridgewater, chief executive officer and co-founder of Sunergy.  “The proceeds from the transaction will help Sunergy scale more rapidly to meet the current demand we are seeing from our customers who desire to reduce high energy bills and contribute to a sustainable future.”
“Our primary objective at ESGEN is to partner with sound, scalable and profitable companies we believe will fundamentally disrupt the current energy landscape and take advantage of markets experiencing generational growth,” said Andrejka Bernatova, chief executive officer of ESGEN. “We want to simultaneously accelerate a shift to a low-carbon future.”
ESGEN is a SPAC investment platform formed by Energy Spectrum Capital, a Dallas-based energy private equity firm with $4.5 billion of invested commitments. The SPAC is managed by the firm’s Energy Spectrum Partners VIII fund affiliate, which is also invested in Nightpeak Energy, an Oakland, Calif.-based energy storage platform managed by former Recurrent Energy executives.
Financial overview
Sunergy’s go-public transaction is being funded with proceeds of $65 million in cash, underpinned by $10 million of common stock private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing commitment from Energy Spectrum Partners, valued at $10 per share.
The company said the transaction proceeds will fund operations and growth opportunities, with the SPAC transaction expected to close during Q4 2023.
Cohen & Company Capital Markets, a boutique investment banking business of JVB Financial, a New York debt investment firm, advised ESGEN on the SPAC combination, while Kirkland & Ellis was the sponsor’s legal advisor.
Eversheds Sutherland and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole are counsel to Sunergy.
SPAC market burst
According to an S&P Global Market Intelligence report, SPAC merger activity involving clean energy companies has largely collapsed since Q1 2021. The energy transition was a key beneficiary to the SPAC trend, with numerous electric vehicle, EV charging infrastructure and energy storage companies to go public over a short timeframe through early 2021.
The SPAC market collapsed amid tightening investor scrutiny tied to regulatory loopholes closed from previous allowances for target companies to go public with overstated financial projections, with numerous companies involved in SPAC mergers now seeing dwindling stock performance, the report notes.
Through Q1 2021, the most active quarter, SPAC IPO’s across all sectors peaked at 311 deals valued at $99.7 billion in aggregate transaction values, while subsequent quarters saw an average of about 73 SPAC deals and $12.4 billion average quarterly transaction values, according to S&P Global.
Tigo Energy, a provider of solar inverter, electronics and energy storage products, revealed plans in December 2022 to go public through a SPAC merger with Roth CH Acquisition IV Company (ROCG), a platform managed by Roth Capital Partners and Craig-Hallum Capital Group. That deal is valued at $600 million pre-money equity valuation and expected to close by June 30, 2023.

These investments are part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda.
The National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP) selected 25 teams to participate in the $10 million Community Power Accelerator Prize competition, which aims to develop a nationwide network of community solar project developers. The DOE sees the potential for as much as 150 MW of community solar in the U.S., or enough to power nearly 30 thousand American homes. Available to these project developers is $5 billion in private sector financing through the Community Power Accelerator, which intends to bring together investors, philanthropic organizations, developers, community-based organizations, and technical experts to get more equitable community solar projects financed and deployed.
The DOE also launched the 2023 Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar, an awards program that recognizes best practices in community solar projects and programs that increase equitable access. The Sunny Awards offers $200,000 in prize awards for community solar projects and programs that increase equitable access and ensure benefits go to subscribers and their communities. Together these programs contribute to the President’s Justice40 initiative to ensure that every community benefits from the clean energy transition and underscores the Administration’s commitment to expanding access to affordable renewable energy across America.
“Ensuring every community has access to the benefits from affordable clean energy resources like solar is key to President Biden’s vision of an equitable clean energy future,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “With today’s announcements, DOE is providing an exciting new set of tools and important assistance to support solar deployment across the nation so that all communities can enjoy the economic and critical public health benefits that come with deploying renewable energy.”
Secretary Granholm will emphasize the importance of these announcements at an event held April 20, 2023 honoring the 2022 Sunny Awards winners in Washington, D.C. The Secretary will highlight newly announced investments from DOE, including $82 million in selections for research and development projects in solar energy and a $3 billion conditional loan commitment to Sunnova Energy’s Project Hestia, which aims to expand access to solar in disadvantaged communities.
Community solar is a way for people to benefit from solar energy without having to put solar on their own rooftop. It serves those who cannot afford their own solar installation as well renters, who don’t own their rooftop. It also serves those whose home many not be oriented for solar or have other unsuitable conditions. Residential rooftop solar has historically been adopted by higher-income customers, although that trend has been changing, community solar is a way for anyone—regardless of income or home ownership—to benefit from solar.  DOE initiatives like NCSP, the Community Power Accelerator, and the Sunny Awards support the Department’s efforts to ensure organizations and communities across the nation have access to the funding and assistance necessary to develop community solar projects that promote long-lasting and meaningful benefits to the surrounding areas.
Equitable deployment 
The Community Power Accelerator Prize was designed to better enable community solar developers to learn, grow their operations, and support multiple projects. DOE anticipates that the prize will foster a robust ecosystem of community solar project developers that incorporate locally centered benefits into projects across the United States. The prize is a critical component of the Community Power Accelerator.
The 25 winners will receive a cash prize of $50,000 each, participate in a learning lab, and obtain technical assistance to further scope out their project portfolios to get them ready for financing. At the end of the next phase of the competition, teams will list their projects on the Community Power Accelerator’s online platform, ensuring visibility to the platform’s financing and philanthropic partners. Through this process, the teams will develop skills critical to deploying hundreds of megawatts of equitable community solar, which support the NCSP’s goal of 20 GW by 2025.
The winners span 16 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and will serve diverse types of communities, for example:

Best practices in community solar 
DOE also opened submissions for its 2023 American-Made Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar. In its second year, the Sunny Awards will recognize community solar projects, and state, municipal, Tribal, and utility-led community solar programs that employ best practices in delivering benefits to their subscribers and communities. Applicants will compete for a prize pool of $200,000, including up to five Grand Prize Awards of $10,000 each.
The Sunny Awards is a prize competition that recognizes community solar projects and programs that employ or develop innovative ways to increase equitable access to the cost-saving and public health benefits of community solar.
In the inaugural 2022 Sunny Awards, DOE awarded over 30 community solar projects and programs nationwide, including Grand Prize winners:
These five winners will help households achieve a projected combined total savings of $4.3 million on their energy bills. These winning projects and programs provide clean energy access for 7,300 low- to moderate-income households and demonstrate best practices in increasing resilience, expanding community ownership, building a more equitable workforce, and leading community engagement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/researchers-look-beyond-silicon-to-potentially-double-solar-cell-efficiency/,"RESEARCH,COLORADO",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 20, 2023",Researchers look beyond silicon to potentially double solar cell efficiency,"Most solar panels used today are made from silicon, a well-tested semiconductor material that is not without limitations. For example, silicon loses up to 40% of the energy it collects from sunlight in the form of heat waste. Researchers at Colorado State University (CSU) are studying radical new ways to improve solar power and provide more options for the future.
CSU chemists are proposing to make solar cells using an abundantly available natural material called molybdenum disulfide. Using a combination of photoelectrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, the researchers conducted a series of experiments showing that extremely thin films of molybdenum disulfide display unprecedented charge carrier properties that could someday drastically improve solar technologies.
The experiments were led by chemistry Ph.D. student Rachelle Austin and postdoctoral researcher Yusef Farah. Austin works jointly in the labs of Justin Sambur, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, and Amber Krummel, associate professor in the same department. Farah is a former Ph.D. student in Krummel’s lab. Their work is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Sambur’s lab became interested in molybdenum sulfide as a possible alternative solar material based on preliminary data on its light absorption capabilities even when only three atoms thick, explained Austin.
The collaboration made use of Sambur’s expertise in solar energy conversion using  nanoscale materials, and Krummel’s expertise in ultrafast laser spectroscopy, both of which helped them understand how different materials are structured and how they behave.
Krummel’s lab contains a state-of-the-art ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectrometer that can very precisely measure the sequential energy states of individual electrons as they are excited with a laser pulse. Experiments using this spectrometer can provide snapshots of how charges flow in a system.
Austin created a photoelectrochemical cell using a single atomic layer of molybdenum sulfide, and she and Farah used the pump-probe laser to track the cooling of electrons as they moved through the material. What they found was astoundingly efficient light-to-energy conversion. More importantly, the laser spectroscopy experiments enabled them to show why this efficient conversion was possible.
What they learned was that the material could convert light to energy so well because its crystal structure allows it to extract and exploit the energy of so-called hot carriers, which are highly energetic electrons that are briefly excited from their ground states when hit with enough visible light. The researchers found that in their photoelectrochemical cell, the energy from these hot carriers was immediately converted into photocurrent, as opposed to being lost as heat, which gave it an advantage over conventional silicon solar cells.
“This work paves the way for knowing how to design reactors that contain these nanoscale materials for efficient and large-scale hydrogen production,” Sambur said.
The project was a collaboration with Professor Andrés Montoya-Castillo and Dr. Thomas Sayer of University of Colorado Boulder, who contributed theoretical chemistry and computational modeling to help explain and verify the experimental data.
“The discovery required a ‘team science’ approach that brought together many different types of expertise, in computational, analytical and physical chemistry,” Krummel said.

As part of Biden Administration’s Investing in America program, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $250 million in federal funding opportunity to incentivize the domestic heat pump manufacturing in the U.S.
This is the first funding opportunity announcement stemming from DOE’s new authorization, invoked by President Biden over the summer of 2022, to use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to increase domestic production of five key clean energy technologies, including electric heat pumps.
The new funding, which is governed by the Inflation Reduction Act of August 2022, will be used to build a clean energy economy, create new manufacturing jobs and help families save money on their energy bills. Increased use of heat pumps for heating and cooling will help lower energy costs for more American families and businesses, and create healthier indoor spaces through American-made clean energy technologies.
“Electric heat pumps offer a cheaper, more reliable option for heating and cooling that isn’t prone to dramatic price swings and helps to strengthen the nation’s energy independence.,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm.
The heating and cooling of buildings, homes, offices, government and municipal facilities consumes more than 40% of all U.S. energy.  Heat pumps transfer heat rather than generate heat, making the technology applicable across all climates without reliance on home heating oil, gas or other fuel sources. One of the downsides to heat pumps has been that they didn’t operate well in cold climates. To help advance the technology, the DOE launched the Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge. Recently Rheem announced an air-source heat pump that passed the Heat Pump Challenge, providing uninterrupted heating under -22.9 F ambient conditions.
The DOE is extending applications to manufacturers interested in creating new U.S. facilities or expanding existing production capacity to develop more electric heat pump systems, components, and materials. The department is seeking projects that will:
Concept papers, required by all applicants, are due by May 19, 2023, 5 p.m. ET.  Full applications are due by August 1, 2023, 5 p.m. ET.

The power grid operator defines net load as total electricity demand minus wind and solar power.
Starting at 12:20 PST, CAISO first reported net demand at negative 63 MW. At the moment, total grid demand was 13.8 GW. It was offset by 12.4 GW of utility managed solar, and 1.5 GW of wind.

While CAISO’s demand was noted as being nearly 14 GW, total true demand was above 20 GW at the moment when taking into account the greater than 10 GW of behind-the-meter solar power deployed in the power grid region.
Combined, solar was meeting greater than 90% of California’s electricity needs at the moment.
At the same time that CAISO first noted a net demand below zero, at 12:20 p.m., the overall supply picture was much more complex. First, there was greater than 4.7 GW of natural gas running, as well as electricity exports of over 4.9 GW.
According to Grid Status’ Max Kanter, Sunday set a record for the highest electricity export ever from CAISO.

In addition to the gas and 4 MW of coal burning somewhere in the state, batteries and multiple other clean sources were doing their job. Just over 2 GW of batteries were being charged, along with just over 4 GW of combined nuclear and hydroelectric power were pumping.
In fact, starting at 8:10 a.m. and going until 5:50 p.m. – nine hours and forty minutes – CAISO’s total electricity demand could be covered by its clean resources of nuclear, hydro, wind and solar.

CAISO’s curtailment report from Sunday shows that there was some solar power being shut down during the day. The report noted that during the noon hour, when the state officially broke below zero on net load by 0.063 GW, solar curtailment capacity peaked at just over 1.7 GW, with 1.54 GWh of electricity not being generated. On April 18, 2023 solar peaked at greater than 14 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/tracking-the-sun-on-uneven-terrain/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 20, 2023",Tracking the sun on uneven terrain,"The utility-scale solar industry is expecting much growth worldwide, leading to the question of land use. In the United States, for example, solar capacity is expected to rise from around 141 GW today to 700 GW in 2033, according to the Solar Market Insight 2022 report, published by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). While flat desert areas of the Middle East, western U.S. and other regions are an obvious choice for solar, much land is available in Australia, the U.S. and Europe, where the hilly and variable terrain is giving rise to the terrain following tracker market.
Terrain following trackers are meeting the challenge of land use, but it’s also been found that sun-facing slopes offer better solar exposure than flat land. According to Yezin Taha, co-founder and CEO of Nevados Engineering, modeling has shown that trackers on a 17% slope can capture 6% more solar energy than trackers on flat ground, and up to 30% more energy than fixed tilt systems.
Development of terrain following trackers began in about 2014, according to Frank Oudheusden of Azimuth Advisory Services, when Nevados began its R&D process, winning a 2015-2016 SunShot award from the U.S. Department of Energy. Today all the top tracking companies have terrain following solutions. According to Wood Mackenzie, the 2021 market leaders were Nextracker, Array Technologies, PVHardware, STI Norland (recently acquired by Array) and Soltec. While the terrain following market is still too young to have strong market data, Oudheusden said that the fact that these market leaders are developing all-terrain solutions indicates a strong market demand.
From a developer’s standpoint, the need for terrain following trackers is essentially based on the fact that traditional trackers cannot hold up in the hilly terrain and possibly rugged climate. Cost is also a factor. When installing on uneven terrain, developers encounter land grading cost estimates of more than 5% of total project budget just to make the land smooth enough for traditional trackers. In the process they have also removed all vegetation and top layers of earth.
The terrain following trackers that use adaptive tracking sensors were recently introduced to meet the need for solar in challenging and sloped landscapes. Adaptive tracking, as described by Annie Rabi Bernard, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, offers row-wise independence for module control, maintenance and construction. These trackers can be designed for hilly regions that may have difficult or no grid access with power provided by dedicated solar panels.
“To tackle high/strong wind scenarios, tracker vendors have deviated from the traditional damping and stowing norms and introduced structures with overdamping and stowing modules at a zero-degree angles,” said Rabi Bernard. “These experiments resulted in increased structural stability of tracker rows and enabled projects to expand geographically into high-wind regions while preventing energy losses.”
Nevados, the company that Oudheusden believes started the terrain following revolution, now offers the All Terrain Tracker that fits to undulating terrain due to its design that integrates the driveline and articulating capability into the same components.
Jenya Meydbray, chief commercial officer at Nevados said that the proprietary design sets the All Terrain Tracker apart from its competitors, with bearings that allow for installation on slopes up to 37% with slope changes as great as 26% across a foundation. Other unique design aspects include non-continuous torque tubes, shorter pilings, and large tolerances, all of which simplify and speed up the installation, Meydbray said. Top-clamp clips also reportedly help solar modules to align during installation, and accommodate different module sizes. The torque tube and damper designs improve wind performance and Meydbray noted, have proven to withstand hurricane-force winds with zero structural damage.
A few unusual designs were introduced in attempts to take on some of the challenges inherent in the undulating and sometimes harsh terrain.
Rute Foundation Systems has an unusual design in its Suntracker system with trackers suspended by cables, introduced to serve the agrivoltaic sector. The company says it offers the lowest levelized cost of energy for high-clearance solar. Rute also reports that by using cables rather than steel foundations, steel use is reduced by as much as 30%. A big advantage for all terrain following systems is that the land doesn’t have to be disturbed, but with the Suntracker it is disturbed even less due to not having to drive piles into the ground for the installation.

Polar Racking’s Axsus Sol-X tracker is an innovative design that was developed in collaboration with leading automotive manufacturers. The Sol-X terrain following tracker was acquired through Axsus and Polar Racking has installed 200 MW, with up to 400 MW expected to enter construction in 2023. By applying automotive manufacturing best practices for a modular, on-site factory process, Polar Racking has increased assembly efficiencies, according to Vishal Lala, managing director at the company.
The Sol-X tracker features independent tables that can hold 6 to 24 modules per table for a total of up to 180 modules per row that are all controlled by a single motor. The table purlin design and flexible drive shaft allow it to follow the undulations of the terrain. Additionally, the Sol-X is can connect directly to various types of foundations, such as ground screws, helical piles, driven piles, and concrete ballasts for landfills.
Its purlin table design also allows for greater pile and assembly tolerances that the company says allows for a much simpler and quicker installation.
Like other single-axis tracker specialists, Nextracker released the NX Horizon-XTR in 2022. A runner up in pv magazine’s BoS award for 2022, the XTR follows undulating terrain while reducing installation costs. 
Alex Roedel, vice president of design and engineering at Nextracker noted that putting traditional trackers on undulating land requires longer foundation piles and more grading, thus adding to the cost, plus requires time to allow regrowth of vegetation. The XTR presents none of these challenges, Roedel said, as it requires 30% to 90% less grading and reduces foundation steel.
With less grading needed, much of the vegetation can be left intact, making trackers a practical solution in agrivoltaic installations. Nick de Vries, senior vice president of technology and asset management at Silicon Ranch has worked on Nextracker XTR installations and said that the fact that the XTR reduces earthwork and disturbs less topsoil is a big advantage for this agrivoltaic specialist. Nextracker’s XTR is moving into the European market with the recent announcement that the German international solar developer, IbVogt, chose Nextracker’s XTR for the 150 MW Garnacha solar power plant in Spain. The project is backed by a 12-year power purchase agreement with Google and is expected to begin production October of 2023.
Upward trajectory
Tracker R&D groups continue to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning platforms to reduce stowing times to as low as under two minutes and smart-weather sensors that are capable of cloud and wind interactions, aiming for additional power output.
While the terrain following market is still nascent, it won’t be for long, as exemplified by solutions announced by all the major tracker manufacturers. The build out of solar across the globe will increasingly look to rolling hills and challenging landscapes, and developers will have a myriad of solutions to keep solar tracking the sun.
