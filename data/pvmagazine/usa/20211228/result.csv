The company also sports solar installations on its plants in Peachtree, Georgia., Adelanto, California, and Clinton, Illinois.
Spier Commercial & Industrial of New Braunfels, Texas undertook the project, installing a 165 kW grid-tied photovoltaic system at McElroy Metal’s Sunnyvale plant. The Seraphim Energy panels were installed on a recent addition to the facility, which was topped with McElroy Metal’s 238T symmetrical standing seam panels.
The panels were fastened to the standing seam roof with products from S-5!, which are designed specifically for standing seam metal roofing. S-5!’s systems use clamps designed to grab and attach onto metal roofs, both at the edge and across the surface, rather than penetrating the roof, which would severely compromise a seam roof.
The project is comprised of 352 470 W Seraphim solar panels, which will generate approximately 261,574 kWh each year. The system is estimated to reduce the facility’s grid energy usage by 46%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/28/a-provisional-victory-was-scored-for-massachusetts-pv-interconnection-whats-next/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 28, 2021",A provisional victory was scored for Massachusetts PV interconnection. What’s next?,"This June, aging grid and high interconnection costs for a growing backlog of renewable energy projects became the focus of Massachusetts state legislators and solar industry leaders.
In a letter to the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), 25 state legislators voiced support for an interconnection cost allocation approach that would help ensure solar initiatives currently in Eversource and National Grid group interconnection studies can move forward in a fair, timely, and financially viable fashion.
Typically, interconnection in the state has occurred in a rolling single-basis fashion. With the advent of the Massachusetts SMART incentive program, an influx of new solar projects entered the interconnection queue. This led Eversource and National Grid to implement group studies to approve interconnection.

About 679 MW of solar were actively under review in the group studies, which began October 2020. Some projects submitted interconnection applications as long as three years ago and may have to wait an additional five years for upgrades to be completed, according to the letter. It called for a provisional interconnection cost-sharing solution for solar projects currently in development, targeting cost estimates from utilities in the next 1-3 years before system plans are approved.
In an interview with pv magazine, Jessica Robertson, Borrego Solar director of policy and business development, said “If we don’t have a new way of structuring cost allocation, the costs for all these projects will be prohibitive, and they will be cancelled.”
She warned that multiple solar projects would end up going back to the starting line without a process to share costs. The letter to the DPU estimated a potential loss of 6,800 jobs, and $300 million in lost municipal revenue due to interconnection costs and delays.
Borrego Director of Interconnection Policy Kathryn Cox-Arslan said one area for improvement is the concept of “free-ridership.” Projects that can afford the cost of interconnection upgrades are able to move forward, while other projects follow and take advantage of the enabled capacity.
“Projects should be paying their fair share for system access, but there should also be an acknowledgement that those upgrades don’t benefit just one facility, but support multiple facilities,” said Cox-Arslan this June.
On the eve of this Thanksgiving, the DPU approved the provisional solution the letter requested, granting cost estimates to the roughly 679 MW of solar in development stuck in group studies in the state.
The provisional program essentially allows for broad cost-sharing for upgrades to transmission due to interconnection of the new projects that were in group study. It addresses the free-ridership issue, shifting some of the costs onto future projects that will take advantage of the same upgrades spurred by these group study projects.

Transmission upgrades, distribution upgrades, or substation enhancements that will benefit multiple projects, not just the pioneering project that spurred the upgrade, can now be determined Capital Improvement Projects (CIPs) by the utility. Importantly, the CIPs must be completed within four years, and the CIPs cannot exceed $500/kW, setting a cap on what may have been cost-prohibitive fee for Borrego and many developers in the state. Developers face other fees, like express feeders and point-of-connection costs, so this cap was an important step, said Cox-Arslan.
Robertson said this may be the first time in the country’s history that upgrades are cost-allocated in this fashion, with a recognition that more distributed generation (DG) projects will interconnect in the future, shifting some costs ahead to those projects. “We’re not just being reactive, but taking a longer-term approach,” she said.
It bears keeping in mind that this cost-sharing structure is a provisional order, and only for the projects under group study. However, DPU is working on the long-term vision for the state, and developers are calling for this type of cost-sharing to be applied to all future projects.
Robertson said Borrego is pushing for the cost-sharing for CIPs in the long-term plan to go a bit further than the provisional plan does, and she is hopeful this model will be adopted by other DPUs in other states.
The current CIP projects must now be justified to the DPU by the utility to approve the costs of the upgrades. Most of the group studies are not complete yet, and then they will have to enter an adjudicatory process. Cox-Arslan is hopeful that the DPU recognizes the urgency of the projects currently held up and that the CIP adjudication will happen in a timely manner.
On the long-term plan, the DPU has not expressly stated what its vision is yet, or what the horizon will be to develop and implement it. First, a department order must be created, and then the utilities must run a study on what the impacts of the new cost-sharing structure would be, which they said could take at least a year. After that, that plan would need to be implemented, which faces further approval.
Cox-Arslan and Robertson are hopeful that this long-term plan will be developed in tandem with the completion of the provisional CIP plans.
Time is of the essence. The Massachusetts clean energy and climate plan calls for a 2030 emissions limit at least 50% below the 1990 baseline. To decarbonize the grid, it will be important for Massachusetts DPU and the state’s utilities to speed the review processes, while developing a plan that integrates solar as long-lasting, resilient infrastructure.

The 293 MW Sun Mountain solar project is set to be located in Pueblo, Colorado, and the 173 MW Bellflower solar project is set to be constructed about 40 miles east of Indianapolis in Henry and Rush Counties, Indiana. While a full project timeline is not available for the Sun Mountain solar project, the Bellflower solar project is expected to be completed in 2022.
The two projects each have power purchase agreements (PPA) in place. Sun Mountain’s PPA is with Xcel Energy, a utility with service in Colorado, and will complement Xcel Energy’s broader Colorado Energy Plan to deliver 55% renewable energy to the grid and reduce carbon emissions 60% by 2026.  It also supports Colorado’s clean energy goal to reduce emissions statewide 26% by 2025, 50% by 2030, and 90% by 2050.
The project is nearby to Lightsource’s Bighorn solar project, also located in Pueblo. That 300 MW project is primarily located on 1,800 acres of Evraz Rocky Mountain Steel property in Pueblo. It is one of the largest on-site solar facilities in the U.S. dedicated to a single customer, with more than 750,000 solar panels. The plant recycles scrap metal to produce new steel products, including railroad track. This project also has a PPA in place with Xcel Energy.
The Sun Mountain Solar project is expected to create 300 jobs during the 12-to-14-month construction period, to be filled mainly by local workers. Nearly 100 of the workers from Bighorn Solar will be transitioning to construct Sun Mountain, with 200 additional workers to be recruited from the local community. The Bellflower project will create about 200 jobs during construction.
Bellflower has a virtual PPA in place with Verizon Communications, furthering Verizon’s goal of being carbon neutral in its operations by 2035.
Bellflower and Sun Mountain were financed under a 466 MW, $376 million portfolio financing package. The tax equity investment for the portfolio was secured from Bank of America, marking its fourth transaction with Lightsource bp over the past two years. Debt for the portfolio was provided by ING Capital, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, HSBC Bank USA, and NatWest.

The office aims to close critical innovation gaps on the path to net-zero emissions by 2050.
The office is funded as a part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that provides more than $20 billion to support clean energy technology demonstration projects in areas including clean hydrogen, carbon capture, grid-scale energy storage, small modular reactors, and more. Demonstration projects prove the effectiveness of innovative technologies in real-world conditions at scale in order to pave the way toward widespread adoption and deployment.
“Thanks to the investments Congress made in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations will move clean energy technologies out of the lab and into local and regional economies across the country, proving the value of technologies that can deliver for communities, businesses, and markets,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “This new office will hire the best and brightest talent to invest in cutting edge clean energy projects, and DOE is calling on anyone dedicated to addressing the climate crisis to roll up their sleeves and join us.”
“This new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations reflects President Biden’s commitment to help Americans turn on the lights in their homes, drive to work, and power their businesses using clean, affordable, and sustainable energy. This office will make life easier and safer for Americans all across the country,” said Mitch Landrieu, White House Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator.
This investment in the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations is part of the $62 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that intends to promote clean energy demonstrations that will deliver clean technologies to communities and businesses across the country. In addition to moving the country closer to achieving its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, projects funded by these demonstrations will total in the hundreds of millions or multiple billions of dollars in scale. Additional follow-on investments from the private sector will likely occur.
Rural areas and economically hard-hit areas are a major focus of the programs, with billions of dollars to be invested in demonstration projects in these communities – a critical focus of President Biden’s Justice40 initiative. The initiative is aimed at delivering 40% of clean energy investment benefits to disadvantaged communities and those that are experiencing the first and worst impacts of climate change. The DOE intends that the office will engage environmental justice groups, labor, and communities to help shape program development and execution. In addition to the large-scale projects, DOE will continue to support many smaller-scale pilots and demonstrations that are needed to meet the Administration’s climate goals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/28/stepping-up-in-2021-2-solar-workers-rights-and-leading-by-positive-example/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,WORLD",BECKY BEETZ,"DECEMBER 28, 2021",Stepping UP in 2021: #2 Solar workers’ rights and leading by positive example,"2021 saw increasing calls for supply chain transparency, including EU draft legislation published on corporate due diligence and accountability to improve upon the currently available voluntary measures, which have been described as largely ineffective.
Meanwhile, in the first two months of 2021, leading European and U.S. trade associations and analysts spoke out against forced labor in China’s Xinjiang province, where 40% of the world’s polysilicon is currently manufactured.
In response, The US Solar Energies Industry Association launched a Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol, in April, which offers guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.”
Following this, on June 24, the US Government decided to ban products from four Xinjiang-based solar manufacturers over alleged forced labor allegations. This decision has affected global supply chains as companies seek to find new suppliers.
Xinjiang sanctions and the PV supply chain: Due to forced labor concerns, a ban on imports from Xinjiang to the United States appears likely. This could be another blow for polysilicon producers hit by industrial accidents and the threat of floods in the third quarter of 2020. Chinese polysilicon prices have surged more than 50% in a matter of months. Consequently, wafer prices have skyrocketed, bringing increasing costs to the solar cell and PV module segments. In the face of price hikes, some projects are now postponed until the first half of 2021.
Leveling the playing field: For a truly successful clean energy transition, the solar industry must also address other toxic issues that continue to arise, including workers’ rights.
Why human rights protection is pushing up module prices: The solar industry typically sees itself as being supportive of the environment, humanity, and human rights. Even large Chinese PV manufacturers publish statements to this effect, particularly if they are listed on Western stock exchanges. But what do human rights have to do with the solar industry? What connections exist, asks Martin Schachinger of pvXchange, and how are they important to the future success of the European PV market?
Polysilicon from Xinjiang: a balanced view: As of March, the United States and Europe were considering sanctions on polysilicon from Xinjiang, China, due to concerns over forced labor. The U.S. government has already barred entry for all cotton products and tomatoes from the region. However, as BloombergNEF analyst Jenny Chase writes, there is no evidence that forced labor is used in polysilicon production in Xinjiang – in fact, the economics might point against it.
Unchained: Political moves shift solar supply: PV module supply chains to the U.S. industry are in flux, and not for the first time. Moves to take action alongside stimulus measures aimed at clean energy are changing the way in which U.S. developers and installers source modules, writes David Wagman, senior editor of pv magazine USA.
Solar ethics, forced labor: The U.S. solar industry has condemned all forms of forced labor and we are committed to ensuring that solar products coming into the U.S. do not contain anything made using forced labor.
Toward traceability: Supply chain auditing has long played an important role in the PV industry, ensuring contracted standards are met and quality is maintained in manufacturing. And with a growing movement calling for ethical and sustainable practices across the solar supply chain, the process could soon take on a new dimension.
Getting on the front foot: For the effective rollout of the global energy transition we urgently need, the time has come to ensure that all aspects of solar and energy storage supply chains are transparent, sustainable, and just. But how can this be achieved? And are there tangible business advantages to be reaped? As part of our Q2 UP Initiative focus on workers’ rights, pv magazine has compiled a five-step guide for best practice in supply chain management.
SEIA seeks supply chain transparency: As ethical concerns around the solar supply chain grow, the U.S.-based Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has a new tool for improving transparency, backed by a traceability protocol. In late April, SEIA released the protocol, which it said would improve supply chain transparency and help ensure that solar components headed for U.S. projects are “made ethically throughout the solar value chain.” pv magazine USA’s David Wagman takes a closer look.
Webinar: Supply chain transparency on the rise – Where is the solar industry?
Op-ed: Greening solar supply chains – As solar energy experiences record growth, investors, customers, and regulators are increasingly asking for more disclosure and transparency on how solar supply chains are managed throughout product life cycles.
Check out the coverage from our UP Initiative Q1 theme: Agri-PV from Dec. 27. The Q3 theme: Sustainable electricity and corporates’ critical solar role, will publish on Dec. 29. In Q1 2022, meanwhile, we will be focusing on the rise of e-mobility and how it can complement the renewable energy transition. Specifically, we will examine the role electric vehicles, trains, and two- and three-wheelers can play in greening the electricity grid.

The solar + storage project has an intended generation capacity of up to 530 MWac  with an up to 600 MWac battery energy storage system. Once fully deployed, Aratina will produce enough clean electricity to power 180,000 homes. The electricity generated by the Aratina Solar Center will be transmitted to utilities and community energy providers throughout California.
Plans were altered after the County’s review and feedback from local residents indicated there was concern about neighbors’ views. The company states on its website that it “listened to the concerns and have incorporated them into a revised design that increases project setbacks from residential areas by up to a half-mile (almost nine football fields)”.
Read “California officials consider 500 MW solar project”.
The revised site design, referred to as Aratina 2.0 by Kern County, increases project setbacks from Boron and Desert Lake’s residential areas. In addition, the company believes that the raised bed railroad that runs by the location and vegetation alongside the road will reduce visibility of the project. Watch this video in which the project developer simulates project visibility.
The Aratina Solar Center site is currently undergoing a geotechnical analysis and topographical survey that will determine the soil composition subsurface and identify potential constraints, such as existing infrastructure or well heads.
