Sun Engine, the combined companies’ community solar software platform, will now manage more than 130 MW of community solar and virtual net metered renewable energy projects, enough to power more than 15,000 homes.
The two brands will continue operations under the Neighborhood Sun brand, and Astral Power’s leadership team will join Neighborhood Sun under CEO Gary Skulnik. Astral Power investors, including co-founder Wilson Chang, will join the board of the combined entity.
The two companies expect the merger to provide higher customer value through scaling efficiencies. “Virtual net metered projects are one of the most compelling growth areas within distributed generation and one of the most efficient ways for lower income communities to benefit from renewable energy,” said Chang in a statement.
Neighborhood Sun has operated in New Jersey, Maryland, New York, and Washington, D.C., delivering projects in multiple utility service areas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/01/partnership-formed-for-molten-salt-long-duration-energy-storage/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 1, 2021",Partnership formed for molten salt long duration energy storage,"Malta, developer of electro-thermal energy storage systems, announced its partnership with Bechtel, an engineering, construction and project management firm.
Malta’s system, developed in partnership with Siemens Energy, is energy-source agnostic, able to collect and store energy from solar, wind, or fossil fuels. Its long-duration capability of 10-150+ hours is particularly well-suited to support renewable energy, storing and dispatching power during the intermittent cycles of generation (day to night), and can perform other grid services.
First, energy is gathered, and then moved through a heat pump, converting electrical energy into thermal energy by creating a temperature difference. The heat is stored in molten salt, and the cold is stored in a chilled liquid. When it is time to dispatch the power, the temperature difference is converted back to electrical energy with a heat engine. Finally, it is distributed back to the grid as needed.
“The lack of long-duration energy storage solutions remains a key challenge for the renewable energy industry,” said Bechtel renewables sector lead Scott Austin. “There is no silver bullet for decarbonization.” A similar sentiment was shared in the pv magazine Roundtables USA 2021 session, where it was discussed that a mix of distributed generation and shorter duration storage with large-scale renewable deployment and long-duration storage would offer the fastest path to decarbonization.
Malta said its solution has applications in replacing retired fossil-fuel assets like coal-fired power plants, with the ability to reuse existing infrastructure. Additionally, it can be used as an alternative to transmission system updates, also using existing infrastructure, said the company.

The Gem Energy Storage Center would be located in Kern County, a recent hotbed for development of utility-scale solar projects. The storage center would use Hydrostor’s Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) system.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It first compresses off-peak or surplus energy from the grid, producing heated compressed air. Next, the heat is extracted from the air stream and stored inside a thermal store, saving the energy for later use. The compressed air is stored in a tank that uses a process called hydrostatic compensation to maintain constant pressure during operation.  When the energy needs to be dispatched, pressure forces air to the surface, where it is then recombined with heat, and sent through an air turbine, producing dispatchable electricity.

The project is expected to make commercial operation date as early as 2026, playing a role in the region’s energy supply and reliability needs. The project is expected to help meet the growing share of renewable energy power peak demand for the greater Los Angeles region and the broader grid.
About 30 to 40 full-time permanent jobs, and roughly 700 four-year construction jobs, are expected when the project commences. Tax revenues of about $500 million are expected for Kern County.
Gem is planned to interconnect at the Whirlwind Substation under California Independent System Operator (CAISO) delivery, or at the planned Rosamond Switching Station, under Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) delivery. In June 2021, the California Public Utilities Commission adopted a decision to procure 1,000 MW of long-duration energy storage, with durations of eight hours or longer.
Hydrostor said the A-CAES system can operate for 50 years with little to no degradation.

Once operational, the project will provide monthly energy savings to around 1,300 residential and small commercial customers across Maryland. The installation will be operated by Summit Ridge Energy, with the company splitting ownership of the installation with Annapolis-based climate investment firm Hannon Armstrong.
Black Bear Energy facilitated the partnership between SRE and STAG while Powerflex provided engineering, procurement and construction services.  
Project completion brings Summit Ridge’s Maryland rooftop community solar portfolio to more than 75 MW, enough to power nearly 11,000 homes. Nearly one-third of the projects will serve low-to-moderate income customers.
In September, regulators unanimously voted to expand the capacity of the state’s community solar program to serve an additional 6,840 Maryland homes annually, as well as improve access for low- and moderate-income (LMI) customer participation in the state’s community solar pilot program.
Summit Ridge is also constructing two rooftop community solar arrays in Maryland with a combined capacity of 2.7 MW on a pair of industrial buildings owned by BentallGreenOak. Those arrays are expected to supply enough electricity to meet the annual demand of around 300 homes upon their completion in the second quarter of 2022.

A mediator led negotiation defined the financial benefits for the community.
Kahana Solar has agreed to deliver a legally enforceable, fixed commitment fund to benefit the local community totaling $1,375,000 over 25 years. The agreement states that Kahana cannot review which organizations receive money for the first five years. After that period, it  can give feedback and verify aligned missions.
The groups also agreed that Kahana would give preference to hiring qualified laborers from West Maui, Maui County, and the State of Hawaii, in that order, for construction and operations/maintenance employment, before hiring non-resident laborers. Additionally, at least 80% of non-supervisory construction and operations workers’ hours must be paid at prevailing wages.
Innergex said in its filings it is common for it to offer 1% of a project’s revenue to the local community.
The solar power facility signed a 25-year fixed price agreement to sell its electricity at roughly 8.9¢/kWh. The retail price of electricity on the Hawaiian Island is around 35¢/kWh. The facility will export an estimated 74,621 MWh in its first year of operation. The Public Utility Commission said the maximum revenue paid to the facility will be $6,677,000 per year.
The 20 MWac site will contain around 90,000 solar modules at 400 watts of greater, – totaling 36 MWdc, according to a 2019 site plan. The module count could fall as module wattage has increased in the past two years.
As is now required for all utility solar power plants in Hawaii, the facility will also contain an energy storage facility equal to the peak solar power grid output, plus four hours of storage, equal to 20 MW/80 MWh.
With an annual output of 74,000 MWh and a solar module volume of 36 MWdc, the facility will have a power production ratio of just over 2.0 and a DC to AC, solar panel to inverter capacity, ratio of 1.8 to 1.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority finalized contracts with Clean Path New York LLC for its Clean Path NY project and with H.Q. Energy Services Inc. for its Champlain Hudson Power Express project. Both are expected to deliver renewable energy from upstate New York and Canada to New York City.
The Champlain Hudson Power Express is a proposed high-voltage direct current submarine transmission project that would link the Montreal area to New York City.
Clean Path NY is an $11 billion infrastructure project which, once completed, is expected to deliver more than 7.5 million MWh of energy into New York City annually. The project could support 1.8 GW of solar and 2 GW of onshore wind across 20 solar and wind projects.
The two ventures are expected to deliver up to $7.4 billion in benefits statewide. This includes greenhouse gas reductions and air quality improvements, and $8.2 billion in economic development across the state with a focus on investments in disadvantaged communities.
The projects are expected to reduce the city’s fossil fuel use for electricity by more than 80% by 2030 when combined with the state’s deployment of clean energy and offshore wind. When completed, they are expected to provide more than a third of New York City’s annual electric consumption.
Contracts have been submitted to state public utility regulators for approval, and are subject to a public comment period that will run through Feb. 7. If approved, NYSERDA payments will start once each project has obtained all required permits and approvals, has completed construction, and is delivering power to New York City. That is expected in 2025 for Champlain Hudson Power Express and 2027 for Clean Path NY.
Project developers committed to prevailing wage and project labor agreements to ensure the quality of labor and wages for local workers.
