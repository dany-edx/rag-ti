The acquisition solidifies Sunstone Credit’s position as a financial platform for small and medium-sized businesses interested in adopting solar.
Historically, many small and medium-sized businesses have lacked access to loans for solar installations, leaving them with the options to pay cash or enter into a power purchase agreement. Sunstone said it is on a mission to close this lending gap and provide more businesses with simple and cost-effective loan financing.
Sunstone said it expects the Orka acquisition to help it serve more contractors and businesses through its proprietary technology platform. As part of the acquisition, key members of Orka’s team will join Sunstone as advisors, including chief executive officer Ted Fawcett.
“ORKA has built an impressive program evaluating businesses for solar loans efficiently, helping those businesses access the many benefits of solar more quickly,” said Josh Goldberg, chief executive officer and co-founder of Sunstone.
The commercial solar sector installed 363 MW in Q3 2023, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Commercial solar encompasses distributed solar projects with commercial, industrial, agricultural, school, government, or nonprofit offtakers, including remotely net-metered projects. SEIA projected a 9% growth for 2023, and expects more near-term growth in 2024.
“We expect to see an average of 8% growth over the next five years,” said SEIA in its Q4 2023 solar market insight report. “Even though growth in some more saturated states is slowing, development in emerging markets will increase.”
SEIA said the commercial solar sector installed about 1.7 GW in 2023, and it expects deployments to reach 2.4 GW annually by 2028.
The acquisition of Orka follows an October 2023 transaction in which solar lender Sunlight Financial filed for bankruptcy and was acquired by a consortium of players in the space. The consortium acquiring the business includes Greenbacker Capital Management, Sunstone Credit, IGS Ventures, and secured lender Cross River Bank. The businesses operate as ED Umbrella Holdings, LLC and have entered into a restructuring support agreement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/11/hawaiian-utility-to-balance-grid-with-540-mwh-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,HAWAII",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 11, 2024",Hawaiian utility to balance grid with 565 MWh battery,"Plus Power announced it has begun operations for its Kapolei Energy Storage (KES) facility on Oahu, Hawaii, helping the state in its transition from fossil fuels to solar and wind. 
The KES project adds 135 MW / 540 MWh to the Hawaiian Electric grid, with an additional 50 MW / 25 MWh of additional “fast frequency response” to support grid stability.
The advanced battery has “virtual inertia” to replicate the power-smoothing function of a conventional spinning turbine. It has “black start” capabilities, which supports grid recovery in the event of a blackout. 
“It’s the first time a battery has been used by a major utility to balance the grid: providing fast frequency response, synthetic inertia, and black start,” said Brandon Keefe, executive chairman, Plus Power. This project is a postcard from the future — batteries will soon be providing these services, at scale, on the mainland.”   
Located on 8 acres of industrial land on the southwest side of Oahu, the project is comprised of 158 Tesla Megapack 2 XL lithium-ferro-phosphate batteries, each about the size of a shipping container. 
The battery can serve as a grid “shock absorber,” serving a role normally performed by combustion-powered plants. It can respond to grid signals in 250 milliseconds, far faster than the several minutes that conventional power plants take to fire up. 
“Energy storage technology that responds quickly to constantly changing conditions is an essential tool for us to use to manage the grid and operate it as efficiently as possible,” said Jim Alberts, senior vice president and chief operations officer, Hawaiian Electric. 
Solar power has become abundant, leading Hawaiian Electric to have to curtail, or turn off, large volumes of utility-scale solar and wind to keep the system in balance. The new energy storage capacity is expected to allow the utility to reduce renewable energy curtailments by 69%. It is also expected to enable 10% more new utility-scale renewables on the grid than previous models allowed. 
Hawaiian Electric said it expects the battery to save its customers on electricity bills. The utility estimates the battery will reduce electric bills by $0.28 per month over its 20-year contract life. 
The KES battery plant is interconnected near three of Hawaiian Electric’s critical power generation facilities, enabling a rapid reboot of those power plants in the event of an island-wide emergency. This is known as “black start” capability. 
The batteries will help replace grid capacity formerly provided by an AES coal-fired power plant less than a mile away. The plant used to provide about 20% of Oahu’s electricity, home to nearly one million residents. The plant closed in September 2022. 
Project developer, owner, and operator Plus Power has a development portfolio of over 10 GW of projects in transmission queues across 28 states and Canada. It has over $1.8 billion in project financings announced as of October 2023. The company expects to be operating seven additional large-scale energy storage plants across Arizona and Texas, adding 1325 MW / 3500 MWh of storage by June 2024. 
“Our projects, like KES, help our customers provide affordable, reliable, clean electricity on hot summer afternoons and cold winter nights, while enabling the decarbonization of the electric grid,” said Keefe.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/11/solar-workers-furloughed-days-after-unionizing/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 11, 2024",Solar workers furloughed days after unionizing,"EmPower Solar, a prominent New York-based commercial solar developer and installer, recently furloughed 40% of its workforce into 2025, and others into 2026. The layoffs came one week after employees voted to join the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 259.
According to union documents filed with the National Labor Relations Board, a December 21, 2023 vote was taken by 49 EmPower Solar employees, driven by concerns over working conditions and safety, as well as job security and equitable compensation. Of the votes, 29 were in favor of unionizing, 16 were opposed, one vote was challenged, and the last few votes were left uncounted.
Only two days before the official union vote, Empower Solar filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the union engaged in “coercion, incl’g statements or acts of violence,” in violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

Since the furlough, workers have picketed the EmPower Solar facilities.
EmPower Solar told the New York Focus, “The decision to furlough had nothing to do with the UAW or results of the union vote.” Company leaders cite macroeconomic factors such as high interest rates and inflation as the primary reasons for the reduced demand for their services.
However, the timing of these announcements – just after a significant unionization event – is strategically inopportune for the company. The UAW and the affected employees, have categorized the actions as deliberate, retaliatory union busting.

At the time of furloughing these employees, EmPower’s website listed 13 positions for new full-time employees. The following positions were still listed on the company website as of January 11, 2024:

Under the NLRA, Section 8(a)(3) strictly prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for unionizing. This section forbids firing as a form of penalty due to union activities or sympathies. Simultaneously, the NLRA protects employers from union coercion, as stated in section 8(b)(1)(A). This section prohibits unions from restraining or coercing employees in exercising their rights under the act, including the right to refrain from union activities.
The Solar Energy Industry Association shows that community scale solar coming online has slowed in 2023, while commercial installations have stayed constant.

Recently, The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Laborers International Union of North America, and the International Union of Operating Engineers have signed a national tri-trade solar agreement. The agreement specifies the roles of each union in utility-scale solar projects across the United States (California excluded).
 
This article was amended to reflect that while the website listed many open positions at the time of furlough, the website has now been updated to show just one open position.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/11/acculon-launches-production-of-sodium-ion-battery-modules-packs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 11, 2024","Acculon launches production of sodium-ion battery modules, packs","From pv magazine Global
As the sodium-ion battery technology continues to mature, new product and manufacturing announcements are coming thick and fast from newcomers and established players alike.
With mainly pilot plants or small manufacturing lines up and running today, U.S.-based battery system developer and manufacturer Acculon Energy has started the series production of its sodium-ion battery modules and packs and unveiled plans to scale its production to 2 GWh by mid-2024.
Acculon’s first two sodium-ion products support a range of applications and are available in small and large modules, capable of building into varying capacities and voltage levels. The product are meeting the safety requirements of UL standards like 2271, 2580, 1973, and 9540, and comply with stringent UN regulations.
The company has been conducting research and development with the technology since its inception in 2009, “culminating in the commercialization of sodium-ion products poised to meet the ever-growing power demands of its OEM customers.”
“We’ve seen the technology readiness level and availability of sodium cells improve impressively over the past two years,” said Acculon President Andrew Thomas. “Along the way, we’ve invested heavily to validate cells in our renowned test lab and conduct pre-certification destructive testing. Our customers demand durable performance and a compelling value proposition–our sodium-ion batteries will achieve both.”
Previously, Acculon Energy revealed some results of its own research into sodium-ion cells, which it described as “promising.”
“On one of the high-energy sodium-ion cell types, we are now about the 300th cycle of 0.5 C rate cycling at room temperature with full depth of discharge and getting 96.3% of maximum capacity,” the company said in a press release in October. “Based on the linear degradation trend, the 80% capacity limit is projected to be reached after about 1650 cycles. This impressive level of durability, if achieved, could open a door to numerous diverse applications.”
There are also other aspects that make sodium-ion batteries a viable alternative to lithium-ion technology, such as superior environmental credentials, enhanced safety, and better raw material costs.
According to UK-based market research company IDTechEx, a sodium ion battery with a layered metal oxide cathode and hard carbon anode will have approximately 25% to 30% lower material costs than an lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. However, significant savings are unlikely initially as the technology will take time to scale.
Taking different chemistries into account, IDTechEx calculates that the average cell cost for sodium-ion batteries is $87/kWh. By the end of the decade, the production cost of sodium-ion battery cells using primarily iron and manganese will probably bottom out at around $40/kWh, which would be around $50/kWh at the pack level, the research company says. By comparison, BNEF’s analysis found LFP average cell prices fell below $100/kWh in 2023.
In its latest report on sodium-ion technology, IDTechEx calculates that the capacities that have been publicly announced by various raw material and battery manufacturers alone add up to well over 100 GWh by 2030. “By 2025, significantly more capacity can be built up than that has been financed so far if investors are found for it in the course of 2024,” the research firm said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/11/first-solar-opens-manufacturing-plant-in-india/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,INDIANA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 11, 2024",First Solar opens manufacturing plant in India,"First Solar, Inc. inaugurated its new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India, with a capacity of 3.3 GW.
India’s first fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing plant will produce First Solar’s Series 7 solar PV modules that were developed at the company’s research centers in the U.S. and optimized for the Indian market, the company says. The facility employs approximately 1,000 people.
“We are pleased that First Solar chose Tamil Nadu for this landmark investment, solidifying our state’s position as India’s hub for manufacturing,” said Dr T R B Rajaa. “This factory sets a high bar for sustainability and advanced manufacturing and has created high-value jobs as a result of its presence in our state, all while supporting India’s ambition to become self-sufficient in solar technology.”
The company reports an investment of approximately $700 million in the facility in India, which includes $500 million in previously announced financing from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the facility is First Solar’s sixth operational factory in the world, with others in the U.S., Malaysia and Vietnam.
“The United States is leveraging American innovation and technology to diversify critical energy supply chains around the world and drive economic growth in India,” said DFC CEO, Scott Nathan. “That’s good for the United States and it’s good for India. This $500 million in financing reflects the increasing strength of our partnership with India – DFC’s largest market and a like-minded partner with a dynamic private sector.”
First Solar reports that its thin film PV modules are produced using a continuous process under one roof that does not rely on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains. Its proprietary, vertically integrated process takes about four hours to turn sheets of glass into fully functioning solar panels, the company says. Each module has a layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor, derived from byproducts of copper and zinc mining, which First Solar says have several benefits compared to conventional c-Si, including lower cost, superior scalability and a higher theoretical efficiency limit.
The Series 7 module produced by the new facility has a carbon and water footprint that is about four times lower than crystalline silicon modules produced in China, the company reports, using 50% less energy and only a third of the water than an equivalent polysilicon module production facility would require.
The factory in India is located in an area of high baseline water stress, and the company says it is believed to be the world’s first net-zero water withdrawal solar manufacturing facility. The facility will rely entirely on tertiary treated reverse osmosis water from the city’s sewage treatment plant and have zero wastewater discharge, expected to relieve stress on the local water system. Additionally, the factory is home to India’s first solar PV recycling plant.
“One month ago in Dubai, COP28 participants issued a bold call for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,” said Ambassador Eric Garcetti. “This First Solar production facility will help advance our global transition to cleaner, greener energy, and stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when the United States and India work together – across government and private sectors – to achieve lasting climate action.”
According to its Q3 2023 earnings report, the company delivered gross margins significantly higher than Wall Street expectations. Gross margins came in at 47%, higher than the consensus of 39%. Gross margins improved based on lower sales freight costs, higher module average sales prices, and a higher volume of U.S.-produced modules, which make them eligible for the 45x tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. First Solar was also the first company to close two separate tax credit transfer agreements, selling $500 million and $200 million of Inflation Reduction Act advanced manufacturing tax credits.
The company continues to grow its manufacturing capacity in the U.S., and expects to have 25 GW of global annual nameplate capacity by 2026.
Founded in 1999, First Solar is among the world’s ten largest solar manufacturers. It sets itself apart, however, by being the only U.S.-headquartered company in the top ten that is not manufacturing in China.
