The round was led by Decarbonization Partners, a partnership between Blackrock and Temasek.
The funds are expected to help Antora ramp up production of its factory-made thermal batteries. Industrial processes represent roughly 30% of global emissions, and BloombergNEF reports that industrial heat represents about 15% of the global emissions total.
Heavy industry, particularly high-heat processes, are considered a “hard-to-decarbonize” sector. Antora’s thermal batteries seek to address high-heat intensive industries like steel and cement production.
The company’s thermal battery absorbs solar and wind power during hours of peak production when these electricity sources are the least expensive. It is made of carbon blocks that are heated to glowing-hot temperatures in an insulated module. Antora said its battery has demonstrated the ability to store energy about 1,800 degrees Celsius, making high-heat dispatch readily available.
“The electrification of industrial heat with renewable generation not only has the potential to bend the curve towards net-zero—it has the potential to open up one of the biggest and most actionable opportunities that the solar industry has ever seen,” said Justin Briggs, co-founder and chief operating officer of Antora Energy.
The Nature Conservancy and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources also participated in this round, along with existing investors Trust Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BHP Ventures, Overture VC, and Grok Ventures. The funding builds on a Series A round in 2022, which brings total funding to over $230 million.
Antora has also received early support from U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization Office (IEDO); the National Science Foundation; and the California Energy Commission (CEC).
“Carbon is about 50 times less expensive than traditional battery materials and has about three times the energy density of lithium-ion. And with a supply chain of over 30 million tons every year—more than 50 times that of lithium—it can quickly scale up alongside demand,” said Briggs.
Last October, Antora announced it opened a 50,000 square foot manufacturing facility for its carbon block thermal batteries. Located in San Jose, California, the factory is expected to have its first units produced in 2024.
Thermophotovoltaics
In addition to its carbon block thermal industrial batteries, the startup produces thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells, or solar cells that produce electricity from the stored heat in the battery. The company began production of its TPV cells at a Sunnyvale, California factory with an production capacity of 2 MW.
“The cells are based on III-V semiconductors, which have a higher performance than conventional solar cells, and produce 100 times more power than similarly sized devices,” CEO Andrew Ponec told pv magazine. “The cells can convert any source of high temperature heat into electricity and their most important application is for energy storage,” he added referring to thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) consisting of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C.
The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as TPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.
Antora said combining its TPV cells with the company’s thermal batteries enables conversion of stored heat directly into electricity with no moving parts and supports on-demand electricity delivery to industrial customers.

The solar portion of the Fence Post solar project began operations in December of 2023, while the 86 MW storage system is undergoing final commissioning.
Enel North America signed a 12-year 22 MW virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Polaris, under which Polaris will purchase the electricity and associated renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated by a 22 MW portion of the project. This matches what Polaris says is about 40% of its electrical needs in the U.S. Coho Climate Advisors advised Polaris on this VPPA and supported the company in its project selection, analysis, negotiations and deal execution.
Enel estimates that the project will provide $35.6 million in local tax revenue to benefit the Navarro County community.
Completion of the Fence Post project brings Enels’ portfolio to over 9.7 GW of utility-scale renewable capacity, 690 MW / 1,036 MWh of utility-scale energy storage and 97 MW / 216 MWh of distributed energy storage capacity.
Texas Solar Nova
Clearway Energy Group announced completion of the 452 MW Texas Solar Nova projects in Kent County, Texas. Completed in two phases, Clearway estimates that the projects will generate enough electricity to power over 190,000 homes each year.
Offtakers for the project include a VPPA with Verizon and REC purchasing agreements with SKF and Toyota Boshoku America (TBA). TBA reported that, beginning in 2026, the REC agreement will offset 100% of annual electricity consumption for facilities in the United States and Canada.
Clearway said the project represents an investment of $660 million. Additionally the project employed more than 400 craftworkers who contributed more than 500,000 hours of injury-free labor, the company reported. The project is built on approximately 5,000 acres of land with over 1.1 million solar panels. The project will contribute to the local tax base, starting with an estimated $5.4 million in property taxes and wages to be paid in the first year.
Clearway and its construction partner, Mortenson, supported several local organizations during construction, including the Texas Leadership Charter Academy-Secondary campus, the Spur Texas Community Food Bank, school supply drives, and fundraisers for local community parks.
In connection with the construction and operation of these facilities, Clearway assembled a bank consortium consisting of Natixis, DNB, MUFG, NordLB, and Societe Generale for a total of approximately $700 million of construction financing commitments and $182 million of term loan commitments. Clearway arranged tax equity for the project, as well as cash equity from HASI in partnership with Clearway Energy, Inc.
Along with its public affiliate Clearway Energy, Inc., Clearway reports it owns and operates 10 GW of renewable and conventional energy assets across the U.S.

Bill Lee, Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD) Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter to announce an expansion of its Portland, Tennessee manufacturing operations.
Shoals will invest $80 million to move its Tennessee operations to a new, larger location. It is expected to add 550 new jobs at the facility, bringing the total employment in the region to approximately 1,400 people. The new 638,000 square-foot plant will be at 1500 Shoals Way, Portland, Tennessee.
The electrical balance of systems (EBOS) provider serves the solar, energy storage, and electric mobility industries. It said increased demand for solar EBOS products drove the expansion decision.
“Portland is excited to once again be a destination for investment and industry. Shoals has already been a vital community partner, and now, with $80 million of new capital and hundreds of jobs, they will be a top employer in the region as well,” said Mayor Mike Callis.
Shoals said its total manufacturing capacity is now 35 GW, with the ability to expand to 42 GW at existing sites. At current capacities, Shoals can serve demand well into 2025, said the company.
Shoals joined the NASDAQ exchange in January 2021 with a $1 billion initial public offering. It is set to report earnings on February 28, 2024.
In its last earnings report, Shoals posted a record quarter with $132.2 million in revenue. This represents a year-over-year growth of 48% for Q3. The revenue total came in slightly below Wall Street expectations.
Backlog and newly awarded orders reached $633.3 million, growing 34% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 81% year-over-year to $48 million. Shoals said its growth was primarily driven by domestic demand for solar EBOS. Shoal’s balance sheet showed total assets of $840.1 million, with current assets at $214.2 million. The company’s total liabilities totaled $315.5 million, while stockholders’ equity was $524.6 million.
Shoals provides big lead assemblies, interconnection components, combiner boxes, transition boxes, service and design and more for solar projects.

Conversations will explore how to lower Africa’s cost of debt to support the region’s ability to ensure a climate-resilient future. Participants will discuss alternative solutions to sovereign guarantees so investors maintain insurance against defaulted payments due to country-specific risks. 
Stakeholders will also assess how donors and development banks can best support Nigeria in implementing the Nigeria Electricity Act (2023). It was signed into law in June of 2023 to demonopolize electricity generation and promote power produced by renewables.
Policymakers will discuss how to ensure the continued, equitable growth of renewable energy projects in each country. One such example is assessing the progress of Power Africa. The organization works with 49 countries across East, West, Central, and Southern Africa to provide equitable access to electricity through renewable energy. Power Africa is funded by the private sector, international development organizations and global governments. 
Power Africa has allocated over $575 million to strategic investments in Africa’s energy sector since its launch in 2013. Examples include the organization’s route-to-market tool that provides visibility on population density, electrification, telecoms, and road infrastructure in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia so residential companies can find geographic markets. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Power Africa launched Power Africa Powering Health in collaboration with African governments, its partners and the private sector to develop off-grid solutions that electrify health facilities across the continent. 
Power Africa has also invested over $25 billion toward generating more than 140 GW of renewable energy plants across the region. They include installing 318 GW of South Africa’s 581 GW renewable energy portfolio, with solar projects comprising 232 GW. In Nigeria, Power Africa has helped install 3 GW of the country’s renewable energy portfolio, currently at 16 GW, with solar making up 7 MW. 
Speakers include Abebe Selassie, the director of the African Department at the International Monetary Fund and private sector companies like SunAfrica. In June 2023, the Florida-based solar project developer was awarded the Deal of the Year, alongside the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Angola, at the Export-Import Bank of the United States’ 2023 Annual conference. SunAfrica was recognized for its ability to support American jobs through exports. The organization was approved for a $907 million transaction to support the construction of two solar energy power plants in Angola. Both are expected to generate a combined total of over 500 MW of solar power nationwide. 
The Powering Africa Summit will also hear from the Youth Energy Summit (YES!), comprised of African students, young entrepreneurs and professionals. The organization scales education and professional opportunities in the African clean energy sector. During the summit, YES! will collaborate with stakeholders to draft a roadmap for electrifying the continent through learning and development initiatives and private and public corporation recruitment opportunities.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/22/pv-goes-portable/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",TRISTAN RAYNER,2024-02-22,PV goes portable,"From pv magazine Global 02/24
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, in January 2024, the likes of Amazon, Samsung, Google, and LG were busily launching TVs, smart home devices, robots of all kinds, and talking up artificial intelligence developments. A relatively new player was also taking up considerable showfloor space: Portable power stations, also known as solar generators, were holding prime locations and hosting major launches for new products.
The rise in batteries and hybrid energy solutions comes alongside the rise in solar installations and popularity. But solar has enjoyed the remarkable combination of both improved efficiency and falling prices. For large scale solar generators, there is a different pitch: The shift to lithium batteries has enabled new and attractive designs and the focus is on mixing solar charging and energy savings with energy security, for off-grid power and back-up systems.
The solar generator sector evolved rapidly thanks to key improvements to batteries and portable solar modules that are often bundled together. In batteries, many early portable power stations jumped at the chance to use the same battery cells used in Tesla electric vehicles, from Panasonic, usually lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries, replacing lead-acid. Ever increasing output power has evolved through the years through better DC-AC inverters to drive bigger appliances, beyond laptops and lights, and more and varied options for indoor and outdoor use. Those same inverters also now incorporate an onboard maximum power point controller for solar charging. The portable solar modules typically coupled with a solar generator are monocrystalline solar cells. Modules usually fold together and are often fitted with adjustable stands or handles. They are waterproof and warranties start at two years. Prices have fallen dramatically and efficiencies have improved, in line with wider solar trends. A standard set ranges from 80 W to 200 W and can be daisy-chained. A current 100 W example is 23% efficient, weighs 4.7 kg, and outputs 18 V at 5.5 A peak with an IP65 rating.
History lesson
The sector was pioneered through the early 2010s, with companies such as GoalZero offering portable solar generators via sealed lead-acid batteries. The specs explain the lack of success: a 400 Wh option weighed 13.2 kg and was more cumbersome than useful. Aspect Solar was an early innovator with lithium-ion batteries, offering an LFP battery solution in its Sunsocket Sun-Tracking Solar Generator, with built-in solar modules. Aspect Solar went out of business before the idea really took hold, however.
Instead, the first large success came from Jackery, a company initially known as a powerbank maker for phones. In 2016, the company took to crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and raised nearly $100,000 to commercialize its Power Pro, a 578 Wh LFP battery featuring Panasonic battery cells and offering solar charging plus DC and 110V AC outputs. The design came in at just under 5.5 kg, much lighter than lead-acid solutions.
That success, and some marketing savvy, saw Jackery become an established player, with outdoor-focused options of all sizes and capacities. Competitors such as EcoFlow quickly followed, offering similar designs. EcoFlow also started via crowdfunding, in 2017, with Zendure following in 2017, Bluetti in 2019, and more. Gas and diesel generator companies were soon being offered lithium-based power stations and solar generators as emissions-free indoor power back-ups became more desirable. From the PV industry, solar inverter makers including Growatt have moved to offer portable solar generators too.
While such products were being pioneered, though, who exactly was buying, and what was the tipping point into mainstream success? The answer comes, in part, with a tinfoil hat.
Doomsday preppers
Buck Buchanan is marketing director at Geneverse, a sister company of Jackery under parent Hello Tech. Geneverse is focused on indoor use, versus outdoor solutions, and was founded after a surge of interest from outdoor enthusiasts.
“There’s definitely the outdoor community that really loves this product but the people that embrace this more than anybody else, and kind of help promote the portable solar generator, are the doomsday preppers,” said Buchanan. “I mean, they are the ones that went on YouTube and detailed how to power your bunker, how to power everything off-grid, and those were really popular. That’s where things started and it started with a slightly older demographic and it’s moved towards young people, even those living in apartments now.”
Kevin Benedict, product and solution manager at EcoFlow, echoed those thoughts, adding in a few more categories of interested consumer for its portable power stations. “We first saw uptake from outdoor enthusiasts, from those who want to enjoy nature and the outdoors but don’t want to leave conveniences behind, from those like auto enthusiasts, campers, and so on,” said Benedict. “And then came homeowners who wanted to be prepared for emergency situations.”
At CES 2024, the world’s largest consumer technology trade show, companies showed off increasingly large-scale home batteries with optional modularity and portability: there are signs that hybrid homes are becoming more common. In addition, at least one brand in attendance offered swappable batteries for their power stations, as with some electric vehicles. Like many other industries, the home battery sector is keenly awaiting developments in solid-state battery technology for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries, with liquid electrolytes to be replaced and the promise of higher energy density, longer cycle times, and improved safety. The technology remains some way from commercialization and mass production, however. In addition, the technology is desired by all battery players: electric vehicles, utility storage, and smartphones.
Both pointed to times of natural disaster and grid crises – as unfortunate as they are – as being big drivers of sales, especially in more exposed parts of the United States. “It’s states like Florida, Texas, and California,” said Buchanan. “Florida because we have natural disasters, hurricanes. Texas has a horrible grid. And, honestly, we have incredibly reactive customers because once you’ve had no power for three days, that’s when they come to us to buy the product. Or once you’ve relied on a neighbor who has one of these products, and you don’t have one and see how useful it is, how it can save your refrigerator full of food and medicines, you just don’t risk it the next time.”
Benedict confirmed something similar, pointing to regions which have suffered natural disaster as having very high penetration for battery products, including Puerto Rico, which was battered by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, and Hurricane Fiona in 2022, entirely collapsing the grid for as much as a year in 2017.
Disaster preparation is not the only sales driver, however. In Germany, not a country known for extensive blackouts, and where Benedict is based, EcoFlow holds 83% of the portable power station market, which is taken up by both outdoor enthusiasts and the green-minded and those looking to save on high utility bills.
Boosting solar awareness
Solar generators are increasingly being sold with solar panels of all types, though portable panels are those most often bundled together with such products. EcoFlow data suggest around half of new purchasers buy a bundle including a portable power station and solar panels as they look to charge off-grid. Geneverse suggests an even higher figure, with some 70% buying at least one set of panels in a bundle.
“We have seen people embracing the move to balcony solar to save on utility bills and charging our products with their solar panels … in addition, they can then use these alongside their outdoor activity,” said Benedict.
Buchanan said the introduction to clean energy provided by portable solar generators alongside portable panels, is helping to improve understanding of both solar and batteries.
“Especially here in the United States, there’s still a little stigma about solar, like – does it work? How well does it work?” said Buchanan. “And especially with our portable solar generators, we harp on the fact that our machines are quiet. There’s no emissions. People are so not used to that, they’re used to gas generators. And now, you see our products and competitor products all being sold with panels and that’s helping with wider adoption and understanding.”
Buchanan added that the industry has a way to go, though, to educate folks who aren’t up to speed with energy technology. “It’s the funniest thing, we get a lot of calls from people wondering if their panels can just be plugged into appliances and how that works,” he said. “They just don’t understand the need for inverters, or that our solar generators store energy and output it. The most common question is: ‘Can my panels power my refrigerator?’ Obviously, education can go further.”

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/22/grid-operator-pjm-could-add-5-5-gw-of-renewables-with-grid-enhancing-technologies/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,2024-02-22,Grid operator PJM could add 5.5 GW of renewables with grid-enhancing technologies,"The PJM grid operator could enable interconnection of 4.8 GW of solar and 0.7 GW of wind capacity by 2027 through 95 deployments of grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), found an analysis produced by the nonprofit RMI. GETs would also enable 1.1 GW of stand-alone storage plus additional storage co-located with new solar.
The GETs would cost $100 million and yield production cost savings of $7 billion over six years, mostly due to the lower cost of operating renewable energy generators enabled by GETs, the report says. That translates to a 70-to-1 benefit-cost ratio, as shown in the graph below.

GETs could save project developers collectively “hundreds of millions of dollars” in interconnection costs compared to default network upgrades, the study says, as shown in the  image below, while the project-level savings “could be the difference” that allows a developer to build a project “instead of dropping out of the queue.” GETs can also be installed more quickly than other network upgrades.

GETs were compared to the network upgrade options of reconductoring (using existing transmission towers to support new high-capacity advanced conductors) and rebuilding transmission lines (replacing both the towers and the conductors). These other options would yield an approximate 10-to-1 benefit-cost ratio, as indicated in the image above comparing their costs to GETs costs.
The $7 billion in production cost savings from installing GETs would not accrue to project developers, although under the current participant-funded upgrade paradigm, developers would pay for the $100 million in GETs installation costs.
GETs can enable rerouting of power flows to avoid congested lines, and provide real-time weather data to enable more power to flow through a line when conditions allow, for example due to the cooling effect of wind. The three GETs considered are dynamic line ratings, advanced power flow controls, and topology optimization, all of which are explained in the report. GETs have been used in Europe for decades, the report says.
To take advantage of GETs, the study says grid operators and utilities will need to adopt new modeling approaches, such as including GETs in power flow studies, and operational changes such as integrating GETs into existing energy management system software.
A previous study by The Brattle Group found that GETs could enable 40 MW more solar and 2.6 GW more wind power in Kansas and Oklahoma within four years.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 2023 requires transmission providers such as PJM to evaluate, when conducting interconnection studies, several advanced transmission technologies listed in the order, according to the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth. The listed technologies include advanced power flow control devices and advanced conductors but not dynamic line ratings or topology optimization, the firm says, noting that the order requires transmission providers to explain their evaluation results, but gives them sole discretion whether to use any given technology.
The RMI report says PJM and other grid operators “should build on FERC’s order and include GETs as standard network upgrade options for generator (and new load) interconnection.” RMI adds that “enhanced transmission planning and build-out is the long-term solution to addressing our capacity-constrained electric grid.”
Methods
In what the study says is a first-of-its-kind analysis, Quanta Technology started with a dataset of projects in five states that are waiting in PJM’s interconnection queue. Quanta conducted power flow modeling—a key step in any interconnection study—to consider each GET individually and then in combination. Quanta projected cost savings through production cost modeling.
RMI said its goal was to develop a “transparent and replicable approach” for analyzing GETs in interconnection studies.
Amazon provided funding for the analysis and report, in line with its commitment to power its operations with 100% renewables by 2025, said Abhishek Sharma, head of energy strategy for Amazon Web Services. An Amazon executive previously described how artificial intelligence could speed interconnection studies for large-scale renewables projects.
Other contributors to the study included GETs vendors such as LineVision and Smart Wires, which provided data and technology-specific information for the modeling, and NewGrid, which conducted topology optimization modeling.
RMI offered detailed recommendations for applying the study’s findings within PJM and nationwide:
PJM is the world’s largest wholesale electricity market, the report says, serving 65 million people; its service area is shown on map above. Wind and solar combined provided less than 5% of generation in the PJM region last year. PJM has instituted a pause on new interconnection applications until 2026.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/22/beaming-radio-frequency-solar-power-from-space/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-02-22,Beaming radio frequency solar power from space,"Researchers have been attempting to beam solar power to earth in recent years, with some demonstrations showing the possibility is real. Pricing estimates for this source of electricity vary widely, with recent headlines from parties soliciting business with the U.S. Space Force suggesting that solar power could be delivered at $0.025/kWh, while a NASA document released in January, “Space-Based Solar Power” suggested a range between $0.61/kWh to $1.59/kWh.
The California Institute of Technology (CalTech) group that initially measured solar power being beamed from space released a paper on the topic, “Wireless Power Transfer in Space using Flexible, Lightweight, Coherent Arrays.”
In the most basic description, the solar panels on the satellite convert the sun’s photons into DC electricity, which the RF integrated circuit (RFIC) then turns into radio frequency (RF) power, which can be beamed to other space vehicles or to earth.

CalTech’s Microwave Array Power Transfer Low-earth-orbit Experiment (MAPLE) was designed to test the wireless transfer of electricity portion of the equation. The cube satellite was attached to a spacecraft last year, and tested successfully. In this case, the source of the electricity was the spacecraft’s – the Vigoride-5 spacecraft from Momentus, Inc. – solar panels.
In the future, the authors envision many of these systems deployed across an highly coordinated area of space, arranged and delivering energy as a phased array.
The project attempted three beam-to-Earth experiments, on May 23rd, 2023 UTC, June 30th, 2023 UTC, and July 28th, 2023 UTC. All three experiments were successfully detected. Specific measurements, including a Doppler shift and power level, aligned with orbital predictions and data from larger spacecraft. The researchers’ techniques improved with each measurement, with the final experiment providing the largest continuous set of data.
The main subcomponents of the MAPLE are:
– Two custom 16-channel silicon RFICs
– An array of 32 flexible co-cured dipole antennas
– A flexible printed circuit board (PCB) on which the RFICs and antennas are mounted (“flex array” or FA)
– A rigid PCB with voltage regulation, on-board telemetry, and redundant microcontrollers (“aggregation panel” or AP).
– Two rectenna arrays.
– Two narrow field-of-view cameras.
– Two wide field-of-view cameras.
The flexible PCB antennas and RFICs constitute the “GU array.” They are responsible for generating and transmitting RF power wirelessly. The rectennas receive the wirelessly transmitted RF power from the GU array and convert it to DC power. The microcontroller on the Main Board controls the execution of the focusing algorithm that continually controls and optimizes the actions of the RFICs and GU array.
Besides cost, one technical barrier that will need to be overcome is the loss in power that occurs in the transfer process (this is where the focused phase arrays come into play). pv magazine USA is not qualified to comment on the ideas associated with solving the efficiency program, nor how to calculate the efficiency – so we asked ChatGPT to read the paper linked to above and help describe the power efficiency of the system.

The end efficiency value is defined as being infinitesimally small, approximately 2.23 * 10-11 % (0.0000000000223%), or 22.3 trillionths of a percent. While the following comparison isn’t completely analogous, one can gain an order of magnitude: to reach the efficiency of a modern solar panel on Earth, which is around 20%, the overall efficiency would need to increase roughly five trillion times.

The marketplace report is compiled by assessing those quotes submitted by solar companies to shoppers throughout 2023, comparing the first half of the year to trends over the second half of the year.
A key finding is that despite inflation and increased financing fees, solar prices dropped for the first time since 2021, falling by 3.5% to $2.80 per watt. The report finds that the median price of $2.80 W in H2 2023 is in line with solar pricing from mid-2020, and  4.5% higher than the low point from summer 2021.
Recent price drops were offset by larger fees charged for lower interest rate loans. The most frequently quoted solar loan was a 25-year loan with a 3.99% interest rate. But the report found that the average fee on the most quoted loan product reached 47% of the cash project cost in the second half of the year.

Storage
Consumer interest in battery energy storage is up, with 61% of solar quotes on EnergySage including a battery in the second half of 2023—an increase of ten percentage points over the first half of 2023.
Quoted storage prices also dropped for the first time since EnergySage started tracking them in 2020, falling by 6.4% in the second half of the year. Previously the median price for batteries quoted on EnergySage increased during every six-month period, but that changed in second half of 2023. This drop in prices is driven by a 19% decrease in quoted storage prices in California, where the attachment rate has been 45% since NEM 3.0 went into effect. The report finds that in the first six months of 2023, Calif. had the lowest level of storage interest of any state on EnergySage.
The change in California’s net metering policy came after the original NEM helped the state become the leading rooftop solar market, achieving Governor Schwarzenegger’s million solar roofs initiative, and under NEM the state has since reached two million solar roofs. The Calif. residential solar market came to a screeching halt after the NEM 3.0 rulemaking decision lowered compensation for exported solar production by about 75%, thus making batteries an essential component of a residential solar project. Assemblymember Laura Friedman recently  introduced a bill calling for the CPUC to re-evaluate net metering.
As storage installations increased over the last three years, the specific batteries quoted and installed through EnergySage have evolved rapidly, yet a few brand choices remain on top. Enphase and Tesla are the most quoted, while FranklinWH jumped from 1% of quotes in H2 2022 to 11% of quotes in H2 2023.
Enphase Energy recently launched the new Enphase Energy System with the IQ Battery 5P, and the company reports that its system is optimized to support the new NEM 3.0 rules by enabling self-consumption and exporting energy at the appropriate times to create maximum value.
Tesla launched its latest battery, the Powerwall 3, last September. The FranklinWH integrated battery and control system was launched in 2022.
The drop in pricing is driven by Tesla and FranklinWH. These two brands were included in one-third of quotes and were priced similarly to each other at around $1,100/kWh-stored. Only one battery brand, LG Energy Solution, was included in more than 1% of quotes and priced below $1,000/kWh-stored on average in the second half of the year.

Seven out of 10 solar shoppers requested battery quotes on EnergySage throughout 2023. For the most part, very little separated the three drivers in the second half of 2023: main
financial savings, maximizing self-consumption, and backup power each accounted for more than 30% of consumer interest in storage.
The NEM 3.0 factor is evident in the Marketplace analysis of California shoppers because it wasn’t until H2 2023 when interest in energy storage spiked. In fact, prior to that Californians had the lowest interest in backup because of the favorable net metering rates. After rates were slashed by NEM 3.0, the state saw the fifth-highest storage interest rate in the country with four out of five EnergySage shoppers requesting storage quotes.

Pricing by state
EnergySage looked at Marketplace quotes for the second half of 2023 for the 10 states with the most cumulative solar electric capacity installed through the third quarter of 2023 based on data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.

According to SEIA the top five solar states are: California, Florida, Texas, Colorado, and Nevada. All of the top five, with the exception of Colorado,  had median quoted prices below the national median price. In California half the  quotes on EnergySage were priced below $2.75 W in the second half of the year (up from 20% in H1), driven by companies trying to improve solar economics when NEM 3.0 became policy.
