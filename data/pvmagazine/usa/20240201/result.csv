The Hornet Solar project is a 745 MWdc project in Swisher County, Texas, generating enough electricity for the equivalent of about 160,000 homes annually.
Blattner Energy is constructing the project, which is selling its power to four large offtakers via a power purchase agreement. The project began construction in the Fall of 2023 and is planned to be operational as soon as January 2025.
Vesper Energy said the project will deliver renewable energy to communities throughout Texas, provide grid stability, and mitigate price volatility in the ERCOT market, interconnecting to Oncor Electric’s transmission system. The project will utilize bifacial solar modules on a single-axis tracker, which is the industry standard nationwide for large utility-scale solar projects.
The company said it expects to monetize over $500 million of production tax credits (PTC) over the next ten years.
“Closing project financing and a long-term purchase agreement for the PTCs on a large project in west Texas is complex,” said Vesper Energy’s chief financial officer Robert Scheuermann. “We are proud to invest in Hornet Solar alongside top-tier lenders and investors.”
The $590 million debt financing package consists of a construction-to-term loan and a letter of credit facility. MUFG Bank Ltd., Nord/LB and Santander Corporate & Investment Banking operated as lead arrangers, BayernLB as joint lead arranger, and Associated Bank as lender.
The $500 million in Inflation Reduction Act production tax credits will be monetized and leveraged by the loan facility through the purchase commitment arranged by Advantage Capital. CCA Capital advised Vesper on the sourcing and structuring of the PTC agreement.
“This transaction demonstrates Advantage Capital’s ability to structure creative financing solutions for a dynamic and growing renewable energy market,” said Michael Sponseller, vice president, Advantage Capital.
Hornet Solar is projected to contribute more than $100 million in new tax revenue to Swisher County over the life of the project without raising taxes. Projected tax benefits include $61.2 million to the Tulia Independent School District, $25.7 million to Swisher County, and $11.9 million to the Swisher County Memorial Hospital.
Vesper Energy, headquartered in the Dallas area, has delivered more than 10 GW of renewable energy projects globally. Its project pipeline includes over 55 renewables and energy storage projects with a combined capacity of over 17 GW.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/01/how-to-combine-residential-heat-pumps-with-pv-battery-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-01,"How to combine residential heat pumps with PV, battery storage","From pv magazine global
Fraunhofer ISE researchers have studied how residential rooftop PV systems could be combined with heat pumps and battery storage.
They assessed the performance of a PV-heat pump-battery system based on a smart-grid (SG) ready control in a single-family house built in 1960 in Freiburg, Germany.
“It was found that the smart control increased the heat pump operation by boosting the set temperatures,” researcher Shubham Baraskar told pv magazine. “The SG-Ready control increased the supply temperature by 4.1 Kelvin for hot water preparation, which then decreased the seasonal performance factor (SPF) by 5.7% from 3.5 to 3.3. Furthermore, for space heating mode the smart control decreased the SPF by 4% from 5.0 to 4.8.”
The SPF is a value similar to the coefficient of performance (COP), with the difference it is calculated over a longer period with varying boundary conditions.
Baraskar and his colleagues explained their findings in “Analysis of the performance and operation of a photovoltaic-battery heat pump system based on field measurement data,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances. They said the main advantage of PV-heat pump systems consists of their reduced grid consumption and lower electricity costs.
The heat pump system is a 13.9 kW ground-source heat pump designed with a buffer storage for space heating. It also relies on a storage tank and a freshwater station for producing domestic hot water (DHW). Both storage units are equipped with electric auxiliary heaters.
The PV system is south-oriented and has a tilt angle of 30 degrees. It has a power ouput of 12.3 kW and a module area of 60 square meters. The battery is DC-coupled and has a capacity of 11.7 kWh. The selected house has a heated living space of 256 m2 and an annual heating demand of 84.3 kWh/m²a.
“The DC power from PV and battery units is converted to AC via an inverter which has a maximum AC power of 12 kW and a European efficiency of 95 %,” the researchers explained, noting that the SG-ready control is able to interact with the electricity grid and adjust the system’s operation correspondingly. “During the periods of high grid load, the grid operator can turn off the heat pump operation to reduce the grid strain or can also undergo a forced turn on in the opposite case.”
Under the proposed system configuration, PV power must be initially used for the house loads, with surplus being supplied to the battery. Excess power could only be exported to the grid, if no electricity is required by the household and the battery is completely charged. If both the PV system and the battery are not able to cover the house’s energy demand, the electricity grid can be used.
“The SG-Ready mode is activated when the battery is fully charged or is charging at its maximum power and there is still PV surplus available,” the academics said. “Conversely, the trigger-off condition is met when the instantaneous PV power remains lower than the total building demand for at least 10 minutes.”
Their analysis considered self-consumption levels, solar fraction, heat pump efficiency, and the impact of the PV system and the battery on the heat pump performance efficiency. They used high-resolution 1-minute data from January to December 2022 and found that the SG-Ready control increased the heat pump supply temperatures by 4.1 K for DHW. They also ascertained that system achieved an overall self-consumption of 42.9% during the year, which translates into financial benefits for the homeowners.
“The electricity demand for the [heat pump] was covered by 36% with the PV/battery system, through 51% in domestic hot water mode and 28% in space heating mode,” the research team explained, adding that higher sink temperatures reduced heat pump efficiency by 5.7% in DHW mode and by 4.0% in space heating mode.
“For space heating, a negative effect of the smart control was also found,” Baraskar said. “Due to the SG-Ready control the heat pump operated in space heating above the heating set point temperatures. This was because the control probably increased the storage set temperature and operated the heat pump even though the heat was not needed for space heating. It should also be considered that excessive high storage temperatures can lead to higher storage heat losses.”
The scientists said they will investigate additional PV/heat pump combinations with different system and control concepts in the future.
“It must be noted that these findings are specific for the individual evaluated systems and can vary greatly depending on the building and energy system specifications,” they concluded.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/01/organic-cathode-for-high-energy-fast-charging-lithium-ion-batteries/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",,2024-02-01,"Organic cathode for high-energy, fast-charging lithium-ion batteries","From pv magazine Global
Organic cathode materials, derived entirely from earth-abundant elements, could eliminate the use of critical metals, such as cobalt, and accelerate the adoption of lithium-ion batteries. However, they have not yet challenged inorganic cathodes due to their poor conductivity, low practical storage capacity, and poor cyclability.
Now, a group of MIT researchers has developed a layered organic electrode material which can compete with cobalt-based cathodes. The new material has shown high electrical conductivity, high storage capacity, and virtual insolubility in common battery electrolytes.
The new cathode delivers an energy density of 765 Wh/kg higher than most cobalt-based cathodes, and can charge-discharge in as little as six minutes. Its specific capacity stands at 306 mAh/g.
“These results demonstrate the operational competitiveness of sustainable organic electrode materials in practical batteries,” the researchers wrote in ACS Central Science.
The new cathode material consists of many layers of TAQ (bis-tetraaminobenzoquinone), an organic small molecule that contains three fused hexagonal rings.
Within the molecules are chemical groups called quinones, which are the electron reservoirs, and amines, which help the material to form strong hydrogen bonds. Those bonds make the material highly stable and also very insoluble, thereby extending its lifetime.
“One of the main methods of degradation for organic materials is that they simply dissolve into the battery electrolyte and cross over to the other side of the battery, essentially creating a short circuit,” said Mircea Dincă, the W.M. Keck Professor of Energy at MIT. “If you make the material completely insoluble, that process doesn’t happen, so we can go to over 2,000 charge cycles with minimal degradation.”
With quinones and amines as precursors, the primary materials needed to manufacture this type of cathode are already commercially available and produced in large quantities as commodity chemicals.
The researchers estimate that the cost of organic cathode-based batteries could be about one-third to one-half the cost of cobalt containing devices.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/01/lithos-technology-reduces-water-use-in-lithium-extraction/,"BATTERY,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,2024-02-01,Lithos technology reduces water use in lithium extraction,"Lithium producer Lithos Group LTD’s subsidiary Aqueous Resources LLC applied for a $30 million grant through the Department of Energy’s FedConnect program. The $150 million grant, to be awarded by the DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, is meant to help advance the development of financially and environmentally sustainable processes associated with the production and refinement of lithium. 
Each awardee receives up to $30 million, and Aqueous’ financing will go toward renovating its 55,000 sq ft Bessemer, Ala., complex. “We are excited to extend and expand our relationship with the U.S. Department of Energy and use this additional grant funding to accelerate pilot scale production of Lithium hydroxide from the Bessemer, Ala., complex,” said Scott Taylor, CEO of Lithos. 
The funds will help increase the facility’s capacity to process lithium hydroxide sustainably, which is essential to ensuring organizations can meet local demands for lithium without causing further harm to the environment. 
Lithium is usually mined from hard rock or salt brines. Both can have a negative environmental impact; however, Aqueous technology works to minimize the amount of groundwater evaporation necessary for lithium recovery from salt brines. The process usually requires pumping saltwater from underground reservoirs to the surface, then storing it in evaporation ponds, where it takes 12 to 18 months to evaporate and leave behind a brine with high lithium concentrations. 
Carbon Accounting Platform Greenly states that it takes almost 2.2 million liters of water to produce one ton of lithium. This depletes groundwater levels in nearby areas, thus potentially harming agricultural land. 
The patent-pending technology, AcQUA, employs an electric-pressure membrane process to remove and refine lithium chloride salt brines. It allows for directly removing raw brine from saltwater without evaporation ponds. Aqueous states that the process is cost-effective and efficient because the technology can pre-treat, select, purify, and concentrate lithium-enriched brines before extracting lithium chloride.
The company reports that the technology also allows for repurposing over 98% of the input brine water. 
Lithos states it has a fully operational direct lithium extraction processing plant commissioned in Denver, Colo. The organization is focusing on applying the same technology to reduce the environmental impact of processing brines across other locations in the United States, as well as in Argentina and Chile. 
The company seeks to become the global standard for economically and environmentally sustainable lithium production, used in the manufacturing of EV batteries. Its Bessemer, Ala., facility sits near Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, Inc., Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, LLC, and Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, LLC.  
“The existing permits allow us to seamlessly extend our pre-treatment processing flowsheets to DLE and through polishing and purifying battery grade lithium. We are grateful for the support we received from the Senate, Congress, the University of Alabama, and the City of Bessemer,” said Taylor.

The company was founded in January 2023 by Alfred Johnson, former deputy chief of staff to Secretary Janet Yellen at the U.S. Treasury Department where he was responsible for work related to digital assets, cybersecurity and technology, and more. He founded Crux to create a market for transactions of the newly transferable clean energy tax credits, included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The company’s latest round of funding was led by Andreessen Horowitz, and included participation by existing investors including Lowercarbon Capital, New System Ventures, Overture, and The Three Cairns Group. 
“This new round of funding will help us build even faster, grow the transferable tax equity market at a critical moment, and expand our services — furthering our mission of making sustainable finance more efficient and interconnected,” said Alfred Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Crux. 
Specifically, the company said that the new funding will help it grow its team, scale up the volumes of annual transferable credits to the billions and look into other offerings for clean energy projects. 
Prior to the passage of the IRA, developers needed to rely on project finance structures called tax equity partnerships to monetize unused credits, Johnson told pv magazine USA. But the IRA substantially extended and expanded the use of tax credits to catalyze the development of clean energy and decarbonization projects, he added.
“Transferability has significantly increased access to capital for smaller projects and new technologies. Projects below [$50 million] are generally too small to attract a traditional tax equity investor. Now, those projects can sell credits directly to third party buyers,” Johnson said.  
Earlier this month, Crux released its first Transferable Tax Credit Market Intelligence report, which estimated that between $7 billion and $9 billion in transferable clean energy tax credits were transacted in 2023. The transferable sector currently accounts for one-third of the entire tax finance market – estimated at around $23 billion in 2023 – and the report forecast a particularly strong growth for the sector. 
The company has over $8 billion of credits currently available for sale and is working with clients that include project developers, tax credit buyers, banks, and others. 
“Recent policy changes around the transferability of clean energy tax credits have propelled market growth beyond expectations, fundamentally transforming how clean energy and decarbonization projects are financed in the United States,” said David Haber, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. 
Looking to 2024, Johnson expects that this market will continue to grow and mature rapidly. At a micro level, a large proportion of prospective credit buyers who were not active in the market for tax credits in 2023 expect to get involved this year, he said – and if a large share of those buyers ultimately decide to pursue a deal, that would represent net new demand for tax credits.
“We also are starting to see some of the first deals that blend traditional tax equity partnerships and direct transfers inked. These hybrid deals will be used more frequently, and buyers are already reacting favorably to those credits,” Johnson added. 
At a macro level, he said, the traditional tax equity market is relatively constrained due to a combination of factors. 
In this context, the energy transition will be fueled by a transparent, efficient market for clean energy tax credits, said Johnson. 
“Our platform is one part powerful data, stakeholder, and workflow management software built specifically for tax credit transactions. And, Crux is also the liquidity solution for buyers, sellers, and their intermediaries to transact,” he said.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/01/suniva-to-restart-idled-solar-cell-factory-in-georgia/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-02-01,Suniva to restart idled solar cell factory in Georgia,"Suniva is proceeding with its plans to restart and modernize its manufacturing facility in Norcross, Georgia. Its goal is to kick off production this spring with a capacity of 1 GW and eventually scale up to 2.5 GW per year.
It has ordered equipment for the thermal process steps of annealing, diffusion and PECVD from Germany’s Centrotherm. The last of a total of three system packages for the 1 GW production line will be delivered in January, the German PV equipment supplier said this week.
“Centrotherm already supplied turnkey production lines to Suniva in 2008 and 2009, and we are proud to contribute to the resurgence of the photovoltaic industry in the USA,” said Jan von Schuckmann, CEO of Centrotherm. “As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which supports domestic manufacturing of clean energy equipment, we expect further impetus from the US market.”
Since its passage in August 2022, the IRA has ushered in a new era of US clean energy manufacturing and installation. Based on tracking by nonpartisan trade group Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), over 274 major clean energy projects have been announced across 41 states, leading to over $110 billion in private investment announcements and the creation of over 95,000 jobs. In 2023 alone, more than 80% of all projects and 95% of capital investments announced were in the manufacturing industry, said E2. 
Suniva announced plans in October to restart the idled factory in Georgia, which operated at around 450 MW of production capacity at the time of its closure in 2017.
“The reopening of production in Norcross is the first step in rebuilding solar cell manufacturing in the United States, which will bolster our country’s energy independence and security,” said Matt Card, president and COO of Suniva.
Once considered one of the largest solar cell and panel manufacturer in the United States, Suniva filed for bankruptcy in 2017 after claiming it could not compete with cheap solar imports.
In response to a Section 201 trade petition filed by Suniva and SolarWorld, the Trump administration imposed duties in 2018 on imported solar cells and panels for a period of four years. The tariffs were extended but somewhat eased by the US government in 2023.
According to Suniva’s Card, the tariffs have helped US panel production, but he credited subsidies contained in the IRA for finally enabling Suniva to produce solar cells again.
Suniva has been owned by New York investment firm Lion Point Capital since it exited bankruptcy in 2019. Last year, the manufacturer secured a $110 million financing commitment from Orion Infrastructure Capital which it said would use to purchase new manufacturing equipment.
