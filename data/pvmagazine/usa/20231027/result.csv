Its performance has struggled in line with other residential solar market leaders, which have all suffered from significantly weakened demand.
High interest rates, regulatory changes like California’s NEM 3.0, and stabilizing energy prices have made a significant dent in rooftop solar installations.
Enphase delivered $551 million in revenues in Q3, 2023, falling short of consensus estimates of $556 million. This is a sharp drop from the previous quarter, with U.S. revenues falling 16% from the previous quarter. Revenues in Europe fared even worse as inventory channels piled up, with revenues falling a staggering 34% from the previous quarter.
In 3Q, the company delivered 3.9 million microinverters and 86 MWh of batteries. It generated a free cash flow of $122 million. About 86% of microinverter shipments were the IQ8 microinverter. The company ended Q2 with 48% gross margin, 18% operating expense, and 30% operating income.
Looking ahead, the high-growth stock is expecting even more contraction of revenues. Fourth-quarter revenues are expected to range between $300 million and $350 million. This is far below the consensus estimate of $577 million.
Despite already shedding significant value after foreboding earnings calls from competitors SolarEdge and Tesla, Enphase dropped another 16% in the trading session following the call.
Enphase represents a higher upfront cost option than its string inverter counterparts. In a high interest rate environment, lower-cost options like string inverters may become attractive to customers. However, Enphase management said it is not making any price reductions and expects to maintain healthy margins.
Weakened demand has caused inventory channels to pile up, especially in Europe. Enphase management said it conservatively expects channel inventory issues to clean up sometime in mid-2024.
“When the demand falls, we think more decisive inventory correction becomes necessary. We are being conservative in our assumptions of no demand recovery until Q2 in this framework. So that explains the guidance,” said Badri Kothandaraman, chief executive officer, Enphase.
“Despite the large reduction in Q4 guidance, we are maintaining our non-GAAP gross margin above 40% in our guidance without the IRA benefit. We aren’t making any broad-based pricing changes at this time on microinverters, and we have already made the necessary changes on batteries before,” he said.
The company attributed a 25% pullback in sell-through in California to NEM 3.0. However, management said it is confident that solar-plus-battery systems will have a payback period under NEM 3.0 that approaches NEM 2.0 levels, and that sales should normalized in “a few more quarters.”
“Utility rates are continuing to move higher in California with one California utility recently requesting a 22% rate hike. Assuming that even half of that rate hike is approved by the CPUC, the payback period for a NEM 3.0 solar plus a battery system will become close to a NEM 2.0 solar-only system. So that’s good,” said Kothandaraman.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/27/advancing-iron-and-salt-batteries-with-8-million-in-seed-funding/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",Advancing iron and salt batteries with $8 million in seed funding,"Inlyte Energy, the recipient of $8 million in seed funding, was founded by Dr. Antonio Baclig, who incubated the company as a 2021 Activate Fellow in partnership with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Since that time Inlyte has been on an upward trajectory—securing an ARPA-A award, acquiring Beta Research, being named to the 2023 Cleantech 50 to Watch and now receiving a funding boost from At One Ventures.
The company, which is located in the California Bay Area, aims to use the seed funding to develop the first generation of its grid batteries made with the most abundant materials: iron and table salt.
The 2022 acquisition of UK-based Beta Research moves Inlyte many steps closer to design and manufacturing, as the scientists at Beta originally developed a sodium metal halide battery more than 40 years ago and brought the technology to commercial readiness and manufacturing capacity. Beta Research has a pilot production line, with 30,000 square feet of manufacturing and testing facilities, which will enable Inlyte to begin manufacturing, once the optimized design is complete.
“The experience of the Beta Research team and their facilities give Inlyte a significant advantage compared to other battery startups in this space. They don’t need to find a pilot factory, get the tooling, or figure out how to manufacture,” said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Inlyte’s ability to compete with lithium-ion on lifetime, round-trip efficiency, and of course upfront cost also gives them a significant opportunity in a market that’s exploding right now.”
The battery chemistry is sodium metal halide, which Inlyte says can “create an energy storage system with high efficiency, long lifetime, competitive energy density, excellent safety, and at an ultra-low cost”. An advantage the chemistry has over conventional lithium batteries is the ability to operate in extreme heat or cold, said the company.
The target market for Inlyte’s batteries is the diurnal energy storage market, with a storage duration of four to 10 hours. The company says this makes them appropriate for grid storage and other industrial applications.
“Conventional sodium metal halide batteries, made from nickel and salt, were developed for electric vehicles in the 1980s and ’90s but never made it down the cost curve,” said founder and CEO, Dr. Antonio Baclig. “At Stanford, I realized that by optimizing that design for the grid instead of for vehicles, and by using iron instead of nickel, we could drive the cost incredibly low. Inexpensive storage is what will truly make wind and solar a competitive total solution versus fossil fuels, not just in California but everywhere in the world.”
The sodium metal halide battery’s iron chemistry’s raw storage materials are Earth-abundant table salt and iron. Inlyte intends to use electrochemical measurements and materials characterization to study the sodium/iron chloride cells, isolate the factors that allow for long cyclability.
Once the company can scale manufacturing, Inlyte expects its batteries to have the lowest cost because the raw materials are common, inexpensive and locally available, thus avoiding sourcing from another country.
“At the end of the day, solutions for the climate crisis are beholden to economics for both companies and countries, and we would have chosen this design and these materials on that basis alone – but there are so many other benefits as well,” said Baclig.
The seed funding round is led by At One Ventures with participation from First Spark Ventures, Valo Ventures, TechEnergy Ventures, Climate Capital, Anglo American, and others.
The next step is for Inlyte to finalize its grid-optimized sodium metal halide design. The company also plans to engage with pilot customers in the coming months, with a goal of launching a manufacturing facility in the U.S. in the coming years, leveraging incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/27/doe-requests-input-on-draft-roadmap-to-fix-utility-scale-interconnection/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",DOE requests input on draft roadmap to fix utility-scale interconnection ,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) seeks input on its draft roadmap “Transforming Interconnection,” which describes 34 approaches to “reliably achieve an energy transition on the U.S. transmission system by 2035.”
The Department has requested input through a formal request for information (RFI).
Feedback from “interconnection stakeholders,” the RFI says, will ensure that the final version of the roadmap provides a “comprehensive set of strategies” to improve the interconnection process.
DOE said that “within months” it expects to finalize the transmission roadmap and release a draft roadmap for improving interconnection on the distribution grid. Both roadmaps are being developed through a DOE stakeholder engagement process known as i2X.
DOE’s 92-page draft roadmap for improving utility-scale interconnection does not mention last year’s initial goals expressed in an i2X webinar to reduce both interconnection costs and timelines by 50% in five years.
Three national trade groups said last year that for large-scale renewables and storage, interconnection studies—a major source of interconnection delays—could be completed in “months instead of years.”
DOE’s draft roadmap states an expected timeline for implementing each of the 34 approaches, called “solutions,” ranging from short-term (1-2 years) to long-term (more than 5 years). Asked about the initial goals expressed last year, a DOE spokesperson said the draft roadmap “contains suggested metrics” and “DOE welcomes stakeholder feedback on the metrics” through the RFI process. The RFI does not state that request explicitly.
The roadmap says the solutions described “require multiple stakeholder actions,” and are intended to be “a collection of strategies” rather than a “rigid package of prescriptive fixes.”
“All stakeholder groups should participate” in implementing solutions, the roadmap says, as it outlines “specific actions” each stakeholder group can take to “contribute to a collaborative improvement process.”
The RFI says stakeholders include, but are not limited to, utilities, grid operators, grid reliability organizations, tribal governments and utilities, federal and state regulators, state and local governments, clean energy developers, energy justice groups, nonprofits and trade associations.
The roadmap contains some solutions that relate to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 2023 on interconnection, and introduces other ideas that support “longer-term interconnection process evolution.” That dual approach can facilitate “industry-wide discourse” that builds upon Order 2023, the roadmap says, and can “maintain usefulness” for transmission providers not subject to FERC jurisdiction.
The roadmap’s 32 solutions fall into four categories: increase data access and transparency; improve process and timing; promote economic efficiency; and maintain a reliable grid.
DOE’s RFI has eight substantive questions, and stakeholders are invited to respond to any or all of them. The deadline for RFI responses is November 22 at 5 p.m. Eastern time.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/27/the-role-of-partnerships-and-planning-in-solar-and-storage-asset-management/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",The role of partnerships and planning in solar and storage asset management,"Owners and operators of solar and storage assets have three primary objectives: Minimizing repairs during the asset’s lifetime, ensuring consistent, high-yield energy performance, and delivering robust returns on the investment. Achieving these goals is crucial for accelerating the clean energy transition and in turn, mitigating the severe impacts of the climate crisis we now face.
A critical factor in attaining these objectives is the early consideration of operations and maintenance (O&M) and asset management. Neglecting these elements in financial modeling, or failing to think strategically about the maintenance plan over the life of the asset, can crush performance, returns and investor confidence.
That’s why selecting the right O&M partners from the outset should be a priority. Experienced O&M professionals and seasoned asset management teams are the linchpin of consistent and reliable power plant performance.
Rising interest rates
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to catalyze what could amount to considerable growth in the solar industry. According to SEIA projections, solar development will increase 69% more than what would have been expected without the IRA. Even as the Biden administration has encouraged more domestic solar manufacturing, rising interest rates have increased the cost to finance new projects. When developers struggle to secure cost-effective funding, the pace of solar development slows.  For those projects that are financed, the permitting and leasing hurdles associated with building out clean energy projects contribute to longer development cycles.
Given the uncertain landscape for new-builds, ensuring the optimal performance of existing assets in the United States is a priority. To maintain the confidence of existing investors, operating solar and storage projects need to consistently meet their production targets.
Performance issues
We have seen evidence of the detrimental impacts of not incorporating asset management early on, as asset owners and operators struggle to keep up with modeled production rates. According to a study by kwH Analytics, for instance, the solar industry missed its production targets by an average of nearly 8% in 2021. More recently, over 3% of targeted production lost in 2022 was due to equipment anomalies alone, nearly double what that same figure was in 2019. This is a pattern that should catch the attention of investors, owners, and asset managers alike. The cost of underperformance caused by equipment anomalies was estimated to represent at least $2.5 billion in annual losses for the solar industry.
Missing targets not only erodes investor trust, but it also pushes us further from our climate goals. It’s time to talk about solutions.
Building reliable, integrated teams 
From our experience in developing an asset management program, partnering with trusted O&M providers and establishing a knowledgeable internal asset management team is essential for reducing solar variance. Vertical integration within this sector is critical for fostering trust and facilitating swift risk identification and resolution. Including asset management input in project modeling can also help guarantee the investment thesis appropriately accounts for quality O&M from the outset.
At CleanCapital, we’ve assembled a dedicated team of technical asset managers (TAMs) with varied backgrounds in O&M and engineering, procurement & construction (EPC). Each portfolio is assigned to a TAM so our O&M providers have a single point of contact with a thorough understanding of each site within that portfolio. The TAMs work collaboratively with the O&M providers to brainstorm and work through more complex issues. This leads to a much quicker turnaround on necessary approvals.
Spare parts replacement 
Efficient spare parts replacement is crucial, given the inevitability of equipment failures and ongoing supply chain constraints. Response time and efficient sourcing are key considerations. When equipment failure occurs on site, O&M technicians need to be able to get the array back to full operation as soon as possible to reduce downtime. While a single damaged panel might have a small impact on daily production, a failed inverter could severely hinder site performance. O&M providers do their best to source replacement parts quickly, but in recent years, we have all seen how easily days can turn into weeks or months.
Our approach to solve this was to build out a centralized spare parts inventory program, where all of our O&M providers are able to source replacement components. This cuts down on lead times to obtain parts, and reduces downtime of the site. Better performance means time is freed up to focus on other issues for all parties.
Technology for optimal performance
Solar arrays send out a constant stream of data and it’s easy to lose valuable information in all the noise. Integrating the right software can help teams quickly identify impending problems as, or before, they arise.
Overall, we’ve embraced technology to evolve and improve processes and create efficiencies in our workflows. Our approach covers the entire ecosystem, including accounting, asset management and compliance software. We have integrated into our O&M providers software wherever possible, so monitoring, ticketing and reporting can be even more seamless.  We also put in place a dedicated technical division responsible for site performance and issue resolution.
Detailed reporting is often overlooked but is vital when dealing with institutional investors and major debt and tax equity providers. Regardless of how assets are performing, investors that are well informed on the overall status will have more faith and trust that problems will be resolved expediently. Proper reporting and increased investor confidence will mean funding that is necessary to make large-scale improvements will be readily available.
A diversified portfolio
The performance of solar power plants is influenced by various factors, and addressing these considerations ensures stable and efficient operation.
Different regions experience varying levels of sunlight throughout the year. For owners and operators of more than one solar power plant, diversifying sites across locations with distinct weather patterns can help balance the risk associated with fluctuations in solar irradiance. This can lead to more predictable energy generation and returns across an entire portfolio of assets.
The increasing frequency and severity of climate-related events have led to changes in the insurance industry. Some insurers have withdrawn coverage from areas prone to high climate risk, like wildfire-prone regions. Solar power project developers and operators must be proactive in identifying such insurance challenges and work on finding alternative risk mitigation strategies.
Investing to solve the climate crisis
We believe that climate change is the greatest threat we face, and we are committed to accelerating the transition to renewable energy.  To reduce the impacts of the climate crisis, investing in the project pipeline and ensuring the health of existing solar assets are equally important. For long-term success, the initiation phase of  solar projects needs to reach far beyond investment and construction. Asset management and O&M should be priority considerations right from the start. The key to consistent performance is straightforward: ensure that the site operates at full capacity continuously. This involves proactive issue detection, expedited repairs, and streamlined reporting for identifying necessary improvements. Achieving this requires the right people, process and technologies in place.
