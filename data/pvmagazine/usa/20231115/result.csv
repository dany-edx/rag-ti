The facility increases GAF’s production capacity to 300 MW annually, an increase of 500% over current manufacturing output at its California facility. The solar shingle business is backed by GAF, a roofing company with over 100 years of history.
GAF began hiring for the Summer 2022-announced facility early in 2023 and has brought on more than 75 people in manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, and other associated roles. At full capacity, the company will employ more than 240 people based in Georgetown.
The facility will produce the Timberline nailable solar shingle, which was introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022. The shingles are designed to mimic the look of a traditional roof and come in several color shadings to match the home’s profile.
Each interlocking shingle covers 60 inches by 7.56 inches of roof space, offering 45 W of power per shingle. The monocrystalline shingles support 600 V max system voltage and can support up to 48 shingles in-series and up to two parallel strings. Each shingle weighs just over 10 lbs. and has an installed weight of 3.36 lbs. per square foot. Find the full specifications sheet here.
Timberline Solar shingles are water-shedding and warrantied to withstand winds up to 130 mph. The product is UL certified for fire safety and has UL certification as a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system.
“Solar roofs are the future of clean energy, and Timberline Solar is the game-changing innovation that will get us there,” said Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy.
DeBono said he believes BIPV installations like the GAF Timberline shingle or Tesla’s solar roof are the way of the future for rooftop solar.
“Over the last 20 years, the way solar panels have been attached to a roof hasn’t changed. When you install a traditional rack-mounted system, which has between 68 and 100 half-inch penetrations, you’re effectively cutting a six by six hole in the roof — with lag bolts drilled through the water barrier in the hope you’ll find a rafter,” said DeBono. 
“By integrating solar with the roofing, you’re going to ensure the integrity of the home,” he said.
With the completion of the Georgetown, Texas facility, GAF is now among the largest producers of BIPV in the world. The 450,000 square foot facility is planned to reach full operations by the end of this year. 
“We firmly believe that manufacturing in America speeds the innovation cycle and allows us to deliver the best product for our customers,” said DeBono.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/15/canadian-solar-reports-q3-earnings-miss-eyes-strong-2024-growth/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023","Canadian Solar reports Q3 earnings miss, eyes strong 2024 growth","Canadian Solar reported its Q3, 2023 earnings, noting a surprised miss on revenues and earnings per share.
The major global provider of solar cells and modules and developer of utility-scale solar and energy storage projects recorded an earnings per share of $0.32, falling short of Wall Street expectations by 54%. It also delivered $1.85 billion in revenue, short of the consensus estimate of $2.03 billion.
Solar module shipments totaled 8.3 GW, falling just short of expectations. However, the company’s module shipments have increased 39% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margins were 16.7%, falling short of the range of expectation between 17.5% to 19.5%. Falling module prices are likely driving the shrinking gross margins.
Total operating expenses were $225 million, down 18% year-over-year. Depreciation and amortization charges were $76 million, up from $56 million in Q3 2022.
Canadian Solar’s cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q3 totaled $1.9 billion, up from $981.4 million on Dec 31, 2022. Long-term debts were $1.07 billion, up from $813.4 million on Dec 31, 2022.
The company issued lower-than-expected guidance for Q4, 2023, but has placed optimistic expectations for 2024. Q4 revenues are expected to land at $1.7 billion, significantly lower than prior consensus of $2.7 billion. 
Canadian Solar expects module demand to rise sharply in 2024, with shipments rising roughly 50% year-over-year. Roth Capital Partners warned that this may be a bit optimistic as the company looks to clear excess inventory channels in Europe. Roth expects module demand to raise only 10% to 15% in 2024, driven mostly by utility-scale demand, while residential solar demand may further peel back in 2024.
Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment for growth, management at Canadian Solar sees a very strong growth ramp ahead for solar.
“To give you some color, I have worked in the solar industry for well over 20 years, but only just witnessed total cumulative solar installed capacity finally reach 1 terawatt worldwide in 2022,” said chief executive officer Dr. Shawn Qu on the earnings call.
“As we look ahead, strong global demand is on track to drive that number up to 1 terawatt in annual installations. I strongly believe this can happen before the end of the decade or 2030,” said Qu.
Qu said that even with current high costs of capital, solar and energy storage project returns are more economically attractive today than ever before. He said that this is due to a combination of lower equipment costs and higher electricity prices.
Improvements in efficiency have also supported the transition to solar and energy storage. Over the past 20 years, module conversion efficiencies improved from less than 15% to well over 25% now.
“N-type is the next big technology driver and we have already ramped capacity,” said Qu. “N-type TOPCon cell capacity now accounts for half of our total cell capacity and is expected to reach 60% by the end of this year.”
The company is also investing big in the U.S. domestic solar value chain. It announced a new 5 GW solar cell facility in Indiana, and a 5 GW module factory in Texas. The cell factory is particularly notable, as the United States has large amounts of module assembly plants, but lags in cell production capacities.

Canadian Solar also announced a 5 GW solar wafer facility in Thailand, to supply its cell fabrications with components that are in compliance with updated U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws.
“Concurrently, we are adjusting the procurement of our module bill of materials in accordance with the newest regulations,” said Qu.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/15/mysterious-higher-energy-yields-in-vertical-pv-systems/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023","Mysterious, higher energy yields in vertical PV systems","From pv magazine global
A group of researchers at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has conducted a series of tests and simulations to understand why vertical PV systems tend to provide unexpected yield gains compared to horizontal arrays and have found that vertical installations have much lower operating temperatures.
“Although better than expected performance for vertical installation of bifacial PV has been reported at conferences and workshops, we haven’t seen any publications that show that this is accompanied with a much lower operating temperature than you would expect for free-standing fixed tilt PV with the same total irradiance,” the research’s corresponding author, Bas B. Van Aken, told pv magazine. “These lower operating temperatures have a positive effect on the operating voltage. And thereby on the total energy generation, particularly under high irradiance conditions.”
In the study “Thermal model in digital twin of vertical PV system helps to explain unexpected yield gains,” published in EPJ Photovoltaics, Van Aken and his colleagues explained that the voltage is influenced both by the amount of light and by the temperature of the solar cells. With increasing irradiance conditions, the voltage increases logarithmically, while with increasing temperature, the voltage decreases, typically by 0.3-0.4% per C.
“For a standard system, we observed that under high irradiance conditions, the increase due to the light is offset by the decrease due to the higher operating temperature,” Van Aken stressed. “However, for the vertical system, we observed that the operating temperature is not increasing so much and the voltage increase and decrease are more or less balancing.”
For its modeling, the group used digital twins, which are virtual representations that connect and visualize real-world assets, to create twins consisting of a real PV system and a copy in digital format. Digital twins are commonly used for operation and maintenance (O&M) of solar power plants. “The digital version mimics the output of the PV panels based on the time series of weather and other environmental data. The simulated values are compared to observed data,” the scientists explained.
They took their measurements in a vertical PV system located near the TNO facilities in Petten, the Netherlands. The east-west system features nine rows each equipped with eight 315 W bifacial modules, with the spacing between module rows being 2 m, 4 m, or 6 m, respectively. Of the 72 modules deployed in the system, 60 rely on n-type M2 TOPCon solar cells. All of the panels are equipped with power optimizers provided by Israel-based SolarEdge.
For its analysis, the group utilized an in-house developed extraction method and found that the heat transfer coefficients of the vertical panels are nearly double the values of the horizontal panels. Heat transfer coefficients define how heat energy passes from one material to another and are commonly used, for example, to make insulation in homes.
They also ascertained that the vertical array operates at a temperature difference with respect to ambient that is “nearly halved,” which they said results in a 2.5% higher annual energy yield.
“These results show the importance of checking the actual operating conditions of emerging applications of solar panels,” Van Aken concluded. “We expect that this effect has a 2-3% increase in annual electricity yield in the Netherlands, the lower operating temperature has a slowing effect on degradation mechanisms and the effect could be more significant in locations with higher irradiance conditions.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/15/soltec-announces-solar-tracker-designed-for-u-s-market/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",Soltec announces solar tracker designed for U.S. market,"Spain-based solar tracker maker Soltec is launching the SFOne US, a single-axis tracker designed for the U.S. solar market.
The company said the difference in the design of the U.S. tracker system compared to Soltec’s system for other markets is the reduction in the number of parts, and the option to have several pieces come pre-assembled.
For example, the tracker is longer for the U.S. market, with piles that are thicker in profile. Using thicker piles means that fewer are needed. Colin Caufield, VP of sales, North America for Soltec, said “in the U.S., the number of piles to install is a major factor that needs to be reduced to be competitive.” He noted that this is true even if the cost of the material is slightly higher, but there are fewer foundations to install.
Soltec has a supply chain for the SFOne’s steel components in the United States and it has contract manufacturers that can produce the piles, tubes and purlins domestically. Caufield said the hardware is made in the U.S., too.
“By being able to manufacture locally, we reaffirm our commitment to the U.S. market as a player that can help achieve IRA compliance for our customers. SFOne.”
Another way that the SFOne US can meet the needs of the growing U.S. market is that, like the original SFOne, it has terrain undulation tolerances that forgive slopes in the east-west direction and north to south. The connecting rod in the east west direction is flexible and absorbs changes in elevations while still connecting multiple rows.
The SFOne is designed for modules with 72- and 78-cell designs and is self-powered by a dedicated module that, according to Soltec, translates into a lower operating cost.
While there is an option to have a 1P independent row, SFOne can also connect two trackers that are adjacent in the east-west direction (shown below), creating a 1P dual-row configuration. Caufield told pv magazine USA that doing this reduces the number of motors and electronics by up to 50% and reduces product cost and tasks required to install the system.

Like the original SFOne, the U.S. version includes Dy-Wind technology, which offers a method for designing wind-resistant tracking structures and the optimization of the diffuse booster system for low-light conditions. The tracking system also features the StringRunner, which is Soltec’s proprietary standard component that combines fused PV source circuits and cabling within the tracker torque-tube to a DC power switch. This technology can reduce trenching costs, the company reports, as it allows for in-tube cable management and low-voltage trenching minimization.
The SFOne US has been put through numerous tests, according to Caufield. “Perhaps most importantly, there have been countless wind tunnel tests influencing the design and giving Soltec essential information that allows us to give a standard product that is design to withstand windspeeds up to 130 mph and a product tailored to high winds that can withstand speeds up to 160 mph,” he said. “The latter of which has a design modification that costs more than the standard product but allows it to be installed in conditions that are far more hazardous.”
More testing has been performed to understand energy capture in different conditions, Caufield noted.
While hail tests are commonly performed by module manufacturers, Soltec designed the system to stow at a high angle in the event that there is hail detected. “The idea is simply that we avoid a direct, perpendicular strike of hailstones down onto the modules by tilting the tracker at angles that can exceed 60°,” Caufield said.
Soltec sees the U.S. as a growing market for the Spanish firm. Europe currently accounts for about 27% of its turnover, with the U.S. accounting for 25% and Latin America 47%.

Minnesota Power, a utility division of ALLETE Inc., is advancing its vision for renewables, called EnergyForward, by issuing a request for proposals (RFP) for up to 300 MW of regional solar energy to come online by 2027. Adding 300 MW of solar through this RFP will increase Minnesota Power’s current solar portfolio by tenfold.
The utility is seeking cost-effective solar resources that are within its service territory with direct interconnections to the company’s transmission system. Minnesota Power provides electric services to more than 145,000 customers in a 260,000 square mile territory in northeast Minnesota from north of St. Cloud to International Falls and Duluth to the east.
Minnesota Power will give preference to projects in communities that have generation resources impacted by the company’s decarbonization plans. It is also seeking diverse bidders and will give preference to projects that use union labor and local labor for both construction and permanent positions. It is also seeking companies that will develop apprenticeship programs.
“As we demonstrated with our three recent regional solar projects, this RFP reflects our commitment to creating opportunities for our communities during the clean-energy transformation,” said Minnesota Power chief operating officer Josh Skelton. “We’re seeking projects that will create local construction jobs and tax base in communities, train people for the future and generate renewable energy for our customers.”
Minnesota Power will consider multiple power supply options, including build-own-transfer and power purchase agreement projects along with self-build projects.
Minnesota is experiencing rapid solar buildout. Ranked  34th in solar capacity last year, it jumped to 17th, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) statewide solar rankings. The state generates 4.05% of its electricity from solar with 1.8 GW currently installed.
Minnesota Power will hold a webinar on Tuesday, November 28, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. CST to answer questions regarding the RFP. Click here to sign up for the webinar. Proposals will be accepted through Jan. 5, 2024. Click here to learn more or to file a proposal.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/15/barbados-finalizes-plans-to-construct-a-60-mw-portfolio-of-community-solar-gardens/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH AMERICA",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",Barbados finalizes plans to construct a 60 MW portfolio of community solar gardens ,"Jurchen Technology, a German-based manufacturer of racking and direct current (dc) cabling solar power plants, in partnership with Blue Circle Energy, a renewable energy developer based in Barbados, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the construction of a 60 MW portfolio of solar generation projects across Barbados’ 11 parishes.  
The project consists of ground-mounted panels using Jurchen Technology’s PEG EW (PEG) racking solution. The solar plant manufacturer states that its PEG system constructed at an 8-degree tilt produces 225% more land yield than trackers and fixed tilt systems. This is due to the minimal spacing between modules stemming from their angular design. Moreover, racks will be situated at waist height, using an aerodynamic blueprint that the company says is engineered to withstand extreme wind from hurricanes. 
The portfolio will include battery energy storage systems (BESS) either tethered to Barbados’ primary grid or spread across the project’s 50 sites, which will function as community solar gardens. Discussions around tariff rates for the portfolio’s BESS are still ongoing, and a decision needs to be reached before construction of the project begins. “We’re looking forward to a commercially viable tariff in early 2024,” said Cameron Steinman, president of Blue Circle Energy. 
Barbados aims to be the first 100% renewable energy and carbon-neutral island-state by 2030, as outlined in its National Energy Policy document. The report includes ten visionary goals centered around creating a diverse, affordable and reliable portfolio of renewable energy options that promote the economic enfranchisement of Barbadians in various ways. Increasing the country’s energy independence is another approach to realizing this mission. 
Not having to purchase international oil using foreign exchange reserves (primarily dollars) to power plants creates space to allocate those funds toward other meaningful infrastructure initiatives, Steinman said. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, 95% of Barbados’ energy supply was imported in 2020. Oil provided the most significant energy supply at 92%, followed by renewables at 5% and gas at 3%. Bioenergy and solar were the largest renewable energy generators at 62% and 38%, respectively. 
“Employing Jurchen Technology’s PEG EW racking solution to construct a 60 MW solar plant portfolio across Barbados represents a significant leap towards our renewable energy goals,” said Lisa Cummins, the minister of energy in Barbados. 
The Barbados Light & Power Co. Ltd. states that its photovoltaic (PV) solar plant in St. Lucy, Barbados, adds 10 MW per day to the national grid. That is in addition to 25 MW of distributed, customer-owned solar rooftop generation. According to Sinalda, a global manufacturer of alternating current voltage systems, this figure increased to 30 MW of PV capacity in 2021.  
While Barbados has a lower risk of hurricanes than other places in the Caribbean, climate change may alter that. The World Bank forecasts new rainfall patterns and more frequent and intense tropical cyclones in the region as global temperatures rise. According to Steinman, the spatial design of the solar-plus-storage plant can help increase grid resiliency in the face of unpredictable weather patterns. Otherwise known as single-point losses, residents will still have access to electricity if a storm damages a site. 
The community solar garden portfolio will also allow about 300 sheep to graze across 30 sites. The agrivoltaic nature of the proposed solar plant adheres to an unwritten Barbados policy requiring the dual use of clean energy generation sites.   
Steinman estimates the portfolio will hire between 20 and 50 people during its three-year construction period. After that, maintenance of the BESS will generate about 3 to 10 jobs on the island, some dedicated to security asset management. 
Blue Circle Energy funds the development phase of the project, which includes permitting, licensing, early design, and scoping costs. Steinman said the company also pays landowners option payments to keep the land reserved while it sorts project delays. International hotelier Sol Ecolution will assume costs associated with paying for equipment, procuring contractors and final portfolio ownership over 20 years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/15/antora-energy-receives-4m-grant-to-scale-thermophotovoltaic-technology/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",Antora Energy receives $4M grant to scale thermophotovoltaic technology,"Antora Energy received a grant for over $4 million from the California Energy Commission (CEC) and Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy to scale up its heat-to-power thermophotovoltaic technology, which can store renewable power as heat in blocks of solid carbon, which converts stored heat into electricity.
The funding, which comes from the CEC’s Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) program and another program at the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, represents “critical state-federal collaboration to scale innovative clean energy technologies,” the company said. 
The additional funding will further accelerate Antora Energy’s production of thermophotovoltaic technology, or TPV, Andrew Ponec, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said.
“With TPV, Antora is capable of decarbonizing the entire energy demand of large industrial facilities—both heat and power—opening the fastest, least expensive path for the industrial sector to reach net zero,” said Ponec. 
“Industrial emissions are among the hardest to abate and Antora’s cutting-edge technology holds promise in overcoming that challenge,” Jonah Steinbuck, R&D director at the CEC, said. 
The company’s thermophotovoltaic technology essentially converts heat to electricity with no moving parts, Brendan Kayes, its head of photovoltaics research and development, told pv magazine USA. 
“Much like a solar cell is designed to capture light from the sun, TPV cells convert the light emitted from glowing-hot objects—like Antora Energy’s carbon blocks—into electricity,” Kayes said. 
Antora Energy says its thermal batteries offer a cost-effective way to store energy and produce high-temperature industrial heat and electricity on demand. So far, processes that convert heat into electricity have historically required extensive machinery with lots of moving parts, Kayes said.
“Think steam turbines and internal combustion engines—technologies that have dominated for centuries—that require expensive, ongoing maintenance, and are only efficient and cost-effective at large scale,” Kayes said. 
Antora Energy’s thermophotovoltaic cells, however, are modular and manufacturable, so their efficiency and cost are independent of scale — enabling cost-effective deployments from kilowatts to gigawatts, Kayes added. This means it could help replace the use of fossil fuels in processes in the food and beverage, paper products, chemicals, steel and cement industries.
The company’s technology has met two thresholds around efficiency and manufacturing at scale, it says – it has demonstrated heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies higher than 40%, and earlier this year, set up a dedicated manufacturing line for thermophotovoltaic cells that is the first of its kind in the world. The manufacturing line is located in Sunnyvale, California and has an initial capacity of 2 MW of cells per year. 
The thermal batteries are built to address energy needs across virtually every industrial sector, and could have major ramifications in sectors beyond manufacturing, including the electric grid, remote power and others, Kayes said. 
Last December, Antora Energy announced it had acquired Medley Thermal – a developer and software company specializing in renewable power-to-heat systems – to help commercialize its heat and power technology. Medley Thermal had previously developed projects that used renewables to cost-effectively electrify heat, and had a robust pipeline of power-to-heat projects, Antora Energy said.
