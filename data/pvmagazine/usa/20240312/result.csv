In pursuit of reduced emissions, one of the major drivers of solar adoption, along with reduced costs, component procurers and project developers must consider the carbon required to bring a project to fruition. Sometimes referred to as the “carbon backpack,” the embodied carbon in a component can differ greatly based on materials used and where it was produced.
According to the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance, the use of PV materials with a lower carbon backpack can reduce the carbon footprint by 50% in the U.S. and 70% in Europe.
Origami Solar, a designer and manufacturer of recycled steel frames for solar modules, commissioned an independent study with Boundless Impact Research & Analytics to understand the difference in carbon backpack between its product and leading competitors. The analysis considered raw material production, manufacturing, transportation, and more.
It found that compared with traditional virgin material aluminum module frames shipped from China, U.S.-made module frames made from recycled steel show a 90.4% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Germany, the frames have a 94.7% carbon advantage.
Boundless estimates the greenhouse gas footprint of Origami Solar’s steel module frames at 9.25 kilograms (kg) of carbon dioxide equivalent per 2 meter by 1 meter frame produced in the U.S.
“The estimated Fossil Energy Footprint of Origami Solar’s steel module frame is 71.8 megajoules (MJ) in the United States and 62.2 MJ in Germany per 2 by 1-meter frame, compared to 920 MJ for a conventional virgin aluminum frame produced in China using an extrusion production process,” said the report.
The company said the improved carbon embodiment would result in a reduction of 80 kg of emissions per module or 200 metric tons per MW.
Analysis by Bloomberg NEF found that though solar component costs have lowered, aluminum framing has stayed relatively flat, and now represent about 25% of the cost of a module.

Origami Solar, a small company based in Bend, Oregon, was awarded the grand prize in the 2022 U.S. Department of Energy’s American-Made Solar Prize competition, recognizing the disruptive value and market potential of the company’s steel module frame.
The company said it is sourcing steel and plans on producing frames regionally, thus eliminating supply chain constraints and trucking miles. The company reports that the frames are 100% U.S. made and will enable solar modules to qualify for the domestic content bonus tax credit.
“Steel is an earth-abundant resource that can be manufactured on every continent, the use of which in trackers, racking, mounts, and tubes is already widely accepted by the solar industry,” said Mathew Arnold, chief executive officer of Unimacts, a Boston-based manufacturer with production facilities in Nevada, Mexico and Spain. “We are excited to collaborate with Origami Solar to rapidly facilitate the shift from imported aluminum to domestically made steel frames.”

Construction is now underway, and is expected to be complete by mid-2025.
Serrano represents the continuation of a longstanding partnership between U.S.-based solar manufacturer First Solar and Longroad. Serrano is the fourth Arizona project using First Solar’s modules that Longroad has financed in four years, and Longroad’s first to use First Solar’s Series 7 panels that are made in the U.S. First Solar has a manufacturing facility in Ohio and recently expanded operations to Alabama and Louisiana.
“We are proud to support American manufacturing and the domestic solar supply chain as we expand our solar footprint in the robust Arizona market, which now surpasses 1.5 GW of operating or under construction projects,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy.”
The 214 MWac / 855 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) will be provided by U.S.-based energy storage platform provider Powin. The BESS will include SMA inverters and cells from AESC, which will be integrated into Powin’s Modular and Scalable Centipede Energy Storage Platform.
Nextracker is supplying trackers for the project and Sungrow is supplying the solar inverters.
Operations and maintenance (O&M) services for the project will be provided by NovaSource Power Services and Longroad’s affiliate Longroad Energy Services. Longterm O&M services for the BESS will be provided by Longroad, in conjunction with Powin and NovaSource Power Services.
Arizona Public Service (APS) will be the offtaker of electricity from the plant through a long-term power purchase agreement. The project will generate enough electricity to power roughly 61,000 Arizona homes.
“APS is widely regarded for providing top-quality, reliable service to our customers, and solar plus storage resources like the Serrano project bring value to Arizonans,” said Brian Cole, APS Vice President of Resource Management. “Our investment in cost-effective, renewable projects enhances our diverse energy mix, providing customers with power that is reliable, affordable and clean.”
Serrano is the fourth large-scale solar facility in Arizona being built by McCarthy for Longroad and is expected to employ over 300 people during the construction process. McCarthy is using registered apprentices and reports it will be paying prevailing wage to all workers on the project, in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Longroad estimates that the solar produced by Serrano represents over 330,000 metric tons of avoided CO2 emissions annually, or the equivalent of taking approximately 75,000 gas-powered cars off the road. Additionally the project is expected to contribute more than $25 million in revenue for Arizona schools and communities through its long-term Right of Way grant with the Arizona State Land Department and tax remittances.
Debt financing was led by CIBC and Societe Generale and included ANZ, PNC, Commerzbank AG, and U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance. CIBC acted as Coordinating Lead Arranger, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, and Green Loan Coordinator. Societe Generale acted as Coordinating Lead Arranger. U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance served as Joint Lead Arranger and Depositary Bank. Athene Annuity and Life Insurance Company, an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, is the project’s tax equity investor and was advised by Apterra Infrastructure Capital.
“Our continued role in supporting Longroad in the build out of their development pipeline is one example of CIBC’s commitment to the U.S. renewable energy and energy transition space as we work towards enabling a more sustainable and inclusive economy,” said Peter O’Neill, head of U.S. project finance and infrastructure at CIBC.
Longroad Energy Holdings has developed or acquired 5.4 GW of renewable energy projects across the U.S. and raised over $14.5 billion of equity, debt, and tax equity to support completion of its portfolio. Serrano expands Longroad’s solar footprint in Arizona to more than 1.5 GW of operating or under construction projects.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/12/gray-skies-over-californian-solar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",TRISTAN RAYNER,2024-03-12,Gray skies over Californian solar,"From pv magazine 3/24
In California, which represents half of the United States residential solar market, the third iteration of net energy metering (NEM) rules has reduced the payments made for electricity fed into the grid from new residential solar arrays by 75%, drastically changing return-on-investment calculations. The “NEM 3.0” rules took effect on April 15, 2023, for new solar customers, with existing solar arrays grandfathered into previous regimes.
While NEM 3.0 boosted the proposition for pairing batteries with solar, entry-level capital costs remain high. With interest rates rising over the past year, due to the U.S. Federal Reserve raising its target range for the federal funds rate, loans to help purchase and install solar panels have risen from historic lows to more than 5.5% in official rates – and to 8% and beyond from finance companies.
With loans expensive and incentives removed, Californian residential PV has been devastated. By late 2023, rooftop solar installations had fallen 80%, driving more than 17,000 layoffs – 22% of the industry. In February 2024, publicly traded installer Sunworks filed for bankruptcy following a 29.5% decline in quarterly revenues, year over year, for the third quarter of 2023, led by a 44.5% decline in residential PV. Sunrun posted a loss of more than $1 billion in its most recent quarter.
Deep Patel, founder and chief executive officer of California-based Go Green Solar, is chapter leader for the California Solar & Storage Association (CALSSA) in Los Angeles. He said NEM 3.0’s overnight change hasn’t just hurt solar uptake, it has damaged wider interest in PV, with online forums such as social media platform Reddit’s solar subreddit seeing plenty of complaints and questions.
“First of all, just on Reddit, a lot of people are confused [about whether solar] now makes sense or not,” said Patel. “There’s a whole consumer perception thing going on. Those people say, ‘If I didn’t get NEM 2.0, I’m not even going to look at NEM 3.0 rules.’ Or they say, ‘Hey, a battery can help me,’ but then they get sticker shock: A typical system runs you $20,000, but adding a battery on top runs you $40,000.”
“The American consumer finances everything and they just don’t have the capital to make big purchases. So even when those battery systems make sense, it might’ve been fine if interest rates were still at 2% but borrowing costs have risen. So they’re punting the decision down to when financing rates are lower. That’s causing stress with distributors and installers and so on.”
While the solar industry can somewhat cheerfully dub the dizzying highs and terrifying lows of the cyclical industry as all part of the “solar coaster,” the reality is grim when it comes to establishing a straightforward industry where people can rely on long-term warranties and support after a five-figure outlay that affects the value and appearance of their home.
Silver lining
The NEM 3.0 rules may eventually benefit key suppliers of residential power electronics – and also module-level power electronics (MLPE). The new rules in California incentivize both home storage and more advanced systems beyond earning feed-in tariffs, including solar self-consumption, energy storage, electric vehicle charging, and more. Achieving those features requires more advanced MLPE products from makers such as Enphase, SolarEdge, and others. The short-term downturn is particularly tough, though, given the state’s oversized contribution to the United States residential market.
Liam Coman, solar analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights, told pv magazine that the situation is tough but not a disaster. “S&P Global predicts MLPE shipments to be down by 4% in 2024 but to grow long-term, out to 2030,” he said.
Data from the company show that global microinverter and power optimizer shipments grew 19% in 2023, to a record high of 26 GW, as non-United States geographies held up well.
While a drop from record highs isn’t inherently disastrous, the industry’s growth-dependent model is the problem for companies heavily invested in United States residential solar. Companies rely on increasing quarterly sales, leaving them vulnerable to overstaffing and excess inventory during downturns.
“High inventory levels and a slowdown in residential demand, particularly in California following the introduction of NEM 3.0, has had a twin negative impact on MLPE suppliers in the US since the second half of 2023,” said Coman.
An issue facing United States residential solar is that rising interest rates have driven up financing costs, discouraging customers and exposing highly leveraged businesses and fly-by-night operators. Many companies offer solar lease arrangements, enabling customers to avoid heavy upfront costs. Low interest rates had made finance attractive, with leased PV accounting for about 70% of the residential solar market. EnergySage Marketplace, a United States-based clean energy comparison website, says an 11 kW solar array came in at an average of $22,022 in 2024. Customers could avoid upfront costs by taking out leases of up to 25 years, spreading the costs in monthly payments until they own their systems. Leases trump the financing of such arrays with loans because they typically involve the installers covering maintenance issues during the lease term. Less scrupulous installers, however, have buried onerous financial terms in the small print. Leasing companies use more advanced inverters and optimizers to monitor their solar fleet. A downturn for solar leasing compounds the problems for MLPE. Sunrun and SunPower, two of the largest solar companies in the United States, reported sobering numbers in their most recent financials. Sunrun lost more than $1 billion in just three months and saw solar energy systems and product sales revenues from the third quarter of 2023 fall 32% from a year earlier. SunPower’s results prompted it to warn that its business could fold. It received a $175 million capital injection in December, albeit coupled with onerous financial terms.
MLPE woes 
Two of the United States’ largest solar MLPE suppliers, Enphase Energy – based in Fremont, California, and SolarEdge, headquartered in Herzliya, Israel – heavily target the residential market with advanced inverter and optimizer solutions. Both supply installers and companies, including Sunrun, leaving them exposed to the current United States residential downturn. 
Although other markets show better results, SolarEdge said it would cut 900 jobs – 16% of its workforce – while Enphase cut 350 roles, or 10% of its staff and said it would cease operations at its contract manufacturing locations in Timisoara, Romania, and in Wisconsin, in a blow to manufacturing. 
Sophie Karp, senior analyst for electric utilities, power, and renewable energy at KeyBanc Capital Markets, agreed with that assessment. “We believe that once channel inventory levels normalize, Enphase and SolarEdge should both grow at a rate similar to the overall growth rate in mature markets,” Karp said. “However, we do not expect this normalization to become apparent until mid-2024 at the earliest.”  
Karp also pointed out that the issues being experienced by the segment are not indicative of wider problems in solar.  
“I don’t believe the issue with Enphase and SolarEdge is indicative of the performance of the solar industry as a whole,” she said. “Both cater heavily to the residential solar market, a niche subset of the solar industry which experienced a “perfect storm” of adverse regulatory outcome and rapidly rising interest rates in a relatively short period of time. I believe that in the medium- to long-run, residential solar with storage will continue to present an attractive value proposition for homeowners in the US.”  
Biju Perincheril, an analyst at trading firm Susquehanna, agreed, noting that issues are improving outside California to an extent.  
“Recent permit data appear to show non-California markets are stabilizing,” said Perincheril. “This is consistent with recent commentary from Enphase. Of course, the California recovery is still a wildcard.” The analyst said the latter half of 2024 should see a recovery but it may not be equally weighted. “We think the recovery for SolarEdge could be slightly behind Enphase and, therefore, [we are] modelling a larger year-on-year revenue decline for SolarEdge this year.”  
Supplies squeezed  
SolarEdge appears to be facing more consistent pressure than Enphase, from analysts such as Perincheril and on the stock market itself.  
A November 2023 industry note from Phil Shen, managing director of Roth Capital Partners, said that an installer in the United States was shifting from serving 50% Enphase inverters and 50% SolarEdge inverters, to an 80% Enphase, 10% SolarEdge, 10% Tesla split. The quoted reason: “When we asked about why the move away from SEDG [SolarEdge], he shared that the higher failure rates have been a challenge.”  
Those reliability concerns continue to pop up in reports and online. On forums including Reddit, Go Green Solar’s Patel is one of many active participants, with the company founder freely providing advice for interested people and answering questions on topics such as “Need advice on batteries?” or “Best value inverter?” as well as about panel and inverter makers, including SolarEdge.  
Patel, when asked about his experience with the Israeli company, said his business, which has been active in the industry since 2006, had gradually transitioned away from SolarEdge, starting around four to five years ago.  
“We used to sell a lot of SolarEdge … but SolarEdge for us started slipping in terms of customer support, quality, and turnaround times,” said Patel. “Lead times got very long at one point during the pandemic. The downside with SolarEdge is that when the inverter doesn’t work, the whole system is down, so that wasn’t good for customers and we haven’t really been back to SolarEdge again.  
“The value proposition SolarEdge offers [via attractive pricing] isn’t there for us. You also have other inverter guys nipping at the heels – you have Sol-Ark now, and GoodWe now has a residential string inverter with four MPPT [maximum power point tracking] trackers in the US, which is great. Even Tesla is coming on strong, no longer just going direct to customers but letting installers sell it for them.”

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/12/decarbonized-aviation-attracts-venture-capital/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,2024-03-12,Decarbonized aviation attracts venture capital,"From pv magazine Global
Since 2016, there has been $2.4 billion worth of venture capital flowing to companies developing technologies to decarbonize aviation, according to Dealroom.co, a Netherlands-based provider of global data and intelligence on startups and tech ecosystems.
The segment had a strong start in 2024, noted Dealroom.co senior analyst Lorenzo Chiavarini.
“Aviation is one of the segments where we still don’t have a clear winning technology path to decarbonization to reach 2050 net-zero targets,” he told pv magazine. “In my assessment, it could be a threat or opportunity, either we don’t hit the targets, or we hit the targets thanks to huge investments and technological advances. A third option is we hit the targets thanks to massive social change. That is, flying becomes something we only do if there is no other alternative. So, if we want people to fly, and limit climate disruption and biodiversity collapse, we need to get serious about decarbonizing aviation now.”
Based on Dealroom.co data, a total of $2.4 billion was invested in the so-called sustainable aviation since 2016. “Under sustainable aviation, we include things like electric aircraft, aircraft batteries, and hydrogen aircraft; sustainable aviation fuels such as e-fuels and biofuels, as well as new aircraft models, airships, and software solutions for contrail avoidance,” he explained.
The startups that attracted most of the funding are developing electric aircraft, hydrogen aircraft, e-fuels and biofuels. Biofuel is the most mature of these segments while electric, hydrogen and e-fuels are emerging.
“Funding peaked in 2022 at almost $700 million before dropping 50% to $337 million in 2023,” Chiavarini said. “Interestingly, early-stage investments stayed nearly constant from 2021 to 2023, more than double the level of any previous year. It enabled a strong early-stage startup scene that needs to prove it can scale in the next few years. Also notable, Europe seems to have gained a share of innovation by both the amount invested and the number of rounds.”

Venture capital across all sectors decreased 38% from 2022 to 2023, totaling less than half of the 2021 peak, even considering the hype about artificial intelligence startups. “Sustainable aviation is not exactly mirroring the broader market, as it is such an emerging segment, especially the technologies for electric and hydrogen aircraft and e-fuels,” Chiavarini stated.
The surge in new investments, however, has to be taken with caution. “We are very early in 2024,” said Chiavarini. “It was mainly driven by two very large rounds, namely Swedish startup Heart Aerospace, which makes hybrid-electric regional aircraft, and Ineratec, a German company that aims to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock for synthetic fuels and synthetic chemicals. I would add that it is common to announce rounds in January that were in reality closed at the end of the previous year. In any event, we are seeing both late-stage and early-stage activity, which is a good sign.
According to Dealroom.co, over 400 investors have made at least one bet on sustainable aviation startups. The most active based on the number of deals is Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a fund backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, with 8 investments from Series A to Series C, including Heart Aerospace, ZeroAvia, U.S.-based hydrogen aircraft developer, and Viridos, U.S.-based developer of microalgae biofuel.
JetBlue Technology Ventures, the corporate venture arm of the US-based JetBlue Airways, is the most active corporate investor with 6 seed and series A stage investments, including Universal Hydrogen, a U.S. provider of end-to-end hydrogen flight solutions, and Electric Power Systems, a U.S. developer of batteries for electric aircraft.
In addition to the sustainable aviation activity, Dealroom.co tracked $5.6 billion invested in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) and electric Urban Air Mobility (UAM) startups since 2016. Most eVTOLs do not contribute to the decarbonization of the aviation industry due to a predominant focus on just a few passengers, typically 2 to 8 passengers, and limited flight range, typically less than 300 km.
“They are more about enabling new mobility models in urban and semi-urban areas, with use cases such as fast trips to the airport from urban centers,” Chiavarini said.
“They are comparable to the use cases of helicopters and short-distance private jets today, and they cater to a wealthy customer base. A few eVTOLs focus on longer ranges and more passenger seats, so could contribute to decarbonizations, such as France-based Voltaero and US-based XTI Aircraft.”
The hope is that they will still contribute positively to the development of aviation by pushing forward the use of emerging technologies and making regulators more comfortable with certifying electric aircraft. “But on their own, they are not solving any sustainability problems in aviation,” Chiavarini concluded.

The network, which has announced that energy is one of its four priority issues “in the 2024 state legislative sessions,” says it is working “to prevent states from adopting unreliable, intermittent sources that make the grid less stable and increase costs,” adding that it favors nuclear and geothermal power.
The pro-renewables Energy and Policy Institute (EPI) has called attention to SPN’s 2024 state-level energy policy work, and has rebutted SPN’s claims about renewables in a brief report on the network.
“In reality,” EPI says, “methane gas failures have been primarily to blame for major blackouts during extreme weather events in recent years,” citing a Union of Concerned Scientists report.
As for increased electricity prices, EPI says that higher fuel costs for power plants that burn coal, gas and petroleum have driven those increases, citing a U.S. Energy Information Administration analysis.
EPI describes SPN as “the national organization at the center of a 50-state network of think tank affiliates that is at the forefront of disinformation campaigns against wind and solar power, and is funded by right-wing donors and fossil fuel interests.”
SPN reports annual revenues of $24 million and combined annual revenues across its 150 think tank members totaling $188 million. The network says that its 150 think tank members include 64 state-focused think tanks in 50 states.
The American Legislative Exchange Council is an SPN partner group that is “a frequent source of ‘model’ legislation that targets state clean energy and climate change policies,” says EPI.
SPN’s annual meetings, EPI adds, are co-sponsored by a fossil fuel industry group as well as “multiple groups backed by Charles Koch,” a billionaire who is CEO and chairman of Koch Industries, a privately held multinational conglomerate with subsidiaries operating in the petroleum and energy sectors.
SPN says its mission is to “catalyze thriving, durable freedom movements in every state, anchored with high-performing independent think tanks.”
EPI has also prepared profiles of three think tanks it said are affiliated with SPN and “involved in coast-to-coast efforts to block renewable energy projects”:
EPI provides brief descriptions of additional groups it says are affiliated or associated with SPN that have “also been ramping up efforts to block renewable energy”:
EPI describes itself as “a watchdog organization working to expose attacks on renewable energy and counter misinformation by fossil fuel and utility interests.”

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/12/car-batteries-can-optimize-the-power-grid/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-03-12,Car batteries can optimize the power grid,"Research from Australia suggests that employing electric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connections at a 10% penetration rate can reduce peak demand charges for local substations by 6% and substantially lower fueling costs for electric vehicle (EV) owners. However, without proper management, EV penetration levels above 20% could negate those benefits.
The study, ‘Network tariffs for V2G,’ conducted by enX and commissioned by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, aimed to explore the interaction between dynamic electricity and network tariffs (which are real-time, similar to wholesale pricing tools) and the increasing number of EVs connecting to the grid. The study also sought to understand how these EVs could help alleviate grid pressure in comparison to fixed time-of-use tariffs.

Findings indicate that V2G connections under dynamic pricing, specifically tariff types s3 & s6 in the chart above, led to the greatest substation peak demand shaving. These same dynamic pricing tariffs also saved significant amounts on EV owners’ electricity bills, with some V2G participants earning a net positive revenue on their vehicles’ electricity use, including one small account that covered 100% of their overall electricity use.
The analysis examined the load at the Metford substation in New South Wales, Australia, specifically focusing on one of the highest peak demand days of the year, March 6, 2023. On this day, the maximum peak demand reached 41.6 MW at 6pm. Under a dynamic pricing electricity and network tariff focused on peak shedding, the substation experienced a reduction of 2.54 MW in peak load. This reduction accounted for 6.29% of the substation’s peak demand value.
The analysis also found that an early morning peak is developing and expected to reach a high-stress point as V2G EVs hit a 20% uptake rate.

The dynamic pricing model achieved the most significant reduction in peak demand when applied to both network charges (including transmission, distribution, and demand-type charges) and electricity pricing. This model priced electricity based on current market rates, contrasting with time-of-use pricing that relies on fixed periods of higher and lower rates.
The analysis also revealed that a combination of bidirectional network support tariff and spot passthrough pricing (scenario s5) resulted in a reduction of 2.11 MW, nearly matching the 2.54 MW in savings from the optimal model. Models s3, s5, and s6 all generated significant savings for their car owners, as well as significant peak shaving for the substation.

In total, the analysis modeled 520 unique user accounts, including customers with solar power installations of varying sizes and diverse patterns of electricity usage. The study was motivated by projections for the year 2050, which predict a significant increase in EV battery capacity. According to the document, EV battery capacity is expected to reach approximately 2.4 TWh, four times the estimated power grid storage capacity of 0.64 TWh. The researchers emphasize that unlocking the potential of these batteries will be crucial for optimizing the power grids of the future.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/12/innovation-as-a-key-to-sustainable-solar/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,2024-03-12,Innovation as a key to sustainable solar,"The photovoltaic sector is a key player in today’s energy landscape, particularly as countries around the globe work to achieve ambitious clean energy targets. However, its integration into the energy system faces challenges ranging from technical to economic and environmental obstacles. Overcoming these challenges is crucial to the sector’s expansion. In this context, innovation plays a fundamental role in facilitating efficient integration, thus smoothing the path for the energy transition.
Innovation in the solar industry cannot focus solely on technical issues – it must also aim to make the sector environmentally sustainable. Developing ecologically and socially responsible solutions is also necessary to allow the sector to adapt to market changes. An innovative strategy called Ecovoltaica – a development, construction, and management model for photovoltaic projects – is gaining prominence by combining solar energy production with the utilization of local natural resources. The commitment of the involved actors, both companies and local agents, is key in this model. Leading companies like Soltec endorse this approach, integrating sustainability into their operations based on principles such as biodiversity protection, responsible resource use, and circular economy, as well as local socio-economic development.
Another crucial advancement is the development of green hydrogen, focused on minimizing its carbon footprint through solar-powered water electrolysis. This resource has potential as an energy vector, allowing the storage and transportation of solar energy. Soltec is anticipating this transition with the inauguration of a dedicated green hydrogen laboratory, which allows experimentation with different electrolyzers and technology optimization.
Adaptability to terrain and climatic conditions is another challenge that the solar energy sector must face. In this regard, strategic alliances – such as the one established between Soltec and the software company Aplitop – represent significant milestones in the field of innovation. This agreement aims to develop an application that simplifies terrain analysis and the design of photovoltaic installations, facilitating the creation of designs specifically adapted to terrain conditions. Soltec also employs algorithms that enable solar trackers to adopt a defensive position against hailstorms, reducing exposed surface area and the probability of photovoltaic module breakage.
The photovoltaic sector is positioned as a promising energy source, capable of significantly contributing to the decarbonization of the global energy system. Innovation offers new opportunities and solutions to address technical, economic, and environmental challenges. With the right momentum through investments and favorable policies, the sector can ultimately play an even more significant role in transitioning to an environmentally friendly energy future.
