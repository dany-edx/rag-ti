The university said it will use savings from the off-site solar contracts to fund future sustainability initiatives. 
The six solar farms, dispersed throughout the state, will produce over 50 million kWh in year one. The University of Rochester is subscribed to 1 billion kWh of production through the 25 year contract. This is comparable to the energy demand of over 7,000 homes annually and will offset the equivalent of 73,000 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Under the contract, the solar facility will deliver power to the utility grid, and the utility awards the community solar participants financial credits for the delivered electricity. The credits are applied to the university’s energy bill with a percentage going to Amp as the owner and operator. The university will receive up to 40% of the credits generated, with the remainder subscribed to by local homes and businesses.
Amp focuses on a long-term partnership model with landowners, towns, and stakeholders. The projects are designed to help local landowners maximize or repurpose their land, create local jobs, and maintain biodiversity through the planting of pollinator-friendly seed mixes for vegetative cover underneath the arrays.
Amp announced it will provide a $100,000 contribution to the university for an endowed scholarship for undergraduate students in arts, sciences, and engineering.
“As a proud member of the Rochester community, Amp is pleased to give back to the community and enable future clean energy economy leaders matriculating at the University of Rochester,” says Nicholas Topping, director of US Community Solar at Amp.
In January, Amp Energy announced the six project portfolio totaling 34 MW of community solar projects in New York State achieved financing, with CIT announcing its role as lead arranger for the $50.5 million investment. CIT is a division of First Citizens Bank.
New York State is a hotbed for community solar development in the US, especially for a Northeastern state that has land-use limitations. The Solar Energy Industries Association ranks the state 11th nationally in solar deployment, and reports about 3.1 GW installed and $7.2 billion invested to date.
The state’s successful community solar market comes in part from supportive policies like the NY Sun program. SEIA led efforts to expand and boost incentive values for community solar projects above initially proposed values. New York is projected to develop nearly 4.4 GW of solar over the next five years, said SEIA.
Amp was founded in 2009, and is headquartered in nearby Toronto, Canada. To date, the company has developed or purchased more than 6 GW of renewable energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/05/energy-storage-software-provider-posts-246-revenue-growth/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 5, 2022",Energy storage software provider posts 246% revenue growth,"San Francisco-based Stem released its Q2 2022 financial results, posting 246% revenue growth. Stem is a provider of AI-backed energy storage software and services. 
The company recently partnered with AlsoEnergy, a leading solar monitoring software provider, to fully integrate solar and energy storage software solutions. Stem said the integration of the two companies is on track.
Storage assets under management total 2.1 GWh, up from 1.8 GWh by the end of Q1 2022. The solar monitoring division has 32.1 GW under management.
Stem’s quarterly revenues exceeded the high end of guidance by 5%, achieving $67 million in Q2, up from $19 million year-over-year. Its GAAP gross margin was 12%, up from 1% in the previous year’s quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 17%.
Net losses were $32 million versus $100 million in Q2 2021. Adjusted EBITA was $(11) million versus $(8) million in the previous year’s quarter. The company ended Q2 2022 with $335 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.
The company holds a $5.6 billion 12-month project pipeline. Bookings in-quarter were $226 million, up from $45 million in Q2 2021, a 402% increase. Contracted annual recurring revenues reached $58 million, a $6 million increase over the Q1 total.
“We are reiterating our full-year 2022 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full-year 2022 bookings and CARR guidance by 20% and 7% at the midpoint, respectively, driven by continued commercial momentum achieved by our team.” said John Carrington, CEO of Stem. “Importantly, our guidance does not incorporate any potential upside from the proposed Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.”
The energy storage market is set to continue its impressive growth path as renewable energy is deployed across the globe. The worldwide energy storage market may reach 500 GW in deployment by 2031, said Wood Mackenzie. The United States and China are expected to represent 75% of global demand.
The market is expected to be highly consolidated over the next decade. The top 10 nations for deployment are expected to represent 91% of the global demand, with grid-scale storage representing the largest share of capacity.
Wood Mackenzie said it sees the United States on a path to be a 27 GW annual market by 2031, and 83% of that figure will be utility-scale storage.
“Supply chain constraints, permitting and interconnection delays, and certain regulatory actions continue to pose challenges, but we believe we remain well-positioned to manage these risks and continue with our strong execution through the rest of 2022,” said Carrington.

The company chose dual-axis solar trackers manufactured in Oregon by Stracker Solar. Stracker reports that its pole-mounted trackers generate up to 70% more solar energy annually than same-sized fixed rooftop, carport, or ground-mount systems, translating to what they estimate to be a 55% to 65% lower carbon footprint as well.
“We believe in cutting-edge technology,” says Derek DeBoer, 3rd generation Owner/Operator of TC Chevy. “Our cars and trucks feature the latest designs and manufacturing practices, and we wanted a solar power system that does the same. The fact that the Strackers are the most efficient and impressive solar solution currently available has sealed the deal.”
One of the advantages of the pole-mounted design is that the trackers and panels can be mounted above a parking lot or building. At TC Chevy, the trackers will tower above the parking lot with each of the five dual-axis solar trackers carrying an array of 28 Longi 445W bifacial solar panels on a 20 foot tall pole. They will also feature high-power LED display lighting that will illuminate the display lot. The complete five-Stracker system is expected to produce 140,000 kWh solar power per year, which will reduce an estimated 99.2 metric tons of carbon annually or the equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 117 acres of US forests every year.
“We are very aware of the local sentiment towards clean energy and sustainability,” adds DeBoer. “We thought it was time that an auto dealership goes beyond just selling electric vehicles and takes the lead in implementing clean energy measures.”
Site work is starting on the premises in early August, with trenching and laying conduit for the solar trackers. The installation of the Strackers is planned for late August.
Stracker Solar reports that its trackers are patent-pending low-maintenance, all-steel dual trackers with a 120 mph wind rating, 50-year structural and 30-year production warranties, and UL 3703 listed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/05/do-we-have-enough-engineers-to-conduct-interconnection-studies/,"EMPLOYMENT,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INTERVIEW,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"AUGUST 5, 2022",Do we have enough engineers to conduct interconnection studies?,"California grid operator CAISO has said that “few experts are available to hire” who can conduct interconnection studies for utility-scale projects, in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last year.
Grid operator MISO similarly reported to FERC in late 2020 that it has “experienced delays in performance of interconnection studies by outside consultants.”
FERC cited both comments in a recent notice of a proposed rulemaking designed to improve generator interconnection procedures.
With hundreds of gigawatts of large-scale solar and storage projects awaiting interconnection studies by grid operators and utilities across the country, the availability of experts to conduct those studies is a key issue.
In this interview, Kalyan Chilukuri, vice president for energy resources integration and interconnection with Electric Power Engineers, LLC, shares his insights on the topic. EPE partners with power and energy clients worldwide to “address complex engineering and grid modeling challenges, bridge gaps, and design and develop the grid of the future,” according to the firm’s website.
pv magazine: How far does an electrical engineering (EE) bachelor’s degree with a power engineering focus get you, toward expertise in conducting interconnection studies?
Mr. Chilukuri: Typically, a master’s degree in electrical engineering with a focus on power systems is required to ensure sufficient fundamental knowledge to enter the power systems studies field. The graduate engineer needs a good understanding of control theory and power systems analytical methods, and a good foundation in power systems and the individual components that make up the system.
Interconnection studies are only one area that power systems engineers can go into—meaning the already reduced pool of talent (power-focused EEs) diminishes further as there are many non-interconnection related positions available to power system engineers/graduates.
The challenge now is not in recruiting sufficient graduates but in training them. While external training programs can address the gaps in knowledge of tools and/or specific power systems fundamentals, knowledge of the ISO/RTO system and processes/procedures requires time, experience, and close mentoring from senior engineering staff. (Editor’s note: ISOs and RTOs are regional grid operators.) Attracting and retaining senior engineers ensures no single engineer is overwhelmed with training duties.
Given that we have a small set of senior engineers with the requisite expertise in this area, closer partnerships between consultants and ISOs/RTOs may be required to help address this training gap.
pv magazine: How far does an EE bachelor’s degree with a software engineering focus get you, toward expertise in this area?
Mr. Chilukuri: Expertise in software engineering is helpful for developing automation scripts but we find it is more useful for graduates to focus on developing the fundamental knowledge of planning and operating power systems, and building skills in Python coding through online training.
pv magazine: What job experience would a person with the relevant education need, to develop expertise in conducting interconnection studies?
Mr. Chilukuri: Any job that allows the graduate to learn a mixture of power system planning concepts, exposure to classical planning tools and electromagnetic transient (EMT) analysis tools, knowledge of renewable energy technologies and their control systems, and ultimately knowledge of the various ISO/RTO systems, processes, and procedures.
pv magazine: Are there enough opportunities for individuals with the relevant education to develop further expertise in this area?
Mr. Chilukuri: We don’t have a finishing school per se (editor’s note: engineering finishing schools are common in India) to develop the deep expertise required, other than on-the-job training. As indicated earlier, this puts some strain on senior engineering staff that need to do their day job as well as provide training and mentoring.
Regional differences in terms of how the systems operate as well as different approaches to interconnection studies and methods makes it difficult to be an expert in many different areas at once. Expertise gained is specific, and it takes time to develop expertise to span a larger footprint.
pv magazine: Is there any way to facilitate interconnection study analyses?
Mr. Chilukuri: Perhaps a finishing school (six months long or so) may be able to take graduates with a master’s degree and help them develop sufficient expertise so that any training needed on the job is around nuanced knowledge of the specific system.
pv magazine: Are we graduating enough electrical engineers with a power engineering focus?
Mr. Chilukuri: We aren’t graduating enough power-focused EEs to compete within our own industry (transmission, distribution, generation, markets, etc.) and to adequately supply interconnection teams. Not everyone wants to specialize in work related to interconnection studies, and traditional employers such as ISOs/RTOs, utilities and specialist consultancies are now starting to compete with large tech firms that are building internal teams. The compensation differences between traditional employers and these tech firms makes it difficult to retain senior talent, placing more strain on an already strained staffing situation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/05/high-performance-aqueous-calcium-ion-battery/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 5, 2022",High-performance aqueous calcium-ion battery,"From pv magazine global
Against a backdrop of soaring prices and predicted shortfalls of lithium-ion battery materials, the search for inexpensive, abundant, safe, and sustainable battery chemistries has never been more critical. Calcium has been considered in batteries, but the larger size and higher charge density of its ions, relative to lithium, have posed challenges for their insertion into electrode materials.
Now, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the United States have reported progress in addressing this issue and unlocking the potential of high-performing calcium-ion batteries.
“The calcium ion is divalent, and hence one ion insertion will deliver two electrons per ion during battery operation,” said Nikhil Koratkar, the John A. Clark and Edward T. Crossan Professor of Engineering at Rensselaer. “This allows for a highly efficient battery with reduced mass and volume of calcium ions.”
However, the larger size and higher charge density of calcium ions relative to lithium impairs diffusion kinetics and cyclic stability, he added. The team has overcome this problem by developing oxide structures containing big open spaces (heptagonal and hexagonal channels). In their work, an aqueous calcium-ion battery is demonstrated using orthorhombic and trigonal polymorphs of molybdenum vanadium oxide (MoVO) as a host for calcium ions.
The researchers have demonstrated that calcium ions can be rapidly inserted and extracted from the material, with these tunnels acting as “conduits” for reversible and fast ion transport. The findings indicate that MoVO provides one of the best performances reported to date for the storage of calcium ions.
Specifically, for trigonal MoVO, a specific capacity of ∼203 mAh g−1 was obtained at 0.2C and at a 100 times faster rate of 20C, an ∼60 mAh g−1 capacity was achieved. The open-tunnel trigonal and orthorhombic polymorphs also promoted cyclic stability and reversibility. These findings were recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
“Calcium-ion batteries might one day, in the not-so-distant future, replace lithium-ion technology as the battery chemistry of choice that powers our society,” says Koratkar. “This work can lead of a new class of high-performing calcium-based batteries that use earth abundant and safe materials and are therefore affordable and sustainable. Such batteries could find widespread use in portable and consumer electronics, electric vehicles, as well as grid and renewable energy storage.”
