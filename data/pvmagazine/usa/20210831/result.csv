The programs aim to ensure early-stage ventures have the resources to advance critical technologies toward marketable products.
The recently announced PV and storage awardees include:
Sol Clarity – Auburndale, MA: Awarded $65,000 for the development of an automated solar panel cleaning product. The Boston University-born project utilizes a small amount of electricity to statically remove dust and soiling from solar panels.
The panel’s surface is charged up to 1200 volts, which moves through three thin fingers, each of a different phase. The alternating phase layers cause the energy to move through the surface as waves, thereby pushing the dust off the panel. Sol Clarity said the power used is a capacitive load, not a resistive one, meaning very little power is used.
Worcester Polytechnic Institute – Worcester, MA: Awarded $65,000 to support a researcher’s sensor and software system for maximal localized solar generation. The researcher is developing an intelligent cloud motion vector sensor, to detect clouds by implementing machine learning techniques. The aim is to improve short-real-time forecasting of PV system performance as a function of moving clouds.

Vespr Solar – Somerville, MA: Awarded $65,000 to test a hurricane-resilient solar panel attachment. The clamp system can be installed beneath modules, with no need for power tools in installation, said Vespr. The company said full panel install can occur in less than 30 seconds per module, and grounding and attachment are completed in a single step. The “V-Clamp” can withstand 900 Lbf for uplift force, and meets NASM 1312-7 vibration standards.
Nth Cycle – Beverly, MA: Awarded $250,000 for the development of cost-effective recycling of metals from lithium-ion batteries. The company uses electro-extraction to recover critical materials from the batteries. Conventionally, these materials are recovered using pyrometallurgy or hydrometallurgy. Pyrometallurgy uses large, carbon-emitting furnaces that consume large amounts of energy, said Nth Cycle. And hydrometallurgy requires the use of harmful acids and solvents that create large masses of environmentally destructive chemical waste. Nth Cycle said the use of electricity in its novel extraction process is clean and modular, making it a more sustainable option.

The CEC Catalyst fund also provided funds to organizations working on innovations in transportation, maritime shipping, offshore wind, biomass, heating and cooling, energy efficiency, and more.
Since 2010, the CEC Catalyst fund has awarded $7.2 million to 138 new companies and research teams. Past awardees have raised over $244 million in follow-on funding.
InnovateMass has awarded over $8.5 million in funding for demonstration projects since 2013, and leveraged over $10 million in private and public investments in the space. Follow-on investments for these awardees totaled $107 million.

The company said the facility doubles its manufacturing capacity, bringing the total to 800 MW. 
The 400 MW annual capacity plant focuses on producing Silfab’s new Prime 370wt series.

Silfab said that cell sorting, glass washing, soldering, and cell alignment are all automated processes, something that the company said leads to its products having low defect rates.
The company is primarily known for its back-contact and mono PERC PV modules for North American residential and commercial markets. 
The new Prime STC series panel is rated at 20.2% efficiency, 370 W power rating, and a maximum DC voltage of 1000. It operates at temperatures between -45 degrees and 85 degrees Celsius.
The 44-lb. module contains 120 Si mono PERC half cells, includes nine busbars, and is packaged in a black anodized aluminum frame.  Module product workmanship warranty on the panel lasts 12 years, with an option to expand to 25. The company said the linear power performance is good for 30 years.

Hurricane Ida knocked out 2,000 miles of transmission lines; outages could last ‘for weeks’. Entergy counted 216 substations and 207 transmission lines as being out of service.
Greenskies and Vanguard complete rooftop industrial solar project. The two companies completed a 1,500-panel, 573 kW solar energy system for the Port Authority of NY & NJ.
Global EV growth is leaving the U.S. in the dust. Wood Mackenzie said that price continues to be a pain point for U.S. consumers as EVs are mostly aimed at the luxury end of the market.
PacifiCorp’s new IRP includes plans to ditch coal. The utility is planning no new investments in gas or coal and aims to retire all coal units by 2040.

Nextracker will supply NX Horizon smart solar trackers with TrueCapture and NX Navigator software and control systems. The purchase price was not disclosed.
Indiana will host five of the solar power plants: Elliott (200 MW), Gibson (280 MW), Ratts 1 and Ratts 2 (both 150 MW), and Posey (300 MW). The 250 MW Citadel project will be located outside of Reno, Nevada, and the 232 MW Townsite plant will be in Boulder City, Nevada.
The seven projects are all expected to be operational by the end of 2023.
Arevon said that Nextracker’s software has resulted in 2.72% energy gains at an existing solar projects that it services. Arevon’s license of NX Navigator’s monitoring and control system is expected to actively minimize risk from increasingly prevalent extreme weather.
Both Indiana and Nevada are poised for significant solar growth. Data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects close to 5 GW of solar will be installed in Indiana over the next five years, ranking the state’s pipeline as the sixth largest in the country. SEIA estimates that Nevada, ranked seventh, will install more than 4 GW over the same period.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/31/global-ev-growth-is-leaving-the-u-s-in-the-dust/,"EV,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 31, 2021",Global EV growth is leaving the U.S. in the dust,"Global electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to top 6 million units this year, said Wood Mackenzie in a research note.
China and Europe combined accounted for 47% of all car sales globally, and contributed to more than 85% of all EV sales during the first half of 2021.
The EV share in the U.S., meanwhile, has grown by 1.4%, resulting in around 270,000 first-half sales. Wood Mackenzie said that price continues to be a pain point for U.S. consumers as EVs are mostly aimed at the luxury end of the market. It also said that although the Biden administration has announced support toward transport decarbonization, regulatory and legislative changes have been slow.
The firm said that global EV sales during the year’s first half nearly tripled compared to the same period of 2020. It attributed some of the jump to slow vehicle sales caused by the pandemic a year ago. Share of EV sales in global passenger car sales doubled compared to the same period last year and now stands at 7% globally.
Wood Mackenzie said that over the past three years, EV sales have grown toward the end of the year. The current trend points to levels slightly over 6 million units for the full year, with full-year sales exceeding 2.5 million each in China and in Europe.
China led the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market in during the first half. The country’s share of BEVs grew to 9.3. In terms of total numbers, BEV sales in China reached 900,000 units, nearly double the sales in Europe.
Wood Mackenzie said that China’s dominance in the BEV market is a result of strong promotion at both ends of the price spectrum. At one end is Wuling’s Hongguang Mini which is priced at $5,000 and notched 180,000 sales in the first six months of 2021. At the other end, the second and third most popular BEVs in China were Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y, which recorded 161,000 first-half sales and cost about nine times as much as the Mini.
