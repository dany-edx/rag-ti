Through the Deploying Solar with Wildlife and Ecosystem Services Benefits (SolWEB) funding program, researchers will study the interactions of pronghorn, pollinators, birds, and other species with solar energy facilities in 26 states. This funding program also includes DOE’s first-ever investments in tools that can assess and help optimize ecosystem services at solar installations.
“DOE is committed to ensuring that renewable energy deployment protects natural environments,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “This first-ever DOE investment in tools to better understand how solar energy infrastructure interacts with native wildlife and the environment will help increase adoption of ecosystem-friendly clean energy deployment.”
Solar energy is growing rapidly in the U.S., in part to meet President Biden’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. While solar deployment has proven to benefit local communities and reduce carbon emissions by reducing the use of fossil fuels, more data is needed on how large solar installations affect wildlife and the environment.
One study conducted at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, however, found that solar farms provide better habitat than the wide-open desert. With tortoise-sized openings at the bottom of the fence surrounding the solar structure, tortoises found more shade and food under the structure. In another study conducted by First Solar at its Topaz project in Calif., First Solar uses a special fence to let endangered foxes in and their predators, coyotes, out. The study found that vegetation at the site showed “greater percent live cover, less bare ground, and higher species diversity” than on surrounding stewardship lands. In a study at the University of Arizona, researchers found that crops improve solar array performance, and the solar arrays improve crop yield in dry environments.
With DOE’s investment, it intends to expand the understanding of solar and the environment, and to also look at ecosystem services, which can also include carbon sequestration and improved soil and water quality.
Projects addressing wildlife interactions ($8.8 million):
Projects addressing ecosystem services ($5.3 million):
These projects are part of DOE’s nearly $100 million renewable power research portfolio that invests in to minimize wildlife impacts and maximize environmental benefits renewable energy technologies.
“If we hope to have an inhabitable planet for our kids and grandkids, we need to get serious about renewable energy sources – including solar power. As we take steps to combat the climate crisis, we must conduct more research to ensure that we can preserve and protect our ecosystems and wildlife as we transition to renewable energy,” said U.S. Senator Richard Durbin (IL). “I’m encouraged by DOE’s trust in Illinois’ world-class research facility, Argonne National Laboratory, and congratulate the Argonne scientists selected to lead this research.”

An international research team has fabricated a tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cell through a new technique enabling the control of tunnel oxide deposition at the atomic scale.
“This new technology is aimed to solve the issues posed by the traditional low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) methods,” researcher Liao Baochen told pv magazine. “These are, among others, high maintenance costs and low deposition rates, especially for in-situ doping.”
The scientists described the proposed method as an innovative tube-type industrial plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technique. They claimed that it can provide high-quality, dense tunnel silicon oxide (SiOx) films at a low cost and high throughput.
They said it could be easily integrated into tube-type PECVD systems used for monocrystalline PERC solar module manufacturing.
“One deposition tool is sufficient to complete the deposition of all the thin film layers, making its fabrication process more competitive than conventional methods,” the researchers said.
The group built the cell with a G1 n-type wafer with a thickness of 170 μm and an area of 440.96 square centimeters. They deposited all the films at a temperature of 200 C and a cycle time of 25 seconds. They then controlled the SiOx thickness by adjusting the number of atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycles and annealed all samples in a tube furnace at 920 C for 45 minutes to facilitate crystallization and dopant activation.
As a final step, the academics screen-printed the cells on both sides with an aluminum-silver (Al-Ag) alloy paste for the front electrodes and Ag paste for the rear electrodes. They then fired the devices at a peak temperature of around 800 C using an industrial fast-firing furnace.
The research team tested the cells under standard illumination conditions and the best-performing device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 42.65 V, a short-circuit current of 17,74 A, and a fill factor of 81.0%.
The scientists also used 60 cells to build a 613 W TOPCon module that achieved an efficiency of 22.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 41.21 V, a short-circuit current of 18.17 A, and a fill factor of 79.5%.
“The cells were half-cut by laser and double-side laminated with two tempered glass panels to form bifacial modules,” they said.
They presented the new manufacturing process in “Atomic scale controlled tunnel oxide enabled by a novel industrial tube-based PEALD technology with demonstrated commercial TOPCon cell efficiencies > 24%,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The group includes academics from Nantong University, Chinese cell maker Tongwei, Singapore’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, and China-based module maker Risen Energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/17/artificial-intelligence-could-speed-interconnection-says-amazon-executive/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 17, 2022","Artificial intelligence could speed interconnection, says Amazon executive","Artificial intelligence, or machine learning, can increase the speed and accuracy of modeling for interconnection studies for large-scale renewables projects, said Xing Wang, global leader for grid modernization for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Energy and Utilities, in a panel discussion convened by the trade group ACORE.
One type of interconnection study uses a model to evaluate how a new solar generating system will affect power flow on the grid. The model predicts power flow “but it doesn’t solve,” Wang said, meaning it doesn’t provide a solution. “You need to find out where the issues are, and that requires years of engineering experience. We have a limited number of people who know how to do that.”
Machine learning can help, Wang said, by looking into a sufficient number of cases that it can provide “some suggestions or recommendations, for example, wherever the power flow is a problem.”
Wang spoke of the “hundreds of scenarios” run by grid operator SPP as it conducts interconnection studies, where engineers must “look at where the violations are, where the congestions are.” Then “you need to allocate the cost to eliminate those congestions back to the developers. And that’s another pretty hard process. I think all of these can be addressed by AI and machine learning, if we do the right model.”
Grid operator SPP, which serves the central U.S., is in discussions with AWS about both AI and more basic improvements, such as automating data entry and data validation. SPP has “some of the best engineers anywhere, but we don’t leverage their talents in the best way,” said panelist David Kelley, SPP’s director of seams and tariff services.
Rather than engineers spending time copying data from applications, Kelley said, “we should use the talents of our engineers to make the best recommendations on whether we need this new 345 kV line from point A to point B, do we need a new transformer substation somewhere, and even that can come with recommendations from AI.”
SPP has been working on solutions with AWS over the last year, Kelley said, and is working toward getting a formal agreement in place.
AI computing applications could equally serve other regions, said panelist Matt Pawlowski, an executive for business management and regulatory affairs at NextEra Energy Resources, who initially brought the AWS and SPP executives together.
Pawlowski praised grid operator MISO for “some automated model management,” saying “those are models that other RTOs can pursue, that could be considered plug and play. And that’s what we’re pursuing. We’ve had conversations with other regions, they haven’t been as advanced as SPP, but we’re getting there.”
Responding to a question comparing SPP’s speed in completing interconnection studies with the fast pace of Texas grid operator ERCOT, Kelley said that ERCOT’s major advantage is that “cost allocation is figured out,” and noted that SPP has moved quickly to add 33 GW of wind power, and is now planning for the next 5-10 years.
Pawlowski agreed on ERCOT’s cost allocation advantage, and added that ERCOT doesn’t have affected system studies. He said one downside for ERCOT is that because it follows the UK’s “connect and manage” approach, it has higher congestion on transmission lines, which results in curtailment of some renewable generation.

The record-breaking run in power prices, particularly in Europe, is creating a favorable investment case for solar and wind projects, making it increasingly compelling to develop renewable assets purely based on project economics.
According to Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, current spot prices in Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom would all result in payback of 12 months or less. Considering the average monthly spot prices for August in these countries were all well over €400/MWh and the relatively low operating costs of renewables, investing in utility-scale projects appear to be a no-brainer.
For instance, for a generic 250 MW solar project, assuming a long-term electricity price of €50/MWh (USD 49/MWh), the expected post tax return is approximately 6% with a payback period of 11 years, Rystad calculates. A price of €350/MWh or above results in a payback period of only one year while a price of approximately €180 – the European Commission’s proposed price threshold – halves the payback to five to six years.

Investors are seeing the opportunity. According to Rystad, capital investments in renewables have increased significantly and are set to reach USD 494 billion in 2022, outstripping upstream oil and gas at USD 446 billion for the year.
“Capital investments in renewables are set to outstrip oil and gas for the first time this year as countries scramble to source secure and affordable energy,” says Michael Sarich, senior vice president, Rystad Energy. “Investments into renewables are likely to increase further moving forward as renewable project payback times shorten to less than a year in some cases.”
Rise of storage
High energy prices but also newly adopted climate legislation, including the US inflation Reduction Act and European Union’s REPowerEU plan, are expected to give a big boost to the global energy storage market.
In its latest forecast, BloombergNEF says that energy storage installations around the world are projected to reach a cumulative 411 GW/1,194 GWh by 2030. That is 15 times the 27 GW/56 GWh of storage that was online at the end of 2021.
Driven by recent policy developments, BNEF has revised its previous estimates up by 13% from the ones presented in its 2H 2022 Energy Storage Market Outlook. This is equal to an extra 46 GW/145 GWh. While an estimated 387 GW/1,143 GWh will be added from 2022 to 2030, supply chain constraints will cloud deployment expectations until 2024, says BNEF.

The United States and China are set to remain the two largest markets, representing more than half of global storage installations by the end of the decade. Europe, however, is catching up with a significant ramp-up in capacity, driven by the current energy crisis.
BNEF’s forecast suggests that the majority of energy storage build by 2030, equivalent to 61% of megawatts, will be to provide energy shifting – that is, advancing or delaying the time of electricity dispatch. Co-located renewables-plus-storage projects, in particular solar-plus-storage, are becoming commonplace throughout the world, notes BNEF.

Researchers from the Central European University in Hungary have estimated the global potential of photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) energy production on rooftops between 2022 and 2060.
Their model predicts that PVT systems have the technical potential to produce curently around 47.6 PWh, with the contribution on the PV side being around 29.5 PWh (62%), and that of thermal production 18.1 PWh (38%).
The study uses a high-resolution, geospatial energy supply model to estimate the useable building rooftop areas across eleven world regions and calculates the corresponding global and regional production that should be provided by rooftop PV-T collectors during the 39-year perios. The model builds on an existing model called BISE, which has three major types of inputs: meteorological, building-related and technological parameters. According to the authors, the strength of their algorithm is that “it requires only easily obtainable and reproducible input data for meteorological and technological measures.”
The scientists assumed the electric and thermal efficiency of the PV-T collectors to be of 21.6% and 63.3%, respectively, as well as a temperature coefficient of -0.35% C for the PV unit. They also assumed the PV panels to rely on monocrystalline cells and an antireflective tempered glass and the thermal modules to be based on a flat plate collector and a copper absorber. For both technologies, degradation rates and possible technology advancements were not considered.
The model estimated total rooftop area values to vary between 3 billion square meters in Europe and 70 billion square meters in centrally planned Asia, including China, in the first year of the simulation period. However, only one-third of the total rooftop area was considered suitable for the installation of PV-T collectors.
By 2060, the highest installable rooftop area is expected in centrally planned Asia, Latin America, and North America. The lowest area is projected for Sub Saharan Africa, at 4.75 billion billion square meters, and Europe, at 1.2 billion billion square meters.
Total PV-T energy production potential is expected to be highest in centrally planned Asia, North America, and Latin America, with 9.7 PWh, 6.0 PWh, and 4.5 PWh, respectively.
“The most restrained potentials, on the other hand, are expected in Europe (0.24 PWh) and Sub Saharan Africa (1.28 PWh) where either the geographical (climatic) or the utilization potential of solar collectors may be reduced,” the scientists said.
Between 2022 and 2060, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are expected to see the greatest increase in PV-T energy production potential.
The scientists described their findings in “Estimating the global technical potential of building-integrated solar energy production using a high-resolution geospatial model”, which was recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.
“As the flexibility and the complexity of the BISE model allows and it could lead to even more robust estimations, our forthcoming studies will also prioritize simulations of solar potential undertaken at urban and neighborhood scale and supported by very high-resolution LIDAR-based rooftop information,” they said.
