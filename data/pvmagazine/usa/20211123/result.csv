Investments in gas and electricity networks, the broader energy transition, and energy services; including storage, EVs and waste-to-energy, accounted for $57.2 billion of the quarter’s total of $72.8 billion in deal value.
This trend of a higher focus on renewable deals began its ramp up in the first half of 2020. EY strategy and transactions partner, Miles Huq, in previous conversations with pv magazine, said individual deals in renewable energy are typically lower in value, so the total value driven by these transactions shows continued investor confidence.
That mark of $72.8b in deal value represents the highest level of investment in the last eight quarters, showing the potential of a return to pre-pandemic levels of deal activity. Corporate investors acquired $8.3b of renewable assets in Q3, as compared to $3.2b acquisitions by financial investors.
There were 53 deals in the Americas, which includes Central and South America, with cumulative deal value of $23.9b, a 69% increase from Q2. Value was driven by very large “megadeals” in energy services and networks assets. Renewable assets drove deal volume with 17 deals.
The report also asserts that utilities are trying to sell off their fossil fuel generation assets, instead focusing on keeping nuclear, renewables and regulated businesses in their portfolios. In return, financial investors are jumping at discounted assets that are critical for grid stability. To illustrate this point, the authors point to the Public Service Enterprise Group selling off its 13 gas-fired plants to ArcLight Capital, a private equity investor, for $1.9b against the assets’ book value of $4.5b.
And while emergent climate and renewable tech historically have been slow in drawing large investment activity, that narrative may be changing, as Q3 saw significant investments in hydrogen technologies. According to the report, gas utilities are increasingly betting on hydrogen to help them transition to clean energy companies.
For example, the report outlines that Avangrid announced plans to construct a 20 MW electrolyzer and hydrogen storage facility for its Connecticut gas and electric utilities, powered by renewable energy from offshore wind. Across the country, American utilities have announced more than 26 hydrogen pilot projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/23/hydrostor-plans-400-mw-3200-mwh-compressed-air-energy-storage/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 23, 2021",Hydrostor plans 400 MW / 3200 MWh compressed air energy storage,"An affiliate of Hydrostor filed an application for a 400 MW / 3200 MWh long duration energy storage (LDES) project with the California Energy Commission (CEC). Hydrostor deploys compressed air energy storage, a technology that is able to store and dispatch energy for long durations.
As the region’s 2,200 MW Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is set to retire in 2024/2025, the LDES project has a target for commercial operation date as early as 2026. The project is expected to have a capital investment of around $800 million.
LDES technologies are viewed as important components in an evolving grid that features a growing share of renewable energy. They provide reliability services, and are hailed for their synergies with the weather-driven generation cycles of renewables.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It first compresses off-peak or surplus energy from the grid, producing heated compressed air. Then, the heat is extracted from the air stream, and stored inside a thermal store, preserving the energy for later use. The compressed air is stored in a tank that uses a process called hydrostatic compensation to maintain constant pressure during operation.  When the energy needs to be dispatched, pressure forces air to the surface, where it is then recombined with heat, and sent through a turbine, producing dispatchable electricity.
The company said its technology has a 50 + year system life, uses no toxic materials, is emissions-free, and can provide rotational inertia in support of grid stability.
The plant, named the Pecho Energy Storage Center, will be able to deliver 400 megawatts of electricity for 8 hours, and will be comparable in physical size to some of California’s largest fossil fuel power plants. It is planned to interconnect at an existing 230 kV PG&E Morro Bay Switching Station, strategically located to serve California’s central coast.
The Pecho Energy Storage Center is expected to create 30 to 40 permanent, full-time jobs, and 200 to 450 labor jobs during construction. 
In June, the CEC said it would procure 1,000 MW of LDES, with duration of eight hours or longer, to be activated between 2026-2028. LDES technologies are continuing to take stage in the climate discussion, with an international LDES council formed at the recent COP26 summit. The council projects a need for 85 to 140 TWh of global LDES by 2040 to meet decarbonization goals, which could entail an investment of $1.5 to $3 trillion.

As Maxeon waits on potential U.S.-based solar cell fab, it launches Air panels in Europe. Maxeon exec Mark Babcock joined pv magazine to talk about Maxeon’s Air solar panels, and the company’s possible U.S. manufacturing expansion.
Ohio regulators approve another 600 MW of solar. The projects include the 275 MW Cadence Solar Energy project, one of the largest projects to be approved for construction in the Buckeye State.
Megawatt-scale, bifacial solar project enters service in Yukon, Canada. The Solvest-developed 1.76 MW project will sell power as an IPP for the next 25 years.

The project features 4,000 bifacial solar modules, which produce electricity on both faces. In Yukon’s springtime, this is particularly advantageous, as most of the ground is covered in highly reflective snow, and the days are sunny and long. Solvest said bifacial panels offered a 9% boost in overall production when compared with monofacial options.
The modules face south, with a 30 degree tilt, and seven-meter spacing between rows. The foundation is built of iron piles driven 15 feet deep to support galvanized steel racking. The project is expected to produce 1.8 GWh of electricity, enough to power 180 homes per year.
Yukon’s IPP policy allows private businesses, communities, and First Nation Governments to build renewable energy projects and sell power directly to the grid.
The project was built in partnership with Yukon Development Corporation’s Innovative Renewable Energy Initiative (IREI), a program that offers funding for small-scale, community-led renewable energy projects. IREI offers funding up to 75% of expenses for a maximum of C$500,000 ($392,000) for emissions-reducing facilities that sell power to Yukon.
