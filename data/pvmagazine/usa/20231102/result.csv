The project, located in Maricopa County, Arizona, includes 377 MWdc solar panels and a 300 MW alternating current battery energy storage system (BESS) with a duration of 1200 MWh.  It is expected to begin operating in mid-2025.
Other projects developed by Longroad include Sun Streams 2, a 200 MWdc solar project that started operating in the middle of 2021. Suns Streams 3 is a 285 MWdc solar panel and 215 MWac storage facility that is expected to begin running next year. Suns Streams 3 storage duration is 860 MW/h. All of Longroad’s facilities are based in Arizona. 
Sun Streams 4 will use bifacial solar silicon panels supplied by Ohio-based First Solar. The panels used for this project will produce up to 480 W and have a 0.3% annual degradation rate, the company reports. Automotive Energy Supply Corporation (AESC) will provide inverters along with lithium-ion cells for Sun Streams 4 BESS.
The BESS will be integrated with Powin’s Modular and Scalable Centipede Energy Storage Platform, and Powin will manage long-term operations and maintenance (O&M) services for Longroad’s latest facility in conjunction with NovaSource Power Services. The latter also offers O&M services for solar panel installations.
Longroad will leverage Nextracker’s solar tracker technology to ensure Sun Streams 4’s panels maximize solar production by following the sun all day. Sungrow solar inverters were selected for the project.
Longroad states that Sun Streams 4 will generate over 200 jobs during the building phase. McCarthy Building Companies Inc., a commercial construction business, will manage the engineering, procurement and development part of the project, as its renewable energy team is based in Arizona. This decision also represents the continuation of McCarthy’s partnership with Longroad as the contractor developed Sun Streams 2 and is currently building Suns Streams 3. 
Construction workers and engineers are expected to receive prevailing wages per Arizona’s labor laws. Prevailing wages are yet to be determined, as the Department of Labor is currently surveying heavy highway construction industries to set wage rates. Longroad is including Registered Apprenticeship provisions that allow workers to get paid experience in conjunction with classroom training. Both are requirements for companies leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Tax Credit program for applicable green energy projects.
Longroad states that Sun Streams 4 will add over $100 million to Arizona’s economy through long-term leases with the Arizona State Land Department and tax remittances. The funds will go toward improving state schools and the quality of life for Arizona communities.
Longroad has entered a power purchase agreement with Arizona Public Service (APS), the state’s largest electric utility provider. The joint venture is meant to help increase grid reliability in the state, especially during the peak summer demand months, as Suns Streams 4’s total output is enough to power 120,000 homes. 
Longroad acquired debt financing led by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). CIBC directed a group of investors, including financial services company The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, U.S. Bank tax credit investments and syndications subsidiary U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance and German universal bank Commerzbank AG through the loan process. 
“Sun Streams 4 has the distinction of being Longroad’s largest project to date by both megawatts and investment capital,” said Paul Gaynor, chief executive officer of Longroad Energy.
The organization has 4.9 GW of domestic renewable energy projects. Longroad has obtained over $12.8 billion worth of equity, debt and tax equity to fund its renewables portfolio.

The solar glass will provide approximately 82 kW of solar power, producing an estimated 107,000 kWh annually. The project is expected save the company in annual operating costs and reduce the facility’s carbon footprint.
ClearVue’s single-pane laminate glazing was developed in partnership with D2Solar.
The company uses nano- and micro-particle technology to internally diffuse, redistribute and reflect elements of incoming light towards the edges of its clear glass panel, where it is collected by monocrystalline silicon PV modules. The modules are placed into a circuit, which is designed to collect energy rays from multiple directions.
The California project build on previous solar greenhouse projects, including the Murdoch University R&D Greenhouse in Perth, Australia, operational since 2021. It also installed solar glass at the Sendai Ignis resort in Japan via its licensee Tomita Technologies.
At the test installation in Perth, daily average energy production is near 1.6 kWh generated by about 25 square meters of solar windows. The installation produced about 500 kWh over the course of a year of operations from 2019 to 2020. The company said a 1000 square meter installation could produce about 70 kWh per day.
“Greenhouses have been an integral part of our strategy from day one as we understood the growing global need for renewable energy solutions for sustainable agriculture,” said Martin Deil, chief executive officer, ClearVue Technologies. “We are thrilled to work in partnership with System USA, a company setting the modern global standard for excellence in efficient greenhouse facilities.”
ClearVue PV technology uses an activated interlayer, sandwiched within a panel composed of two or three glass panes, some of which are coated with specialized thin-films. The solar glazing is covered with a low-emissivity coating.
The design allows for PV production without sacrificing maximum natural daylighting for the crops below. The color rendering index (CRI) of the windows is as high as 99%, leading to an unaltered color rendering or appearance of all objects behind the ClearVue glass, said the company.
ClearVue said its technology can lead to up to 32.5% savings in energy costs when compared to conventional single-glazing greenhouse paneling.
“ClearVue glass also has the potential to add efficiency to automobiles, public transport, agriculture and mobile electronic devices,” said the company.

At the pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, experts discussed what to expect in terms of manufacturing capacity, what technologies will be manufactured, and how manufacturers will maintain quality, reliability and durability while growing the domestic industry.
In this session, moderated by pv magazine editor-in-chief Jonathan Gifford, panelists include Theresa Barnes, manager of PV reliability and system performance group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); Mark Culpepper, general manager of solar at Zeitview; Terry Jester, managing director of PI Berlin in North America; and Nicole Thompson, head of data science property insurance with kWh Analytics.
Big floppy modules
One of the notable developments in the PV industry over the last few years has been the adoption of larger modules, which Theresa Barnes said are popular due to high energy yield. These modules offer lower overall cost and higher energy yield. However, she said they tend to be “big floppy modules,” because to make a module that large, some of the components have to be very thin in order to keep the weight down.
As a result, Barnes said that they can be less mechanically durable than smaller modules. “In some cases, that’s okay. But we have to understand that these modules have less room for error, they don’t have this big design safety factor for mechanical loads, that some of the smaller, more stouter, thicker modules used to have” Barnes said.
Unfortunately, NREL is seeing early failures in the field at fairly high rates, which Barnes said is attributed to the glass because with a thinner frame, the glass becomes part of the load structure. Now there’s 2-millimeter glass on the front, compared to 3.2 millimeters in smaller designs. And that glass is heat strengthened, but not fully tempered, because glass can’t be tempered below a certain thickness, Barnes said.
Hail testing and more
In terms of testing of these large-format modules, Terry Jester said PI Berlin’s sister company PVEL is seeing quite a bit of deflection with the center glass modules and that perhaps hailstone testing needs to be stepped up hail-prone regions. Jester said this would move us to a regional series of tests, and that it behooves module manufacturers to look at statistics on hailstones in particular regions and possibly step up internal testing as a result. Once in the field, damage is not always obvious as it does not always end up in the glass, but EL inspection may spot damaged cells.
In addition, large-scale solar plants are being built not just in the sunny south, but also in the central U.S., which experiences more hailstorms than other regions. Nicole Thompson of kWh Analytics pointed to the need for testing and the need to further standards to test for more than 1.8 joules, which she said is equivalent to less than one inch of hail. In addition it’s important for labs to test these modules and quantify the differences between 3.2 millimeter tempered glass and the two millimeter non-tempered glass, Thompson said.
Zeitview conducts aerial inspection of solar installations, completing assessments of about 6,200 assets this year in the U.S. Mark Culpepper said glass crack analysis has become one of Zeitview’s fastest growing services. Cracks can cause both performance and safety issues, and the safety issue could be ground faults. This can occur if a module has a deep crack and then gets rained on. Ground faults can be serious safety issues for crews on site, he said.
While the industry has trained itself to try to cut costs, Culpepper said “I do think there is a point of diminishing returns there,” noting that he thinks the industry is discovering that 3.2-millimeter glass is probably more appropriate than the thinner glass in hail-prone regions.
Gathering data
One of the challenges in figuring out failure rates is lack of data. Thompson said that companies are addressing standardization of data, which will make distinctions between costs of projects, maintenance, resilience and more. She said insurance premiums should reflect that reduction of risks that you have by having a more resilient site.
The data being gathered in the field and in internal testing is extremely important to manufacturers who are putting 25- or 30-year warranties on modules. Jester said that at PI Berlin they spend a lot of time ensuring for clients that modules are built to the standard that’s promised, and gathering data from what’s happening in the field is an essential piece of information.
“Obviously anything you can get from the data that can help feed your decision making both on design and factory operations, I think will only help us as an industry,” she said.
Most of the module manufacturers coming to the U.S. are planning highly automated factories, but as Jester pointed out, automation doesn’t substitute for good practice and good data analysis within four walls of a factory. In addition to automating, they should look at lab reports, field reports, as well as at what the insurance companies are finding, and then then refine the design as appropriate.
“If that design loop can continually feed itself, I think, well, we’ll get stronger as an industry,” she said.

Global investments in the solar energy sector touched the $308 billion mark in 2022, registering a massive increase of 36% over 2021 levels. Still, solar accounted for only 11.5% of the overall energy investment in 2022 ($2.6 trillion), according to a new report by the International Solar Alliance, released at its recent sixth assembly in New Delhi
The report stated that solar investments are overwhelmingly concentrated in a few developed countries in the Asia Pacific Region, followed by Europe and North America. In 2022, Asia Pacific and Europe and North America accounted for 55% and 33% of global solar project development investment, respectively. Within these regions, investments have been dominated by economies that have a mature PV market, such as China, the United States, Japan, Spain, Australia, the Netherlands, South Korea, Brazil, Vietnam, Germany, and India. 
China and the United States have consistently attracted the most annual solar investments, with their combined share of about 50% of all solar investments since 2015. Only a small fraction of global investments in the solar sector is being made in emerging and developing economies such as the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Thus, these regions are lagging behind in the race of solar energy deployment.
The report states that to accelerate global investments in solar energy, it is vital to prioritize these developing and underdeveloped regions across the world that have a huge unrealized solar potential.
Solar project development accounted for nearly 90% of the total investments made across the solar value chain in 2022. Segment wise, utility-scale solar segment accounted for the highest investments in solar project deployment with a share of 43% followed by residential solar segment at 39% and commercial & industrial (C&I) solar segment at 18% in 2022.
Private finance was a major contributor to solar energy projects, accounting for more than 80% of total investments between 2015 and 2022. The public sector contributed to the remaining investments during the same period. 
The report states that for ensuring just energy transition and inclusion, more finance needs to be mobilized from public players as most of the private financing is directed towards advanced economies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/02/solaredge-tumbles-on-significantly-reduced-q4-outlook/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",SolarEdge tumbles on significantly reduced Q4 outlook,"SolarEdge, a provider of string inverters, power optimizers, and energy storage, is weathering challenging conditions, with its stock price tumbling 10% to 20% of its value in the hours following its Q3, 2023 earnings report.
The company is suffering from the same macroeconomic and regulatory forces that are squeezing the residential solar industry. High interest rates and the reduction of net energy metering credit values are causing sharp declines in demand for SolarEdge and its peers. And the entry of Tesla into the string inverter market may be causing further downward pressure on the company.
SolarEdge shipped 8 GW of AC inverters and 121 MWh of batteries in-quarter.
For Q3 2023, the company posted revenues of $725 million, $676 million of which is from its solar segment. However, looking ahead to Q4, SolarEdge provided guidance of $325 million in revenues.
This has caused the stock price to crater, as SolarEdge is a high-growth stock that relies on steadily increasing revenues to push its value higher. Its major competitor Enphase similarly posted significantly depressed revenue estimates for Q4.
“The results for the third quarter fell short of our prior expectations and are reflecting a slow market environment, which has resulted in high inventory of our products in the distribution channels, in particular in Europe,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer, SolarEdge.
The company also posted an earnings per share of -$0.55, a negative surprise of 172% when compared to Wall Street consensus estimates. GAAP gross margins were 19.7%, and gross margins from the solar segment were 0%. The company posted an operating loss of $16.7 million in-quarter.
“While channel inventory clearing is expected to continue in coming quarters, we are optimistic about the future of the solar PV industry and are confident that our leading technology, global presence and broad product offering will enable us to continue to be a leader in this market,” said Lando.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/02/h2b2s-california-facility-to-produce-up-to-three-tons-of-green-hydrogen-per-day/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",H2B2’s California facility to produce up to three tons of green hydrogen per day,"Green hydrogen solutions provider H2B2 Electrolysis Technologies is working on the largest operational green hydrogen production plant to date in North America, which will be powered entirely by renewable energy.
The project – called SoHyCal – is located in Fresno, California, and is currently fully operational in its first phase, in which it is producing up to one ton of hydrogen per day using biogas and electrolysis technology. 
In its second phase, it will transition to also using solar energy from a nearby photovoltaic plant, and is expected to scale up to producing up to three tons of hydrogen per day – enough to power 210,000 cars or 30,000 city buses every year. It will also continue using biogas to produce hydrogen in this phase. The facility is expected to get to this point by the second quarter of 2024. 
Both the biogas and solar energy sources are adjacent to the site, and directly connected to it, Pedro Pajares, CEO of H2B2 USA, told pv magazine USA. SoHyCal is a behind-the-meter facility.
In May, H2B2 announced that it had entered into an agreement with RMG Acquisition Corp. III,  a special purpose acquisition company, to take the former public. H2B2 was founded in 2016, and while most of its presence is in the U.S. and Europe, it is also expanding in the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. 
The green hydrogen market is viewed as having significant potential, according to the company, and forecasts indicate it could reach a value of $10 trillion by the end of the decade. The industry’s growth will come from various sectors, including industrial use, transportation, and power generation, the company said. 
However, one of the challenges the industry faces is the correct development of infrastructure and financial models to support the hydrogen ecosystem, Pajares said. 
In terms of how policymakers could address these challenges, Pajares said they “are taking the right steps to develop both the market and the ecosystem. If any, I would add the legislative needs to keep listening to the private sector as a whole, from producers to consumers to infrastructure and supply chain.”
The Fresno facility has also received regulatory support, including in the form of a $3.96 million grant from the California Energy Commission’s clean transportation program. That funding has been key to getting the plant to its 1 ton-per-day of hydrogen production capacity, and the fuel is being used at hydrogen refueling stations in the San Joaquin Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.
California regulators have also been providing funding to other players in the hydrogen market. In August, heavy-duty battery and fuel cell vehicle manufacturer Nikola announced it had received $58.2 million in grants from various regulatory agencies – including $41.9 million from the California Transportation Commission and $3.3 million from the California Energy Commission – to build a network of hydrogen refueling stations for heavy-duty trucks.

Now, in 2023, the U.S. market may exceed 30 GW in one year! As megawatts have grown to gigawatts the inverter market has diversified and matured, but bigger inverters aren’t necessarily the growing trend. Central inverters still dominate the U.S. utility solar market but string inverters are beginning to get more traction in 10+ MW projects.  
“…When a central inverter goes down for anything more than minor maintenance, it takes down several MWs of generation potential with it. The prolonged downtime for repair or replacement can be detrimental to project performance,” said Jason Ellsworth, CEO, Clēnera 
Earlier this summer, Clēnera, a Boise, Idaho-based solar developer and asset manager began commercial operation of Apex Solar, a 105 MWdc solar project in Beaverhead County in southwestern Montana. The project is contracted to NorthWestern Energy under a 20-year power purchase agreement and is expected to generate carbon-free power equivalent to the annual consumption of 13,500 households. Unlike most of Clēnera’s previous projects that use central inverters, the Apex Solar plant is utilizing 275 kWac string inverters made by CPS America.  
Advantages of string inverters include their relatively small size and weight, the ability of the project owner to store spare replacement inverters on-site, and the lower production losses when an inverter goes down.
According to Jason Ellsworth, Clēnera co-founder and CEO,
As a company, we are aggressively seeking innovations that improve reliability. At Apex, string inverters are just one of the steps we’ve taken to ensure maximum reliability and performance. As a long-term owner and operator, we care deeply about the lifetime performance of each project.  We will continue to find ways to improve reliability, enhance performance, and extend the lifetime on all our projects.
In the dynamic landscape of the utility-scale solar market, which is anticipated to reach 23 GW of deployment in 2023, agility is paramount. In a recent interview with the CPS America’s leadership team at RE+ in Las Vegas where 40,000 energy professionals gathered, Bryan Wagner emphasized CPS’s “Lightspeed system” that bridges communication across its diverse departments, from R&D to sales to service. This nimbleness, he argues, translates to annual product evolutions, moving CPS’s inverter market share from a modest 2-3% five years ago to their current market share of 8%. 
In 2016 GTM predicted that string inverters would achieve 20% market penetration in U.S. utility solar by 2022. Globally, the penetration of string inverters into utility solar is already 50% according to some sources.
According to CPS Global, string inverters are adopted at 80-90% of all their projects in some European & Asian countries.
“The Apex Solar Farm project is a testament to CPS‘s commitment to integrate the benefits of string into utility scale projects like Apex Solar and we couldn’t be more excited that Clēnera put their trust in CPS America on this project,” said Bryan Wagner of CPS America.
