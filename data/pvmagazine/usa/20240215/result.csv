Now the company is stepping into solar glass manufacturing, setting up shop in Georgia to generate 5 GW to 6 GW of solar glass a year.
The U.S. solar manufacturing supply chain is bolstered by new solar module entrants, but it has lagged behind in solar glass manufacturing. Solarcycle aims to change that by taking the circular and sustainable approach of recycling the glass from used or damaged panels to make new solar glass.
The company made the announcement alongside Georgia Governor Brian P. Kemp, stating that Solarcycle’s $344 million investment will create more than 600 new full-time jobs in Polk County.
“Solarcycle’s first-of-its-kind facility is a transformational investment for the Polk County community and will help drive its economy for years to come,” said Governor Brian Kemp. “In Georgia, our strong energy mix is one of the key reasons our state has attracted generational investments in recent years. We will keep working to secure our power supply through exciting projects like this one.”
The glass plant, scheduled to begin construction in 2024 and to be operational in 2026, will be located in a Georgia Ready for Accelerated Development (GRAD) certified site in Cedartown. The company reports that the plant will be the first of its facilities to manufacture glass in addition to recycling solar panels.
Solarcycle operates solar recycling facilities in Odessa, Texas and Mesa, Arizona, and has long-term partnerships with more than forty of the largest solar companies in the U.S. to reuse and recycle their solar panels. The new glass facility in Georgia will position Solarcycle as one of the first manufacturers of specialized glass for crystalline-silicon (c-Si) photovoltaics in the U.S., the company reports.
Solarcycle recently inked a recycling deal with Qcells, a major manufacturer of solar modules, also with facilities in Georgia. While the Solarcycle glass announcement does not state that Qcells will be a customer, Qcells operates one of the largest solar manufacturing operations in the United States, with plans to expand production to 8.4 GW annually by the end of 2024.
“The United States’ landmark Inflation Reduction Act has spurred unprecedented levels of domestic manufacturing investments,” said Becca Jones-Albertus, Director of the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office, which has invested $1.5 million in Solarcycle’s research and development efforts. “We are excited to see U.S. solar companies expanding their footprint in the domestic solar supply chain and creating economic opportunities in their communities.”

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/15/california-introduces-bill-to-reestablish-rooftop-solar-net-metering/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-15,California introduces bill to reevaluate rooftop solar net metering,"California Assemblymember Laura Friedman has introduced AB 2256, which would require the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to fully consider the costs and benefits of rooftop solar when revisiting its net energy metering (NEM) tariff.
The bill would require CPUC to consider the total benefits of rooftop solar, including improved local air and water quality, avoided land use impacts, and any associated system cost benefits.
“The CPUC currently only considers some economic benefits of rooftop solar,” said a fact sheet on the bill. “As NEM is not simply a rate structure but rather, a far-reaching policy initiative with goals and outcomes that will shape the future of clean energy and climate change in California, it is critical for policy makers to consider all relevant information in re-designing the tariff that has proven integral to meet our climate goals.”
NEM helped California launch the nation’s leading rooftop solar market, achieving Governor Schwarzenegger’s million solar roofs initiative, and under NEM the state has since reached two million solar roofs.
The California Air Resources Board has projected that the state needs to double its rooftop solar to reach targets of 90% emissions-free electricity by 2035 and 100% by 2045.
California’s rooftop solar market has been screeching to a halt ever since the NEM 3.0 rulemaking decision was implemented. The rate structure lowers compensation for exported solar production by about 75% and makes batteries an essential component of a residential solar project. This, combined with high interest rates, has worsened customer economics for rooftop solar, no longer presenting a cash flow positive investment in many cases, said installer HES Solar.
The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) said about 17,000 jobs have been lost, demand for rooftop solar has fallen about 80%, and solar business insurer Solar Insure told pv magazine usa that 75% of its covered companies are considered a “high risk” for bankruptcy. Major publicly traded global equipment providers like Enphase and SolarEdge have made significant cuts to their workforce.
The California Energy Commission (CEC) projects that the state will need to build 6 GW of solar-plus-storage every year for the next 26 years straight to meet the 2045 target. Over the past five years, California has only averaged about half of the 6 GW deployment figure. The state has averaged about 2.3 GW of utility-scale solar-plus-storage installations over the past few years, far behind the pace to reach that near mid-century goal of 100% carbon free power. CALSSA said the goal is impossible to reach with a utility-scale only model, which the state seems to be hurdling itself toward.
Save Solar coalition
Also this week, over 60 organizations submitted letters to Governor Newsom, state legislative leaders, and the CPUC to call for immediate action to restore the state’s rooftop solar growth. The letter to the governor can be found here.
The coalition called out several requests for getting rooftop solar and storage back on track, including:
The requests were signed by Laura Deehan, Environment California, Roger Lin, Center for Biological Diversity, Bill Allayaud, Environmental Working Group, and many other California environmental and community leaders.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/15/reducing-cost-of-residential-solar-financing-with-virtual-power-plants/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,2024-02-15,Reducing cost of residential solar financing with virtual power plants,"Solrite Energy is rolling out a new finance package for residential solar-plus-storage, claiming its enhanced terms are directly tied to the benefits derived from virtual power plants (VPP).
Using the advanced technical capabilities of sonnen’s energy storage hardware, their power purchase agreement (PPA) aims to tap into the growing potential of VPPs, offering homeowners in selected regions a way to participate in energy markets.
According to a press release shared with pv magazine USA, Solrite Energy’s PPA is now accessible to homeowners in California, Puerto Rico and Texas. The company is planning expansions into New York, New England and Hawaii later this year. These regions offer opportunities for homeowners to integrate their residential solar and storage systems into the broader power grid. This integration occurs during periods of high demand, allowing homeowners to generate revenue by providing grid services.
For example, in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the National Grid’s ConnectedSolutions program seeks to pay energy storage owners up to $400/kW during high grid demand events in Rhode Island, and $225 in Massachusetts. Similarly, Eversource, another major utility in Massachusetts, offers a similar program.
Sonnen recently updated its energy storage systems to be “NEM Proof,” specifically tailoring its technology to thrive under California’s net energy metering 3.0 electric rate environment. This update introduces an optimized time-of-use solution, designed to maximize value for homeowners by strategically managing energy storage and consumption. Solrite says homeowners will also have access to the battery’s backup features.
Solrite is actively recruiting contractors via its website to offer its finance and technical product to end users.
While Solrite states that its offering is a market-first, it’s likely that national residential solar companies like Sunrun and Sunnova have previously adjusted PPA pricing to reflect additional revenue streams. However, Solrite distinguishes itself as the first to explicitly market its PPA as more advantageous, directly attributing the improved pricing to revenues generated from VPPs.
Sonnen has been a pioneer in harnessing battery assets for power grid support via its “sonnen communities,” with the inaugural community established in 2015. By 2018, the company achieved prequalification from TenneT, enabling it to engage in Germany’s primary control energy market with its solar-plus-storage network.
In the United States, Vermont’s Green Mountain Power took the lead in utilizing distributed assets to aid the power grid. The utility reported that 500 distributed Tesla Powerwalls, alongside two larger energy storage facilities, collectively saved its customers $500,000 over the summer by alleviating demand during peak hours.
The Tesla Powerwalls, through a collaborative agreement between the utility and homeowners, are installed in private residences. This initiative has successfully expanded to include several thousand units.
In 2019, Sunrun was the first residential solar asset owner to win the right to earn revenue from their installations through a “solar as a service” model, when the company was awarded a contract to contribute grid services in the NEISO power grid region. This has opened up the possibility of offering customers enhanced contract terms, potentially sharing some earnings. In the fall of 2022, the asset network was turned on for the first time, leveraging around 5,000 residential solar-plus-storage systems, delivering over 1.8 GWh of energy during times of peak demand.
Following regulatory approval, Tesla launched its inaugural VPP in Texas, establishing networks that leverage solar energy and Powerwalls to support the grid.

During the summer of 2023, Tesla Powerwall participants in the company’s new VPP began seeing revenues during peak-demand periods, with some reporting total earnings over $400, triggered when electricity prices reached $4/kWh.
Sunnova’s initiative to launch a “microutility” in California, aimed at equipping neighborhoods with their own power and comprehensive grid services, was unfortunately not approved. However, such forward-thinking proposals hint at the transformative potential awaiting the energy sector’s future.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/15/survey-finds-26-of-battery-storage-systems-have-fire-detection-and-suppression-issues/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-02-15,Survey finds 26% of battery storage systems have fire detection and suppression issues,"Around 26% of energy storage systems that were inspected by Clean Energy Associates (CEA) during a recent survey showed quality issues connected to their fire detection and suppression systems, according to a report from the clean energy advisory company.
The findings led the report’s authors to conclude that thermal runaway still poses a significant risk to the energy storage industry. In addition, the survey found 18% of the energy storage systems had issues with the thermal management system. 
“Fire suppression and thermal management systems are critical for functional safety, and defects in these systems can lead to increased risk of fire,” the report said. 
CEA conducted more than 320 inspections on over 52 battery energy storage system factors, collectively auditing over 30 GWh of lithium-ion battery storage projects. In total, the exercise identified more than 1,300 manufacturing issues, the company reported. 
Markets in the U.S. and across the world have been deploying increasing amounts of energy storage to help smooth out renewable power. In fact, the total amount of energy storage installed in the U.S. in the first three quarters of 2023 exceeded total deployments for the previous year, and would have been much higher, if it weren’t for delays that affected 80% of projects in the pipeline, according to a report from Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).
Experts say that multiple factors are driving the battery storage market, including price declines. Median prices for grid-scale lithium-ion battery storage systems shrunk 23% quarter over quarter, according to the report, thanks in part to easing supply chain challenges and lower commodity prices. 
However, policy-makers are also keeping a close eye on the risks posed by lithium-ion batteries, which have been known to cause fires – such as the 2019 McMicken fire at an Arizona Public Service (APS) system, which injured eight firefighters and a policy officer. Last September, a fire occurred at a battery storage in northern San Diego County, California – the Valley Center Energy Storage Facility, a 139 MW project. That fire necessitated evacuating people from homes and businesses within a quarter mile of the storage system’s site. 
CEA’s analysis took a closer look at issues at the system, module and battery cell levels. It found that some 50% of quality assurance findings were system-level defects. Two factors drive this trend, according to the report: systems tend to be complex and vulnerable to problems that were actually caused further upstream and escaped earlier quality checks, and the integration process for battery storage systems tend to be highly manual and labor intensive, and don’t always have stringent quality control procedures.
“A takeaway is there is no perfect production line or supply chain or manufacturer… So definitely doing due diligence before procuring and then in the factories is a must for buyers. The industry has matured a lot, but it’s not there yet – I think that’s quite obvious,” said George Touloupas, senior director, technology and quality with CEA, during a webinar conducted by Energy-Storage.news.
But while lithium-ion batteries present these risks, Touloupas said they remain the prominent storage technology being purchased today.
“[I]f we need a lot of hours of storage, then maybe flow batteries or other technologies become competitive – but as we are today, there’s nothing else than lithium-ion,” he said, adding that he’s optimistic that the industry is reacting and addressing these safety challenges. 
Noah Roberts, senior director of energy storage with the American Clean Power Association, noted that the report’s findings do not mean that these faults exist in energy storage facilities connected to the grid. In fact, he said, under current industry standard practices, and the nationally recommended safety standard, NFPA 855, all of the faults identified in this report would be corrected during the project installation and commissioning process.

“It is critical that the topic of this report—a subjective evaluation of manufactured products still on the assembly floor—is not conflated with the highly regulated, evaluated, and tested energy storage equipment currently serving the electric grid,” Roberts added.
This article was amended on Feb. 19, 2024 to add comments from Noah Roberts of the American Clean Power Association.

The program intends to provide up to 30,000 low-income households with low cost solar and storage installations to residents who own and occupy a single-family home in an eligible neighborhood and qualify using Energy.gov’s eligibility map and questionnaire. The DOE determines neighborhood eligibility by assessing whether it has a high percentage of low-income residents and experiences long and frequent power cuts. While the systems that will be deployed under the Solar Access Program will reportedly have no up-front costs to the households that receive them, the households will have small contributions to the long-term maintenance of the systems, a cost that the Grid Deployment Office expects will be offset by energy bill reductions.
Qualified applicants must then collect all the required documentation and contact a local solar ambassador to guide them through the application process.  
Energy.gov states that qualified applicants must demonstrate they are low-income through enrollment in a government assistance program, including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, Nutrition Assistance Program or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. 
Having a household resident dependent on an electricity or battery-powered medical device because of a medical condition or disability also may qualify a resident. 
The Solar Access Program is funded by the Puerto Rican Energy Resilience Fund. The $1 billion grant is managed by the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (GDO), the Federal Energy Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It was started after President Biden visited Puerto Rico following Hurricane Fiona in October 2022. He committed to allocating federal resources toward improving Puerto Rico’s electric grid through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into law two months later and included $1 billion to establish the PR-ERF. 
Energy.gov states that the fund has been developed in consultation with Puerto Rican entities and communities to reduce the energy burden of the territory’s most vulnerable residents as the region continues to increase its energy resilience. According to the DOE’s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool, the average energy burden for low-income households across the U.S. is 8.6% (three times) higher than for non-low-income households, estimated to be 3%.
The Solar Access Program is the consumer-facing application phase of the first round of funding of the PR-ERF. Last summer, the GDO published a funding opportunity announcement for up to $450 million toward residential solar and storage installations and developing consumer protection and education resources. Eligible applicants included private industry, educational institutions, state and local government entities, nonprofits, and energy cooperatives. In November 2023, three solar businesses, seven nonprofits and five cooperatives began negotiations to receive up to $440 million toward solar and storage installations and developing education, training and consumer protection programs about them.  
The PR-ERF is part of Puerto Rico’s effort to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050 and 40% by 2025. The region currently has 680 MW of distributed solar, according to a study by the DOE. Puerto Rico also has 1.6 GWh of residential-sited batteries and an additional 4,500 rooftop solar arrays being added every month. Each includes a 100% battery attachment rate.
