It also offered significantly lower than expected guidance for revenues next quarter, posting an expectation of $550 million to $600 million, dramatically lower than the consensus forecast of $748 million. Following the earnings report, share prices dipped about 10%.
The Fremont, California based manufacturer has hit some choppy waters in the macro environment, as rising interest rates and stabilizing electricity prices have lowered demand for residential solar in the United States. While the company has posted strong sequential growth in Europe, slowing U.S. sales are expected to persist into next year, pulling down revenues.
U.S. residential solar is further being hampered by policy changes, particularly around reductions in compensation for net energy metering. California notably entered NEM 3.0 in April, and other states have followed suit.
ROTH Capital Partners managing director Phil Shen warned in an industry note that in addition to slowed demand, the emergence of Tesla as a residential string inverter provider may pose risk to Enphase’s market share. While Shen notes that Enphase is a superior product with a better value for total cost of ownership, customers and installers alike may be more attracted to a lower cash ticket price for the string inverters provided by Tesla. ROTH estimates that 20% to 30% of U.S. residential solar market share may go to Tesla.
Enphase posted Q2 revenues of $711 million, falling short of the consensus $722 million. It delivered 2.1 GWdc of microinverters and 82 MWh of energy storage. Earnings per share reached $1.47, coming in above the consensus of $1.25. ROTH lowered its 12-month price target from $250 to $185 and maintained its buy rating. The stock stands at $150 per share at time of writing.
The company also authorized a $1 billion stock repurchase program, a common tactic for businesses that may be looking to stem a declining share price and believe their company is undervalued in the market.
As demand for U.S.-made components has increased under the regulatory environment created by the Inflation Reduction Act, Enphase has begun making contract manufacturing partnerships. Contract manufacturer Flex is producing IQ8 microinverters in Columbia, South Carolina. It recently was visited by President Joe Biden to commemorate the launch of the site. It also began a new contract manufacturing operation with Foxconn in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The two facilities shipped about 50,000 microinverters in Q2. Enphase said it is on track to begin shipments from a third contract manufacturer in Q3 2023.
Enphase U.S. manufacturing footprint will total $60 million in capital investment, create 1,800 direct jobs, and produce 18 million microinverters per year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/28/doe-announces-27-million-for-clean-energy-plans-for-disadvantaged-communities/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 28, 2023",DOE announces $27 million for clean energy plans for disadvantaged communities,"DOE describes a successful project as one having equitable program innovation, multi-jurisdictional partnerships, and scalable outcomes that can leverage DOE and other resources to speed and scale deployment of innovative clean energy strategies nationwide.
The U.S. Department of Energy Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP) is opening applications for the $27 million Energy Future Grants (EFG) program. These grants are intended to encourage local, tribal, and state governments to partner with community-based organizations, academia, utility companies and non-profits on projects that benefit disadvantaged communities.
The goal of the EFG funding is to address barriers preventing low-income and disadvantaged communities from realizing the benefits of clean energy. These communities have long suffered from fossil fuel pollution near their homes, lack of access to renewables-driven affordable electricity, climate change, and more. The program promotes ideas led by EFG teams of at least 3 to 4 governmental partners joining together to present solutions in and across the power, transportation, and building sectors.
“To champion an equitable clean energy future, we must work with communities to foster integrated clean energy solutions across the power, transportation and building sectors,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “These Energy Future Grants represent an opportunity to spearhead innovative projects through collaboration, creating clean energy solutions that are equitable, and scalable of clean energy strategies nationwide.”
The EFG program plans to make approximately 50 awards with each awardee team potentially receiving about $500,000 in federal funding. Applicants are required to submit a Community Benefits Plan (CBP) outlining how the project will achieve four goals: (1) support community and labor engagement, (2) invest in the American workforce, (3) promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA), and (4) contribute to the Justic40 goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.
For more information, visit the Energy Future Grants webpage. Those interested in the grant program can register for webinars. A general overview will be offered on July 27 webinar (taking place at 2 p.m. ET) and a general overview webinar + tribal liaison Aug. 3, (4 p.m. ET
3 (at 4:00 p.m. ET). Applications are due September 30, 2023, at 5 p.m. ET.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/28/bonneville-power-plans-transmission-upgrades-to-connect-6-gw-of-solar-wind/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 28, 2023","Bonneville Power plans transmission upgrades to connect 6 GW of solar, wind","The federally owned Bonneville Power Administration is “moving forward” with transmission projects budgeted at $1.35 billion, with expected completion between 2025 and 2032, the utility said.
If all the projects are built, they would provide 6 GW of additional capacity on BPA’s transmission network.
The planned transmission projects would upgrade existing BPA transmission lines that carry power from east of the Cascade Mountains to the Puget Sound area and Portland.
The projects, along with substation and line projects, “are a major part of BPA’s Evolving Grid effort” that is designed to meet regional transmission needs over the next two decades, the utility said.
One of the transmission projects would upgrade an existing transmission line from 230 kV to 500 kV, approximately doubling the line’s capacity.
The list of planned transmission projects is likely to expand when BPA finalizes its 2023 cluster study for generator interconnection requests, the utility added.
The region served by BPA is expected to see at least 10 GW of new generating resources interconnected by 2032, consisting of about 90% solar and wind power and the rest fossil gas, the Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee projected last year.
Generation projects waiting in BPA’s interconnection queue for a final interconnection study include 49 GW of solar, as shown on the nearby map, 21 GW of wind, and 51 GW of storage, the utility said in an April presentation.
BPA said that “traditionally” 10% to 15% of generator interconnection requests “follow through to energization.”
The Pacific Northwest region now has more than 7 GW of wind and solar generation interconnected.
BPA said its planned transmission upgrades will help meet load growth in Portland and Seattle, driven by the high-tech industry and electrification of transportation and buildings. BPA projects “reduced operation” of 4.5 GW of carbon-emitting generators in the coastal region, and said that “replacement” solar and wind resources are located east of the Cascade Mountains. The three dynamics are indicated on the nearby map.
BPA maintains about 75% of the high-voltage transmission network in its service territory, and markets power from 22 GW of hydropower plants.

A process launched last year by Governor Jay Inslee and U.S. Senator Patty Murray, both of Washington, evaluated breaching four hydropower dams in the lower Snake River to protect salmon populations from going extinct, and replacing their generating capacity with renewables. Building 1.3 GW of solar, 1.4 GW of wind and 0.2 GW of battery capacity would be the lowest-cost option for replacing the four dams’ annual generation, said a study cited in a draft report commissioned by Governor Inslee.
Washington State has set a target for all electric utilities to be greenhouse gas neutral by 2030, while Oregon has set a target for greenhouse gas emissions to be 80% below the 2005 baseline by 2030, BPA said.

This principle is currently being showcased by Spring Hill Greens, a Colorado-based farming operation nestled between two greenhouses. Their unique vertical bifacial solar panel system optimizes land use while potentially capitalizing on the high albedo effect of the highly reflective greenhouse materials.
We get morning sun and evening sun but during the day we also get reflection off the buildings which we hope will produce a significant amount of solar–Tom, from Spring Hill Greens Farm in Fort Collins

The system’s design and installation were handled by Sandbox Solar. While they don’t yet have a tool to fully measure the albedo effect without a control vertical system, the company has commenced experiments to provide further insights into generation curves.
Ian Skor, owner of Sandbox Solar noted that the production on snowy days is dramatically higher than any other installation. The project’s peak generation periods are at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., which Skor likened to a “reverse duck curve”.
To help design and simulate the generation curves of the facility prior to construction, Sandbox Solar employed their inhouse software, SPADE Agrivoltaic.
Preliminary data shows promising results. During the months of September through April,  the vertical bifacial system produced 559.28 kWh/kWp. This performance surpasses that of a nearby east-west rooftop system owned by Spring Hill by 14%, which produced 489.93 kWh/kWp. However, it falls behind a south-facing ground mount project, also a Spring Hill property, which achieved an output of 857 kWh/kWp, by 34%.

Denver-based Greentech Renewable provided the hardware for the project, which includes Canadian Solar 445 W BiHiKu bifacial solar modules, SolarEdge 11.4  240V single-phase inverters, p505 rail mounted optimizers, and Tamarack bifacial vertical solar fence racking.
Acknowledging the customer’s initial desire to maximize land use, Skor commented, “My summary is that the system saves dramatically on footprint and can increase the number of usable project areas. The production during snowy days is dramatically higher than any other installation. This application may work extremely well in northern climates that experience significant snowfall.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/28/six-terawatt-hours-of-grid-scale-energy-storage-by-2050/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"JULY 28, 2023",Six terawatt hours of grid-scale energy storage by 2050,"Energy storage is about 10 years behind solar PV on the cost-adoption curve. In the U.S., we currently have 550 GWh of pumped hydro energy storage, which is 90% of the grid-scale energy storage. That leaves 61 GWh of ‘other’ including lithium ion, metal-air, zinc, and a variety of flow batteries. It’s estimated by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories that we need 6 TWh of energy storage to ‘clean the grid’ by 2050, which means we need to scale grid-scale energy storage by 98.4 times…let’s just say we have to 10X and then 10X again (100X) the storage industry in the next 30 years.
Reuters recently hosted a webinar examining the latest developments and trends in grid-scale energy storage in the United States, which this author moderated. The subject matter expert panelists were Leslie Ponder of Black & Veatch and Annam Muthu of Engie North America. The major theme was the massive growth projected for the U.S. energy storage market, with installations forecast to increase 10-fold between 2023 and 2030. This rapid expansion is being driven by clean energy targets, the need for energy security, and new financial incentives like the IRA. However, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize this potential, including permitting and interconnection issues, workforce shortages and upgrading grid infrastructure.
On the technology front, lithium-ion batteries currently dominate, but alternatives like flow batteries and thermal storage are gaining traction for longer-duration needs. Form Energy has been making waves with a series of announcements including a 1000 MWh project in Minnesota and 1500 MWh project Georgia. Repurposing retiring fossil fuel plants as storage sites is an emerging trend, combining existing infrastructure with new storage assets. For example, adding lithium-ion batteries or a hydrogen storage facility to a shuttered coal plant or one that is converting to natural gas and hydrogen as in the case of Aces Delta project by Mitsubishi and Magnum Development that will store 300 GWh of green hydrogen.
According to Muthu, standalone storage projects are proliferating in Texas due to faster interconnections and permitting relative to other ISOs. Revenue prospects from market volatility also make ERCOT attractive. Key siting criteria include transmission congestion and land availability to enable future expansions.
For longer-duration technologies, Ponder cited targets to reduce costs from ~$1400/kW currently to $650/kW by 2030. These systems can scale duration more easily by separating power and energy components. However, siting and permitting remains challenging, especially for large pumped hydro facilities.
Regarding project timelines, Muthu noted lithium-ion systems can reach commercial operation within 2 years in Texas, versus 4 to 5 years in California due to interconnection queues. Ponder stressed that for emerging technologies like pumped hydro, permitting alone can take 5+ years.
In summary, the webinar highlighted the tremendous scope for energy storage growth, while underscoring that critical challenges around siting, regulations, grid upgrades and workforce development must be tackled to realize the industry’s full potential. Continued technology innovation, public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms will be essential to enabling rapid and sustainable market expansion. There is a follow-on conference, Energy Storage North America 2023 in Houston, Nov 7-8.
