The detainments stem from enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which was implemented in June 2022 by the Biden Administration.
The UFLPA places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the Xinjiang region of China, home to roughly 50% of the global polysilicon supply chain, are made using forced labor. The act places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever. China has denied allegations of using forced labor of Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group, at its work camps in the region.
“There’s clearer guidance out, and we’re seeing more shipments coming through,” said John Podesta, a senior clean energy advisor to President Joe Biden, speaking at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.
The Energy Information Administration said about 20% of utility-scale solar projects, sized 1 MW and larger, were delayed in the first half of 2022, largely due to module supply shortages related to the investigation, as well as to COVID-19 slowdowns and goods seizures from UFLPA.
Reuters shared that more than 900 MW of Trina Solar panels have cleared customs in the last four months, and less than 1% of the company’s shipped products were detained for examination.
“Trina’s data systems and supply chain management allow us to provide detailed traceability documentation, upon request by U.S. Customs,” Melissa Cavanagh, a spokesperson for Trina Solar, told Reuters in an emailed statement. “This has significantly reduced delays at the ports.”
As of October 2022, over 1,000 shipments had been blocked from entering the U.S. market, primarily consisting of Trina, Jinko, and Longi solar panels. In response to public records request last month, U.S. Customs said it released more than a quarter of the 1,433 electronics shipments it had detained under UFLPA, but it would not specify how many of those were solar products.
“Companies are aggressively shifting their supply chains, helping to ensure that solar installed in the U.S. is ethically sourced and has no connection to forced labor,” said Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) chief executive officer Abigail Ross Hopper in a March 9 note. “While the solar and storage industry acts swiftly on supply chains and building a stronger domestic manufacturing base, ongoing threats of steep tariffs are holding back the potential of the historic Inflation Reduction Act.”
A steady supply of solar components will be needed to build out the U.S. energy transition. Based on different policy assumptions, SEIA projects a difference of 40 GW between low-case and high-case scenarios for deployment through the next ten years. SEIA projects that U.S. solar capacity could expand from 141 GW today to well over 700 GW in 2033. Projections for 2023 and 2024 show a broad market recovery, with growth across all sectors averaging 19% per year until 2027.
“While 2022 was a tough year for the solar industry, we do expect some of the supply chain issues to ease, propelling 2023 growth to 41%,” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “With major uncertainties ahead of the industry, our high- and low-case scenarios can help the industry benchmark potential outcomes. In each scenario, there is roughly 20 GW of upside or downside risk over the next five years — the same amount of capacity installed last year.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/10/inside-transferability-or-selling-renewable-energy-tax-credits/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 10, 2023","Inside transferability, or selling renewable energy tax credits","The renewable energy industry is eagerly awaiting guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide guidance on the wide set of rules and regulations that surround the $369 billion in incentives contained within the Inflation Reduction Act.
One provision awaiting clarity to proceed is transferability, or the sale of tax credits. However, the market is moving ahead with tax credit sales without guidance.
This activity was reviewed in a whitepaper written by Keith Martin, co-head of projects, Norton Rose Fullbright. Martin said that production and investment tax credits on solar and wind projects are generally trading between 90¢ and 92¢ per dollar of tax credit. He said that a significant number of these transactions are in the term sheet stage, with some moving into documentation.
“The market is looking to Treasury for guidance about a number of issues, but in many cases, the tax bar has already formed a view and the lack of guidance should not stop transactions from moving forward,” said Martin.
Martin expects prices to rise as more buyers enter the market, especially as deadlines approach to file tax returns and buyers will have a clearer picture of their tax liabilities. He said industry members expect prices settle at 95¢ or 96¢, although some brokers expect them to reach as high as 98¢. Some recent offers in the 80¢ range have been rejected by sponsors, said Martin.
The Inflation Reduction Act enables clean infrastructure owners to sell nine different types of tax credits to others for cash. Credits generated after 2023 are eligible, and the rules of these sales can be found in section 6418 of U.S. tax code. There are nine types of tax credits that can be sold. U.S. tax code 45, 45Y, 48, 48E, 45Q, 45V, 45U, 45Z 45X, 48C and 30C set the rules for these credits.
The nine credits are production tax credits for generating renewable or nuclear electricity, capturing carbon emissions or producing clean hydrogen and clean transportation fuels (like sustainable aviation fuel), tax credits for manufacturing wind, solar and storage components or processing, refining or recycling 50 types of critical minerals.
The tax credits also apply to building new factories and re-equipping existing assembly lines to make or recycle products for the green economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at existing factories by at least 20%. There are tax credits for installing electric vehicle and other clean fuel charging stations in low-income and rural areas.
Tax credits can only be sold once, and a buyer cannot resell the tax credits it purchases. The buyer must pay cash, and tax credits that are carried into one year from another year cannot be sold.
The deadline to sell tax credits after they are generated is at least until year end and likely the due date for filing the tax return for the year, said Martin. For example, 2023 tax credits could be sold up until the seller files its 2023 tax return in 2024. The buyer claims the tax credits in its tax year that ends on the same date as the seller’s tax year, or the date that straddles the back end of the seller’s tax year for buyers with different tax years. The buyer can carry credits forward if not used immediately.
Sellers must notify the IRS of the sale by filing an election. The sales proceeds do not have to be filed as income. Buyers pay less than a dollar per dollar for the credits so they may profit from the transaction.
Tax equity partnerships 
Martin said that it is now standard practice in partnership-flip tax equity transactions for the tax equity investor to require the right to direct the partnership to sell credits. All tax equity transactions involving production tax credits, and 80% of tax equity financings involving investment tax credits, are structured as partnership flips, said Martin. Read more Norton Rose Fullbright insights on solar tax equity structures and partnership flip structures and issues. 
One might wonder why a project developer would carry transaction costs to put tax equity financing in place and then incur more of such costs to have the equity partnership sell the credits. The tax equity investor demanding the right to force a sale sometimes pays the sale costs, said Martin.
“Combining both approaches allows the developer to ‘step up’ the tax basis on which investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation are calculated by selling the project company to the tax equity partnership near the end of construction for the appraised value the project is expected to have when fully built,” Martin said in the whitepaper. “When the tax credits are later sold, they are calculated on the fair market value rather than the bare cost to construct.”
Rising tax equity also offers the developer value for the depreciation on a project, said Martin. Tax credit sales are also a way for some tax equity investors who lack current tax capacity to remain active in the market.
“Another reason to try to move a project into a tax equity vehicle is tax equity provides upfront funding for projects on which production tax credits will be claimed over 10 years on the electricity output,” wrote Martin. “PTC sales are likely to draw annual or quarterly payments as tax credits are earned. Some banks are exploring lending bridge debt against the future payment streams in cases where there have been forward sales of all 10 years of tax credits. However, early offers from lenders have been at advance rates as low as 50% of the future payment streams.”
Sales of tax credits by equity partnerships raise a few problems, which Martin outlined in the whitepaper. For one, the partnership will have to indemnify the tax credit buyer if the tax credits are recaptured or disallowed by the IRS. Norton Rose Fullbright’s analysis of the four complications can be found here.
Guidance needed
Companies are looking for guidance on whether a partnership between a private developer and such investors qualifies for a cash payment for the share of tax credits that belongs indirectly to the tax-exempt or government entity. The market assumes the answer is no, said Martin.
Another issue to be clarified is whether the tax credit buyer must report income equal to its profit when it uses the tax credit to extinguish a tax liability.
And, the Inflation Reduction Act remains unclear on who gets audited and has to pay any audit adjustment where tax credits have been sold. The market assumes that the IRS will come after the seller for any taxes that have to be paid after a recapture or disallowance of sold tax credits, but the Treasury must confirm this, said Martin.

The non-profit has garnered financial support from corporations and foundations, enabling the program to be being offered at no additional cost to the developers. The Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund works alongside partner Monarch Joint Venture.
“Pollinators are an important keystone species that are in dire need of habitat,” says Peter Berthelsen, executive director of The Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund. “Through this program, we’ll have an incredible opportunity to work collaboratively with solar developers to not only increase pollinator health and habitat, but to also deliver a set of significant environmental and sustainability benefits that include carbon sequestration, increased soil health, better water quality, and more.”
The new Solar Synergy program consists of uniquely designed outcomes that deliver four key benefits to renewable energy projects:
1. High-value pollinator seed mixtures: Two different seed mixtures will be used on each project: one for use within the solar array area that is designed to work with each project’s solar panel heights, and one used in the buffer, or open areas of the project, designed with 40+ different native wildflower species.
2. Extensive monitoring of pollinator health: The Monarch Joint Venture will collect baseline and ongoing pollinator and habitat information for Solar Synergy program sites on an annual basis.
3. Carbon sequestration documentation: Baseline and ongoing carbon readings will be used to document carbon sequestration gains. The program will then help connect purchasers of potential carbon credits to each project. The Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund has entities waiting in line to purchase carbon credits that may become available on the sites.
4. Increased opportunity for honey production: The Solar Synergy program will be producing a large amount of high-quality pollinator habitat on project sites, offering a unique opportunity to connect solar project developers to commercial beekeepers. Increasing beekeepers’ access to high-quality pollinator habitat can create opportunities to increase the production of U.S.-sourced honey.
Solar paired with pollinator plantings has been found to be a win-win proposition at sites across the country. In New York state, for example, the Monroe County Water Authority (MCWA) has a pollinator-friendly solar project that was developed by Sol Systems. The 29 acres facility was planted with a seed mixture of pollinator plants, which will create new habitats for local pollinators, boosting the surrounding ecosystem.
In Maryland, Perdue Farms has a pollinator-friendly ground cover at a solar installation located at the company’s headquarters. Planting took place in 2018 under the guidance of the Bee and Butterfly Habitat Fund and Fresh Energy, a catalyzer of pollinator-friendly solar.

Polar will supply its terrain-following Axsus series single-axis tracker for the construction of the Camillus Site 1 (6.61 MW), Camillus Site 2 (6.64 MW) and Vernon Site 1 (5.93 MW) community solar projects.
OYA Renewables is the project developer for the community solar projects located in Onondaga County, N.Y., where the Camillus 1 and Camillus 2 projects are taking subscriptions under National Grid’s local community solar access program.
Polar will complete the tracker order supply by the end of March 2023 and provide engineering and design services for the New York solar portfolio.
The Axsus tracker follows undulating terrain and is designed to perform significant pre-assembly in a controlled environment. Initially designed in the laboratories of a leading automotive manufacturer, Polar’s trackers have been tested to automotive standards. Highly evolved automotive manufacturing best practices have been applied to tracker installation methodology for a modular, on-site factory process to increase assembly efficiencies, Polar says.
“I believe that the Axsus tracker will continue to be the solution of choice for projects throughout the USA because of its ability to reduce grading costs and assembly times for developers and installers,” said Vishal Lala, managing partner of Polar Racking.
Polar Racking continues to grow with an active pipeline of over 1,000 MW across the United States and Canada.
On March 1, OYA Renewables secured a $216 million project financing commitment for 15 New York community solar projects as part of its 2023 pipeline.  Of the total financing, $145 million is a construction term loan from CIT Group, Amalgamated Bank, Siemens Financial Services, Comerica Bank and Cadence Bank. An additional $71 million tranche of the investment is tax equity from Monarch Private Capital.
OYA Renewables has more than 1.44 GW of solar currently deployed in the community solar and utility markets, generating enough electricity to power 720,000 homes on an annual basis.  The company has a 9 GW project development pipeline of projects within the solar, EV charging and other clean technologies in 14 US states.
At the New York Solar Energy Industries Association’s (NYSEIA) 2022 New York Solar Summit, held on December 13, 2022, Doreen Harris, president & chief executive officer of New York Research Development Authority (NYSERDA), said the Empire State deployed 4.24 GW of cumulative solar installations, mostly due to the NY-Sun program and 13,000 solar energy jobs created to date.
NYSERDA’s December 2021 submission of the Distributed Solar Roadmap set in play a strategy of deploying 10 GW of distributed solar resources by 2030, pursuant to PSC docket 21-E-0629.

Marie solar portfolio northwestern Ontario, Canada for a purchase price of $50.2 million, along with the assumption of $169.5 million of existing debt.
“The acquisition of Sault Ste Marie supports our strategy to increase geographic and technological diversification, while benefiting from reliable, quality cash flows through its attractive contracted profile,” said Michel Letellier, president and chief executive officer of Innergex. “We are also pleased to enter this part of Ontario where heavy industries are looking to decarbonize, which could bring additional opportunities for Innergex in the long term.”
The portfolio includes the Sault Ste. Marie 1, 2, and 3 facilities, which were all commissioned between 2010 and 2011 and have had an excellent operating track record since then, with a historical 5-year weighted-average availability of 98.5%, according to Innergex.
The Independent Electricity System Operator signed on as the off-taker for all three facilities under long-term power purchase agreements.
Innergex reports that the assets are expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $33.1 million in 2023, with operating, general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.1 million during the same period. Innergex expects the portfolio to be immediately accretive based on these historical averages.
Canadian developer Innergex develops, acquires, owns and operates hydroelectric facilities, wind farms, solar farms and energy storage facilities, in Canada, the United States, France and Chile and manages a portfolio of assets currently consisting of interests in 87 operating facilities with an aggregate net installed capacity of 3.7 GW and an energy storage capacity of 159 MWh, including 40 hydroelectric facilities, 35 wind facilities, 11 solar facilities and 1 battery energy storage facility.
Last year the Hawaii Supreme Court upheld a utility’s approval of a power purchase agreement for the Paeahu Solar plant, owned by Innergex. The agreementhad been challenged by  a Maui community group that alleged that the solar facility would cause potential harm with water runoff. The Supreme Court found that the Coalition did not show how the project would exacerbate water runoff or damage native plants and ultimately found that the PUC had properly evaluated allegations of harm and had  lawfully approved” the utility’s agreement to purchase energy from the Paeahu solar plant.
