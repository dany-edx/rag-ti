https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/30/california-energy-commission-awards-grant-for-low-income-multifamily-solar-and-storage-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 30, 2022",California Energy Commission awards grant for low-income multifamily solar and storage project,"Yotta Energy announced it received a $1.23 million grant from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to install a pilot system on an 11-story multifamiily low-income housing complex Santa Ana.  
Yotta said the installation has potential to decarbonize existing technologies, decrease the demand on the grid, and increase at-home and at-business electric vehicle charging adoption rates. The project will demonstrate replicability options for other underserved communities throughout California, said the company. Yotta said the project is particularly important as an example of addressing energy insecurity, which 30% of Americans struggle with.
“Our state has long been dedicated to introducing and integrating renewable energy, but as lower-income areas lagged behind in adoption due to a lack of resources, these communities have experienced elevated air pollution levels,” said CEC chair David Hochschild. “We look forward to working with Yotta Energy on this project to demonstrate the viability of these installations and how we can replicate similar types across the state.”
The project includes both rooftop PV and battery backup, utilizing Yotta Energy’s scalable technology. The suite of Yotta products includes the SolarLEAF panel-level lithium-iron-phosphate energy storage device, a DPI microinverter at each module, and Yotta Energy Services software and gateway for energy management. Yotta also partners with AP Systems, PanelClaw, and Energy Toolbase in its fully integrated solar and storage systems.
Last year, Yotta introduced the SolarLeaf, a distributed battery installed beneath individual solar panels. The 1 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate batteries are designed for commercial and industrial flat roofs. Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries are hailed for their enhanced thermal management capabilities and lower fire risk than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
The company will work with the Electric Power Research Institute, a preeminent nonprofit energy research and development organization to document the project for replication and scaling. Solar developer Promise Energy will bring its services to the project, as well.
The project is expected to commence this month. Ahead of the installation, Yotta will perform data collection at the Colorado campus of the Solar Technology Acceleration Center, one of the largest test facilities for solar equipment in the United States.
“This is a significant step for the city of Santa Ana as the state looks to adopt and implement greener technologies into its buildings,” said Omeed Badkoobeh, CEO of Yotta Energy. “Not only will this project lead to a cleaner, healthier local environment, but it will also open the door for economic prosperity and growth in Santa Ana. As we expect to continue growing and implementing our solution in communities nationwide, we look forward to ensuring that everyone has access to a reliable energy supply.”
In April, the Department of Defense’s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program awarded Yotta $1.97 million for a new solar and storage microgrid project at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Earlier this year, Yotta Energy announced it would partner with Cal Solar, Inc, a solar energy storage design-build engineer and contractor for new commercial and multifamily construction, to begin deploying systems on new buildings following California’s mandate for new commercial buildings to integrate solar.
“With the new building code requirements that go into effect in 2023, we anticipate that the demand for solar and storage will continue outpacing industry analysts’ predictions,” said Sean Neman, CEO & Founder of Cal Solar Inc.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/30/solaredge-investigated-for-alleged-patent-violation/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,COLORADO,ISRAEL,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 30, 2022",SolarEdge investigated for alleged patent violation,"Ampt, a power electronics specialist based in Colorado, filed a lawsuit against SolarEdge, a major player in the power electronics space, for allegedly violating their patents. The company said that SolarEdge violated patents on “power optimizers that contain high-efficiency power converters that both allow maximum power-point output and use operational boundary conditions that continue producing power during conditions that might otherwise require the optimizer to be bypassed.”
Now, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has accepted the complaint from Ampt, and will launch an investigation into the alleged patent infringement. The ITC set a target of 45 days from the announced investigation to complete the review.
Ampt is seeking a ban of imports of SolarEdge products as well as a ban of a sale of these products in the United States after they are imported.
“We appreciate the Commission’s decision to investigate SolarEdge’s unlawful use of our proprietary technology without asking our permission or compensating us,” said Levent Gun, Ampt chief executive officer.
Simultaneously, Ampt filed a patent infringement action involving claims from eight of Ampt’s U.S. patents in the U.S. District Court in Delaware against SolarEdge seeking a finding of patent infringement, substantial monetary damages and an injunction.
Responding to the lawsuit SolarEdge told pv magazine:
“SolarEdge and AMPT have been litigating a dispute involving a patent family filed by SolarEdge and a patent family filed by AMPT before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for many years. Recently, the USPTO awarded priority of invention to SolarEdge, cancelled the claims of AMPT’s patents, and awarded the patent claims in these AMPT patents to SolarEdge.”
“It appears that having lost before the USPTO, AMPT is now shopping around its claims to other courts. SolarEdge anticipates a vigorous defense of these new cases.” 
SolarEdge, along with other players in the solar industry, is expected to grow significantly following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes record spending for renewable energy technologies. JP Morgan recently increased its 12-month share price target for the company, listed as SEDG, from $373 to $419. The target implies a 51% increase from its current share price of $277.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/30/polysilicon-price-relief-in-2023-as-industry-scales-to-500-gw-capacity/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 30, 2022",Polysilicon price relief in 2023 as industry scales to 500 GW capacity,"Solar polysilicon has reached its highest pricing since 2011, when the price of polysilicon hovered between $60 to $80/kg for about two years as the industry cooled off, following the $460 per kilogram peak seen in early 2008.
According to a spot market analysis by China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, last week’s price touched $45.47/kg, before settling a bit lower. This is an increase of over 600% from the low pricing of under $7/kg, seen in the second quarter of 2020.

Source: Bernreuter Research
If we consider that it takes about 3 grams of raw polysilicon to create each watt of a solar panel, then a 400 watt residential solar panel uses 1.2 kg of polysilicon. The largest panels – 700 watt utility-scale modules – use 2.1 kg. At today’s pricing, that is $51 of polysilicon for the residential panel, at 12.7¢/watt. The 700 watt utility scale panel contains $90 of polysilicon.
Keep in mind that these spot market prices are likely much higher than the prices being paid in long term contracts. The cost of polysilicon inputs hasn’t risen nearly to the same heights, so companies that produce their own polysilicon are actually paying much less for their input costs.
Multiple parties have suggested that the industry should see significant volumes of polysilicon manufacturing come online as the year ends, which would lead to decreases in pricing starting in 2023.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA), in their PV Price Forecasting Program Q2 2022, says they expect ‘significant expansions among ingot and wafer suppliers are expected to create a competitive market scene when these suppliers can once again source lower-priced Polysilicon.’ The group says that by the end of 2022, the world will have approximately 285 GW of polysilicon manufacturing capacity online.

While the executive preview version of the report doesn’t share future polysilicon pricing, CEA does suggest that the average 2022 wafer pricing of $0.13/W could fall as much as 23% by the end of 2023. This implies that polysilicon pricing could fall by roughly $10 per kg. This will lead to solar modules – priced at $0.27/W FOB China for Q4’22, and $0.26/W FOB China for Q1’23 – to fall to $0.23/W by the end of 2023.
Bloomberg NEF recently suggested that by the end of 2023, there will be enough polysilicon manufacturing facilities to supply 500 GW of solar modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/30/honda-and-lg-team-up-to-manufacture-ev-batteries-in-the-u-s/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 30, 2022",Honda and LG team up to manufacture EV batteries in the U.S.,"LG Energy Solution (LGES) and Honda plan to invest $4.4 billion and establish a new joint venture manufacturing plant in the U.S. that is expected to have an annual production capacity of approximately 40 GWh.
The pouch-type batteries produced at the new plant will be supplied exclusively to Honda facilities in North America. While the location for the joint venture plant has yet to be finalized, the two companies aim to begin construction in early 2023, in order to enable the start of mass production of advanced lithium-ion battery cells by the end of 2025.
After a second quarter earnings call revealed that LG’s profits were down over 24% from the previous quarter, LG noted that it could see a bright future, driven by scaling up manufacturing of EV batteries. The company said at the time that it planned to triple revenue in five years and achieve a double-digit operating profit margin, setting an annual revenue target to $16.74 billion. One of the ways in which the company said it planned to scale manufacturing was through expansion of its joint venture partnerships with major partners developing both cylindrical and pouch-type batteries, supplying existing customers as well as EV startups. Earlier this year, LG Energy Solution announced a commitment to construct a $2.1 billion battery manufacturing plant in Lansing, Michigan with General Motors to mass produce 50 GWh of pouch-type EV batteries.
LGES and Honda hold the shared belief that expansion of local electric vehicle production that can shore up the battery supply chain would position them to target the rapidly-growing North American EV market.
“Our joint venture with Honda, which has significant brand reputation, is yet another milestone in our mid- to long-term strategy of promoting electrification in the fast-growing North American market,” said Youngsoo Kwon, CEO of LG Energy Solution. “Since our ultimate goal is to earn our valued customers’ trust and respect, we aspire to position ourselves as a leading battery innovator, working with Honda in achieving its core initiatives for electrification, as well as providing sustainable energy solutions to discerning end consumers.”
“Honda is working toward our target to realize carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities the company is involved in by 2050,” said Toshihiro Mibe, president, CEO and representative director of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. “Aligned with our longstanding commitment to build products close to the customer, Honda is committed to the local procurement of EV batteries which is a critical component of EVs. This initiative in the U.S. with LGES, the leading global battery manufacturer, will be part of such a Honda approach.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/30/breaking-first-solar-to-invest-up-to-1-2-billion-in-expanding-u-s-solar-manufacturing-by-4-4-gw/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,OHIO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 30, 2022",First Solar to invest up to $1.2 billion in expanding U.S. solar manufacturing by 4.4 GW,"First Solar, Inc. announced plans to invest up to $1.2 billion in scaling production of American-made solar modules, an investment that is forecast to expand the company’s ability to produce modules for the U.S. solar market to over 10 GWDC by 2025.
As part of its push to scale U.S. production of solar modules, the company intends to build its fourth, fully vertically integrated domestic factory, with an annual capacity of 3.5 GWDC, in the U.S. Southeast. The company said it expects to invest up to $1 billion in the new factory, which, contingent upon permitting and pending approval of various federal, state, regional, and local incentives, is expected to begin operations in 2025.
In 2021 First Solar announced that it was building its Ohio facility, where the company produces its thin film solar modules using a fully integrated process using cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductor. The company said that the Ohio plant is currently the largest vertically integrated complex of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. First Solar intends to $185 million to upgrade and expand its Ohio footprint by 0.9 GWDC.
The company said it will invest in expanding the capacity of its two operating facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township, Ohio, by 0.6 GWDC to 3.6 GWDC of annual Series 6 module capacity. And it will also expand its third Ohio factory, expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023, to 3.5 GWDC of annual Series 7 module capacity. The expansion will increase First Solar’s total investment in its Ohio manufacturing facilities to over $3 billion, with a cumulative annual production capacity of over 7 GWDC by 2025.
“In passing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration has entrusted our industry with the responsibility of enabling America’s clean energy future and we must meet the moment in a manner that is both timely and sustainable,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “This investment is an important step towards achieving self-sufficiency in solar technology, which, in turn, supports America’s energy security ambitions, its deployment of solar at scale, and its ability to lead with innovation.”
First Solar estimates that its new investment will add at least 850 manufacturing jobs, bringing its total number of direct jobs in the U.S. to over 3,000 people in four states by 2025. By 2025, First Solar is also expected to support an estimated 15,000 indirect and induced jobs.
On its last earnings calls, First Solar announced that it had a backlog of bookings, after announcing several large orders for its advanced thin film solar modules.  Silicon Ranch recently booked a 4 GW order, a National Grid order came in at 2 MW, and Intersect Power placed an order for 2.4 GW.
A long-time customer of First Solar’s, Intersect Power is expected to be one of the largest buyers and operators of First Solar technology by 2027.  “Intersect Power’s ongoing relationship with First Solar has been critical in rapidly scaling our business to meet our vision and reliably delivering our customers value and performance to support their decarbonization goals,” said Sheldon Kimber, chief executive officer, Intersect Power. “We look forward to bringing this large-scale portfolio to operation, and creating good-paying, American jobs in both construction and manufacturing with First Solar’s domestically-produced modules.”
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building its first new manufacturing facility in India, which is scheduled to begin operations in the second half of 2023. When expansion in the United States and India is complete, the company expects to have over 20 GWDC of annual global manufacturing capacity in 2025.
The company also continues innovate its process, optimizing the amount of semiconductor material used. First Solar also operates an advanced recycling program that enables materials to be re-used in new modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/30/aluminum-sulfur-battery-for-small-scale-storage-at-8-99-kwh/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 30, 2022",Aluminum-sulfur battery for small-scale storage at $8.99/kWh,"From pv magazine global
A research team led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has developed a new type of aluminum–chalcogen battery that is purportedly resistant to dendritic shorting.
“The battery is intended for small-scale energy storage stationary applications,” researcher Donald R. Sadoway told pv magazine. “Commercialization is underway at US-based startup Avanti Battery Company.”
Dendrites are tiny, needle-like projections that can grow inside a battery, and cause a number of undesirable effects, including, in a worst case scenario, complete battery failure and even fires.
The battery relies on two electrodes made of aluminum and sulfur and a molten salt electrolyte placed between them. The electrolyte was composed of sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), and aluminum chloride (AlCl3), and formulated with high levels of AlCl3.
“We demonstrate that these are the key to supporting ultrafast electrodeposition of aluminium (cell charging) while vitiating dendrite formation,” the scientists said, in reference to the three compounds.
They are extremely cheap and earth-abundant compared to lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite used in lithium-ion batteries.
“The chloro-aluminate salt that we chose essentially retired runaway dendrites, while also allowing for very rapid charging,” Sadoway explained. “We did experiments at very high charging rates, charging in less than a minute, and we never lost cells due to dendrite shorting.”
The researchers said the sulfur electrodes with a high loading of 12.0 mg cm2 can sustain a high capacity of 520 mAh g–1 more than 100 cycles at 5 C.
“We attribute full accessibility of electrode capacity to the advantageously low surface tension of the chloroaluminate melt,” they said.
The U.S. team described the technology in “Fast-charging aluminum–chalcogen batteries resistant to dendritic shorting,” which was recently published in nature.
“Our battery has a two-fold economic promise. First, given the high earth abundance of all components, aluminum, sulfur, NaCl, KCl and AlCl 3, the estimated cell-level cost of our Al–S battery is as low as $8.99 per kWh, which is 12% to 16% of that of today’s lithium-ion batteries,” the academic said. “We also show that the use of low-grade aluminum (for example, food-packaging foil) in the negative electrode does not result in appreciable deterioration in cell performance.”
The research team included members from Peking University, Yunnan University, the Wuhan University of Technology, the University of Louisville, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Waterloo.
