The battery charger is designed for implementation by EV original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of electric vehicles and is available for both off-board and on-board applications.
The 3.3 kW battery charger comes with a 500 W DC-DC converter to power the vehicles’ auxiliary loads and an EV charging station interface. The auxiliary load device can support vehicle accessories like air conditioners, controllers, lights, turn signals, navigation, and communications devices. It is available in 58.8 V, 65 V and 120 V DC models.
The product is scalable, allowing EV manufacturers to stack up to three chargers for power levels up to 10 kW. Delta-Q said the battery charger, cased in an IP67 rated enclosure, offers OEMs with a rugged option for electrifying off-road applications.
“No other 3.3 kW charger on the market also includes a DC/DC converter for auxiliary DC loads and an EVSE charging interface in such a compact size,” said Mourad Chergui, senior product manager, Delta-Q.
To extend battery life and improve charge times, the XV3300 charger is programmed with algorithms to deliver precise charges to batteries of various chemistries and voltages. It has protections against short circuits, over-voltage, and over-temperature for safe operation.
The charger is tested for automotive-grade shock and vibration. It is sealed in an aluminum die-cast enclosure, protecting the device from dust, liquids, and the effects of immersion up to one meter of water.
The device complies with SAE J1772 (levels 1 and 2) and IEC 61851 (modes 2 and 3) to charge from standard EVSE AC charging stations across North America and Europe.
Delta-Q is a member of the Zapi Group and headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. The company spans five continents, servicing industries such as electric golf cars, lift trucks, aerial work platforms, e-mobility, floor care machines, utility/recreational vehicles, and new markets, like construction and outdoor power equipment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/02/solar-testing-group-warns-of-degradation-risk-for-topcon/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 2, 2023",Solar testing group warns of degradation risk for TOPCon,"Each year, Fremont, California’s Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) releases its PV Module Index, tracking the latest trends in solar module quality, performance, reliability, and emergent technologies.
The latest annual report, PV Module Index 2022 opens with remarks about the rise of TOPCon solar modules, a technology increasingly being adopted by major panel suppliers.
TOPCon was first demonstrated at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in 2013 and is now gaining market traction and acceptance.
The technology is comprised of n-type PV cells with passivating contacts. The modules have strong surface passivation and effective carrier transport, both of which contribute to a strong open-circuit voltage and high efficiency. The shift to TOPCon comes as p-type passivated emitter and rear-contact cell (PERC) modules begin to reach their theoretical efficiency limits.
RETC said this boost in efficiency has made TOPCon “the buzziest word in solar.”
The report noted that while Longi Solar is “betting big” on p-type TOPCon, many other leading module companies, like Jinko Solar, Jollywood Solar Technology, JA Solar and Trina Solar are making significant investments in modules with n-type TOPCon cell designs. 
“Via higher open-circuit voltage values, you can achieve higher efficiencies and power ratings. In and of itself, that is likely going to move manufacturers to n-type TOPCon cell designs, as soon as they can get there,” said Kenneth Sauer, principal engineer, VDE Americas.
RETC said due to manufacturing complexities, high-efficiency n-type cells using heterojunction technology (HJT) and interdigitated back contact (IBC) cells are relatively expensive to produce and remain a niche part of the market. By comparison, n-type TOPCon cell production is very similar to the PERC manufacturing process, making for an easier transition from existing manufacturing lines.
“Though today’s n-type TOPCon modules cost slightly more to produce on a per-watt basis than p-type mono PERC modules, the efficiency gains result in a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in large-scale field deployments. Best of all, leading experts expect n-type TOPCon to benefit from an accelerated learning curve,” said the report.
However, as with any emergent technology, the report notes that moving towards TOPCon may carry some risk. While n-type TOPCon PV cells have proven resilient to light-induced degradation and light and elevated temperature-induced degradation, some evidence exists of susceptibility to ultraviolet induced degradation (UVID), which could chip away at module longevity.
Researchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have documented front- and back-side power loss from these technologies. The data does not point to a single degradation mechanism but suggest that different cell designs degrade via different pathways, said the report.
“We’re not trying to sound an alarm for no reason,” said Cherif Kedir, chief executive officer, RETC. “We just want to test the potential for UV degradation to educate ourselves and the industry. If there’s no problem, we can all move forward with our lives.”
Kedir recommends module makers conduct accelerated UVID testing as part of a technical due diligence survey. If cell passivation layers are improperly tuned, they can break down under this exposure. He recommends evaluating each new cell design on a case-by-case basis.
“If there is a problem, we will publish a report so that the industry can get out in front of the issue,” he said.

Desert solar plants may increase humidity while reducing wind speed and evaporation, according to “Projected PV plants in China’s Gobi Deserts would result in lower evaporation and wind,” which was recently published by scientists from the National Climate Centre of China Meteorological Administration (CMA) in Solar Energy. The researchers claim that the local climate impacts of the solar parks could be equivalent if not stronger than those caused by climate change.
The researchers quantitatively compared the climate effects of solar parks in the Gobi Deserts in China under various emission scenarios. This is the first such comparison between PV-induced climate effects and projected climate variability.
The team combined the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projection models for the simulations. WRF is a numerical weather prediction system suitable for various applications, such as weather forecasting and atmospheric research, while the CMIP6 is used for climate projections. The CMIP6 is commonly used to understand past, present and future climate changes arising from natural, unforced variability.
“In situ meteorological observations from two PV power plants, located in Xinjiang and Qinghai, China, were also included to validate this model,” the academics stated. “In this parameterization, each utility-scale PV plant is treated as a shortwave radiation sink and a sensible heat flux source, and the latent heat flux directly relates to evaporation through the latent heat of vaporization.”
To represent typical summer/winter climatology, the team analyzed 20 different five-year July and January periods from 2008 to 2062.
“These favorable changes in humidity, evaporation and wind speed, as predicted in this study, would contribute to improving ecological conditions, which are in line with the previous reports about the vigorously growth of vegetation in PV plants established in dry climates,” they said.
The study suggests that the spatial coverage of solar plants has a greater impact on climate than their intensity.
“Therefore, future work is needed to address this issue by conducting the long-term simulations under different scenarios, and the dependence of the PV-induced effects on climate and soil conditions should be also considered,” the scientists concluded.

The credit facility will also support the development of 188 MWh of battery storage facilities across the same states, with the multi-year financing to support projects brought online between 2024 and 2026.
“We are excited to be partnering with Nomura to deploy clean, reliable energy at a time when there is a critical need for capacity,” said Fred Robinson, chief executive officer of BayWa r.e. solar projects.
The investment includes a revolving credit facility and letter of credit to provide financing for the expansion of projects across a number of jurisdictions. Nomura was lead arranger of the credit facility, while Norton Rose Fulbright represented the lender group. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom was counsel to BayWa.
“As a leading clean energy financier and customer-focused institution, we’re pleased to support BayWa r.e., one of the leading developers and operators in the renewable energy space,” said Alain Halimi, executive director, Nomura. “We always focus on working with our clients to execute customized solutions that best fit their needs and we are excited to collaborate with BayWa r.e. for this unique and strategic financing”.
As additional projects are added to the portfolio, the credit facility is expected to be upsized in the coming months.
Based in Irvine, Calif., BayWa r.e. Solar Projects is a utility-scale solar developer in North America operated by BayWa AG. The U.S. company operates a pipeline of solar and storage projects totaling over 9 GW.
According to Mercom Capital Group, total corporate funding of $31.7 billion in 2022 was a 63% increase over 2021 at $19.5 billion, as global companies see the value in investing in renewable energy projects.
At the BloombergNEF Summit on April 25 in New York, clean technology VC investors from Cycle Capital and Energy Impact Partners said following the April collapse and receivership of Silicon Valley Bank, equity transactions involving renewable energy could be few and far between for the remainder of 2023, with subdued deal activity.
Debt financing should be readily available to companies with a proven track record and portfolio, said Lindsay Luger, partner of Energy Impact Partners, while numerous alternative asset lenders have also provided debt solutions in recent years, including EIP, a New York-based investment firm that has 60 strategic underwriters comprised of global utility firms.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/02/oregon-utilitys-irp-calls-for-400-mw-energy-storage-development/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,OREGON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 2, 2023",Oregon utility’s IRP calls for 400 MW energy storage development,"Portland General Electric announced the procurement of 400 MW(ac) of new standalone energy storage projects from NextEra Energy Resources and Eolian LP, a private developer.
The two projects use 4-hour duration lithium-ion battery modules. Collectively, the 400 MW nameplate capacity projects can provide enough clean power for 260,000 homes at four-hour intervals during peak power usage times such as weeknights from 5 pm to 9 pm.
The new storage projects will be located at utility substation end points, close to electrical demand, and will store enough electricity to power all PGE customer homes in the Portland city area for an entire evening on battery-delivered energy alone.
The storage projects are designed to address grid constraints, delivering flexibility to PGE’s grid operators to meet changing conditions and manage costs. Stored energy can be reliably deployed within seconds to customers during extreme weather events or times of high demand, while reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and costly demand-side power, the utility said.
The energy storage projects include:
The storage facilities allow PGE to optimize renewable energy projects across its Pacific Northwest portfolio, as the four-hour batteries provide less expensive power when intermittent resources such as wind farms and solar farms are inactive.
“Anticipating the need for resilient, flexible and carbon-free grid-balancing resources to serve the dynamic growth of the Portland metro area led us to focus on the development of battery energy storage sites at key substations directly serving load in the region,” said Eric Stoutenburg, director of energy storage at Eolian.
“The Troutdale battery storage project, in addition to the Wheatridge Renewable Energy facilities, the first utility-scale energy facilities in North America to co-locate” 350 MW of wind and solar projects with battery storage resources (30 MW), “really demonstrate the tremendous results that great collaboration can achieve,” said Rebecca Kujawa, president and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy Resources.
Sited locally, the new projects will bring family wage jobs and tax revenue to Oregon. Employment opportunities in the local economy supported by these projects include roles in development, engineering, construction and installation, logistics, operations and maintenance.
The energy storage projects were procured from PGE’s 2021 Request for Proposal and represent one example of the kind of non-emitting energy resources PGE is utilizing to advance decarbonization and bolster resource adequacy – a strategy outlined in the utility’s recent Clean Energy Plan & Integrated Resource Plan.
Recently PGE completed the Faraday Repower & Resiliency Project, a multi-year modernization effort to improve the efficiency, reliability and operational safety of a historic hydropower plant.
On April 26, Pachwáywit Fields, Oregon’s largest solar farm at 162 MW, entered commercial operations, supported by commercial customers and municipalities enrolled in PGE’s Green Future Impact program. PGE purchases the output from Pachwáywit Fields, which is owned and operated by Avangrid through a long-term PPA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/02/california-bill-to-mandate-bidirectional-chargers-for-all-evs-sold-after-2026/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 2, 2023",California bill to mandate bidirectional chargers for all EVs sold after 2026,"California is evaluating a mandate requiring all electric vehicles (EVs) to have “vehicle-to-everything” (V2E) capabilities by January 1, 2027. The state defines V2E as a system where an EV’s battery’s stored energy can be used for various purposes, including powering a home (vehicle-to-home), a building (vehicle-to-building), a microgrid, another vehicle, or providing electricity to the electrical grid (vehicle-to-grid).
All V2E vehicles and infrastructure will be required to be interoperable.
The bill, SB-233, includes light vehicles and school buses. On April 25, 2023, it passed the legislature’s Transportation committee 11 to 3, and is now advancing to the Appropriations committee.
The bill notes that California already has laws on the books that project deployed EVs will exceed eight million cars by 2030. At 75 kWh per vehicle, it’d total 0.6 TWh of cumulative energy storage. As of 2021, more than 14 million cars were registered in the state. If all 14.2 million cars had a 75 kWh battery, the combined energy storage would amount to just over a terawatt-hour.
The bill would dictate that starting in 2024, California will hold quarterly interoperability testing events, allowing companies to share products and information while testing the compatibility of electric vehicles, electric vehicle supply equipment, and emerging V2E technology. These events will contribute to the development of state standards.
Additionally, before 2027, the state plans will incentivize buyers to acquire bidirectional equipment, in order to smooth the transition.
As part of the research and development process, California will evaluate individual use cases to identify vehicle and charger types that may not benefit from this technology and could be exempted. One potential exception cited is high-speed public DC chargers.
Analysts estimate that between 80% (Tesla) and 90% (Lazards) of future battery cells will be used in vehicles, leaving 10% to 20% of remaining cells for power grid energy storage. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence projects that approximately 8.5 GWh/year of lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing capacity will be available by 2030.
If eight million cars were connected to California’s power grid, 600 GWhs of capacity would be added. To counterbalance the state’s peak electricity demand in August and September, California would need to deploy an additional 10 to 20 GW of resource adequacy, operating for four to five hours, amounting to 40 to 80 GWh.
Level II electric car chargers have output of 3 to 19.2 kW (the Ford Lightning). If cars averaged 10 kW, it’d take one to two million EVs to generate 10 to 20 GW of electricity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/02/colorado-passes-bill-to-speed-up-solar-permitting-inspection/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOFTWARE,COLORADO",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 2, 2023","Colorado passes bill to speed up solar permitting, inspection","The Colorado Legislature has passed HB-1234, which establishes the Streamlined Solar Permitting and Inspection Grant Program and provides nearly $1 million to help local governments with start-up costs associated with adopting permitting and inspection software. The bipartisan bill was sponsored by Dylan Roberts and Perry Will in the Senate, and Matt Soper and Kyle Brown in the House.
“Colorado’s mountain communities are eager to develop solar technology, but all too often, projects are held up in the labor-intensive permitting process, and sometimes even canceled. These grants will help reduce time, costs, and burden for permitting, and keep us in line with our greenhouse gas reduction goals,” according to bill sponsor Dylan Roberts. “House Bill 1234 is a win for both our economy and our environment.”
Last year the Department of Energy (DOE) released a solar guidebook that encourages local governments to adopt SolarAPP+ (Solar Automated Permit Process), a software platform, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and UL Solutions, that can immediately approve residential permits. According to NREL, projects submitted through the app are 37% less likely to fail final inspections than projects that don’t use the tool. At present, 32 communities across the U.S. are using SolarAPP+, resulting in over 15,000 residential solar permits issued, accounting for 100,000 kW of electricity and 15,000 estimated staff hours saved on reviewing permits.
“We commend the Colorado legislature for advancing expedited permitting on residential solar projects while prioritizing compliance with safety and code standards,” said Ken Boyce, senior director of principal engineering at UL Solutions. “We recognize the value SolarAPP+ brings to governments, the public and the solar industry, and how it will serve as an important enabler of safer and cleaner energy.”
SolarApp+ is already in use in the city of Denver. With HB-1234 in place, communities in Colorado will get financial help with start-up costs of using SolarApp+. Colorado enjoys more than 300 days of sunshine a year, offering vast solar potential. Currently the state has about 2 GW of solar resources installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and is ranked 13th in the nation for solar. Streamlining the solar permitting and inspection process can help more Coloradans speed up the process of harnessing that sunshine.
“This will empower local officials to automate permitting and inspections, which will reduce staff time and cut costs,” said Mike Kruger, CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association (COSSA). “In turn, this will give homeowners immediate results for their permit applications, and solar and storage companies can hire more staff to support an increase in projects approved.”
