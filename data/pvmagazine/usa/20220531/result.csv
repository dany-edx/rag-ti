Cable management systems might never drum up the same excitement as new modules or trackers, but for the folks working at CAB Solar, the 2021 pv magazine Award winner in the BOS category, the name of the game is proficiency, not publicity. 
When it comes to cost reduction, attention is understandably focused on the most visible and prominent aspects of an installation: large, high-powered modules with ever-increasing efficiencies, and the yield-increasing single-axis trackers that house those generating behemoths.
CAB is headquartered in Pennsylvania, split among two divisions. CAB solar operates out of a 105,000 square-foot facility in Johnstown, a short drive east from Pittsburgh, while non-solar CAB products are manufactured in a 134,000 square-foot facility in nearby Evansburg. 
CAB Solar’s patented cabling system consists of PVC-coated steel cable hangers — to ensure that no potentially sharp edges come into contact with the cables — strung along a copper-clad messenger wire that acts as the electrical grounding conductor. In practice, the solution offers significant cost reductions in labor, materials and engineering, especially when compared to popular alternatives of trenching the cables or using cable trays.
“Using the messenger wires as the ground allows you to run one messenger wire, instead of having to run a messenger wire and then a separate ground,” explained Tim Wedding, solar program manager at CAB. “When there’s only one connection, it simplifies the installation, shortens the installation time, and decreases the amount of product being used. It’s a large cost saving in both product and labor.”
While the company has existed for almost 100 years, CAB didn’t get into the business of solar hangers until 2014. Founded in 1927, the company has had a hand in manufacturing a litany of products, from disposable food service kits, to pillowcases, to making mops and laundry bags for the US government. According to President and CEO, Tara Bosserman, CAB originally got into cable management in the 1970s, manufacturing hooks and hangers for use in the mining industry.
The company found success in the manufacture of this application-specific hardware, so much so that, in 2014, an unnamed solar company contacted CAB, asking if their products would work in a solar application. “When this opportunity came along with solar, we took what we already knew, which was hooks and hangers, and we just moved it into the solar industry,” said Bosserman. “We were already servicing above-ground cabling for electrical, and we had some of our products used in shipbuilding. And so we, you know, transitioned into the solar industry.”
As simple as Bosserman makes the process sound, the reality of the company’s transition was much more intensive, as Wedding was quick to outline. “It was a pretty big overhaul,” he said. “All of our designs for solar, probably 99.9% of them are new products that we’ve developed over time, working with customers identifying what they needed, working within national electrical code to make sure that they were complying, and then trying to develop our products that we could make easily that would fit within the window of the CAB system. The L brackets that hold the messenger wire in place were a new product for us, and the messenger wire itself wasn’t something that we had ever dealt with before… It took a considerable amount of time for us to identify what parts would work and what we needed to do to adjust the designs.”
While it’s not uncommon for one manufacturer to have a hand in a series of different industries, CAB has done it seemingly effortlessly and consistently throughout its 95-year history. This is because CAB’s focus has never solely been on the industries it operates in or the most profitable product to manufacture at the time, but to provide employment opportunities to individuals who would otherwise be limited in their options.
“We’ve always looked at how we can provide employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities,” explained Bosserman. “And we found that, as a nonprofit in the late 60s and early 70s, trying to rely on government funding and charitable contributions that many nonprofits rely on, that we wanted to take a different route. We really wanted to look at how we could sustain our organization, and that was through providing products to different sectors.”
Through a partnership with The Cambria County Association for the Blind and Handicapped, CAB has made it the company’s mission to provide quality jobs to people with blindness, as well as individuals living with other disabilities. Through employment and revenue generated from CAB’s cabling system and other products, the company is able to support more than 500 persons with disabilities.
“We’re a small community,” said Bosserman. “Early on, there was a need for a place for individuals with disabilities to come not only for employment opportunities, but for rehabilitation and vocational training, and socialization. We have a very dynamic social recreational program as well here. I think that as far as what has sustained us, when you’re working with our individuals, and you’re seeing them and you’re talking to them, as staff, we are driven to our mission of having them here and providing employment opportunities for them.”
Of the 343 workers at CAB Solar’s Johnstown facility, around 230 are individuals with disabilities. Bosserman went on to outline that this drive to provide the best employment opportunity possible for individuals with disabilities has gone so far as to dictate the company’s manufacturing process and what products it pursues. “When we find a product, we look at how it can blend in with all of our employees, and the diversity that they have with their disabilities,” she said. “I think that has really helped us to continue to push forward and push our organization to the next level.”

Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform has reported that a Russian missile strike has hit a ground-mounted solar plant in Merefa, close to the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.
The missile strike hit the solar plant on the night of May 28. Ukrinform quoted local media outlet Suspilnie Kharkiv as saying that the project had been built on a former landfill site under Ukraine’s feed-in tariff scheme. It had been operational for about a year and a half.
According to the manager of the project, Volodymyr Ronchakovsky, the missiles produced holes at the site measuring 6 meters deep and 11 meters in diameter. The missiles were reportedly launched from Belgorod, western Russia.
In mid-March, the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy (UARE) said that 37% of the nation’s ground-mounted solar project capacity had been built in areas where armed conflict was taking place, with another 34% in adjacent areas. The UARE reported “registered cases of destruction” of solar panels and claimed that Russian forces “steal all the equipment from the stations – everything that can be stolen and taken away.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/31/achieving-a-zero-carbon-grid-opportunities-in-virtual-power-plants/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 31, 2022",Achieving a zero-carbon grid: opportunities in virtual power plants,"The consumer market for distributed energy resources – DERs – is on the verge of booming. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates nearly 5% of US owner-occupied homes now have rooftop solar. Energy storage is having its moment, with more storage deployed in 2021 than the prior five years combined. What’s more, solar generation and energy storage are increasingly friendly, with a third of new behind-the-meter solar systems installed by 2025 expected to incorporate energy storage. Overall, $110 billion is expected to be invested in DERs by 2025.
DERs can provide energy at a lower price than what the grid typically offers.  They do so more cleanly while offering consumers greater resilience during adverse grid events. And despite commercial lenders’ unwillingness to adequately recognize it, DERs are also more widely available and cost-effective than ever. As researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have shown, solar adopters can come from a range of incomes, and financing options are gradually expanding to lower income groups, as well as to those with below-median home values and credit scores.
Much more DER deployment will be needed at scale to meet the Administration’s goal of achieving 100% clean electricity by 2035, and ensuring an equitable transition under its Environmental Justice 40 initiative will require intentional investment. Virtual power plants can catalyze DER deployment at scale and help make affordable, resilient, and clean energy accessible to all Americans.
A VPP is generally considered a connected aggregation of DER technologies – not only solar and battery storage, but increasingly grid-interactive efficient appliances and buildings, electric vehicle charging, and thermal energy storage. Aggregators, utilities, or grid operators, under terms agreed upon with participants, can remotely and automatically adjust DERs in this aggregation to provide clean energy, reliability, and grid services while maintaining customer comfort and productivity. Through a combination of software and hardware, VPPs not only open the grid to a whole new utility-scale, behind-the-meter supply, but also coordinate disparate DERs into holistic, demand-flexible resources. Operators gain the flexibility to better reduce peak demand and, as a result, defer investment in additional capacity and infrastructure to serve a peak load that is expected to increase as we electrify the nation’s economy. VPP participants can receive compensation for services rendered and all the benefits that come with them. Everyone enjoys greater affordability and performance.
Over the coming weeks, I’ll be offering my thoughts on the potential of VPPs in a series of VPPieces. I’ll explain how the emergence of VPPs – enabled by shifting technology and evolving energy policy – can create a more equitable, resilient, and participatory energy system while catalyzing good-paying jobs across a number of clean energy sectors.
I hope you return as I make the case for the wider integration of VPPs across our country’s electricity markets and utility service areas. I’ll share the ways I see VPPs benefitting all Americans; offer perspectives as to the role LPO and the Federal government can play, including through new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorities that can support state efforts to promote aggregation; and survey the most promising VPP models and technologies budding in the private sector.
VPPs offer an exciting opportunity to create clean power solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts. The power plants may be virtual, but VPP technology’s potential to democratize the coming clean energy economy will be very real.

By 2035, the US Navy and Marine Corps will aim for 100% zero-emission vehicles, including 100% zero-emission light-duty vehicles by 2027.
The Department committed to ensure continuity of operations of critical missions by deploying cyber-secure microgrids or comparable resilience technologies that combine carbon-free generation and long-duration battery storage.
A 90-day planning process will establish how to meet the targets.
While the strategy document does not address the expected contribution of solar, it highlights an existing solar plant and a planned large-scale battery energy storage system at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California, and existing mobile and deployable solar-powered electric vehicle charging stations at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany in Georgia. The document also highlights geothermal and landfill gas generation.
Chain of command
Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said that President Biden has prioritized climate change as an essential element of national security. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has championed that prioritization, he said, while partners and allies around the globe are “similarly focused and committed.”
“For the Department of Navy, this is existential,” Del Toro said. “If we do not act, as sea levels rise, bases like Norfolk Naval Base and Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island will be severely tested in their ability to support their missions. We will see more extreme heat events, with temperatures at-or-above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, requiring strenuous activity – including mission-essential training – be curtailed because it is not safe.” Strain on the grid “as people compete for energy to cool off,” he said, will make the Navy’s “mission and our people vulnerable to an outage.”
“Doing our part to reduce the destabilizing threat of climate change and to ensure our ability to operate in an increasingly unstable future is an integral part of our mission and will make us a more capable, agile, and lethal fighting force,” the document says.
The US Army has previously committed to using 100% clean electricity by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/31/the-making-of-a-clean-energy-prosumer-part-three/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA",,"MAY 31, 2022",The making of a clean energy prosumer: Part three,"This article series describes my journey from a standard consumer to a prosumer and from owning a gasoline-powered vehicle to owning an electric vehicle (EV).
I was led to making these two decisions to lower my ever-rising electric and gasoline bills, to enhance the resilience of my house to power outages, and to promote clean air.
The report includes economic analysis behind the decisions, explains what it took to implement them, and provides the results during the time that has elapsed since I became a prosumer and EV driver.
The economics of being a prosumer
The picture below shows the 25 solar panels I have installed on my roof. They have a total capacity of 8 kW.
The next picture shows the SolarEdge inverter which converts the DC power coming from the panels into AC power that ultimately feeds into the house, and if there is a surplus, feeds into the grid.
Here is a picture of the battery which is attached to an exterior wall which faces the patio.
Every morning, as the sun rises and strikes the panels, they generate DC power and feed that into the battery. Once the battery is fully charged, the panels feed power to the house, with the DC power going through the inverter. If the house needs are less than the power being generated from the panels, as begins to happen in the early afternoon hours in most months, the excess power is exported to the grid. As the sun begins to decline, when the power generated from the panels falls short of the needs of the house, the battery begins to supply power to the house. It keeps doing that until it is down to 30% of charge. Then it goes into standby mode, and will provide power to five essential circuits in the house in the event of a power outage.
This sequence of events is shown below.
When an outage occurs, the battery begins powering the house. One such instance happened at 9:05 pm on June 20. The sun had gone down. The panels were not producing power. The battery had 60% power stored in it. It began to discharge power to the house.
My solar power production and household energy consumption data for 2021 are illustrated below on left; the comparative data for 2019-2010 is on the right. In 2021, the panels generated 9,670 kWhs while the house consumed 10,230 kWhs. Without the solar panels, the house would have paid for 9,670 kWhs. With solar panels, I only paid for the 560 kWhs of net purchase from the grid.
In the prior year, I experienced a technical glitch in the solar panels. Half of them stopped working very late in May and were not operating for much of June. Since June is the most productive month from a solar production perspective, the annual generation was much lower than expected and net usage, consequently, was much higher.
The solar insolation falling on the roof, the size and orientation of the panels, the size of the storage system and a number of other factors such as how well the system is maintained and operated.
In June, daily production from the panels can reach 50 kWh as shown in the picture below from June 8, 2021.
I have often been asked how I feel about my decision to become a prosumer. I believe it has been one of the most fulfilling decisions in my life. Not only am I saving money and having higher reliability, I am also contributing to California’s clean energy goals.
The economics of driving an EV
I purchased the Tesla Model 3 in June. As I write these words, the car has been driven 15,000 miles. Over its lifetime, it has consumed an average of 266 watt-hours per mile. Total lifetime consumption has been 3,990 kWh. Electric rates vary with the charging time, being lowest during the off-peak hours.
When I charge at home, on the EV2-A rate, the off-peak rate (applicable between midnight and 3 pm) was initially 18 cents/kWh. Now it is 21 cents/kWh. Rates at the Tesla Supercharger (off peak runs from 7 pm to 10 am) are a bit higher. I have mostly charged during the off-peak hours, whether at home or at the Supercharger. Assuming an average rate of 21 cents/kWh, I have paid $837.9 for driving 15,000 miles.
My previous car, a 2005 Porsche Boxster, was giving me an average of 20 miles per gallon. To drive 15,000 miles, it would have consumed 750 gallons. Using an average price of $4.50 per gallon, that yields a total cost of $3,375, or four times the amount I had to pay to drive the same number of miles in the Model 3.
There is no question that the Model 3 is less expensive to drive than the Porsche Boxster. It’s also far less expensive to maintain. Surprisingly, it also handles the road better and it clearly has superior acceleration. It provides an amazing amount of information on the screen. The sound system is very good. The only thing that it lacks is a good interior finish and, of course, the Porsche brand.
On the last point, it’s worth stating that the Boxster was easy to spot in any parking lot, whether at the airport, or BART or any of the Big Box stores. That’s not true with the Model 3. There are several in just about any parking lot and most of them have the same grey color as mine. More than once, I have tried to open someone’s else’s car.
This concludes the three-part series on the making of a prosumer.
