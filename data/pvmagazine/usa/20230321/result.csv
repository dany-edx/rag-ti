https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/21/global-study-highlights-potential-of-floating-solar/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MARCH 21, 2023",Global study highlights potential of floating solar,"From pv magazine global
Researchers from China, Thailand, Sweden, and the United States have used a PV system performance model from Sandia National Laboratories to calculate the potential for floating solar (FPV) generation across the world, with specific results for the 20 countries with the highest potential.
The study only considers global reservoirs larger than 0.01 km2, with 30% of their area covered but not exceeding 30 km2. The academics used three global databases to filter the eligible reservoirs, Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD), the Georeferenced Global Dam and Reservoir (GeoDAR), and OpenStreetMap (OSM). There are a total of 114,555 reservoirs worldwide meeting the criteria with a total area of 554,111 km2. Of those, 2,561 reservoirs already have hydraulic power generation and grid infrastructure in place.
“Unlike previous studies that use empirical formulas to estimate the FPV electricity generation potential, we use a technically rigorous PV system performance (PV_LIB, Sandia National Laboratories) that considers climate conditions and the specifications of the particular PV and inverter used,” the scientists said.
The solar panel is Panasonic’s VBHN235SA06B, with an output of 235 W and 18.6% efficiency. The 240 V inverter is also from the Japanese manufacturer. The team used data for solar radiation, temperature, and wind speed spanning from 2001 to 2020, from the Synoptic 1 degree (SYN1deg) and ECMWF Reanalysis version 5 – Land (ERA5-Land) databases.
The results showed that the mean annual electricity generation potential from FPV built on global reservoirs is 9,434 TWh, with a standard deviation of 29 TWh. Covering 30% of reservoirs with floating solar could also reduce annual water evaporation by 106 km3. If the reservoir area coverage is reduced to 20% or 10%, the FPV annual generation would be 7,113 TWh or 4,356 TWh, respectively.
“Globally, the highest regional potential tends to be concentrated in parts of the United States, eastern Brazil, Portugal, Spain, northern South Africa, Zimbabwe, India, and eastern China,” the scientists said.
The results also show that 40 countries have higher FPV potential than current annual electricity demand, with Brazil’s enormous 538 TWh per year of electricity demand being fully met by potential FPV generation of 865 TWh per year. Zimbabwe, Laos, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Myanmar, and Sudan have considerably higher FPV electricity potential than current demand, according to the study.
The results for the top 20 countries for floating solar potential are as follows:
“Achieving this vision will require addressing lingering problems related to policy, planning, financing, regulation, technological support, and construction/maintenance,” said the scientists.
They shared their findings in “Energy production and water savings from floating solar photovoltaics on global reservoirs,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) shared that solar, wind, and battery energy storage technologies are now 82% of new capacity additions actively planned to come online. 
Utility-scale solar is still quite young, as substantial capacity additions did not come online until 2010. Now, as of January 2023, 73.5 GW of utility-scale solar is online, about 6% of U.S. generating capacity. Just over half of planned U.S. generation to be added to the grid is solar. If all planned projects come online as expected this year, 2023 will mark the most capacity added to the grid for solar yet.  
By 2030, the Department of Energy expects 350 GW to 750 GW of solar and wind capacity to be added. This progress is impossible without the hard work of those that develop, construct, and maintain projects like the ones listed below. 
Texas 240 MW for Facebook 
Avangrid announced the signing of a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Meta (Facebook) for a 240 MW solar facility in Falls County, Texas. This project was Avangrid’s first to be located in the booming market of Texas, though it currently operates more than 1.2 GW of onshore wind in the state. 
The project is expected to reach commercial operations in early 2025, delivering over $40 million in property taxes over its first 25 years. Construction of the project is expected to create over 200 local jobs. 
With more than 8.6 GW of installed renewable capacity, including 1.1 GW of solar projects operating and under construction, Avangrid is the third largest renewable energy operator in the U.S. It has a pipeline of over 25 GW of solar, wind, and battery energy storage under development. 
California 117 MW plus batteries 
EDF Renewables North America announced a 20-year PPA with the Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA) for energy and renewable attributes tied to the 117 MWac Sapphire Solar project. The project includes a 59 MWac, 4-hour battery energy storage system. 
Sapphire Solar will deliver power to SCPPA’s participating members of Anaheim, Pasadena, and Vernon by the end of 2026. Construction is expected to bring 250 temporary construction jobs and generate over $253 million in new tax revenues over the operational life of the project. 
The project is expected to generate 375,800 MWh of clean energy per year, enough to meet the consumption of over 58,000 average California homes. This is equal to mitigating over 266,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually, representing annual emissions from over 57,000 cars. 
EDF Renewables has over 35 years of experience and 16 GW of solar, wind, and storage projects developed. 
Arkansas 20 MW microgrid for rice mill 
CS Energy and KORE Power have teamed up to deliver a 20 MW solar, 20 MW/ 41 MWh battery energy storage system for Producers Rice Mill, which operates four rice mills, 12 storage facilities, and 2,000 farmer members across 350,000 acres of rice. 
The microgrid is the largest commercial and industrial project in Arkansas, and among the largest microgrids in the United States. The solar and energy storage system will allow the mill to continue operations uninterrupted during periods of electrical curtailment by the local utility. About 67% of the mill’s electricity needs will be met by the solar microgrid. 
Rapid response from KORE Power’s microgrid controller system is designed to mitigate power quality issues and intermittent stoppages at the plant. The installation will make use of KORE’s Mark 1 lithium-ion batteries and U.S.-manufactured EPC inverters. 
“Designing and constructing a solar + energy storage system that ensures more reliable power helped us solve our customer’s challenges and ensures Producers can cleanly and reliably process their members’ harvest,” said Jesse Lieberman, director of operations at CS Energy. “That’s good news for the farmers here in the United States, and it’s good news for consumers across the world.” 
Tennessee 3 MW REAP loan
Silicon Ranch Corporation, a leading renewable energy provider, activated a new 3.25 MW solar facility in Hardeman County, Tennessee, providing power for Bolivar Energy Authority (BEA). The facility will provide enough electricity to power more than 500 homes and is expected to help keep rates lower for BEA’s 11,000 customers. 
The project was approved by utility Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). TVA is enabling us and LPCs across the Valley to do just that through its generation flexibility program, by providing our community with the opportunity to partner with dependable, renewable energy providers like Silicon Ranch to procure local energy solutions,” said Tony Kirk, president, BEA. 
The Bolivar Solar Farm was supported by the USDA through its Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) initiative, which provides guaranteed loan financing and grant funding to support agricultural producers and rural small businesses with renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements. Available to agricultural producers with at least 50% of their gross income coming from agricultural operations, and small businesses in eligible rural areas with populations less than 50,000, the program funds various renewable energy technologies, including solar.  
The REAP program offers loan guarantees on loans up to 75 % of total eligible project costs, grants for up to 40% of total eligible project costs, and combined grant and loan guarantee funding up to 75% of total eligible project costs. REAP loans approved in Fiscal Year 2023 will receive an 80% loan guarantee. Grants are capped at $1 million for renewable energy and $500,000 for energy efficiency.

VP3 aims to move the industry and transform policy toward increased support for scaling energy assets such as electric vehicles (EVs), smart thermostats, appliances, batteries, solar arrays, and others to support the grid.
“Virtual power plants can provide essential grid services by reducing peak power demand and improving resilience in a world of increasingly extreme climate events,” said Mark Dyson, managing director of RMI’s Carbon-Free Electricity Program. “VP3 is excited to partner with CPower and other industry leaders to grow the market for VPPs and ensure the energy transition doesn’t miss a beat.”
CPower, based in Baltimore, Maryland, is owned by LS Power, a development, investment, and operating company focused on the power and energy infrastructure sector.  CPower’s EnerWise Site Optimization solution is a virtual energy manager designed to address the challenges around optimization of distributed energy resources (DER).
The company has 6.3 GW of DER capacity at more than 17,000 sites across the U.S and was recently recognized by Wood Mackenzie as the national leader for flexible capacity in its recent Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Market report. By joining VP3, CPower expects to offer perspective on how to expand VPP access for larger C&I energy users, as well as DER owners and operators.
The VP3 initiative follows in the path of successful institutional spinoffs in the electric sector space previously incubated by RMI including the Clean Energy Buyers Association and the Energy Web Foundation.
Initial funding of the VP3 effort was made possible by General Motors and Google Nest. Founding members include Ford, General Motors, Google Nest, OhmConnect, Olivine, SPAN, SunPower, Sunrun, SwitchDin, and Virtual Peaker.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/21/transferability-or-selling-tax-credits-top-of-mind-at-seia-finance/,"EMPLOYMENT,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 21, 2023","Transferability, or selling tax credits, top of mind at SEIA Finance","The U.S. solar market continues to play the waiting game for guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the set of rules and regulations that surround the $369 billion in incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) forecasts 200 GW of new solar resources to be deployed over the next five years thanks to IRA incentives fueling the energy transition.
One provision awaiting clarity to proceed is transferability, or the sale of tax credits.  This week at the SEIA Finance, Tax and Buyers Seminar in New York, guidance surrounding transferability was the most anticipated topic of discussion for the near capacity conference audience.
“Everyone keeps telling me this month we’ll see clarity, but this is going on several months now,” said Taylor Mayeux, a director at Stonehenge Capital, a tax equity investor.
Ben Norris, Senior Director of Regulatory Affairs & Counsel at SEIA, said while the U.S. solar association eagerly awaits further guidance from the IRS about transferability, among a number of “wishlist” items from the IRA, for now the agency is working at light speed to disseminate and respond to 4,000 comments from public constituents on the many tax credits and other incentives packed into the sweeping 755-pages of legislation just six months since the legislation was signed by President Biden.
Seth Hanlon, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax and Climate Policy, U.S. Department of the Treasury, said the government entity is working with a myriad of agencies to codify and provide guidance on the historic climate legislation, which modifies 20 tax incentives from manufacturing to distributed energy generation.
“This is an all-hands-on-deck government-wide piece of legislation,” Hanlon told the SEIA finance audience, while the treasury department is working in unison with the IRS, Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Labor, Environmental Protection Agency and numerous other federal agencies to provide guidance in the coming months, though he declined to comment on specific timeframes to see guidance on various items such as transferability.
For now, the treasury official said that by May 31 he was hoping to see more guidance on Section 48C of the IRA, as well as 48D and 48E, which provide $10 billion of tax credits for advanced energy projects, and a new technology neutral credit for energy storage technologies placed into service after December 31, 2024. Under 48E, taxpayers will be able to claim a 30% bonus credit based on emission measurements, which requires zero or net-negative carbon emissions for project to enter operations also after December 31, 2024.
Working with the DOE, the Treasury has put out lots of “plain language” information circulars and conducted consumer-facing webinars for various industry stakeholders seeking to learn more about tax and financial incentives for adding clean energy projects as well as home energy efficiency upgrades and low-income housing community on-site power projects, Hanlon said, who said the government authority has conducted more than 200 such meetings thus far.
During a tax equity panel, several panelists noted that uncertainty surrounding federal guidance among the numerous tax incentives has caused a slowdown in the tax equity market. Project financing commitments initially on track for 2023 pushed out to 2024 in lieu of lack of clarity from IRA subsidies.
“2023 projects are sloping to 2024 at this point, with IRA adders creating upsized projects at the same time,” said Bryen Alperin, managing director at Foss & Company, a tax and structured finance investment firm, who said transferability guidance could help pencil in more 2024 projects at the very least.
Jennifer Wnek, a partner in Allen & Overy’s global projects, energy, natural resources and infrastructure group, agreed with Alperin, saying the solar finance market appears “stymied” right now based on uncertainty concerning IRS guidance for tax credit transferability, among other incentives.
After transferability, panelists appeared most interested in federal guidance surrounding the Energy Communities adder as well as prevailing wages and apprenticeship guidance, designed to create new jobs in the clean energy marketplace.
The IRA defines an energy community as a brownfield site or an area that has had significant employment related to fossil fuel resources historically. These energy communities increase the available tax credit by 10% if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met or 2% if those requirements are not met for projects over 1 MW.
Tanya Willacy, senior vice president and chief legal officer of esVolta, an energy storage developer and asset manager, said without federal guidance, the Generate Capital-backed company remains keen on brownfield projects as qualified under the energy communities adder.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/21/researchers-evaluate-viability-of-direct-green-hydrogen-fuel-production/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,GERMANY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 21, 2023",Researchers evaluate viability of ‘direct’ green hydrogen fuel production,"“Green” hydrogen is the production of hydrogen fuels using emissions free generations sources like solar and wind energy. While renewables-charged battery-powered vehicles and power plants are expected to make up a large share of the energy transition, green hydrogen has garnered interest for heavy trucking and industrial use cases due it its ability to dispatch high amounts of power. 
Production of green hydrogen typically takes the “indirect” approach using solar and wind to power electrolyzers. These electrolyzers have reached efficiencies of around 30%. 
A research team at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) Institute for Solar Fuels is investigating another pathway to emissions-free hydrogen production through a process they call the “direct” approach. The approach is outlined in a Nature Communications article. 
The team is developing photoelectrodes that convert sunlight into electrical energy, are stable in aqueous solutions, and catalytically split water into hydrogen. The photoelectrodes are coupled with catalyst materials, creating the active component in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. 
Today, the best PEC cells are able to achieve efficiencies near 10% and are made of low-cost and relatively stable metal oxide absorbers. Though they are significantly less efficient than their indirect green hydrogen counterparts, PEC cells have some advantages. The heat from the direct sunlight can be used to further accelerate reactions. And, since the densities range ten to 100 times lower with this approach, more abundant and inexpensive materials can be used as catalysts, said the researchers. 
Despite these promising elements of the PEC approach, techno-economic analysis and net energy analysis have shown that it is not yet competitive with the conventional green hydrogen production approach. Hydrogen fuel from PEC systems costs about $10 per kg, about six times more than “blue” hydrogen from fossil methane steam reforming at $1.50 per kg. Also, cumulative energy demand for PEC water splitting is estimated to be four to 20 times higher than for hydrogen production with renewable energy and electrolyzers. 
Despite this gulf in cost efficacy between the approaches, the research team at HZB Institute is testing other potential benefits of PEC. The group tested the effects of how the hydrogen produced reacts further with itaconic acid in the same reactor to form methyl succinic acid (MSA). MSA is another chemical fuel that can be used to dispatch high amounts of energy like hydrogen. 
The PEC technology enables MSA to be produced at only one-seventh of the typical energy requirement of MSA fuel production processes. 
To find this, researchers calculated how much energy is needed to produce the PEC cell from light absorbers, catalyst materials and other materials such as glass, and how long the system must function to produce this energy in the form of chemical energy as hydrogen or MSA. 
For hydrogen alone, the energy payback period is about 17 years when assuming a modest 5% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. If only 2% of the hydrogen produced is used to convert itatonic acid into MSA, the energy payback time is halved. If 30% of the hydrogen is converted into MSA, the production energy can be regained after just 2 years. 
“This makes the process much more sustainable and competitive,” said Dr Fatwa Abdi, HZB Institute for Solar Fuels. 
“This approach offers a way to significantly reduce the production cost of green hydrogen and increases the economic feasibility of PEC technology,” Abdi says. “We have carefully thought through the process, and the next step is to test in the laboratory how well the simultaneous production of hydrogen and MSA works in practice.”

Spanish energy company Iberdrola is using a real dog and a robotic dog to detect faults in one of its ground-mounted PV plants.
The real dog uses its olfactory abilities to detect problems in the electrical network that could lead to power outages. It was trained by technicians from ScottishPower, Iberdrola’s subsidiary in the United Kingdom, to find the faults. The company claims it had a 100% success rate in a test conducted in December.
“Not only has it found all the problems that had been prepared, but he has also detected some that he was not expected to find,” Iberdrola said, noting that the dog saves time and eliminates unnecessary work by helping to fix faults as quickly as possible. “The training of the dog is not accidental, since it is part of a pilot project that joins other actions that the company has planned to deal with inclement weather in the country.”
In addition to the services provided by the real dog, Iberdrola is also using a robotic dog at the PV facility. The device has a built-in thermal vision system that generates thermographic reports on the status of the different PV plant components, as it walks between the panel rows following a programmed route. According to the robot developer – U.S.-based Boston Dynamics – the big benefit of the robotic legs is that they are terrain-independent.
Iberdrola says the robotic dog is able to detect and analyze faults in substations.
“The advantages of this small technological assistant are several,” it explained. “On the one hand, it takes high-resolution photos that it compares with images taken previously, which makes it possible to detect changes in the infrastructures that escape the human eye.”
The company added that the robot can collect large amounts of data, which can help it to increase the number of inspections that are carried out every year.
Boston Dynamics sold its first robot dog in 2020 for $74,500. Thus far, it has been used by various industries for a wide range of applications. Initially, the robotic dog was used to inspect the construction of active infrastructure tunnels, according to the manufacturer.
