The projects include 1.6 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of storage, which compares to 16 GW of solar and 14 GW of storage in NYISO’s interconnection queue studies at year-end 2021, according to data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The projects also include 2.3 GW of offshore wind and 0.8 GW of onshore wind, compared to 37 GW of offshore wind and 4 GW of onshore wind in the NYISO queue at year-end 2021.
The approved transmission project is the 339-mile, 1.25 GW high voltage direct current (HVDC) line known as the Champlain Hudson Power Express, for which construction began in November 2022.
The total interconnection cost for all approved projects is about $600 million, including about $200 million to interconnect the transmission project.
The approved projects “will help move the state closer to the clean energy mandates” of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, said Zach Smith, NYISO’s vice president of system and resource planning. Under that law, New York has an interim goal of reducing climate pollution 40% by 2030, compared to the 1990 level.
NYISO said in a statement that it “continues working with stakeholders to implement improvements to the interconnection study process.” The transmission operator said that additional engineers and project management staff have joined the planning department, and that ongoing focus groups with developers aim to identify “additional areas for enhancements.”
In addition, new technology is being developed, NYISO said, that will “create efficiencies in managing demands for applicants as well as NYISO staff.”
Last year Texas grid operator ERCOT reported that it had completed final interconnection studies for 6 GW of solar interconnection requests in 2021, while California grid operator CAISO reported completing such studies for 5 GW of solar. Grid operator MISO in the central U.S. reported that generator interconnection agreements for 6 GW of solar projects were filed in 2021. A generator interconnection agreement follows a final interconnection study.
NYISO has made available a list of the 27 projects that are advancing.
NYISO reviews requests to interconnect to the transmission grid using a “cluster study” process, which NYISO calls a “class year” process, as described in “The NYISO Interconnection Process.” In reporting on the 27 projects, NYISO said the “decision/settlement process for Class Year 2021” has been completed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/20/sustainability-at-fisu-world-university-games-includes-solar-powered-off-grid-generators/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Sustainability at FISU World University Games includes solar-powered off-grid generators,"The FISU World University Games is an international multi-sport event, organized for university athletes by the International University Sports Federation (FISU). The Lake Placid 2023 FISU Games’ Organizing Committee launched a sustainability initiative called “Save Winter” pledging to reduce the environmental impact of the event by using renewable energy, a more sustainable supply chain and a rigorous recycling program.
The organization has also taken measures to reduce energy use wherever possible, with a redesigned refrigeration system for the ice Herb Brooks Arena—where the 1980 Olympic hockey gold medal was won. The organizers are also using hybrid or electric vehicles wherever possible, and have planted trees to address the carbon emissions that result from the extensive travel required for the games.
The 2023 games are taking place from Jan. 12 to 22 in Lake Placid, New York with 1,443 student-athletes from more than 540 universities and 46 nations competing in 12 winter sports.
The games take place at disparate sites throughout the area and providing power where it’s needed is often a challenge. As a solution, Lion Energy, an official provider of power for the 2023 Games, donated 70 Lion Safari ME solar generators and 100 Lion Safari ME-XP expansion packs, along with solar panels, to power the waxing stations used by alpine ski athletes to prepare their equipment on race days, the announcer and press stations at the Curling Center and a charging station at the FISU World Conference where guests can charge their phones. The generators and expansion packs are contributing to maintaining a local electric power grid that is 100% renewable.
“As the Games Organizing Committee, we acknowledge that there is no way currently to host a perfectly carbon- and waste-neutral event,” said Karlan Jessen, head of sustainability and legacy at the 2023 FISU World University Games. “We feel that by bringing the conversation into the open and by doing what we can, we are setting a benchmark for future Games and for FISU, the international governing body for university sports. We appreciate our providers like Lion Energy who actively support this mission.”
Lion Energy, headquartered in American Fork, Utah, specializes in portable generators for off-grid use. The Lion Safari ME offers multiple plug-in options including AC, USB-A, USB-C and 12 V port, and it can  charge virtually anything that can plug into a standard wall outlet (15A) including power tools, refrigerators, medical devices, and even waxing equipment– at a professional grade 2000W/922Wh. An optional expansion battery pack, Safari ME-XP, enables storage of up to three times more energy  at nearly 3,000Wh total. Using the sun, it can recharge in as little as 95 minutes with a charge that can be retained for up to one year.
The units include a lithium iron phosphate battery made by American Battery Factory. The batteries can be charged in about 1 ½ hours with an AC cord or with solar energy from 100 W 24 V solar panels.
“As our vision at Lion Energy is to provide eco-friendly power solutions that help individuals, families and organizations of any size become energy independent, we welcomed the opportunity to participate at the 2023 FISU World University Games, which have a strong focus on sustainability,” said Tyler Hortin, president of Lion Energy.
Occurring concurrently, the FISU World Conference ran from Jan. 13 to 15, 2023 to coincide with the opening week of the games and featured athletes, advocates, authors, innovators, environmental leaders in both the private sector and government and researchers. Each of these groups focus on the intersection of climate change and winter sports. Lion Energy’s Tyler Hortin participated in the panel discussion titled “Clean Energy Solutions for Winter Sports and Our Communities” alongside panelists Professor Ken Vesser of Clarkson University, COO Serge Abergel of Hydro-Québec Energy Services, Vice President David Sandbank of NYSERDA and moderated by Professor Susan Powers of Clarkson University.
Last year Lion Energy donated approximately $400,000 worth of generators, lighting and other equipment to support communications and other key electrical services for Ukrainians.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/20/model-law-protects-developers-of-solar-on-brownfield-sites/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MASSACHUSETTS,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Model law protects brownfield solar development,"Investments in the U.S. renewable energy market are expected to hit $114 billion by 2031,  according to a recent report from Wood Mackenzie. This indicates a 78% increase from $64 billion in total investments at year end 2021, and is attributed to the decarbonization momentum being spurred by the landmark Inflation Reduction Act. Such rapid expansion, however, will inevitably lead to issues related to siting.
One attractive solution to this is siting renewables on brownfield sites, which are current or formerly contaminated sites. This includes landfills, former power plants, and mine sites, among other locations. Lawyers for the Legal Pathways to Deep Carbonization Model Law Project are aiming to make this easier. The group recently published a new model law to provide liability exemption for renewable energy developers under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
CERCLA, commonly known as a Superfund, authorizes the federal government to assess and clean up properties contaminated with hazardous waste, with hefty fines for liable polluters. The model law would provide a “statutory exemption for wind and solar energy developers” in line with current protections, and “removes the need for EPA enforcement discretion as to imposition of CERCLA liability.”  Also, it would limit CERCLA liability by transferring wind and solar brownfield site authority to state response authorities.  However, an exception to the EPA’s role would be retained where it is warranted by regulation, “such as sites posing a threat to the sole-source drinking water aquifer or a sensitive ecosystem.”
These changes would build upon the EPA RE-Powering Initiative which encourages renewable energy development on brownfields. The EPA estimates that there are approximately 13,000 potential brownfield sites with over 22 million acres nationwide. A report from the RE-Powering Initiative in October tracked 502 renewable energy projects on brownfields across the country, amounting to 2.4GW installed, with 93% of those installations being from solar. Surprisingly, 26% of those installations are based in Massachusetts as the result of state financial incentives coupled with a streamlined permitting process.
An example brownfield solar development is the 50 MW Sunnyside Solar Project that’s being developed south of Houston, with 2 MW from the project designated for community solar. Located on a former landfill, that had been abandoned for 50 years, the development is expected to become the nation’s largest urban brownfield solar farm. The 240-acre plot will provide enough electricity to power up to 10,000 homes or take an estimated 120 million pounds of carbon out of the atmosphere annually. A part of the agreement between the city and Sunnyside Energy, Sunnyside will provide power discounts to low-income residents in the neighborhood and will train 175 residents through local colleges and employ more than 100 local workers to construct the project.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/20/soiling-a-multibillion-dollar-issue-for-the-solar-industry/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,O&M,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Soiling – a multibillion-dollar issue for the solar industry,"From pv magazine global
Soiling – where PV modules become coated with dust, dirt, sand or snow and thus receive less sunlight – is still an underestimated problem for solar power systems. Specialized solutions are now available in the form of anti-soiling glass coatings, automated and manual cleaning products, and models to predict the ways to use them most economically. But our understanding of the issue is still evolving, particularly as PV systems move into new regions with different environmental conditions, and the technology itself continues to change and improve.
A new report by IEA-PVPS Task 13 seeks to push understanding of soiling a step further, taking a detailed look at the mechanisms causing soiling right down to the size and shape of the individual particles that build up on module’s surface, and the surrounding conditions that lessen or worsen its impacts.
The report estimates that in 2018, soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV – amounting to lost revenue of over $3 billion. And this is expected to increase to around 4% to 5% this year, thanks to an increase in PV installations in regions highly prone to soiling, economic pressures, and the fact that more efficient PV modules will suffer larger losses to their output due to soiling.
The report shows that soiling is a highly site-specific issue, and that even different areas within a single site can see quite different conditions. This leads the authors to place emphasis on accurate monitoring of these as a key part of the solution.
“An ideal solution should be installable with as little maintenance as possible and be able to detect heterogeneous soiling at both module and site level with high accuracy,” the scientists said.
Meanwhile, additional work is needed to develop accurate models to predict soiling rates at a given site, with current efforts either limited to a very small area, or based only on satellite data that is too generalized to give an accurate portrayal of site conditions.

PJM is a regional transmission organization that serves 13 states and the District of Columbia.
At year-end 2021, PJM had 259 GW of new power generation and storage capacity actively seeking grid interconnection. Capacity in PJM’s queue is dominated by solar (116 GW), standalone energy storage (42 GW), solar-plus-storage systems (32 GW), and wind power (39 GW).
PJM’s queue has ballooned in recent years, with 2021’s active queue increasing by 240% compared to year-end 2019. The capacity associated with interconnection requests is nearly twice as large as PJM’s peak load in recent years (155 GW). This explosive growth of interconnection requests along with lengthy study timelines and high project withdrawal rates (423 GW) motivated the Mid-Atlantic grid operator to reform its interconnection process in 2022.
Going forward, PJM has adopted a “first-ready, first-served” approach and increased study deposits that are at risk when projects withdraw.
The PJM study culls data from more than 1,100 projects, covering 86% of new generators in the grid from 2000 to 2022. However, the Berkeley Lab notes the difficulty in finding project cost specific data, creating an information barrier for developers, regulators and policy makers.
For completed projects, average costs have doubled relative to pre-pandemic costs, from $42 per kW to $84 per kW, with a median of $18 per kW to $30 per kW).
For active projects, interconnection costs have ballooned higher, from $29/kW to $240/kW between pre-pandemic costs and costs starting in 2020.
Withdrawn projects face the highest costs, averaging at $599/kW, with a median of $156/kW, which is likely a key driver for those withdrawals, the report notes.
Full access to the study can be found here.
Network upgrade cost driver
The key driver to interconnection cost increases has been network upgrade costs, Berkeley Lab finds.  The average costs for upgrades beyond the substation have risen sharply since 2019, to $71/kW for complete projects, $227/kW for active projects, and $563/kW for withdrawn projects.
A small group of generators face lower network upgrade costs by choosing interconnection services as an energy source instead of a capacity resource. However, as a result project owners forfeit preferential treatment during daily high load times, cannot participate in PJM’s capacity market, and may face increased curtailment.
Among recently completed projects, interconnection costs have fallen for natural gas ($18/kW) facilities, while increasing for both solar ($99/kW) and onshore wind ($60/kW) relative to historical costs through 2016. Costs for both active and withdrawn storage and solar plus storage projects are surprisingly high ($337/kW), but complete projects are much cheaper (storage: $4/kW, solar hybrid: $20/kW).
The PJM study was funded in part under the U.S. Department of Energy’s Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2X), and builds on Berkeley Lab’s previous work tracking interconnection requests and timelines.
After a recent study from October 2022 examining interconnection costs in the MISO market, the Berkeley Lab will publish future analyses on the NYISO, ISO-NE, and SPP markets in the coming months.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/20/ohio-watershed-authority-evaluating-bids-for-modules-and-hardware-for-13-solar-facilities/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,OHIO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JANUARY 20, 2023",Ohio watershed authority evaluating bids for modules and hardware for 13 solar facilities,"Anglers of the Ohio River’s eastern tributaries will see its conservation corps powering its stations with solar over the coming years.  The Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District (MWCD) announced plans to install 13 solar systems this year with EPC contractor IMC Solar deploying its systems. Solar power generated from the projects will help offset approximately 73% of energy used by the district and lower its carbon footprint by 656 tons of CO2 emissions.
Adria Bergeron, director of marketing and communications at MWCD, told pv magazine USA that the water district is evaluating bids for solar modules and hardware to be used across the 13 waterway sites, where the facilities could utilize ground-mounted, rooftop systems or parking canopy solar arrays, or a combination of the three systems.  The spokeswoman said once the district evaluates bids from potential suppliers, the authority and IMC Solar will provide more clarity on the overall power output from the 13-site portfolio, adding that the preference is to go with Ohio or at least U.S.-made components.
The district’s board of directors recently approved an agreement with IMC Solar to install solar projects at the conservancy’s Atwood, Clendening, Piedmont, Seneca, and Tappan Lakes facilities, in addition to its main office located in New Philadelphia, Ohio.
“MWCD’s mission is to be a good steward of our natural resources,” said Craig Butler, executive director. “Ohio has excellent opportunities for solar power, and we expect to grow this program to expand in the future.  We are fortunate to partner with IMC Solar and welcome them as part of our team to help us manage our long-term energy management needs.”
“We really want to create a visible presence for our visitors because there really isn’t all that much solar in our part of the state,” said Bergeron.
“The solar program will also provide better economics for the district’s energy expenditures,” said Rick Frio, managing partner of IMC Solar.
The district’s clean power analysis began in 2022 with IMC Solar assessing solar potential. This included evaluating electricity usage, determining potential locations, and cost savings.
IMC Solar will assist during the construction phase as well as the negotiations of a purchase power agreement, including providing financial modeling of the potential projects.
The district was formed in 1933 to develop and implement a plan to reduce flooding and conserve water for beneficial public uses in the Muskingum River Watershed, the largest watershed in Ohio which covers about 20% of the state’s land area.
Since construction, the district’s 16 reservoirs and dams have been credited to saving more than $8 billion worth of potential property damage from flooding, as well as providing popular recreational opportunities including campgrounds, fishing and boating access, hiking and walking trails that bolster the region’s economy. The district is partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for operations and management of the system of dams and reservoirs. The Army Corps operates the dams for flood reduction and the district manages most of the reservoir areas behind the dams.
American Electric Power, the utility that services the eastern Ohio region, will retire 50% of its U.S. coal fleet or approximately 5.3 GW of coal-fired power plants through 2028.  In December 2015, AEP demolished a 1.5 GW coal plant located along the Muskingum River in Beverly, Ohio.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Ohio ranks 26th in the U.S. for solar development, with 916 MW deployed through Sept. 30, 2022, though the Buckeye State is home to 7,411 workers in the solar industry. Ohio is home to First Solar, Yellowlite and Toledo Solar manufacturing facilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/20/10-million-prize-to-accelerate-community-solar-in-underrepresented-communities/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 20, 2023",$10 Million prize to accelerate community solar in underrepresented communities,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP) launched several initiatives to support the deployment of equitable community solar projects and recognize projects that exemplify best practices in community solar.
The Community Power Accelerator and its $10 million prize will leverage $5 billion in private-sector financing commitments to help community-based organizations and other project developers access financing and build community solar projects, particularly in disadvantaged and underrepresented communities.
Community solar is a way for people to benefit from solar energy without having to put solar on their own rooftop. It serves those who cannot afford their own solar installation as well renters, who don’t own their rooftop. It also serves those whose home many not be oriented for solar or have other unsuitable conditions. Residential rooftop solar has historically been adopted by higher-income customers, although that trend has been changing, community solar is a way for anyone—regardless of income or home ownership—to benefit from solar.  
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a sweeping piece of climate legislation, but it may have its greatest impact on overburdened communities. For example, the IRA includes the Justice40 Initiative, which supports programs that improve clean transit and workforce development, while also investing in programs that make clean energy more affordable and accessible and strengthen resilience to climate change.
NCSP will play a vital role in supporting the Justice40 Initiative to ensure that every community benefits from the clean energy transition and in achieving the President’s goals of a 100% electric grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
“The National Community Solar Partnership provides yet another exciting opportunity to harness the power of the sun to power our communities—helping make our climate goals a reality while lowering energy costs and reducing local air pollution,” said Jennifer M. Granholm, U.S. Secretary of Energy. “The President’s historic clean energy laws are supercharging access to renewable energy, and DOE is seizing the moment by accelerating community solar deployment to ensure affordable, clean energy is available whenever and wherever to everyone.”
Community Power Accelerator
The Biden Administration set a goal this year to sign up 5 million community solar households, achieving $1 billion in bill savings by 2025. Currently the community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW by the target year. The IRA established tax credits for solar energy projects, and it adds 20% bonus credit for solar power projects that sell their electricity to low-income households. The DOE estimates that this tax credit could support up to 18 GW of additional community solar projects over the next 10 years, enough to power over 2.5 million homes.
The critical challenge is ensuring that all types of organizations and communities have access to the funds to develop community solar and that the projects deployed deliver “meaningful benefits” to communities and subscribers, like electricity bill savings, community ownership and wealth-building, resilience, equitable workforce development, and low- to moderate-income household access.
The Community Power Accelerator is intended to bring together investors, philanthropic organizations, developers, community-based organizations, and technical experts to get more equitable community solar projects financed and deployed. The Accelerator will provide technical assistance to developers along with a Learning Lab to build a pipeline of verified, credit-ready projects that will connect with investors seeking to fund community solar in disadvantaged communities. Financial institutions and philanthropic organizations participating in the Accelerator have committed $5 billion in private sector financing for projects that are credit-ready.
The Accelerator includes the following programs:
Sunny award winners
During the NCSP Annual Summit, DOE announced the winners of the Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar, an awards program that recognizes best practices in community solar projects and programs that increase equitable access.
Five teams were selected for Grand Prize awards. Across the board, these five winners will help households achieve a projected combined total savings of $4.3 million on their energy bills. The projects provide clean energy access for 7,300 low- to moderate-income households and demonstrate best practices in increasing resilience, expanding community ownership, building a more equitable workforce, and leading community engagement.
Connecting the dots
With the NCSA program bringing community solar to more people and more communities, DOE wants to share that experience by highlighting the benefits of solar energy. The new Connect the Dots campaign will provide a resource hub so that the public can learn about how solar will positively impact the nation’s future, bringing focus to the connections between solar energy investments and their enduring, long-term benefits.
