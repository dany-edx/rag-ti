The bill is very similar in flavor to last year’s HB 1381, which passed 58-38 in the state House before ultimately dying in the Senate, in that it establishes standards for setback and height requirements, as well as fencing around projects, however the big change is that the adoption of these standards is entirely voluntary and dependent on the community.
The death of HB 1381 has been partially attributed to the fact that it would have required all communities to have adopted these standards, a point of contention within the 32 Indiana counties that previously enacted bans on renewable power projects. With SB 411, the hope is that other communities across the state will recognize the economic opportunity presented by solar, as well as its eventual inevitability as a lowest-cost generation resource in a state that has been slow to adopt it, but is moving rapidly as of late.
“We hope that counties in Indiana will use these new standards, but if not, we look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders to explore ways to grow the state’s energy economy,” said Clean Grid Alliance State Policy Manager, Sean Brady.
Just last month, Duke Energy released a request for proposals (RFP) looking to bring up to 1.1GW of intermittent generation, specifically renewable energy generation like solar, wind, hydrogen or other commercially viable renewable energy technologies to the Hoosier state, as part of it’s most recent Integrated Resource plan.
Duke is also looking to construct or acquire up to up to 1.3GW of non-intermittent generation, which the utility defines as electric generation that is dispatchable on demand, specifically natural gas combustion turbines, combined-cycle units and stand-alone battery storage.
In August of 2021, CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana-based utility filed a request for approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to enter into two power purchase agreements for an additional 335 MW of solar energy. The state’s solar takeoff has already begun, with almost all of its roughly 1.6GW of installed capacity reaching operations in 2021. When HB1381 passed the Senate last year, the state had just 475MW of installed capacity.
Over the next five years, the state is expected to add the sixth-most new solar capacity of any state in the country, with roughly 6.75GW of new solar expected in that time. According to the American Clean Power Association, Indiana has 1,218 MW of clean power currently under construction and 4,657 MW in advanced stages of development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/10/dukes-proposed-net-metering-2-0-rule-change-in-north-carolina-meets-stiff-opposition/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH CAROLINA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 10, 2022",Duke’s proposed Net Metering 2.0 rule change in North Carolina meets stiff opposition,"Today three of the longest-established rooftop solar companies in North Carolina will jointly intervene in the North Carolina Utility Commission (NCUC) net metering docket in order to challenge Duke Energy’s proposal to change the rules.
Duke’s plan would institute a minimum monthly bill of up to $28 for homes adding solar and would lower the price paid for their excess power by up to two-thirds from the current retail rate. Additionally, a rebate for solar customers who also install a smart thermostat may not be approved. If it is approved, it will only be for homes heated with electricity and is not available to current solar owners.
For Dave Hollister, president of Sundance Power, a leading solar installer in North Carolina, this is ultimately a battle over who owns the energy. “When utilities look through such a narrow lens of cost shifting they’re applying a litmus test that doesn’t apply to any other ratepayer. Rooftop solar is such a small fraction of electrical sales in this state that it poses no threat to Duke Energy currently. They’re hedging their bet without fully complying to the letter of the law [HB 529], which states that ‘The rates shall be nondiscriminatory and established only after an investigation of the costs and benefits of customer-sited generation.’ No such investigation has been conducted. ,” Hollister said.
Also today, 15 of North Carolina’s rooftop solar companies sent an open letter to Governor Cooper calling for his help to protect rooftop solar from Duke’s attempt to weaken the industry. The letter states, “We believe the proposed changes could harm a growing industry on behalf of a single corporation, cause the loss of thousands of well-paying jobs in the North Carolina solar industry, threaten your climate goals and hurt all electricity customers by limiting the delivery of low-cost power to the grid.”
Changes countrywide
Changes in net metering rules in California and Florida have forced the industry to react quickly. In California, the Net Metering 3.0 proposal, which was called a solar-killing measure, was put on hold after it came under fire from industry leaders, environmentalists, and working Californians. Just this week Florida’s House passed a bill that calls for the rate paid by utilities to rooftop solar owners for electricity sent back to the grid to be phased down to a fraction of its original rate, and it opens the door for unlimited fixed fees to be levied on solar customers.
These net-metering changes are pitched as a protection for non-solar customers from raised rates through cross-subsidizing solar customers. Studies completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar.
Will Giese, southeast regional director of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) sees these bills as a threat to the 100,000+ Florida homeowners who have installed rooftop solar and to the 11,000 jobs created in the state. “Utilities are now banking on the state government to strip those rights away and pad their monopoly hold on electricity ,” Giese said. The Florida bill now goes to the Governor’s desk.
Following the anti-rooftop solar playbook
“There’s much national attention on utility efforts to choke rooftop solar, and it’s increasingly clear to me that this case could be pivotal to flipping Duke Energy’s climate-wrecking, ‘expand gas, limit renewables’ business model,” said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN.
The North Carolina rooftop solar proponents point out that rooftop solar is good for all electricity ratepayers, which is in contrast to Duke Energy’s stance. In testimony in October 2020 in a South Carolina Public Service Commission proceeding, Crossborder Energy of Berkeley, CA made the statement that, “There is not presently a cost shift from solar customers to non-participating ratepayers, and distributed solar is a cost-effective resource for DESC (Duke Energy South Carolina) ratepayers.”
Stew Miller, co-founder and president of Yes Solar Solutions, a leading installer in North Carolina and signer of the letter, thinks that Duke is “following the playbook that utilities in California and Florida are using to slow the growth of their only competitors … their current ratepayers that want the freedom to generate a portion of their own electricity.”
In addition to the letter, over 50 nonprofits have signed a statement opposing Duke’s scheme. A statewide TV-online ad campaign will begin soon; phase one will last four weeks and is intended to build public pressure.
North Carolina is currently generating 8.07% of its electricity from solar and ranks fourth in the country for solar installed, according to SEIA. The North Carolina General Assembly and utilities have set goals of net-zero emissions by 2050 for the electric power sector, and the letter states that “it is inconsistent for Duke Energy to propose a policy that would slow the growth of clean energy.”
The bottom line is that the Duke proposal is bad for ratepayers and for solar installers. “Initial modeling indicates the value of solar to NC customers is reduced by 25%-30% due to increased monthly fees, TOU rates, critical peak pricing and significantly lower credit for excess generation,” Miller said.
The NCUC extended the deadline for parties to intervene in the case and to file initial comments to March 29.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/10/without-federal-support-us-would-only-reach-39-of-carbon-free-energy-sector-by-2035-said-wood-mackenzie/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 10, 2022","Without federal support, US would only reach 39% of carbon-free energy sector by 2035, said Wood Mackenzie","SEIA and Wood Mackenzie issued a call to the federal legislature to move quickly to pass climate and clean energy policy. The US solar industry is facing supply chain challenges, trade actions, and legislative uncertainty. Wood Mackenzie said prices have increased as much as 18%, slowing deployment.
As much as a third of all utility-scale solar capacity scheduled to activate in Q4 2021 was delayed by at least a quarter, and 13% of projects planned for 2022 will be delayed for a at least a year, or have been cancelled altogether, according to SEIA and Wood Mackenzie. These pressures have led Wood Mac to lower its near-term solar forecasts by 19%, or 11GW.
Without significant policy support, including a long-term extension of the federal investment tax credit (ITC), Wood Mac said the US may only achieve 39% of its target of a carbon-free power sector by 2035.
After multiple rounds of slashing the total cost of the Build Back Better bill, US senators remain locked in negotiations. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted against an earlier proposal, shocking many, and has now said he will reopen negotiations “starting from scratch.” For now, the nation awaits resolution in what would be the most significant climate and energy legislation in US history.
“In the face of global supply uncertainty, we must ramp up clean energy production and eliminate our reliance on hostile nations for our energy needs. Policymakers have the answers right in front of them: if we pass a long-term extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit and invest in U.S. manufacturing, solar installations will increase by 66% over the next decade, and our nation will be safer because of it. America’s energy independence relies on our ability to deploy solar, and the opportunity before us has never been more obvious or urgent.” SEIA CEO and president Abigail Ross Hopper
Ten-year forecasts from Wood Mackenzie show that passing a long-term extension of the ITC, manufacturing tax credits, and other key clean energy incentives could increase installations by 66%. The group estimates an additional 20GW of US manufacturing would be added with supportive policy. Earlier proposals of the Build Back Better Act contained significant incentives for solar modules, trackers, inverters, and more.
In an interview with pv magazine, module producer Maxeon said that it is considering a 3GW cell production plant in the US, but is waiting on a Title XVII loan from the Department of Energy, and the passing of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. If passed, the company said it could begin producing cells in the US as soon as 2023.
Wood Mackenzie estimates 10-year growth under a long term ITC would be 86% for utility-scale solar, 20% for residential solar, and 15% for commercial/community and other non-residential solar. Solar capacity additions could exceed 70GW by 2030 under this growth projection.
“The supply chain constraints of the last year will hit 2022 installations the hardest, reducing capacity by 7% compared to 2021,”  “But our forecasts demonstrate long-term growth will overshadow these short-term challenges, especially if federal clean energy incentives are passed. In our ITC extension scenario, installed solar capacity is expected to multiply six times by 2032.” Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie
Despite uncertainty in policies like net energy metering (NEM), and the headwinds affecting all solar sectors, residential solar grew 30% year over year, reaching nearly 24GW of new installed solar capacity. California, which represents half of the nation’s rooftop solar market, is awaiting results on a reworked NEM 3.0. Earlier proposals of NEM 3.0 slashed solar value aggressively enough to cause Wood Mackenzie to drop its deployment projections in half for the state. The decision has been delayed indefinitely, thanks to advocacy efforts by groups like SEIA and the protest of thousands of Californians.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/10/renewable-advocates-urge-regulators-to-reject-fixed-charge-for-shared-solar-program/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,FINANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,VIRGINIA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 10, 2022",Renewable advocates urge regulators to reject fixed charge for shared solar program,"Just over six months ago, the state of Virginia began accepting applications for its new shared solar program, under which small-scale solar projects can be developed and constructed, with multiple customers subscribing to receive a credit on their utility bill for their share of the power that the solar array generates.
It’s a program structure that has taken off across the country. Most call it a community solar program, Virginia calls it shared solar, but it’s the same basic premise.
However, renewable energy advocates within the Commonwealth are concerned that the program could become compromised before it even begins, as the State Corporation Commission’s Hearing Examiner has proposed a requirement for residential customers to pay a $55 minimum bill each month to Dominion Energy as a condition for participating in the program.
If accepted, this minimum bill would be the highest in the nation, and the Coalition for Community Solar, a group of businesses and nonprofits working to expand customer choice and access to solar vial community solar, described the proposal as unraveling a program that was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.
While solar advocates are always going to oppose minimum bills and immovable fixed charges, which place a burden on the same low-income customers these programs are created to help, the shared solar law already included the ability for regulators to set a minimum monthly bill, in the form of a fixed cost charged to subscribers, that would account for the costs of implementing the program and for use of the utility’s grid infrastructure. While perhaps not ideal, this structure would be founded on actual cost, rather than the $55 flat fee that advocates have claimed is an arbitrary fee that will limit program participation.
“This minimum bill proposal of $55 or higher will kill the economics of the program by unfairly raising costs to the consumer, harming those the General Assembly intended to help,” said Executive Director of Conservatives for Clean Energy, Ron Butler. “Additionally, this will hurt landowners looking to secure their financial stability through lease payments for shared solar project sites. Virginians need the Commission to course correct so that all Virginians have the opportunity to benefit from the clean energy economy.”
On March 25, state regulators will take public testimony at an evidentiary hearing to address this proposed minimum bill. While the comment period for testimony has closed, interested parties can still register to speak as a public witness here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/10/solarfood-in-ethanol-fields-could-fully-power-the-united-states/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 10, 2022",Solar+food in ethanol fields could fully power the United States,"Ethanol emits more greenhouse gasses than the gasoline it is supposed to replace. Additionally, ethanol (corn) farms greatly under-utilize one of the greatest resources we have – land.
Of the ~92 million acres of corn planted in the US each year, roughly 40 million acres (1.6% of the nation’s land) are primarily used to feed cars and raise the octane of gasoline. If this land were repurposed with solar power, it could provide around three and a half times the electricity needs of the United States, equivalent to nearly eight times the energy that would be needed to power all of the nation’s passenger vehicles were they electrified.
However, if we were to transition this 40 million acres are of fuel to solar+food (agrivoltaics) – we could still meet 100% of our electricity needs, and power a nationwide fleet of electric vehicles. 
Recent research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that utility scale solar power in the United States generates between 394 and 447 MWh per acre per year. (For this document we’ll assume a more conservative 350 MWh/acre)*. Thus, just one acre of solar panels provides enough energy to propel America’s most popular electric vehicle – the Tesla Model Y – nearly 1.3 million miles each year.
LBL
In a good year, one acre of corn is expected to generate around 328 gallons of ethanol. Since ethanol contains only ⅔ the energy of gasoline, a comparable crossover SUV averaging 30 miles per gallon would travel only 6,600 miles per year on that acre of corn.
That’s not a typo. solar panels produce roughly 200 times more energy per acre than corn. This striking figure makes an ironclad case in favor of converting vehicles to electricity – and that’s before we take into account the environmental and health benefits which would result from the profound reduction in emissions.

The ‘recent’ news that US ethanol emits 24% more emissions than gasoline, is in fact old news. Politics in the United States, influenced by agricultural industries, fossil-fueled fertilizer manufacturing, and perhaps a well-intentioned ulterior motive of underwriting food for national security, has led to a massive subsidy program for corn growers.

In fact, since 1980, pretty much all of the additional acres used to grow corn have gone towards fueling vehicles, not humans. We need not point fingers at farmers – they simply produce what the market demands. But these demands, which our civilization imposes on our soil, have resulted in far-reaching consequences.
Corn is particularly adept at siphoning nutrients from our soils. Restoring these nutrients requires fertilizers sourced from fossil-fuel feedstocks and produces more CO2 emission than any other human-driven chemical process on earth. Meanwhile, solar can help alleviate our nitrogen-fixation emissions crisis as well, by pulling fertilizer out of thin air.
With these factors in mind, we propose a new national security initiative – one that combines solar electricity generation with food production in order to solve many issues in one fell swoop. We urge landowners, developers, and legislators to prioritize the replacement of ethanol field corn with agrivoltaic operations. These operations should specifically target locations with the highest risk for fertilizer runoff. It’s time to bring our agrarian society into the 21st century.
And, just for the sake of fuel security, let’s incorporate some hydrogen generation into the picture as well.
#AgrivoltaicsforEthanol
Forty million acres of ethanol field corn could be used to generate 14 petawatt hours of solar electricity, if deployed in standard, highly efficient installation techniques. A reminder – that’s 3.5 times more energy than the current U.S. electricity consumption.
However, that is not our goal. 

Even though we’re still in the nascent stages of agrivoltaic development, it’s fair to say that solar plus food facilities will generate at least half the amount of electricity per acre as we leave space for farming machines. One analysis from Germany found potatoes could be grown at 80% of their initial volume, while electricity could also reach 80% of its potential. 
In the scenario where we only get 50% of the solar output from the land, our repurposed acres would generate around 7 petawatt hours of electricity per year. That’s eight times the amount of electricity required (~0.88 PWhrs/year) to push 3.26 trillion passenger car miles in the US every year, and enough left over to electrify the nation 1.5 times over.

Of course, we don’t need (or probably want just yet) to power the US only via solar power. Thus we suggest powering the nation with only 50% solar – thus setting our electricity for our cars and our general power use around 16-21 million acres.
If we’re going to be honest about electrification, we must admit to ourselves that the 40 million acres of corn we blend with our gasoline is obstructing this path. But if we want to support our farmers, while generating massive amounts of local, secure, clean – and as sure as the sun rises – predictable electricity pricing, we must consider trading our ethanol for agrivoltaics.
#AgriovoltaicsforEthanol
*There are several caveats to this article.
For instance, this author’s interpretation of the solar capacity and electricity per acre per year research is on the higher end of the estimations (currently), as the research quoted focused specifically on land used for solar power – but less so on the land supporting the solar. One estimation from a respected modeler suggested we use a value of 220 MWh/acres/year – 37% lower than this article’s 350 MWh/acre/year, and roughly one half of the 447 MWh/acre/year value in the research paper quoted.
Another debate is the exact number of acres should we specifically say are ethanol acres – this is something researched by many, and can change based on the source.
Additionally, many questions related to energy storage scaling, high voltage power lines deployment, scheduling the charging of EVs, energy losses in charging/discharge, and whether or not to use solar energy to generate and compress hydrogen remain. Many paths are possible, but first we must eliminate the archaic notion that corn acreage is sacrosanct.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/10/industry-efforts-prevented-florida-rooftop-solar-bill-from-being-potentially-disastrous-2/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,FLORIDA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 10, 2022",Industry efforts prevented Florida rooftop solar bill from being potentially disastrous,"Recently, the Florida state legislature passed House Bill 741, a provision that lowers the rate paid to solar customers that export their excess electricity back to the grid. Industry advocates, environmentalists, and Florida citizens are now calling on Governor Ron Desantis to veto the bill as a last measure to prevent its passing.  
A Mason-Dixon poll showed 74% of Republicans and 94% of Democrat respondents wanted net metering to remain intact, and 68% of all respondents said they believe the state legislature should make it easier to go solar. However, the bill passed, and now net metering payments are scheduled to taper down. 
However, things could have been much worse. Rather than a slow taper, which gives the industry time to react and innovate, earlier models of the bill called for a swift change that would have left the industry reeling. Palmetto’s market development officer Ryan Barnett joined pv magazine to discuss the policy effort. 
Residential solar and storage developer Palmetto, along with other industry actors and advocates, worked closely with the bill’s negotiation process. “Costs likely won’t come down as quickly as the loss in value caused by the credit lowering, so this is a loss for consumers and for the industry,” said Barnett. “While this is bad for consumers in the short term, the solar industry will still thrive in the US.” 
Senator Jennifer Bradley and Representative Lawrence McClure introduced the bill in January, and the original proposal was described fast-moving and heavy handed. Rep. McClure was reported to have accepted over $20,000 from Florida utilities, and at that time he requested the Florida Public Service Commission to review rules and regulations of net metering, citing a utility argument that rooftop solar hurts middle-income Americans.
The bill that has now been passed was “successfully modified beyond recognition,” said Barnett. Several changes were made that may save the industry from being throttled by the new policy. 
Glide path
Perhaps the biggest win was buying the industry and Floridians valuable time. Original timelines of the Bradley/McClure proposals had the rate paid for net metering lowered from a retail price (what consumers pay for electricity end-use) to an “avoided cost” rate (essentially the wholesale cost to utilities) at the start of 2023. Payments for net metering would be slashed to a fraction of what they are today overnight. This would have been particularly damaging to the local businesses who have helped almost 1% of Floridians top their rooves with solar thus far, giving them little time to react and adjust business practices.
Instead, the bill has been built with a “glide path.” Rates will lower by 25% starting in 2024 and will taper off to the avoided cost rate in 2029, six years later than originally planned. 
Grandfathering & fixed charges
Image: Palmetto
Another victory was scored for the customers that Palmetto and other PV installers have served, as the “grandfathering” of net metering rates was extended. Now, customers will be able to lock in their net metering rate for 20 years instead of 15. Plus, whatever rate you install solar under will remain locked in for 20 years, so there is opportunity to secure net metering before it goes away by 2029. 
The original bill also had broad language that allowed utilities to levy fixed monthly charges on solar customers, something that has been described as a “tax on the sun.” Barnett said the new bill does still have provisions for fixed charges, and that it was a “tough pill to swallow” for the coalition of solar-supportive policy advocates.
However, the new fixed charge language tightened up the process. Rather than being able to add charges unchecked, utility companies will have to go undergo a public stakeholder process with Florida citizens and the Public Service Commission. This means that by 2026, the 68% of Floridians who responded they would like solar to be easier to access have an opportunity to block such fixed charges. 
Opportunity ahead 
Barnett said he is optimistic going forward that Florida citizens will have the opportunity to choose rooftop solar. Palmetto is well-positioned to continue to serve the state for years to come. The company is a technology-focused developer that works on a hub-and-spoke model. It enables “build partners” in active markets to use its design, sales, and customer service platforms. The company operates in 24 states. 
Palmetto’s build partners are local solar installers, electricians, and entrepreneurs that have real connections to their communities and the needs of local solar markets. It has a partner program called “Build+” where it trains startup-minded solar entrepreneurs. By operating with the hub-and-spoke model and being a well-capitalized company that is asset light and operational expense light, Palmetto is well-suited to adapt with strength to the many policy changes facing the nation, said Barnett. 
Barnett added that he believes the conversation is changing around renewable energy policy, that it is becoming less confrontational, and that utilities and rate designers are beginning to recognize the undeniable benefits of distributed, customer-owned rooftop solar. 
Direct pay?
Barnett added that there is an opportunity for policy to bring solar to more Americans. One such change would be the federal “direct pay” option, which would allow the solar investment tax credit to be paid against taxes. Currently, you need tax liability, or taxes owed, to qualify and take advantage of the tax credit.
This provision has an outsized impact on low-to-middle income people, tax-exempt people, and taxpayers with substantial losses. Direct pay would open solar access to these individuals who have historically not been able to enjoy the benefit of the tax credit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/10/charge-evs-at-work-not-home-to-put-daytime-solar-power-to-work/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 10, 2022","Charge EVs at work, not home, to put daytime solar power to work","Some electric vehicle owners automatically charge their vehicles when solar or wind generation is the highest and grid emissions are lowest, by using a Juicebox charger from demand response provider Enel X, or a rare Juicenet-enabled charger. EV owners using these options, which Enel X has offered since 2015, receive “grid participation incentives,” according to the company’s website.
The challenge of matching EV charging with renewable generation is easily met in the windy Plains states, with plenty of nighttime wind generation. There, charging at home overnight can access emissions-free wind power. In California, however, where solar is the main source of renewable generation, an EV driven to a daytime job needs a workplace charger to recharge with solar power.
That insight comes from a study by think tank RMI, co-authored by staff of the nonprofit WattTime. WattTime provides the “grid emissions intensity” data used by JuiceBox and JuiceNet chargers, through an application programming interface (API) that is also available to other providers.
The problem for EV owners in California, and other states adding solar power, is that the US has only 10,000 workplace charging ports, while 2.35 million EVs have been sold in the US since 2010, based on government data. Most of those EVs are still in use, and are typically charged at home.
For grids with “significant daytime solar,” the answer is to accelerate workplace charging programs, says the study, and offer low-cost daytime charging for employees.
For “wind-heavy grids” with increased wind generation overnight, the study notes that electric trucks and buses could be charged overnight at a centralized depot.
To maximize the flexibility of EVs as a grid asset, the study recommends high-power Level 2 charging with longer “dwell times,” or the amount of time a vehicle is parked at a charger. That could maximize EV use of renewable generation that would otherwise be curtailed at times when generation exceeds consumption.
Utilities should incorporate the grid flexibility resource from EVs at the planning stage, the study says, which means utilities must “modernize” the integrated resource planning process.
A transition to EVs was found to yield a 90% clean grid at lower electricity costs than one without EVs, in a UC Berkeley study last year. That’s partly because transmission investments would mainly be for spur lines to new renewable generation.
While the WattTime approach uses real-time emissions data to guide EV charging, an alternative approach would use real-time pricing data for managing the timing of electric vehicle charging, and other electricity use. A real-time pricing approach has been proven to work in a California pilot program.
The RMI study includes a comparison of the resource types used for generation, such as solar and wind, in each of five major grid operators in the US: PJM, CAISO, SPP, ERCOT and NYISO. The opportunities for charging EVs with renewables is greatest in regions with the highest renewables contribution, the study said.
