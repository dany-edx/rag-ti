https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/15/clean-energy-cost-savings-motivates-republicans-and-democrats-alike/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Clean energy cost savings motivates Republicans and Democrats alike,"Communication researchers from three universities have been studying how the framing of energy policy communication is able to influence participants’ views differently, depending on their political ideology. Whereas the vast majority of existing studies have examined the effect of messaging immediately after the message was delivered, this study sought to measure the ‘durability’ of messaging, using a three week waiting period.
The study found that after three weeks, the “cost savings” of renewables was the most memorable, or “sticky”, subject in the minds of participants. Participant’s responses to cost savings messaging remained the same at both the initial and the second meeting, and were shown to remain consistent across political parties.
Prior research from this group found that Republican support for renewable energy policies were influenced more from framing communications around renewables’ low cost and economic benefits, whereas Democrats’ support for renewable energy policies were influenced more by their concerns about global warming. The authors also noted that previous research indicated that news of higher renewable pricing caused more negative reactions, than news of environmental benefits caused positive reactions.
It’s long been known that “people tend to be more motivated to avoid losses rather than to capture equivalent gains”. With that, the authors found that framing a cost increase as a “threat” was more effective at influencing participants’ beliefs than highlighting “cost savings”, despite the identical financial consequences of both messages.
Messages presented to participants by researchers

In the paper, The durable, bipartisan effects of emphasizing the cost savings of renewable energy, participants were shown one of three messages (above) concerning renewable energy, and a benefit from the product. The researchers then measured the beliefs about renewable energy’s benefits and the percentage of support they received from participants. They sampled participant responses two more times over the course of 23 days.
The key results found that cost savings messaging (middle) had the largest, and most durable effects on beliefs, followed by the economic benefits and jobs message (left). The global warming message (right) was the least effective at changing participants’ views.
Results of three rounds of research participants, second two round after messaging shown

The cost savings results showed an initial increase in receptiveness, far exceeding that of the economy/jobs and global warming messages. In these times of extremely high fossil fuel pricing, it is no surprise that demand for solar panels has driven hardware pricing up. The results of the global warming messaging seemed to show very little benefit among Republicans, and may have actually caused a negative response. Messaging about jobs and the economy had less of an effect on Democrats than Republicans.
A total of 1,403 Republicans, and 1,488 Democrats were initially questioned. By the third round, 893 Republicans and 1,178 Democrats were left.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/15/what-kind-of-salary-and-benefits-can-i-expect-in-the-solar-industry/,"COVID-19,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",What kind of salary and benefits can I expect in the solar industry?,"Solar energy is a burgeoning industry, as the United States has set its sights on reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. By the end of last year, over 250,000 Americans were employed in the solar industry, growing 9% over the previous year.  
Solar jobs have doubled from about 100,000 in the last ten years, and the next ten are set to be even more historic as the Inflation Reduction Act sets aside $370 billion in climate and energy spending, much of it focused on boosting U.S. solar. 
RO Energy, a clean energy and infrastructure recruitment site, released its annual Salary Guide to illuminate what opportunities lie in this industry. The results are based on answers from over 400 respondents.
By market focus, across all job types, salaries were as follows:
Entry-level (0-2 years) commercial and industrial (C&I) workers were paid $80,700, entry level distributed generation workers $69,600, utility-scale $80,800, storage $79,200, and EV and EV infrastructures were $87,000.
Mid-career workers (6-10 years) were paid as follows: C&I $145,500, distributed generation $137,800, utility-scale $144,100, storage $175,000 and EV $141,700.
Late-career workers (15+ years) were paid: C&I $175,000 distributed generation $185,000, utility-scale $190,000, storage $205,000 and EV $200,000.
According to the previous year’s 2020 survey, construction jobs across all sectors paid around $84,600 entry-level. Construction workers with six to 10 years experience made $126,000, and those with 16+ years reported making $170,600. In development jobs, the first two years of experience led to an average pay of $87,600. That rose to $129,200 by years six to 10, and $187,100 for those working in the industry for 16 or more years.
Engineers and operations and maintenance (O&M) workers started off with the lowest salaries, $77,500 and $67,500, respectively. By year six to 10, engineers were paid an average of $94,200 annually and O&M pros made $121,800. By year 16, engineering jobs paid $127,600 on average, and O&M roles made $174,000.
Finance offered the highest pay levels in solar: an average of $94,000 for the first two years of experience, $149,100 years six to 10, and $195,000 for experience beyond 10 years.
The 2021 study found that there is a gender pay gap of about 18% in favor of men in the industry for early-career participants, but by mid-career, six to ten years, there is a slight pay gap in favor of women. The industry essentially reaches pay parity in mid- to late careers, but the survey highlights the need for gender pay equality in early-career opportunities. The survey also found 69% of females and 65% of males do not or do not know if they receive enhanced maternity/paternity leave. 
Solar workers appear to be happy in their current roles. On average, across levels of experience and job function, respondents said they would need a 20% to 25% increase in pay to be willing to change jobs. 
The survey also highlights benefits available to solar energy workers. The most common benefits were 401(k) contribution (92%), work from home options (83%), and flexible working hours (64%). 
When asked what the most important benefits of a solar job are, 29% said that work from home options are most important. This was followed by career progression (18%), 401(k) contributions (16%), flexible working hours (10%) and equity/stock options (9%). Interestingly, 83% of respondents said they receive an annual bonus as part of their compensation. 
“With the recent announcement on panel tariffs freezing for the next 24 months, I am sure we are going to see another boom in recruitment from companies that had slowed down due to the uncertainty around foreign panels,” said Emrah Baykal, CEO of RO.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/15/emerging-market-distributed-renewable-energy-platform-raises-5-million/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,COLORADO,NORTHERN AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Emerging market distributed renewable energy platform raises $5 million,"Odyssey Energy Solutions raised $5.34 million to scale its investment and asset management platform for distributed renewable energy projects. The funding round was led by Equal Ventures. Participating investors included Twelve Below, Abstract Ventures, Founder Collective, and MCJ Collective.
The company enables developers to plan, finance, build, and operate projects. The platform is catalyzing over $1 billion in financing in emerging markets in Africa and Asia. Over 1500 companies have used the platform across five continents.
BloombergNEF said investment in energy supply and infrastructure may reach up to $173 trillion over the next 30 years. Existing grid infrastructure is strained in emerging markets, and costs of renewable technologies are falling. As such, distributed renewable energy is leapfrogging centralized grids and will be at the core of infrastructure investment in the years to come, said Odyssey.
“The DRE market is fragmented, lacking the data and standardization required for large-scale investments,” said Emily McAteer, CEO, Odyssey Energy Solutions. “By solving for core frictions in one platform, our solution provides the tools to build investable portfolios and truly unlock scale.”
Odyssey said the funding will be used to launch new financial products for distributed renewable energy by infusing more private capital to the markets. The funds will also scale the company’s aggregated procurement platform and advance remote monitoring, control and analytics technologies for a wide array of asset types.
“We see the energy transition as one of the greatest (and most challenging) opportunities of our lifetime. Emerging markets represent one of the most economically and environmentally impactful areas to address the challenges but have thus far been hindered by access to technology and capital,” said Rick Zullo, general partner, Equal Ventures. “We are thrilled to partner with this first-class team to accelerate the global energy transition in a way that no one else has done before.”
Odyssey’s CEO, Emily McAteer, has more than 15 years of experience in energy management and distributed renewable energy, having launched SunEdison’s microgrid business as chief revenue officer of Frontier Power, along with Odyssey co-founder Cathy Zoi, clean energy leader and former Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy.
Since 2019, the company has supported a series of major electrification projects on the platform. It is the platform for the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP), a $550M initiative of the Federal Government of Nigeria financed by the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
NEP is one of the most ambitious electrification projects in history, targeting to connect over 3.5 million people to electricity, 109,000 businesses, and over 500 hospitals, universities, and health centers

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/15/goldman-sachs-and-cleanhill-partners-acquire-majority-stake-in-epc-power/,"ACQUISITIONS,BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Goldman Sachs and Cleanhill Partners acquire majority stake in EPC Power,"EPC Power Corp., a supplier of smart inverters for utility-scale solar installations, today announced the Sustainable Investing business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Cleanhill Partners acquired a majority stake in its company. The transaction closely follows the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which among other provisions, extends a first-ever tax credit to stand-alone energy storage, creating a significant financial incentive for clean energy technologies.
EPC Power, headquartered in San Diego, Calif. is an end-to-end power conversion solution provider. Its main products are designed for utility-scale applications as well as business and facility applications, and its smart inverters are designed for applications in standalone energy storage, solar energy storage and data center backup power. Going beyond the role of traditional inverters to feed power into the grid, smart inverters are powered by advanced software and work dynamically with the grid to increase resilience, reliability, safety, and security.
“EPC Power is uniquely positioned to play a critical role in the evolution of the U.S. solar and energy storage value chains and is now well capitalized to continue its trajectory of rapid growth,” said Alexander Mass, managing director of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “As the only scaled supplier of smart inverters that are designed, engineered and 100% manufactured in the U.S., EPC Power is a natural continuation of our thematic investment activity in this space, in partnership with Cleanhill Partners and EPC management.”
To date, EPC Power has sold more than 2 GW of smart inverters globally. Its first manufacturing facilities are in Poway in San Diego County, Calif., with a second U.S. manufacturing location on the East Coast scheduled to open in late 2022 to significantly expand production capacity. With a growing customer base in Europe, EPC Power also maintains an engineering and sales office in Helsinki, Finland. The company employs approximately 180 people.
“In an exploding market of cleantech innovators, EPC Power stands out for its industry-leading technology, which directly supports the renewable energy transition while preserving grid reliability and performance,” said Rakesh Wilson and Ash Upadhyaya, managing partners at Cleanhill Partners, which first invested in EPC Power in 2021 when it underwrote a credit facility to support its growth; since then, the firm has also provided counsel on operational matters and facilitated strategic partnerships to help the company achieve rapid scale. “As prior investors in EPC Power, we have every confidence that the company will meet its ambitious and environmentally critical objectives and we are excited to partner with Goldman Sachs for the next stage of EPC Power’s growth.”
The strategic investment positions EPC Power to further expand to be ready to meet the growing demand for renewable energy storage markets. Global energy storage installations are projected to multiply 20 times by the end of 2030 compared to the end of 2020, according to BloombergNEF’s 2021 Global Energy Storage Outlook, with the U.S. currently being the world’s largest market. Wood Mackenzie sees the United States on a path to be a 27 GW annual market by 2031, and 83% of that figure will be utility-scale storage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/15/ftc-solar-to-unveil-new-solar-tracker-technology-at-re-in-anaheim/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",FTC Solar to unveil new solar tracker technology at RE+ in Anaheim,"With a 500 MW agreement already inked for multiple projects using its new Pioneer tracker, FTC Solar, Inc. is about to unveil the one module in portrait (1P) solar tracker solution during the annual RE+ event on September 19 to 22 in Anaheim, Calif.
“Pioneer achieves a full 18%-36% pile count reduction per megawatt vs. the current industry-leading solutions by volume,” said Nagendra Cherukupalli, chief technology officer of FTC Solar, “allowing customers to benefit from reduced labor and materials costs. And with a high-density design, Pioneer enables up to 5% greater energy output for the same site compared to the competition, among numerous other advantages.”
The company said one of the advantages of Pioneer’s proprietary design is that it can reduce piles by 18% or more. It also features shorter row length that reportedly enables more than 5% greater energy output for a given parcel of land, and zero-degree stow allows for shorter pile embedment depth.
Designed for utility-scale installations, the Pioneer accommodates 550 W and 600 W wide-format modules. In addition, the company said no Torque Tube (TT) dimpling or through-bolts are required to index the module to the TT, allowing for module changes and retrofits. Pioneer supports all module factors, including those over 2.4 meters in length.
The tracker will operate independently from the grid during outages and is self-powered with a high-energy battery for up to three days. It also has a high slope tolerance that includes 17.5% north-south tracker row allowance.
Pioneer has undergone rigorous wind tunnel testing by an independent engineering firm RWDI to assure structural and torsional stability in wind conditions up to 120 mph. In addition, Pioneer’s distinctive torque tube shape allows for longer spans, improved torsional rigidity, and positive alignment of components without the need for torque tube penetrations.
The 500 MW agreement, signed with Primoris Renewable Energy, stipulates that FTC will supply its solar tracker technology for multiple project sites in the United States. Primoris is expected to use the new Pioneer 1P tracker technology on multiple projects.
Founded in 2017, FTC Solar is based in Austin, Texas and provides its tracker systems around the world. The company posted 44% growth in 2021 and issued strong guidance for the year, estimating 62% revenue growth for 2022, which the company said would outpace the market. In March FTC announced the acquisition of emergent competitor HX Tracker, a China-based supplier of 1P trackers. FTC anticipated that the acquisition would bring growth in China, the Middle East, and Africa.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/15/investing-in-uncertain-times-evaluating-the-solar-supply-chain/,"FINANCE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2022",Investing in uncertain times: Evaluating the solar supply chain,"Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, the solar coaster is about to move. With the signing of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in November 2021, the Auxin Solar petition to the U.S. Department of Commerce and subsequent investigation launched in March 2022, and the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Act stalled in Congress. The U.S. solar supply chain was broken and investment in domestic solar manufacturing was in free fall.
According to the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), solar installation forecasts have been lowered for 2022 and 2023 by 46%. On August 16, the U.S. solar industry received an unexpected reprieve in the form of the $1.3 trillion, Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by President Biden. Of this, the domestic solar supply chain is set to benefit from $60 billion of incentives.
I reached out to a cross section of U.S. solar industry participants for their perspectives on how this unprecedented new source of long-term economic support might impact business risk, investment, and M&A trends within the domestic solar manufacturing industry.
Key drivers of investment in U.S. solar manufacturing
According to Monica Wilson Dozier co-chair of Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP’s Renewable Energy Practice Group, “Supply chain volatility has particularly impacted U.S. development of renewable energy. In addition to constant technological change, the past several years have shown a variety of approaches to solar PV and battery storage plant component manufacturing – some successful, and others not.
“In an environment of ever-increasing demand, particularly in the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act, developers, contractors and their financing partners are eager to establish long-term procurement relationships with stable manufacturers. In order to do that, they are looking to diligence (1) technological capabilities, (2) manufacturing bandwidth and supply chain traceability, (3) financial stability, and (4) key warranties and product guarantees.”
A solid foundation for the future of U.S. solar manufacturing
Jordi Villanueva is the vice president of sales at Attala Steel, a subsidiary of EDSCO Fasteners and portfolio company of MiddleGround Capital. Attala Steel specializes in high volume, high-quality, low-cost posts for PV solar projects using 100% made-in-USA production. As he says, “The past two and a half years have brought unprecedented and unexpected challenges.”
“As a 16-year veteran in the solar industry I can confirm that, just like in life, the path to progress has never been a straight line for solar. Starting with a brutal pandemic, followed by extreme labor and material shortages, supply chain and transportation disruptions, regulatory setbacks, and several geopolitical challenges.
“Most of these challenges converging at the same time, in a ‘perfect storm’ fashion. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act will bring the much-needed stability and predictability to the solar market. Additionally, we are finally beginning to see relief in the labor, materials, and supply chain markets, which make 2023 and onwards a very promising and exciting time for the U.S. solar industry.
“Our customers, mostly solar EPCs, are already releasing a sizeable number of projects for Q4 2022 and particularly for 2023. Some of these customers are also seeking to secure sufficient production capacity to support their future projects. Only time will tell which is the next ‘bump’ on the solar road, but it appears that we are finally headed towards a smooth stretch in the foreseeable future.” 
Leading the way in U.S. solar infrastructure investing
Rick Brawn, managing director of operations at MiddleGround Capital, a private equity firm that invests in B2B companies in the industrial and specialty distribution sectors in the lower middle market in North America and Europe, says, “One of the reasons MiddleGround Capital (MGC) is investing in infrastructure and particularly in the solar industry is because we found ways to create value in our investments, particularly around solving supply chain issues. Our investments in solar help EPC customers and developers by reducing lead times and meeting their rapid growth plans.”
“We put capital to work by increasing capacity in the supply chain, adding equipment to accelerate delivery of critical product and by producing better quality products that meet new requirements such as the extended life of new solar fields. That’s why MGC invests in companies like Attala Steel and we continue to look for opportunities to invest in the solar industry. Finally, we continue to put resources into these investments and identify similar opportunities to create additional value in the supply chain for the solar industry.”
The U.S. solar industry of the future
Finally, Brad Ives, the recently announced executive director of the Center for the Environment at Catawba College in North Carolina, believes the supply chain for utility-scale solar projects needs a rapid increase in domestic manufacturing.
“The current shipping problems and costs, tariffs on Chinese panels, and concerns about possible forced labor by the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, all are combining to drive up costs for imported solar panels at a time when the United States wants to rapidly increase the amount of solar energy being generated. The solution will be to develop meaningful manufacturing in the Southeastern U.S. that can supply just-in-time deliveries to 100+ MW projects.”

Jake Beaulieu is a director with Bundy Group, a 33-year-old, industry focused, boutique investment bank. He leads the firm’s Sustainability coverage efforts advising founders, owners and management teams in business sales, capital raises and acquisitions.
