The portfolio begins with the announcement of four distributed standalone 9.9 MW battery energy storage systems. Regis Energy Partners will operate as independent developer, owner, and operator, while Excelsior will act as an investment fund. The initial four battery systems are expected to come online in 2023. 
Energy storage developer Stem will provide battery hardware and operate its AI-powered energy management software system. Stem will also offer in-market solutions for ERCOT development and provide ongoing services once the batteries are operational. 
“The energy storage market in Texas represents a significant growth opportunity for leading renewable energy investors like Excelsior who recognize the rich merchant revenue opportunities in the ERCOT market. Stem has spent the past decade helping project developers and independent power producers (IPPs) get projects to commission and drive higher economic output with our AI-driven Athena platform, energy consulting and support services, and ability to manage and optimize projects over time. We will continue to partner with regional developers like Regis to collectively help investors achieve their energy optimization goals in the region while accelerating the adoption of renewable assets,” John Carrington, chief executive officer of Stem
Standalone energy storage systems now offer greater value under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which extends the 30% investment tax credit to the technology. Previously, only co-located batteries paired with renewable energy generation were eligible for the credit. 
Texas grid to benefit from distributed storage 
In 2021, Winter Storm Uri became a landmark example of the unpredictability of climate, and its harsh impact on the legally mandated core requirements of electric utility companies: to provide electric service reliably and to furnish just and reasonable prices to customers.
The electric grid’s functional collapse during the storm was an example of the ERCOT grid’s failure of achieving those mandated goals. By some estimates, the storm caused $130 billion in near-term economic damages, and the long-term consequences have not yet been fully assessed.
The sudden spike in unplanned-for energy demand caused by extreme weather led to wholesale market spot prices skyrocketing up to $9,000/MW, and that price held for over three days. Historically, the price cap is only hit momentarily, and pressures are relieved quickly.
This unprecedented price spike was caused by a combination of nonfunctioning natural gas equipment, and congestion on the grid from intense localized energy demand, that caused substations to cut power to stabilize the grid. A study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found 87% of the outages were caused by issues with natural gas supply as uninsulated stations failed to function.
A panel at the RE+ event in San Antonio reviewing the ERCOT grid shared that 40,000 power outage events occurred in the U.S. last year, a 50% increase over 2020.
The figures highlight two problems. First, the centralized grid is failing the people who rely on it. Second, the climate is adding more pressure that will need to be dealt with to keep these systems running adequately.
This is where energy storage comes into play, and where intelligent planning of the grid is critical. At RE+ San Antonio, residential installer Sunrun shared that its home battery systems provided 234,000 hours of backup power following Winter Storm Uri. Interest in batteries skyrocketed, with hits on Sunrun’s battery-related website pages increasing 350% in the direct aftermath. This backup was about more than just comfort, but also about safety. Uri took an estimated 246 lives in Texas.
The financial cost of such events is massive, too. Retail energy providers who did not properly hedge against the risks of the volatile ERCOT wholesale market were hit with fees so sharp that many  went out of business overnight. Homeowners in predatory contracts were also exposed directly to the wholesale market, and many were faced with multi-thousand-dollar utility bills.
Congestion on the grid was a key cause of the problem. Delivering power from generation centers in remote places across long distances to load centers in large cities often runs into bottlenecks, leading to curtailment and scheduled blackouts.
A vast bulk of the large-scale solar projects are in the western, sunnier part of Texas, and are delivered to population centers in the east. The issue can be looked at as a microcosm of the entire United States, where legislators are suggesting building a transmission superhighway from the west to the eastern seaboard.
Congestion rents, or the cost of transmission services, are expected to worsen in many areas across ERCOT, despite hundreds of millions of dollars planned to build transmission to alleviate the congestion.
Solar and batteries can serve a critical role in alleviating this congestion, reducing renewables curtailment, smoothing the curve of wholesale market demand spikes, and providing critical backup power in times of crisis.
When located closer to load centers, or the location of energy demand, batteries can readily dispatch backup power. By locating the batteries as “nodes” further down the grid, pressure is taken off key bottlenecks like substations, which shut down in times of extreme peak demand, and are extremely expensive to upgrade.
Batteries can also serve as peak-demand shavers, avoiding those massive spikes in wholesale market volatility. This is the main way they are currently deployed in ERCOT, and peak demand shaving represents a massive market opportunity. At RE+ utility-scale solar and storage developer 8-minute energy shared that 95% of the revenue generated by a two-hour duration battery is earned in the first hour of dispatch. 8minute said the market opportunities for batteries could be improved, if “predefined revenue streams” are created, like in the capacity-based, forward looking market of California’s CAISO grid.
This article was amended on December 13, 2022 to reflect the fact that the four projects are each 9.9 MW, rather than a combined total of 9.9 MW as previously stated.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/08/brookfield-renewable-acquires-21-mw-community-solar-portfolio-in-maine/,"ACQUISITIONS,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MAINE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",Brookfield Renewable company acquires 21.6 MW community solar portfolio in Maine,"Luminace, a Brookfield Renewable Partners portfolio company, has reached an agreement to acquire a 21.6 MWdc portfolio of community solar projects in Maine from EDF Renewables North America.
The portfolio includes Overlook Solar (7.2 MW) in Bristol, Tower Solar (7.2 MW) in Embden, Maine, and Green Mile Solar (7.2 MW) in Woolwich, close to the coastal communities of Bath, Sebasco and Popham Beach, Maine.  The projects are estimated to reach commercial operation in 2023.
Discounted bill credits from the projects will be sold to 18 local municipalities, non-profits, and small businesses under Central Maine Power’s Net Energy Billing Program. This platform will allow many of the buyers to in some cases go 100% renewable through the purchase of RECs bundled with existing energy credits, while realizing significant savings on their utility bill over a 20-year term.
The three projects are expected to generate 27,600 MWh of low-carbon energy annually, enough to power 8,400 homes in Maine. This is equivalent to avoiding over 19,560 metric tons of carbon emissions annually which represents the greenhouse gas emissions from over 4,200 passenger vehicles driven over the course of one year.
“This latest acquisition is an important step in our growth strategy across the U.S. to bring clean energy solutions to our valued customers, as well as the evolving value propositions offered via Community Solar market expansion,” said Brendon Quinlivan, senior vice president of distributed generation at Luminace.
In 2019, the Maine Legislature passed distributed generation legislation to encourage the development of solar and small renewable projects in the state. The DG program calls for the procurement of a total of 375 MW of solar and small renewables resources by July 2024, through five separate procurement blocks. For projects awarded under the procurement, Maine’s electric utilities agree to enter into 20-year contracts at the contractual rate established for that particular block.
Maine has programs available that provide opportunities for residential and commercial customers to participate in community solar projects.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Maine ranks 32nd in the U.S. for solar capacity but deployed a record amount of new solar projects in 2021 with 289.3 MW of deployments. The state’s solar market saw $341 million of investments that year.
Earlier this week, Renewable Properties acquired a 40 MWdc Maine community solar portfolio from NextGrid, bringing its total Maine portfolio to over 42 MWdc in various stages of development.

Squad Mobility’s new car, the Squad solar electric vehicle, is a golf-cart-like battery-powered vehicle that can charge itself with sunlight.
Squad Mobility said the car has a 62-mile range on full battery charge, and it can source an average of about 12 miles per day from the sun with its built-in solar array. Squad is pricing its base model at $6,250.
The two-passenger vehicle has a solar roof and can also be charged via a 220 V port. It has two 2 kW motors, and swappable lithium-ion batteries. Each swappable battery in the Squad has a capacity of 1.6 kWh, adding up to 6.4 kWh max. The company said it will develop “Squad Battery Walls” with pre-charged swappable batteries for fleet managers.
Squad is designed for short trips, with compact and maneuverable design for navigating congested cities. It has removable doors for warmer climates.
The vehicle tops out at about 44 miles per hour, making it a city surface road navigator rather than a full-speed highway commuter. It measures 2 meters long, 1.2 meters wide, and 1.6 meters high, and has a 6-meter turning circle, creating a compact design for easy parking. The 770 lb. car has a full aluminum tubular roll cage and crash structures in the front and rear and holds up to 243 liters of storage.
“Combining low CAPEX and OPEX with the capability of remote diagnosis, SQUAD provides essential vehicle data 24/7 for efficient fleet management. Both the interior and exterior are easy to clean, while broken parts are easy to replace. The wheels act as natural bumpers, preventing damage to body parts. An extra option is the SQUAD battery wall for quickly changing and charging the batteries,” said Squad Mobility.
Production is scheduled to begin in 2023, with deliveries first starting in the Netherlands, and then moving east and south through Europe.

Battery storage capacity in the U.S. was negligible prior to 2020, at which point storage capacity began to ramp up. As of October 2022, 7.8 GW of utility-scale storage assets are operating, with 1.4 GW of additional capacity to be added by the end of 2022.
The EIA forecasts another 20.8 GW of battery storage capacity will be added from 2023 to 2025.
Growth in energy storage capacity is outpacing the pace of early growth of utility-scale solar. U.S. solar capacity began expanding in 2010 and grew from less than 1.0 GW in 2010 to 13.7 GW in 2015. In comparison, the EIA sees energy storage increasing from 1.5 GW in 2020 to 30 GW in 2025.

Energy storage adds stability to intermittent clean energy sources such as wind and solar. Batteries solve the intermittency problem by storing extra energy produced by wind or solar generators for use later in the day.
While it may come as no surprise, more than 75% of the 20.8 GW of new utility-scale battery capacity that developers plan to install from 2022 to 2025 is located in Texas (7.9 GW) and California (7.6 GW).
More utility-scale solar capacity is located in California than any other state, at 16.8 GW, and developers expect to add another 7.7 GW of solar generating capacity between 2023 and 2025, furthering the ramp up necessary for grid-scale storage solutions.
Another 10.5 GW of utility-scale solar capacity is located in Texas.  Lone Star state developers plan to install another 20.4 GW of solar capacity between 2023 and 2025.  Not to mention, Texas is home to 37.2 GW of wind power capacity, more than any other state, and developers expect to add 5.3 GW of new wind turbines over the next three years.
As more battery capacity becomes available, storage projects are becoming increasingly larger in capacity. Before 2020, the largest battery storage project was 40 MW. The 250 MW Gateway Energy Storage System in California, which began operating in 2020, marked the beginning of large-scale energy storage installations.
At present, the 409 MW Manatee Energy Storage in Florida is the largest operating battery storage project in the U.S. Developers have scheduled more than 23 grid-scale battery projects, ranging from 250 MW to 650 MW, to be deployed by 2025.
Funding for the massive energy storage roll out will come in part from the Inflation Reduction Act, which BloombergNEF states will drive the development of 30 GW (111 GWh) of energy storage capacity by 2030. The IRA stipulates $369 billion in clean energy investments, as well as 30% tax credit for energy storage systems.

Industrial Sun, a renewable energy and storage developer based in Austin, TX, specializes in serving high energy demand customers who need the energy for refineries, pumping and compression stations, manufacturing and/or processing plants, terminals, and data centers. The Industrial Sun team members have collectively delivered more than 6,000 MWac of power projects throughout the United States, with a heavy concentration in the ERCOT market.
The project has an expected interconnect capacity of 100 MWac, which will be installed in an area with little land suitable for development. The Erthos design is meant for such areas, as the company reports that its installations typically require less than 2.5 acres per MWac, compared to the usual 5 to 6 acres required by conventionally mounted solar.
What makes earth mount solar PV unique is that the solar arrays are mounted directly on the earth with no mounts or trackers below. While the design is unusual, the company announced the closing of a $17.5 million Series B funding round in March to scale up production. This follows a $7.4 million Series A in 2019, which launched the company and helped it finalize the earth-mount system architecture. It also funded the development of the autonomous cleaning robot, which drives over the surface of the panels to clean them, which is necessitated by having the solar modules so close to the ground.
“Erthos technology allows us to maximize our project capacity, particularly in those areas where our projects are land-constrained. Erthos is a very welcome solution for our business, and for any developer needing to up-size the capacity of their projects,” said Wade Gungoll, Managing Director of Industrial Sun.
The agreement with Industrial Sun is the company’s largest contract to date and follows a recent announcement by Erthos of a signed memorandum of understanding for a separate 107 MWdc project, as well as 14 MWdc of additional signed contracts.
“There’s no question that our business is continuing to accelerate,” said Charles Pimentel, chief commercial officer of Erthos. “That’s in large part because of our ability to deliver improved energy density, higher wind ratings, and short build times – and to do so at a lower cost.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/08/solar-performance-reduced-by-up-to-30-during-peak-wildfire-seasons-report-finds/,"RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA,OREGON,WASHINGTON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 8, 2022","Solar performance reduced by up to 30% during peak wildfire seasons, report finds","Smoke from California wildfires in September 2020 darkened the skies so much that it slashed the state’s solar power production during peak hours by 10% to 30%, according to the study Smoke from 2020 United States wildfires responsible for substantial solar energy forecast errors, conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and published in Environmental Research Letters.
It also means solar energy forecasts for several days had overestimated the amount of power that can be generated by solar modules for multiple days during wildfire season.
The study used advanced computer models of wildfire smoke patterns and meteorological conditions, as well as records of solar irradiance and energy production. Although previous research looked at the impact of 2020 wildfires on solar energy production, the new study is notable for using a specialized weather forecasting model, pointing the way to developing better systems to predict smoke impacts.
“The key takeaway from this research is that wildfire smoke can have a substantial and negative impact on solar production in areas near major wildfires,” said Timothy Juliano of NCAR, lead author of the report. “This is something that utilities should keep in mind when wildfires occur.”
The study was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, NCAR’s sponsor, as well as by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office.
The 2020 California wildfire season featured half of the 10 largest wildfires in the state’s history, including the August Complex, which set the state record by burning more than 1 million acres. In September, dry and windy conditions in California and much of the West were particularly conducive to wildfires, with satellites showing clear images of smoke plumes.
Juliano and his colleagues focused their study on smoke conditions from Sept. 7 to 16, 2020, when fires were peaking. To determine the amount of solar energy generated at various sites across the state, they drew on California Independent System Operator (CAISO) data.
The group compared energy output to the same period during the two previous years, when solar arrays produced far more energy. They also analyzed data from ground stations in California and elsewhere in the United States that measure solar radiation, or irradiance, minute by minute.
During days of heavy smoke, irradiance was sharply reduced and energy production plummeted 10% to 30% during otherwise daily peak solar generation time of noon to 4 p.m., compared with the same days in previous years.
On days when winds blew much of the smoke out of the region, such as occurred on Sept. 9 and between Sept. 12 and 16, solar production declined by just less than 7%.  Although scientists focused on areas in California near the fires, Juliano said other regions of the country where the smoke dispersed likely experienced a small decline in solar energy.
PV forecast improvement
The smoke significantly affected the accuracy of energy predictions in California. During the smokiest days, solar production averaged 27% less than forecast. It also fell to as much as 50% less than forecast during late afternoon and evening hours that coincide with the largest ramp-up in energy demand.
To determine if the forecasts can be improved, the scientists next turned to an NCAR-based model known as Weather Research and Forecasting-Solar, which enhances solar irradiance predictions. By inputting data about the smoke, including airborne particles such as aerosols, they were able to better approximate the magnitude and timing of solar irradiance.
The weather forecast model simulations were run on the Cheyenne supercomputer at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center.
Juliano concluded that wildfire activity seldom affects solar energy to the extent that it did in California in 2020.  But with wildfires becoming more common and smoke plumes sometimes extending over large swaths of the nation, the study concluded that scientists need to continue working to better predict smoke impacts — an effort that will require collaborations among experts in different disciplines, including fire behavior, weather, and renewable energy.
“Wildfire smoke can be quite an important factor in energy production,” Juliano said. “Given the increase in large wildfires and society’s greater reliance on solar energy, even regions far downwind of fires may need to consider the potential impacts of smoke.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/08/the-clock-is-ticking-on-the-iras-prevailing-wage-and-apprenticeship-requirements/,"EMPLOYMENT,GUEST POST,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",The clock is ticking on the IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements,"Renewable energy developers and contractors have been anticipating the Treasury Department and IRS’s initial guidance on what is required to satisfy the prevailing wage and apprentice requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). To take advantage of these tax incentives, renewable energy developers and contractors must ensure their projects meet certain requirements, including paying a “prevailing wage” to workers, employing certain percentages of apprentices, and maintaining required ratios through registered apprenticeship programs.
On November 30, 2022, this guidance was published in the Federal Register. Under the IRA, the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements go into effect sixty days after publication, which is January 29, 2023.
While this date is fast approaching, there is no need to panic yet. As an initial matter, the guidance confirmed that projects for which construction begins before January 30, 2023 will be exempt from prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and automatically qualify for the 30% investment tax credit. The guidance reaffirmed longstanding pre-IRS rules for determining when “construction begins” – either when physical work of a significant nature begins or, under the safe harbor, when 5% or more of the total cost of the project or facility is incurred subject to continuous construction or efforts requirements.
While many in the renewable energy industry hoped the guidance would provide much needed practical instructions and directives as to how to comply with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, it is largely a recitation of the IRA provisions themselves, and provides little clarity on implementation. However, the guidance does indicate that the Treasury and IRS may issue later regulations and additional guidance about the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
So, what does this initial guidance say?
Prevailing wage
The IRA states clearly that laborers and mechanics employed by the taxpayer (the owner of the project when placed in service) and all contractors and subcontractors engaged by the taxpayer must be paid prevailing wages of the locality for the specific profession and classification during construction, alteration, or repair of a covered facility.  “Employed” for purposes of prevailing wage requirements is broadly defined, and includes any individual who gets paid money for their services, regardless of whether the individual is an employee or independent contractor under the IRS or other traditional tests. Importantly, based on this initial guidance, and unlike the requirements of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA), the IRA does not appear to require certified payroll be submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) – but the guidance otherwise adopts the definitions of some fundamental terms including “wages,” “laborer,” and “construction” from the DBRA.
In describing how stakeholders will determine the applicable prevailing wage, the guidance directs taxpayers to wage determinations published by the U.S. Secretary of Labor at www.sam.gov. If a particular type of construction project, geographic area, job, or classification is not listed there, taxpayers are instructed to request a wage determination or rate from the DOL via email at IRAprevailingwage@dol.gov, making sure to provide enough information in the email (type of construction, geographic area, job description and duties) to assist the DOL in providing a determination. There is no indication in the guidance as to how much time the DOL will be given to respond, or whether there will be a deadline, nor is there indication as to whether the DOL’s judgment calls will be published for other taxpayers who may have similar requests.  It does not appear that the process will be as formal as the current Opinion Letter process, and the guidance does not contain the same advisement not to include privacy, trade secretion or confidential commercial information as it may be incorporated into the DOL’s response, which is made available to the public, as the Opinion Letter process dictates.
The guidance admonishes taxpayers to maintain scrupulous records to support or establish that prevailing wage requirements have been satisfied. Although it is unclear whether the records will be subject to an audit initiated by the DOL, developers and contractors should maintain sufficient records in the event of such audit – or more likely, an IRS audit of claimed tax credits.
Opportunity to cure prevailing wage shortfalls
Although the guidance does not expound on the topic, the text of the IRA itself allows a taxpayer to cure a failure to satisfy prevailing wages through catch up payments, with interest, to each worker paid below the prevailing wage and penalty payments to the IRS that amount to $5,000 per affected worker. Higher payments to workers (3x the difference between actual and prevailing wages) and higher penalties ($10,000 per affected worker) apply where the failure to pay prevailing wages is the result of an intentional disregard of the regulations and payments and penalties are due within 180 days of a violation determination.
This opportunity to cure is likely to be a key element of many project agreements during initial implementation of IRA prevailing wage requirements, as developers and contractors negotiate allocation of the risks around assumptions of wage rates prior to DOL determinations.
Apprenticeship
The apprenticeship provisions generally require (1) that a certain percentage of the total labor hours for construction, alteration or repair of a covered facility must be performance by qualified apprentices; (2) taxpayers (and their contractors and subcontractors) who employ 4 or more individuals must also employ at least 1 qualified apprentice; and (3) taxpayers must maintain the required ratio of journeymen to apprentices for the duration of the project.  The following journeyman to apprentice ratios apply based on when construction begins:
Notably, these percentages exclude management and administrative personnel (for example, foremen, superintendents, and owners or persons employed in bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity).
Like the prevailing wage provisions, “employ” under the apprenticeship requirements is broadly defined and means any individual who gets paid money for their services, regardless of whether the individual is an employee or independent contractor under the IRS or other traditional tests. And, consistent with the prevailing wage provisions, taxpayers are admonished to maintain sufficient records to support that apprenticeship requirements have been met or a good faith effort exception, as described in further detail below, applies.
The guidance further provides that to comply, taxpayers must employ apprentices through a “registered apprenticeship program” meaning one registered under the National Apprenticeship Act or by the DOL.  Thus, the taxpayer’s options for apprenticeship compliance are: (1) utilize an established state-registered apprenticeship program; (2) establish your own proprietary program that meets the necessary requirements; or (3) work with industry associations who have existing registered apprenticeship programs.
Good faith effort exception to apprenticeship requirements
A taxpayer will be deemed to have satisfied apprenticeship requirements if the taxpayer requests qualified apprentices from a registered program and receives either no response within five business days of receipt, or the request is denied if such denial is not the result of the taxpayer’s, or its contractors and subcontractors, refusal to comply with the standards of the registered apprentice program.
Overall, while this initial guidance starts the clock toward required compliance with IRA prevailing wage and apprenticeship provisions, it still leaves renewable energy developers and contractors with significant uncertainty in practical compliance.
Remaining uncertainties include:
As these requirements begin to go into effect, the renewable energy industry will be dependent upon DOL response times to fill in remaining compliance questions and gaps. And we can also expect additional, forthcoming regulations and guidance from Treasury and the IRS.
But for the time being, renewable energy developers and contractors should take note of the following practical points:
Now that initial guidance has been issued, renewable energy developers and contractors can put plans in place to implement appropriate structures for compliance with IRA prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Parties should pay particular attention to incorporation of these requirements in EPC and O&M agreements, as well as all downstream subcontracts. Sophisticated developers and contractors should create and implement compliance programs to ensure appropriate record-keeping to substantiate their payment of prevailing wages and use of appropriate apprenticeship programs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/08/new-jersey-boosts-solar-with-new-competitive-solar-incentive-program/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,NEW JERSEY",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",New Jersey boosts solar with new Competitive Solar Incentive program,"The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) established the Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI) program, a new program designed to encourage grid scale solar generation in the Garden State. CSI is a key part of the state’s Successor Solar Incentive initiative (SuSI), which was enacted by the board in 2021, and is expected to significantly increase the state’s solar program at a lower cost for ratepayers. The order states that the goal of the program is to “continue the fight against climate change by increasing the supply of electricity that New Jersey consumers receive from clean solar energy and to bring down the costs of solar generation in the state.
The new CSI program has a goal of incentivizing at least 300 MW of solar annually until 2026. The program will be open to qualifying grid supply solar installations and non-residential net metered solar installations with a capacity greater than 5 MW, as well as to eligible grid supply solar installations in combination with energy storage.
New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy has committed to 100% clean energy by 2050 and at least 50% Class I Renewable Energy Credits by 2030.
“The CSI program is a vital component of our new SuSI program and will play a major part in helping us meet our solar goals while decreasing costs to ratepayers,” said Joseph L. Fiordaliso, president of NJBPU. “Our growing solar program, which not only includes CSI and [Administratively Determined Incentive] ADI but also Community Solar, is one of the core programs in achieving Governor Murphy’s goal of a 100%  clean energy future.”
Over 6,000 people work in the solar industry in New Jersey, a state that currently has 4 GW of solar installed, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
“SEIA is pleased that the BPU took significant parts of the solar industry’s comments into account in its final design of the Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI) program,” said Sean Gallagher, vice president of state and regulatory affairs for SEIA. “The guidelines released today establish a competitive solicitation process for 300 megawatts (MW) of annual large-scale solar development in New Jersey, as well as targeted procurement of 160 MWh of energy storage paired with grid-scale solar per year.”

The order states that, “While the economic and environmental benefits of New Jersey’s first 4 GW of solar have been significant, the combined effect of the SuSI Program is expected to have an even larger impact.”
The new program structure has separate categories, or tranches, to ensure that a range of solar project types, including those on preferred sites, are able to participate despite potentially different project cost profiles. The board approved four tranches for grid supply and large net metered solar and an additional fifth tranche for storage in combination with grid supply solar.

After receiving an award in the solicitation, CSI projects will have three years to come on-line. The CSI program design has siting requirements that apply to all projects in the program, regardless of whether they actually seek an incentive. These requirements follow stipulations laid out in the Solar Act of 2021 and establish construction requirements designed to uphold the mandate to “minimize, as much as is practicable, potential adverse environmental impacts.”
“The structuring of the CSI program will ensure that a range of competitive solar project types can participate, despite potentially different project cost profiles,” said Gallagher. “SEIA and its members are evaluating the program’s construction and siting requirements, including new standards for pollinator-friendly ground-mounted projects and various land development restrictions. Establishing a workable siting process is critical for the solar industry to achieve the CSI program’s goal for 1,500 MW of large-scale solar capacity by the end of the decade.”
Solicitations will take place annually, and all projects that meet pre-qualification requirements will compete on price only. The first solicitation is scheduled to take place early 2023, with bids due on March 31, 2023.
In addition to CSI, the SuSI program consists of the ADI program, which set incentives for net-metered residential projects, net-metered non-residential projects of 5 MW or less, and community solar projects.
Once fully implemented, the Order states that the new SuSI Program “will be an important part of New Jersey’s continued national leadership in the battle against climate change and cement the State of New Jersey as a magnet for green jobs”.
