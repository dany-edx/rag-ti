Technology improvements and the resulting price declines already have rendered solar and wind generation resources the least-cost option in much of the U.S. During the next two to three years the accelerating shift will be transformative, the IEEFA said.
Solar plus storage is currently economically competitive, and costs are almost certain to decline.
“Hitting both the [DoE’s] solar and the long duration storage cost goals would be a game changer,” the report said.

To pull down storage costs, the Department of Energy (DOE) in December launched a storage challenge that set a goal of reaching a levelized cost of storage for long-duration stationary applications of $0.05/kWh by 2030. Using DOE’s own estimates, the report said this would represent a 90% cost reduction.
In February, the DOE added to that goal, setting its sights on pushing PV costs down to $0.03/kWh by 2025 and $0.02/kWh by 2030.
“Last year was definitely a breakout year for battery storage… but it’s just a harbinger of things to come,” said Dennis Wamstead, the IEEFA analyst who co-authored the 2021 outlook.
About 20,000 MW of new battery storage will probably be installed at utility installations around the country in the next four years. Battery storage passed the 1 GW marker for installed capacity last year.
According to the IEEFA’s report, coal’s days are numbered. “Even being among the best operating coal-fired generators doesn’t guarantee that a unit is financially viable or is the lowest-cost option for consumers,” it said.
On the natural gas side, the IEEFA said it expects project financing to become increasingly difficult to secure due to climate change concerns, a more progressive administration in the White House, and lingering overcapacity. The possibly that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will re-examine its current hands-off approach to approving new interstate gas pipelines also presents a threat to future gas generation proposals, it said.
In short, the rise in gas generation that occurred in the 2010s is pretty much over.
“Part of that is being driven by the rush to wind and solar, and part of that is being driven by the fact that there is an increasing emphasis on the environmental impacts of gas,” Wamstead said.
He said “it’s entirely possible”  that by the end of 2022 wind and solar by themselves will have caught up with coal. He said that by the end of this year, wind, solar, and hydro generation may well exceed coal’s contribution to the U.S. electricity market.
If the Biden administration pursues a 2035 carbon-neutral electricity grid with any success, “obviously that will change a lot of these forecasts,” he said.
For example, creating an investment tax credit (ITC) for energy storage or a technology-neutral tax credit that would apply equally across all forms of generation, and storage that lowers greenhouse gas emissions could also accelerate change. So, too, could the passage of several other bills in Congress, including one measure to incentivize domestic manufacturing of advanced energy technologies and another to create a transmission tax credit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/14/walmart-adds-6-5-mw-of-rooftop-and-canopy-parking-solar-to-california-stores/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 14, 2021",Walmart adds 6.5 MW of rooftop and canopy parking solar to California stores,"Sol Systems said it completed solar energy systems totaling 6.5 MW at seven Walmart stores in California.
The portfolio includes a mixture of solar energy systems installed on rooftops and parking lot carports. Total development cost was around $10 million, and Bank of America served as a tax equity partner. The retail outlets will take all of the energy. Interconnection approvals involved four separate utilities.
The fixed-axis solar arrays will power stores in Burbank, Calexico, North Highlands, Perris, Placerville, Sacramento, and Wasco. The portfolio was developed by Sol Customer Solutions, a unit of Sol Systems, a joint-venture with global infrastructure investment firm Capital Dynamics. REC was the construction subcontractor. Trina supplied the modules and the inverters were sourced from CPS.
The projects began construction in 2020. Sol Systems said it developed and financed more than 200 MW of solar energy last year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/14/hawaii-lawmakers-vote-to-slash-solar-credits-as-the-state-looks-to-prop-up-its-budget/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,HAWAII",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 14, 2021",Hawaii lawmakers vote to slash solar credits as the state looks to prop up its budget,"State senators in Hawaii voted April 13 on a bill to cut the cap for residential solar tax credits from $5,000 to $2,500. The bill also cuts the cap for commercial property owners from $500,000 to $250,000.
Solar advocates said the measure will hurt the state’s economy and make it harder to achieve its clean energy goals.
A Senate committee added language to cut the renewable energy credit to an unrelated film tax credit bill, House Bill 1174. Solar advocates said the language was added without notice or outreach to Hawaii’s clean energy sector.
“Now is not the time just as we are trying to pull ourselves off the mat from the Covid- 19 pandemic,” Rocky Mould, executive director of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association, was quoted as saying.
Solar installation companies employ about 2,500 people statewide, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The state has around 1,400 MW of installed solar capacity, which accounts for around 15% of the state’s electricity demand.
The vote in the state Senate comes as lawmakers look to bolster the state budget. Tax revenues have fallen during the pandemic. Mould said the state would gain about $18 million in tax revenue by cutting the solar benefit, but added that the taxable economic activity from rooftop PV “far exceeds this amount.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/14/sunrise-brief-xcel-energy-files-plans-for-a-460-mw-solar-plant-in-minnesota/,"BATTERY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 14, 2021",Sunrise brief: Xcel Energy files plans for a 460 MW solar plant in Minnesota,"Xcel Energy filed plans with Minnesota regulators to build a $575 million, 460 MW solar project next to the company’s existing Sherco coal-fired power plant.
The solar plant would help replace some capacity lost through the retirement of the utility’s three Sherco coal generators. The utility also has proposed building a 750 MW gas-fired power plant at Sherco later this decade. That plan that has drawn fire from environmental and clean energy groups.
If approved, the solar facility would start construction in 2022 and enter service in 2024. It would be developed by Xcel and National Grid Renewables, and Xcel would own and operate the plant.
Reports said that Xcel’s largest single-site solar plant in Minnesota is the North Star project, with a capacity of 100 MW. The state’s largest source of solar power is its Community Solar Garden program, which has 789 MW of capacity across 400 sites.
Pacific Gas and Electric launched its Community Microgrid Enablement Program to help communities identify, design and build permanent, multi-customer microgrids serving critical facilities and vulnerable customer groups.
The program was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission in March. As part of the program, PG&E will provide technical and financial support for qualifying projects in areas with the greatest energy resilience needs.
Prioritized projects will be those that serve disadvantaged communities, critical facilities such as hospitals, and areas with a higher likelihood of Public Safety Power Shutoffs or other power outage events, as well as projects with higher levels of renewable energy.
The first project under the program is the Redwood Coast Airport Renewable Energy Microgrid, a collaboration among PG&E, the Redwood Coast Energy Authority, Schatz Energy Research Center at Humboldt State University, Humboldt County, and Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, among others.
The Redwood microgrid will include 250 kW net metered system to offset daily electricity usage at the airport, 2 MW of wholesale power that will feed clean energy directly into the grid, 2 MW battery storage system providing 8 MWh of energy storage, a microgrid controller providing the ability to island from the main grid, and electric vehicle charging stations capable of demand response
The Redwood facility is under construction and scheduled to enter service in December.
A report from the Energy Department’s Berkeley National Laboratory said that the power sector is halfway to being carbon free.
It said that 17 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have adopted laws or executive orders to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity in the coming decades. In addition, 46 U.S. utilities have pledged to go carbon free no later than 2050.
The report said that its review of the past 15 years in the electricity sector shows that large emission reductions are possible. The study, “Halfway to Zero: Progress towards a Carbon-Free Power Sector,” looks back at the 2005 Annual Energy Outlook from the Energy Information Administration.
It found that business-as-usual projections saw annual carbon dioxide emissions rising from 2,400 to 3,000 million metric tons (MMT) from 2005 to 2020. Actual 2020 emissions fell to 1,450 MMT. That meant the U.S. cut power sector emissions by 52% below projected levels, leading the report’s authors to say the power sector is now halfway to zero.
The study said that over the 15-year period, total consumer electricity costs were 18% lower; costs to human health and the climate were 92% and 52% lower, respectively; and the number of jobs in electricity generation was 29% higher.
Battery recycling company Li-Cycle Corp. said it will build its third commercial lithium-ion battery recycling facility near Phoenix.
When complete, Li-Cycle’s “Spoke 3” facility will be capable of processing up to 10,000 tons of end-of-life batteries and battery manufacturing scrap per year, bringing Li-Cycle’s total recycling capacity to 20,000 tons per year.
The company has locations in Rochester, New York, and Kingston, Ontario. The Arizona facility is part of Li-Cycle’s goal to build 20 Spokes globally over the next five years. The Phoenix area is close to Li-Cycle’s existing battery supply network, and near the center of expected growth in volume of batteries available for recycling.
The facility’s production line will be able to process electric vehicle packs without dismantling. It converts battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries into products including “black mass”, a powder substance containing a variety of metals, including lithium, cobalt, and nickel.
The Spokes will supply black mass to Li-Cycle’s future North American hub, which is currently in late-stage development in Rochester. The hub will then process black mass to produce battery-grade materials, including lithium carbonate, cobalt sulphate, and nickel sulphate, as well as other recycled materials. The company said its process has a recovery rate of up to 95% resource mass recovery.
In February, Li-Cycle said it would merge with Peridot Acquisition Corp., a deal that is set to close in the second quarter.
