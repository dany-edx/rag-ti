The funds were provided by the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program. Established in 2007, the program has loaned over $8 billion for projects that have supported the production of more than 4 million advanced technology vehicles.
The facility, called the KOREPlex, is a 1.3 million square foot site with multiple production lines for both advanced battery cells for transport and larger grid-scale batteries, using both nickel manganese cobalt and lithium ferro-phosphate batteries. The site is located in the greater Phoenix, Arizona area.
“The administration is taking advantage of the resources we provided through the Inflation Reduction Act to not just boost jobs in Arizona, but also to strengthen our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign sources of battery components for everything from electric vehicles to energy storage,” said Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.
When the initial lines are fully operational, the factory will have an annual production capacity of 6 GWh of battery cells, and may be expanded to 12 GWh to meet rising demand. The facility is expected to begin delivering product by the end of 2024 or early 2025.
The construction of the KOREPlex, which began civil works late last year, is expected to create 700 jobs. The facility itself is expected to create 1,250 direct jobs when operating at capacity. The company is also is working with local colleges and universities in Arizona to establish training initiatives and programs for the factory’s workforce.
“We are focused on building a facility where American workers will build the battery cells that power our energy and mobility future,” said Lindsay Gorrill, Founder and chief executive officer, Kore Power. “Domestic manufacturing will unlock the benefits of clean energy investments for U.S. workers across the supply chain.”
In November 2022, Kore Power announced a $75 million equity investment for the Arizona facility, led by Siemens Financial Services and utility contractor Quanta Services.
In late 2022 BloombergNEF forecast a 30% compound annual growth rate in the energy storage market. Similarly, electrification in the mobility sector, which includes electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, is experiencing rapid growth with EV sales up 60% year over year.
Also in late 2022, American Battery Factory, a Utah-based manufacturer of lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) battery cells, announced it will build its first gigafactory in Tucson, Arizona, with 2 million square feet of production space.
The company’s landmark site will involve a $1.2 billion capital investment, start with 300 first phase employees and scale up to 1,000 cumulative jobs over time, bringing $3.1 billion in economic impact to the state.
Elsewhere, in South Carolina, battery technology provider AESC announced a 1.5 million square foot facility to produce EV batteries for BMW. Slated for commercial operations in 2026, the facility is expected to provide over 1,170 jobs and produce 30 GWh of capacity. 
The American Clean Power Association said in the first eight months following the passage of IRA, 46 clean energy manufacturing facilities were announced, bringing an expected 18,000 or more U.S. jobs, with more announcements rolling in week after week.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/09/california-grid-falls-21-short-in-100-ev-usage-case/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 9, 2023",California grid may fall 20% short in meeting 100% EV goal,"The State of California could fall 21.1% short of the electricity demand required to meet the most populous U.S. state’s bold goal of its consumer and commercial transportation fleet becoming powered entirely by electric vehicles (EV).
That shortcoming is detailed in a report by the Pacific Research Institute, a Sacramento-based nonprofit and think tank formed in 1979.
In September 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order requiring all new passenger cars and commercial light trucks sold in California to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. In August 2022, the California Air Resources Board or CARB approved the governor’s mandate, setting the state on a bold mission to supply clean energy into the grid to power its 40 million residents’ homes, businesses as well as vehicular fleet.
After the CARB vote, grid operator the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) then sent a dispatch called the Flex Alert to the state’s EV drivers to request that they refrain from charging their vehicle during the peak evening hours of 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Pacific time. CAISO then expanded its memo to request homeowners curtail the use of household appliances like washer and dryers at the same time.
“California’s green energy mandates will require families and businesses to consume more energy from the electricity grid instead of fossil fuels, making it less likely that we can generate the necessary power,” said Dr. Wayne Winegarden and Kerry Jackson, the authors of the PRI report. “These policies jeopardize California’s energy security and, without a miracle leap in technology, set us up for future energy shortages.”
Assuming all other residential electricity consumption remains flat—a trend ongoing since 2006—PRI’s calculations find that California will require a 20.2% expansion of electricity generation, from nearly 280 TWh to an estimated over 336 TWh to meet its EV mandates and additional residential electric charging required by 2045.
The report highlights California’s phase out of nuclear and natural gas, among other fossil fuel facilities, is the leading source of the state’s 21.1% deficit of power generation to demand by 2045.
The PRI report, titled “Sapping California’s Energy Future,” explores how implementing the EV mandate combined with other state green mandates will create avoidable energy shortages. Analyzing state data and conducting their own calculations, PRI found that:
Winegarden and Jackson suggest that California should repeal its green mandates and instead promote market-based climate change policies. They conclude that Sacramento should embrace technologies that are efficient today and will promote the innovations required to secure a low-emission energy system.
“Energy policy should not be crafted based on the whims of a few hundred policymakers who want to design the future,” said Winegarden and Jackson. “Sacramento must prioritize promoting innovation to meet California’s clean energy goals while keeping energy abundant and affordable.”
According to the PRI’s chart below, referencing the state’s energy department data from 2021, the state continues to import 30% of its energy needs from neighboring states. With baseload generation from remaining nuclear, gas and coal resources to be shut down by 2045, the state will still fall short of meeting demand forecasts.
Renewable sources are defined as biomass, solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal, fuel cells and hydro generation of 30 MW or less, plus renewable natural gas, solid waste conversion and tidal energy.
Of the favored energy sources, solar and wind generation are the only growth sources in California. Geothermal, hydro, and bioenergy have been in overall decline over the past two decades. In practice, solar and wind will need to generate nearly all the renewable power for the state’s energy transition.
With sufficient energy storage included, the excess electricity generation that occurs on sunny and windy days can be stored. For California, CAISO estimates that meeting its 2045 objective  requires 37 GW of energy storage, 4 GW of long-duration storage, over 53 GW of utility solar, 2 GW of geothermal, and over 24 GW of wind turbines, split between in and out-of-state wind power. Total renewable generation capacity needed by 2045 is 120.8 GW, PRI reports.
EV surge imbalance
Based on EV data from Pew Research and CarInsurance.com, PRI said that by 2035 there will be 13.4 million EVs on California’s roads, which is similar to CalMatters’ estimate of 12.5 million EVs by 2035.
Continuing through 2045, there will be 21.8 million EVs in the state. Charging these EVs will require a 21-fold increase in the amount of electricity, from an estimated 2.75 TWh in 2022 to an estimated 59.3 TWh in 2045. Since the 2.75 TWh of electricity used to charge EVs in 2022 is already accounted for, meeting California’s current EV mandates requires an additional 56.5 TWh of electricity over the current electricity consumption projections timeframe, as seen in Table 1 above.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/09/terrepower-opens-solar-remanufacturing-facility-to-refurbish-and-reuse-solar-and-batteries/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TENNESSEE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 9, 2023",TerrePower opens solar remanufacturing facility to refurbish and reuse solar and batteries,"TerrePower’s remanufacturing facility is up and running in a  20,000 square foot facility in Sparta, Tenn., where the company says it will refurbish solar modules and EV batteries for re-use.
“The holy grail of responsible resource management has always prioritized reuse over recycling,” said Duncan Gillis, chief executive officer of BBB Industries. “We are selling every solar panel we can remanufacture and expect to triple the size of our solar panel remanufacturing business in the next two years.”
Established in 2021, TerrePower is incorporating BBB Industries’ global automotive aftermarket experience by remanufacturing used solar panels to enable them to be sold as a more affordable solution for commercial or residential installation, or replacement use. TerrePower recycles materials from panels and EV batteries it cannot remanufacture and enables the reuse of raw materials to avoid landfill disposal. The company reports that remanufacturing used panels can cut carbon emissions by about 35% over original production.
“We apply over 30 years of remanufacturing experience to our solar panels, which can provide a high-quality alternative source to new (panels),” said John Boyer, president of TerrePower. “In many cases, we can use newer, superior components.”
In its battery remanufacturing process, TerrePower identifies weak battery pack components and replaces them with tested components to improve performance for vehicle reuse. Underperforming battery modules that can no longer be used in vehicles are repurposed into less energy demanding stationary energy storage units for a second life.
TerrePower is embracing the opportunity to recycle the expected surge of retired modules in the fast-growing U.S. solar industry. Solar modules have a typical lifespan of 25 to 30 years. The company believes that their reuse can decrease supply-chain dependence on imports, and lower costs for solar and other manufacturers.
To build a truly sustainable facility, TerrePower installed second-life solar panels on its Tennessee facility, meeting an average of 39% of its monthly power needs. The onsite solar facility reduces the plant’s scope 2 emissions, avoiding over 22 metric tons of emissions, the equivalent of taking 655,000 miles off the road from cars or avoiding the emissions of 50 homes’ electricity for a whole year. Furthermore, the panels are directly connected to a sustainably manufactured energy storage system made of second-life EV batteries.
TerrePower also manufactures both EV batteries and solar power systems under the Ontility brand, including modules and inverters. The company is ramping up its EV operations across plants in four U.S. states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/09/oregon-3-2-mw-community-solar-project-to-test-goat-grazing-for-mowing/,"COMMUNITY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,OREGON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 9, 2023",Oregon 3.2 MW community solar project to test goat grazing for mowing,"A southern Oregon town located due west of Crater Lake National Park nestled between two coastal mountain lines is procuring community solar for its residents.
Project developer and investor SolRiver Capital is helping the town of Myrtle Creek offset its carbon emissions and save money on electricity through the Canyonville Solar project, a 3.2 MW community solar project. Now the site owner is testing several shared land use cases for agrivoltaics, which is the siting of solar projects with agriculture growing or animal raising.
In addition to being the first community solar project in Douglas County under the state’s utility-run Oregon Community Solar Program, energy produced from the project will be made available to residents who don’t own their own home, such as renters and local small business owners.
Canyonville Solar uses single-axis trackers and is expected to produce 5.85 million kWh of clean power upon completion in early 2024. The project is located in PacifiCorp’s southern Oregon service territory. The project is not currently accepting new subscriptions though Sulus Solar is managing subscription intake for the site.
Traditionally, community solar has been made available to utility ratepayers whose home may not be suitable for rooftop solar arrays, as well as low-and-moderate income households without the financial means to procure residential solar otherwise.
Canyonville Solar is forecast to provide 9.77 cents per kWh of bill credit value to subscribers at a cost of 8.8 cents/kWh, providing $78 in first-year savings to enrollees under the program. Enrollment requires a 20-year contract for residents seeking to add community solar savings, according to the Oregon Community Solar Program. Low-income residents whose individual annual income is $41,688 or less, or a family of four’s collective household income is $80,168 or less, can enroll in projects such as Canyonville.
Canyonville Solar is also unique for its initial use of goat grazers for mowing, in addition to other grazing animals. At the inaugural Solar Farm Summit, an agrivoltaics conference held in Rosemont, Ill., experts in solar grazing suggested a best practice of using sheep on solar sites, versus goats, which as goats have developed a bad image for being less cooperative on sites.
Caleb Scott, owner of United Agrivoltaics and vice president of the American Solar Grazing Association, said goats can be unruly on solar projects and are not as great of an operations and maintenance tool compared to sheep grazers. Goats have been known to chew wire harnessing on PV projects and require additional monitoring, he said at the Solar Farm Summit.
Various goat species have been less than ideal partners for weeding and onsite mowing solutions on community solar projects, whereas sheep require very little oversight other than a canine shepherd to navigate herds across multi-hundred acre sites throughout the day, Scott and other panelists said at the recent conference.
SolRiver Capital said the Canyonville project is testing several agrivoltaics solutions on the Douglas County site including:
Founded in 2016, Denver-based SolRiver Capital is a distributed generation project developer and third-party investor that has funded more than $400 million into more than 60 MW of small-scale solar projects in over 12 states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/09/off-grid-solar-kit-with-quick-swap-modular-batteries/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 9, 2023",Off-grid solar kit with quick-swap modular batteries,"Runhood, based in California, is a new entrant to the off-grid and portable solar plus batteries market, a market with many participants.
What makes Runhood’s offering unique is its design built around external swappable batteries. The batteries can be linked together in the company’s power bank, or removed to operate independently, charging and discharging with USB or AC adapters. This design offers a lot of flexibility for off-grid adventures and can lessen the load of carrying a heavy battery bank.
The external batteries can be directly connected to the portable solar array, meaning one modular battery can be charged while the others remain in the power bank, supplying electricity to various off grid appliances and devices. Runhood said up to 9 devices can be powered at once with its kit.
The company currently offers a 600 W power bank option with two battery slots and said it has plans for a larger four-slot 1200 W design in the future. The 600 W kit offers 1295 Wh of capacity across four battery modules and is rated at 110 V.
The 600 W battery bank weighs about 17 lbs. when loaded with two swappable batteries. A 120 W car charger cable, an AC connector, USB connector, and a solar panel connector are all included in the kit.
When the modular battery units are individually connected with the AC connector, they function as a mini 80 W / 324 Wh portable power station. When connected with the DC connector in the power bank housing, the battery units transform into a more powerful 90000 mAh power bank with two standard 100 W outlets and two USB 3.0 outlets.
Also included in the kit is a foldable mini solar array with a max power of 100 W. The device carries 18 V, 5.5 A working current, and is IPX6 rated for water resistance. The panel can charge the bank alone or be paired with a second panel for boosted capacity.
Compare the Runhood kit to other products released by some of the market’s major players: Growatt, Generac, and the Jackery.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/09/usda-offers-tool-to-help-rural-co-ops-apply-for-9-7-billion-renewables-program/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 9, 2023",USDA offers tool to help rural co-ops apply for $9.7 billion renewables program,"Rural electric co-operatives seeking federal grant and loan support for renewable and clean energy projects must compete against each other under a $9.7 billion U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) program, said Chris McLean, Assistant Administrator of USDA’s Rural Utilities Service, during a webinar. The Rural Utilities Service is in charge of the program, known as New ERA.
The program seeks to achieve the “greatest reduction in CO2, methane and nitrous oxide emissions,” McLean said, quoting from the Inflation Reduction Act’s section 22004 that created the program. In selecting grantees, the program will evaluate the emissions reductions proposed by rural co-ops in their applications, as co-ops compete against other co-ops of similar size.
To enable the comparison across co-ops, a key part of a co-op’s preliminary application for grant and loan support is its calculation of the emissions reductions that its project, or portfolio of projects, will achieve. To ensure that each co-op calculates emissions reductions in the same way, USDA has provided a spreadsheet workbook called the Achievable Reduction Tool, and has created four template versions to reflect four possible types of applications.
Rural electric co-ops may apply for grant and loan support to purchase renewable energy, renewable systems, zero-emission, carbon capture and storage systems. A grant may cover no more than 25% of the project cost, while a low-interest loan may cover the rest.
Beyond reducing emissions, proposed projects will be evaluated based on customer benefit in terms of lower costs for customers, the project cost per unit of greenhouse gas reductions, project costs relative to program funding, and the geographic distribution of all projects, McLean said.
The application window for a preliminary application, known as a letter of interest, will be open from July 31 through August 31. USDA plans to make available a template letter of interest on the program’s website, and to offer webinars describing the electronic submission process.
Detailed information on the program’s application requirements is provided in a notice of funding opportunity. USDA has also provided answers to frequently asked questions. The Department plans to make available a recording of the webinar on its website next week.
“One of the reasons we’re able to operate our loan program at a very affordable rate for our U.S. taxpayers,” said McLean, is that the Rural Utilities Service has “a really strong repayment record. And that’s partly backed by the strong collateral that we have behind our loans.”
McLean said that loan amounts could be made available upfront with system financing, in which a co-op uses the collateral of its existing system—an approach that USDA has used since the 1930s. Or a co-op could use a completed project as collateral for a USDA loan, after building the project using funding from an interim financer. USDA will also consider “stranded asset refinancing—the ability to release funds in order to create those resources that you need to invest in new, eligible clean energy sources,” McLean said.
USDA plans to invite, from October to November, “competitive” preliminary applicants to file a full application. Awards from the New ERA program will be made from December 2023 through December 2026, and all funds will be disbursed by September 30, 2031.
