The new 3 GW facility will produce TOPCon PV-silicon cell technology and the Maxeon’s proprietary shingled-cell Performance Line solar modules.
The company said the facility will produce millions of solar modules each year for the growing utility-scale and distributed-generation markets in the U.S.
“I am proud to welcome Maxeon Solar Technologies’ first U.S.-based manufacturing facility to New Mexico,” said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. “This private investment shows how our state programs, paired with President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, have charted a path for New Mexico as a leader in growing the clean energy economy and creating a strong workforce for the future.”
Total investment of the project is expected to be over $1 billion, Maxeon reports, and is subject to a successful financial close under the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program. Maxeon is currently in the due diligence stage of its loan application and site selection is an important milestone in completing this process with DOE’s Loan Programs Office.
“Thanks to the support of the Biden administration, the U.S. is now poised to re-shore and scale up a domestic solar supply chain,” said Bill Mulligan, Maxeon CEO.  “We see tremendous opportunity to help the country advance its clean energy agenda while generating strong local economic impact.”
Maxeon selected a 160-acre site located in the community of Mesa Del Sol, and it will include solar cell fabrication, panel assembly, a warehouse, and administrative offices. Maxeon reports that its new plant is expected to be the first large-scale cell and module manufacturing in New Mexico. While 3 GW is the planned capacity, the company said there’s a chance it will increase it to 4.5 GW in the future.
Maxeon expects to begin construction in the first quarter of 2024, with factory ramp-up to commence in 2025. The company currently has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Malaysia and the Philippines.
Once complete, Maxeon estimates the Albuquerque facility will create up to 1,800 jobs, including highly skilled manufacturing and engineering jobs, and produce millions of solar panels each year for the U.S. market. The New Mexico facility expands
“The Inflation Reduction Act has catalysed a new chapter in America’s energy transition. Our new solar cell and panel facility in New Mexico is an ambitious and concrete response to the need to decarbonize the U.S. economy while creating permanent highly skilled local manufacturing and engineering jobs,” Mulligan added. “We expect the new plant will also serve as an anchor to attract further regional investment in the solar supply chain. We are proud to be bringing U.S.-developed technologies back home and to contribute to the reshoring of a domestic solar supply chain.”
The company’s Performance line of solar modules leverage Maxeon’s shingled cell technology, originally developed by SunPower. The technology is protected by 83 granted patents. The 425 W modules use bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large-format eight-inch G12 wafers, and have an efficiency of 20.6%, according to Maxeon.
Maxeon was spun off from SunPower in 2020, when both became separate entities. TotalEnergies owns a minority interest in Maxeon. The company is based in Singapore but lists shares on the NASDAQ Capital Markets exchange, where it currently trades at $23.13 per share today, The company has approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, based in Mexico (39%), Malaysia (33%) and the Philippines (20%)..

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/10/edf-places-order-for-up-to-7-gw-of-u-s-made-canadian-solar-modules/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 10, 2023",EDF places order for up to 7 GW of U.S.-made Canadian Solar modules,"Canadian Solar Inc. and EDF Renewables North America signed a multi-year module supply agreement for up to 7 GW of high efficiency N-type TOPCon solar modules to be produced at Canadian Solar’s new factory in Mesquite, Texas.
Under the agreement, Canadian Solar will be supplying its latest high efficiency N-Type TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) solar modules to support EDF Renewables’ project pipeline in the U.S. between 2024 and 2030.
Canadian Solar announced that production in its first U.S. factory was set to begin in late June. With a planned output of 20,000 modules per day, it expects annual production capacity to total 5 GW.  The facility represents a $250 million capital investment in a U.S. manufacturing facility, one of the many announcements in clean energy manufacturing over the past 10 months following the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Canadian Solar is one of the largest global suppliers of TOPCon.solar cell technology. This technology has among the highest efficiencies in the commercial PV market and has high degrees of bifaciality, absorbing and converting light from both sides of the module. Canadian Solar reports that TOPCon has conversion efficiencies of up to 22.5%, a low temperature coefficient of -0.30%/degrees C, low LID (light induced degradation) resulting in a low power degradation.
“The module supply agreement demonstrates our commitment to domestic sourcing and represents a pivotal step for EDF Renewables, enabling us to achieve key milestone dates and execute a schedule for the construction of our robust solar pipeline,” said Tristan Grimbert, president and CEO of EDF Renewables North America. “We are genuinely excited about our capacity to develop and build solar projects utilizing ‘Made-in-USA’ solar modules aligning with IRA guidelines.”
EDF Renewables is a North American renewable energy developer with16 GW of wind, solar and storage projects developed and 13 GW under service contracts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/10/promoting-electrification-without-penalizing-efficiency-an-alternative-to-the-income-graduated-fixed-charge-proposal/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CALIFORNIA",,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Promoting electrification without penalizing efficiency,"An income graduated fixed charge (IGFC) has been suggested as a way to promote electrification. It would lower the energy charge by 22%, which certainly would encourage electrification if nothing else was changed. But the reduction in the energy charge would be accompanied by the imposition of a substantial fixed charge. In the case of PG&E, that would average out to $53 a month. This is almost five times higher than the national average of $11 a month measured across 173 investor-owned utilities. It’s also worth noting that today PG&E has no fixed charge, just a minimum bill of $10 a month.
To make the rate shock politically palatable, the IGFC would collect a lower fixed charge from low income customers and a higher fixed charge from middle income and higher income customers.
There are at least five problems with the IGFC. First, a high fixed charge is antithetical to the concept of demand flexibility, which requires dynamic rate designs. Second, such a fixed charge is higher than any found in the US. It does reflect what are usually regarded as fixed costs of serving a customer – metering, billing and customer care. The median fixed charge among investor-owned utilities is around $12. A $53 fixed charge is without precedent. Third, income data is confidential and attempts to retrieve it via a third party will be difficult to administer and additionally will be challenged in court.
Fourth, in any given year, less than 10% of the customers are in the market for buying a new HVAC system or a new car. The other 90% of customers will simply be given an incentive to waste electricity. This proposal will reverse decades of progress the state has made in energy efficiency. Furthermore, simply lowering the energy rate will do little to encourage load flexibility, a stated objective of the CPUC proceeding. In fact, the insertion of a substantial fixed charge will remove the incentive to change the usage pattern.
Fifth, the CPUC is focused on promoting heat pumps and electric vehicles (EVs). Not only are these technologies expensive to buy; they often require an expensive upgrade of the main panel in the house. Recent data indicates that EVs accounted for 25% of new car sales in California. That’s happening despite California’s exceptionally high electric rates. The primary reason for the adoption of EVs by Californians is that gasoline cars cost two to three times more to drive than EVs because gasoline is very expensive in the state.
The main barrier to EV penetration is not high electric rates. It’s a variety of other barriers, such as range anxiety, high price, and limited model availability. None of these will be addressed by IGFC. Low income customers will be better off with IGFC but their savings will not be large enough to motivate them to buy a heat pump or an EV.
The IGFC is infeasible and unlikely to help the state meet its Net Zero goal. There’s a better way to promote electrification. Here is an outline.
First, only apply the new rate (described below) to customers who are either in the market for replacing their HVAC system, water heater, stove, clothes dryer or their car or those who are building a new house or buying an additional car. Leave all other customers on existing rates.
Second, even for customers who are in the market, only apply it to the incremental use of electricity which will occur via electrification. In other words, don’t incentivize waste for existing technologies.
Third, only include an energy price in the new rate and make sure it varies by time of day, and possibly varies across day types. Set the price equal to marginal energy cost. It will help promote demand flexibility, which is the title of the proceedings.
Some will object, saying this proposal cannot be implemented. In fact, it can be implemented with information that utilities already possess.
Utilities have hourly load profiles on every customer who has a smart meter. No separate meters will be required. They will know when the load profile changes significantly, which will happen when the customer acquires a heat pump or an EV.
Additionally, utilities will know which customer has installed a heat pump because they will apply for a rebate from the utility. Utilities also know (or will soon come to know) which customer has an EV.
Under this new rate design, customers will only see a change in their bill if they electrify. Millions of existing customers live in small homes or are singles or couples. They also include families who are frugal, energy efficient and they include a million customers who have installed solar panels on their roofs. If the IGFC is implemented, they will be victims of rate shock and will revolt. Under this new rate design, they will not be hit with rate shock.
At the same time, everyone will be incentivized to electrify because they will pay a significantly lower rate for the new electrotechnologies. For example, a PG&E customer who is currently paying 34 cents a kWh may end up paying only a dime a kWh for powering their new electrotechnologies.
Even those who don’t electrify will win because the state’s climate will improve as harmful emissions are reduced. California will reach its net zero goal much faster than would otherwise be the case. Customers who electrify will lower their bills at the margin. Utilities will recover their fixed costs just as they do now, since the existing rate design will apply to existing electric usage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/10/retired-coal-plant-to-be-running-on-100-hydrogen-by-2045/,"HYDROGEN,UTAH",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Retired coal plant to be running on 100% hydrogen by 2045,"Two Mitsubishi Power advanced-class gas turbines were delivered to the Intermountain Power Project Renewed (IPP Renewed) facility in Delta, Utah, marking a significant milestone in the project’s development, according to Mitsubishi and the Intermountain Power Agency.
The 694,000 pound turbines, which were manufactured in Takasago, Japan, arrived at the facility on June 8 and July 21. With their delivery, “the IPP Renewed project is well on its way to becoming a beacon of innovation, paving the way for a cleaner, dispatchable energy footprint in the region,” said Cameron Cowan, general manager of Intermountain Power Agency. 
IPP Renewed is a sweeping project that involves the retirement of a coal plant that currently exists on the site, to be replaced with new natural gas generating units that are also capable of running on hydrogen. The upgrade will modernize the transmission system that links the project to Southern California, and build out hydrogen production and storage capacity. The new facility will eventually use renewable energy to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, which will be stored in underground salt caverns, until needed to run turbines and generate electricity. 
The IPP Renewed project is expected to come into operation in 2025 with a 30% hydrogen fuel blend, with the eventual aim of ramping that up to 100% hydrogen by 2045. The project will provide 840 MW of net generation output and its developers expect that the blend of natural gas and hydrogen will reduce carbon emissions by more than 75% of its current operations. 
The project “demonstrates that bringing together the right partners with the right capabilities supports essential renewable energy infrastructures emergence and moves the country further along the path to net-zero emissions,” said Bill Newsom, president and CEO of Mitsubishi Power Americas.
The turbines are major components of the IPP Renewed project, and their on-time deliveries are allowing construction to continue on schedule, said John Ward, a spokesman for the Intermountain Power Agency. While the turbines are commercially guaranteed for 30% hydrogen blending at start-up, achieving 100% hydrogen by 2045 is a goal that will require additional technology developments that are under way, according to Ward. 
Mitsubishi Power has also partnered with Magnum Development to build an advanced clean energy storage project, called the ACES Delta hub, next to the IPP project. The facility will use electrolyzers, powered by renewable energy, to produce hydrogen that will then be stored in two underground salt caverns, each with an estimated capacity of 150,000 MWh. It will feed hydrogen to the IPP Renewed project. 
Last June, the ACES project received a $504.4 million loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy, the first for a new clean energy technology issued by the agency’s Loan Programs Office since 2014. 
Both the IPP Renewed and ACES Delta construction processes are on schedule and anticipated to enter commercial service in mid-2025, Ward said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/10/scientists-explore-aquatic-effects-of-floating-solar/,"RESEARCH,NEW YORK",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Scientists explore aquatic effects of floating solar,"As more states adopt green energy solutions to power skylines and public transportation, stakeholders continue to explore solar infrastructure options that won’t exacerbate (or introduce) damage to natural habitats and wildlife.  
A group of researchers at Cornell University are exploring one such solution: preserving land for agriculture and wildlife by placing floating photovoltaic (PV) panels on lakes rivers and reservoirs. 
Since the middle of June, Cornell and U.S. Geological Survey Ecologist Steve Grodsky, Ph.D., have been working with students to monitor how their hand-linked panels affect aquatic life across three ponds. Other researchers from Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences are joining the team to research how solar panels affect the relationship between the host microbe and its environment and also how the panels affect the bioacoustics of the ponds. This branch of sciences looks at sound production dispersion and reception in animals.

Located at the Cornell Experimental Pond Facility in New York state, the project comprises 378 solar panels and 1,600 floats. “The floats are made from plastic and the PV panels are made from the same materials you would see in recent terrestrial solar [crystalline-silicon],” said Grodsky.
The equipment is favored for its affordability and buoyancy. However, researchers hope to examine how these solar panels affect factors like the water’s natural nitrogen and phosphate levels and life quality for microbes macroinvertebrates (snails and crayfish) macrophytes (aquatic plants) and fish. They will use gas-trapping monitors to collect this data, as ponds naturally release greenhouse gasses when organic matter in the water grows and dies.  
“It’s not about slowing down renewable energy development; it’s about incorporating scientific rigor to make the deployment of floating solar development more sustainable,” Grodsky said. 
Ciel & Terre, a French company that specializes in developing floating solar panels, is partnering with the researchers. Ciel & & Terre is the developer of one of the largest floating solar projects in the U.S. The 4.4. MW floating array in Sayreville, New Jersey,  just outside of New York City, is sited on a pond at a water treatment facility. It offsets the power use at the facility as well as at other government facilities.
Interest in floating solar is rising, especially with the “Protect our Waters and Expand Renewables on our Reservoirs Act” introduced by Rep. Paul Tonko, D- N.Y., and Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., in December 2022. 
The bill encourages clean energy production on federal water reservoirs and examining the deployment of floating solar to create renewable energy. With states like North Carolina, New York and New Jersey already deploying their versions, stakeholders must balance protecting biodiversity above and below water. Doing so will unlock the possibility of saving 5 million acres of land and providing 10 percent of domestic energy needs – which National Renewable Energy Researchers say floating solar can do.
