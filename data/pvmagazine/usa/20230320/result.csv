The report highlighted that the United States is currently not on the path needed to meet the carbon emissions reduction targets set by the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst effects of climate change. The agreement calls for a 50% to 52% reduction of emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. Currently, EIA projects the U.S. is on a course for reducing it by 25% to 38%.
Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is expected to help the U.S. ramp up rapidly to meet the goal faster. The $369 billion climate and energy package in the IRA is expected to lead to a 33% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030, a far cry from the 50% reduction needed, but significantly greater than the 26% reduction EIA expected without the historic law. By 2050, EIA expects IRA to guide the U.S. to an additional 17% less carbon emissions versus last year’s pre-IRA projections.
Renewable energy developers are rapidly raising capital, training workforces, and working to secure a steady supply of components to achieve these goals and serve steadily increasing electricity demand. Demand will be driven further by increased electrification of transportation, buildings, and industry. Total installed power capacity is expected to double by 2050 to meet this increased demand.
Once built and when the resource is available, wind and solar are the least cost resources to operate to meet electricity demand because they have zero fuel costs, said EIA. Thus, over time, the combined investment and operating cost advantage is expected to increase the share of zero-carbon electricity generation.
Post-IRA, projections for solar development are significantly higher, though the range is wide, as uncertainty around global supply chain constraints and grid interconnection costs and delays threaten to hamper growth.
“Across all cases, compared with 2022, solar generating capacity grows by about 325% to 1019% by 2050, and wind generating capacity grows by about 138% to 235%. We see growth in installed battery capacity in all cases to support this growth in renewables,” said EIA.
EIA projects a wide range of energy storage buildout. The reference case for 2050 estimates 160 GW of standalone battery storage capacity will be deployed, and deployment varies between 40 GW and 260 GW in the other cases.
Meanwhile, coal-fired electricity is expected to decline sharply by 2030, cutting its contribution in half from current levels by 2030. The IRA hastens the near-term decline of coal and speeds up retirements across the U.S. coal fleet, said EIA.
EIA also expects continued cost relief for solar, wind, energy storage, and natural gas. Solar is expected to be the lowest cost generation source in the EIA’s reference case, reaching between $600 per kilowatt and $900 per kilowatt by 2050 in 2022 dollars.
The EIA Annual Energy Outlook can be found here. The report includes downloadable data files, Excel sheets, interactable dashboards, and narrative reports on the Administration’s summary of today’s energy profile and the outlooks for 2030 and 2050.
Despite potential failures to reduce economy-wide emissions, the electricity sector is expected to make strides in emissions reductions by 2030. A Department of Energy and National Renewable Energy Laboratory analysis found that clean electricity as a percentage of total generation could increase to over 80% in 2030 under mid-case assumptions. The low-case and high-case projections place clean energy’s share of electricity generation between 71% to 90%. This is substantially greater than the 41% share emissions-free electricity achieved in 2022.
Under the model, solar and wind scale rapidly, more than doubling historical maximum rates of annual deployment in many scenarios. DOE now expects 350 GW to 750 GW of new capacity from these two technologies by 2030 depending on future market conditions.
This renewables growth is projected to be supported by 40 GW to 100 GW of new energy storage and a 11% to 24% expansion of long-distance transmission by 2030.
Furthermore, the DOE said clean electricity growth will lower bulk power costs by $50 billion to $115 billion through 2030, saving ratepayers money on their bills. In 2030, the reduction equates to approximately $3 per MWh (5%) to $6 per MWh (13%).
“The U.S. energy system is rapidly changing. In recent years, technology innovation has accelerated the deployment of renewable energy, expanded markets for electric vehicles, and established record-high levels of petroleum and natural gas production. Heightened geopolitical risks have also influenced the energy system. And this year, recent federal legislation authorizes historic levels of investment in clean energy technology,” wrote Joseph DeCardolis in a foreword to the Annual Energy Outlook.

UCLA researchers and Midsummer, a Swedish building-integrated PV (BIPV) module manufacturer, claim to have demonstrated a four-terminal (4T) tandem solar cell. It is based on a top cell made of perovskite and a bottom cell relying on copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS).
“The cell is based on a perovskite top cell that has been optimized for integration with Midsummer’s CIGS cells that are utilized in their commercial suite of BIPV products,” said Midsummer, without revealing any additional technical details. “The research continues with the aim of a two-terminal perovskite-CIGS cell which will render this particular solar cell highly competitive and suitable for mass production.”
The manufacturer said the tandem cell is suitable for its Duo production equipment, which manufactures 56 mm x 156 mm CIGS cells on a flexible stainless steel substrate.
UCLA set an initial efficiency record for such tandem cells in 2018, at 22.4%. This surpassed the 17.8% efficiency achieved in 2016 by a collaboration of European research institutes, which developed a peroskite/CIGS mini-module measuring 3.76cm².
The U.S. researchers designed the bottom cell as having an indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent conductive oxide film, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, a perovskite layer, and a layer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer. For the top cell, they used an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a cadmium sulfide (Cds) layer, and a CIGS absorber.
Yang Yang, a UCLA professor of materials science, said at the time that devices with similar designs could reach efficiencies above 30%.
“We feel fortunate to be working with Professor Yang’s group at UCLA which has demonstrated key advances in perovskites,” said Leon Chiu, president of Pioneer Materials, which is a key supplier for compound sputtering targets used in Midsummer’s novel processing for CIGS on stainless steel. “Integrating Midsummer’s production proven CIGS processing with Yang’s Lab tailored perovskite shows a clear path toward expanding the reach of BIPV by improving efficiency and lowering costs.”
Midsummer currently operates a 50 MW manufacturing facility in Bari, southern Italy, and another factory in Sweden. In 2020, it released a 500 W solar panel for large rooftop arrays.

Domestic production of solar panels could speed up decarbonization in the United States, according to a new study by Cornell University researchers. They shared their findings in “Reshoring silicon photovoltaics manufacturing contributes to decarbonization and climate change mitigation,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
If solar panel manufacturing returns to the United States by 2035, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be reduced by 30%, said the scientists. Energy consumption could also be cut by 13% from 2020, when the United States relied almost entirely on Malaysia (38%), Vietnam (21%), Thailand (17%), South Korea (9%), China (6%), and Singapore (3%) for PV module imports.
The academics performed a comparative and prospective life-cycle assessment (LCA) to clarify the energy and environmental impacts of bringing crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV production to the United States. The LCA includes emissions during upstream module manufacturing, as well as during operations, maintenance, and end-of-life treatment stages.
They conducted a quantitative analysis based on global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED), by comparing the offshore manufacturing cases from 2010 to 2020 and the reshored manufacturing scenarios from 2020 to 2050.
“The reshored scenario in 2020 is studied to examine the climate impacts of solely bringing manufacturing back to the US by comparing it with the outsourced manufacturing case in 2020,” the scientists explained. “Moreover, reshored scenarios from 2025 to 2050 in five-year increments are forecasted with cleaner power compositions such as wind, solar, geothermal, etc., building up from 21% renewable power contribution in 2020 to 42% in 2050.”
The results show that domestic manufacturing of c-Si PV modules in the United States in 2020 could have reduced GHG emissions by 23% and energy use by 4%.
“The differences in power mixes between countries lead to discrepancies in climate change impacts of silicon manufacturing, which directly results in the gap in GHG emissions between the [scenarios],” the researchers said.
Looking forward to 2050, the increasing share of solar PV in the U.S. electricity mix is expected to further help reduce GHG emissions in domestic solar panel fabrications by 33%, compared to relying on international supplies in 2020.
“By 2050, around half of U.S. electricity will come from solar energy,” said Fengqi You, one of the paper’s co-authors. “Now, we only have about 3%. The U.S. is ramping up. We are going to increase solar capacity from 74 GW in 2022 to a projected 1,600 GW by 2050. That means we will need a lot more panels in the next three decades.”

UL 1973 is an industry standard recognition for stationary energy storage systems which confirms the module’s quality, resilience and ability to operate safely and effectively in a variety of conditions. The S200 modules power ESS systems the Energy Warehouse and Energy Center product lines.
The safety recognition follows the 2022 receipt by ESS of the UL 9540A standard, demonstrating the company’s systems pose no risk of thermal runaway, making the company’s energy storage products a preferred choice for installation in regions prone to wildfires or adjacent to populated areas.
Recent use cases illustrating the advantages of ESS’ iron and saltwater flow battery technology include a January deployment by Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to provide a battery system that will enable electrification of the airport’s ground operations. The safety profile of the ESS technology was a key factor in the selection given the proximity to passenger aircraft at the airport facility.
In February, ESS announced the delivery of an Energy Warehouse system to the Turlock Irrigation District in Central California. The energy storage company will deploy a few Energy Warehouse containers to pair with solar panels over irrigation canals. The solar-plus-storage project will shade canals with solar panels, a process that will reduce evaporative losses while generating clean energy.
In addition, ESS was selected by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) to deliver up to 2 GWh of energy storage systems in support of the utility’s 2030 Clean Energy Vision. ESS systems will be deployed across SMUD’s grid in the coming years.
The company’s iron flow technology provides cost-effective, long-duration energy storage ideal for applications that require up to 12 hours of flexible energy capacity. ESS systems provide resilient, sustainable energy storage suited for multiple use cases including utility-scale renewable energy installations, solar plus storage microgrids, solar load-shifting and peak shaving, and other ancillary grid services.
Long-duration storage systems of more than four-hour discharge are increasingly deployed in states with high solar penetration. After California, additional utility offtakers include NV Energy in Nevada, Georgia Power, Orlando Utilities Commission and Minnesota’s Great River Energy, according to Julia Souder, executive director of the Long Duration Energy Storage Council.
According to BloombergNEF estimates, the federal Inflation Reduction Act is expected to drive an additional 6.6 GW / 26.4 GWh of new energy storage capacity in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market through 2030, even though Texas is forecast to add a higher amount of storage systems, at 8.9 GW / 35.6 GWh of additional capacity.
Unlike typical lithium-ion batteries that are packaged as fixed cells  or modules, a flow battery such as the Energy Warehouse allows power to be decoupled from the capacity, allowing users the flexibility of using the battery for a variety of use cases simultaneously on a project.
The ESS warehouse container provides 400 kWh of peak energy in a module whose average life is more than 20,000 cycles. The container weighs 41.9 tons at wet weight and measures 40 feet by 8 feet, standing 9.5 feet high. The system uses recycled iron components and abundant saltwater, making its electrolyte system fully recyclable.

Vision Solar, a newcomer to Connecticut, was granted a Home Improvement Contractor license in December 2020, but starting in August 2021, the Attorney General’s office began to receive the first of 14 unique complaints against the company.
The legal complaint can be found here. 

The attorney general’s office states that “Vision Solar preyed on low-income, elderly, and disabled homeowners, pressuring them into unaffordable loans for solar panels that in some cases were never activated”. The company’s in-home sales tactics included overstaying permitted hours, pressuring customers into immediate signatures, falsely claiming that signatures were for “pre-approval” only, and failing to deliver contracts to customers. The attorney general also alleged that Vision Solar made sales pitches to individuals with language or intellectual challenges who were unable to make informed purchasing decisions.

Vision Solar is also accused of misrepresenting the tax benefits of solar panel installation to those with no tax liability. The attorney general further suggested that Vision Solar applied for solar permits without proper licenses and may have used the license of an electrician no longer employed by the company to apply for some of those permits. Vision Solar is also alleged to have installed solar projects without a licensed electrician.
Vision Solar’s online reviews tell a similar story. With 176 reviews, Vision Solar received 1.79 out of 5 stars on SolarReviews.com. They earned an “F” with 1.21 out of 5 stars from the Better Business Bureau, with 203 reviews. On Yelp! the company earned only 1.5 out of 5 stars, and on Angie’s List (now just ‘Angi’) they received the site’s lowest possible score, 1 out of 5.

In 2020, Vision Solar sued Momentum Solar for trade secret violations. Momentum Solar itself was sued for racist and discriminatory actions. Online searches reveal multiple lawsuits against Vision Solar in New Jersey for violation of the Do Not Call list.
Despite the numerous complaints against the company, as of March 20, 2023, Vision Solar’s license is still listed as “active”.

Entergy Louisiana, the state’s largest utility, is seeking approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission to add approximately 175 MW of new solar energy from a facility in Iberville Parish and 49 MW from what would become the Sterlington Solar Facility in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana.  Collectively, Entergy is seeking the approval to construct and place 3 GW of solar projects into the grid.
Entergy’s announcement for approval of the 3 GW solar portfolio follows an announcement earlier this month the utility had filed with the PSC to approve the purchase, construction and operation of the 225 MW of solar projects.
Ranked 38th in the nation for installed solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Louisiana has lagged behind in embracing solar energy to the point where solar provides just 0.0043% of the state’s electricity, or enough to power 20,352 homes, according to SEIA.
“Like never before, our state has opportunity to retain businesses, support expansion projects and attract new companies on a global scale, but it’s going to take meeting their operational and sustainability needs,” said Entergy Louisiana president and chief executive Phillip May.
The Louisiana PSC in September 2022 approved Entergy’s initial 475 MW solar portfolio as part of the Geaux Green program, and also approved the solar subscription and green tariff program itself.
In June 2022, Entergy Corp. discussed plans for generating up to 7 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2025, and as much as 14 to 17 GW of renewable resources by the end of 2031.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/20/minimizing-ev-impact-on-the-grid/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 20, 2023",Minimizing EV impact on the grid,"National and global plans to combat climate change include increasing the use of electric vehicles and the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources. But some projections show that these trends could require new power plants to meet peak loads in the evening when cars are plugged in to charge after the workday. What’s more, overproduction of solar energy during the daytime can waste valuable electricity-generation capacity, according to a new study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
MIT researchers have found that it’s possible to mitigate or eliminate daily EV charging demand and solar over-capacity without the need for technological upgrades of connected devices and real-time communications, which could add to costs and energy consumption. The study was published in the March 15 issue of Cell Reports Physical Science journal by Zachary Needell (PhD, 2022), post-doc Wei Wei and Professor Jessika Trancik of MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems and Society.
Instead, the placement of EV charging stations in strategic locations and setting up charging systems to initiate charging at delayed times could potentially make all the difference.
In the MIT analysis, researchers culled data collected in New York and Dallas. Data was gathered from anonymous records collected from onboard EV devices, as well as surveys that sampled populations to examine travel behavior. The data tracked residential, workplace, shopping and entertainment location EV driving habits.
Better availability of charging stations at workplaces, for example, could help EVs “soak up peak power being produced at midday from solar power installations,” which might otherwise go to waste because it is not economical to build enough battery or other storage capacity to save all of this solar energy for later in the day. Thus, workplace chargers can provide a double benefit, helping to reduce the evening peak load from EV charging and also making use of the solar electricity output, according to Trancik.
The effects on the electric grid are considerable, especially if the system must meet charging demands for a fully electrified personal EV fleet alongside demand energy peaks in other instances such as late summer energy usage of air conditioning units. If unmitigated, the evening peaks in EV charging demand could require installing close to 20% more power generation capacity, the researchers said.
“Slow workplace charging can be more preferable than faster charging technologies for enabling a higher utilization of midday solar resources,” said postdoc student Wei Wei.
Meanwhile, using delayed home charging, each EV charger can be accompanied by a simple app to estimate the time of charging cycles so that the EV charges just before it is needed the next day. Unlike other system proposals that require a centralized control of the charging cycle, such a system needs no inter-device communication of information and can be preprogrammed to accomplish a major shift in the demand on the grid caused by increasing EV penetration.
For home charging, the researchers aren’t just referring to charging equipment in garages or parking areas. They say it is expanded to include on-street parking locations and apartment building areas as well.
Trancik says the findings highlight the value of combining the two measures — workplace charging and delayed home charging — to reduce peak demand, store solar energy, and meet drivers’ charging needs on all days. As the team showed in earlier 2021 research, home charging can be an effective component of a strategic package of charging locations. Workplace charging, they have found, is not a good substitute for home charging to meet drivers’ needs on all days.
“Given that there’s a lot of public money going into expanding charging infrastructure, how do you incentivize the location such that this is going to be efficiently and effectively integrated into the power grid without requiring a lot of additional capacity expansion?,” said Trancik. This research offers some guidance to policymakers on where to focus rules and incentives.
“I think one of the fascinating things about these findings is that by being strategic you can avoid a lot of physical infrastructure that you would otherwise need,” she says. “Your EVs can displace some of the need for stationary energy storage, and you can also avoid the need to expand the capacity of power plants, by thinking about the location of chargers as a tool for managing demands — where they occur and when they occur.”
Delayed home charging could make a surprising amount of difference, the MIT team found. “It’s basically incentivizing people to begin charging later. This can be something that is pre-programmed into EV chargers. You incentivize people to delay the onset of charging by a bit, so that not everyone is charging at the same time, and that smooths out the peak,” Trancik said.
It’s not a given that all this would line up just right, and putting in place the right mix of incentives would be crucial. “If you want EVs to act as an effective storage technology for solar energy, then the [EV] market needs to grow fast enough in order to be able to do that,” Trancik says.
To best use public funds to help make that happen, she says, “you can incentivize charging installations, which would go through ideally a competitive process — in the private sector, you would have companies bidding for different projects, but you can incentivize installing charging at workplaces, for example, to tap into both of these benefits.” Chargers people can access when they are parked near their residences are also important. Home charging is one of the ways to meet charging needs while avoiding inconvenient disruptions to people’s travel activities.
The study was supported by funding from the European Regional Development Fund Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization, the Lisbon Portugal Regional Operation Program, and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.
Jessika Trancik has been an MIT professor at the Institute for Data, Systems and Society since 2010, and focuses on energy service projects including electricity, transportation, heating, and industrial processes. Her work spans solar, wind power, energy storage, low-carbon fuels, EVs, and nuclear fission.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/20/used-and-resold-solar-module-pricing-aligns-with-general-market/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 20, 2023",Used and resold solar module pricing aligns with general market,"EnergyBin, a website for selling solar hardware, has released their second annual PV Module Price Index for the Secondary Solar Market. The index tracks the price of new and used solar modules listed for sale.
EnergyBin does not take commissions on module sales or track actual final sales, so their data tracks listed prices only, not actual sales. The group lists solar components from over 500 companies that have registered on their website. From January 2020 to December 2022, the website listed 3.6 million modules with a total capacity of 1.35 GW.
Since January 2020, solar module prices on EnergyBin have increased across all classes. Prices increased until January 2022, held near that peak for around six months, and then steadily decreased throughout the rest of the year.
Solar module pricing has not returned to the lows seen in 2020 and early 2021. And due to growing demand, U.S. import challenges, and polysilicon shortages, module prices mirrored those seen in the general marketplace in 2021 and 2022.
Starting with the middle 2021 polysilicon shortages due to factory fires, then buoyed by major growth, polysilicon prices increased by over 200%. This broke the decade-long price decrease streak of solar modules. Amongst the many advances in that period, the effective price per watt of polysilicon fell by 96%. Later in 2022, aligned with the EnergyBin price decrease, we started to see the price of polysilicon also begin to fall – before bottoming out in January. It is projected we will see further solar panel price relief, due to massive industry scaling going forward.
EnergyBin has found that the volume of available modules tends to peak during the first and fourth quarters of the year, and decreases in the second and third quarters.
BayWa r.e., GoodFaith Energy and Inovateus Solar are a few EnergyBin users listed on its website.
Price per watt ($/W) of solar panels
In 2022, used solar panels represented approximately 9% of all modules listed on EnergyBin’s website, and prices fluctuated from $0.095/W to $0.197/W. EnergyBin observed that at one point during the year, a single project contributed a 27.5 MW volume of used modules, which increased the percentage of used solar modules on the website from 4% to 9%.
EnergyBin says that used modules cost 50% to 80% of what new products cost. Some of the larger solar distributors and re-distributors can be found on the website, along with local shops stocking smaller quantities.
