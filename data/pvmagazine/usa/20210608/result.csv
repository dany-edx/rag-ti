Battery energy storage additions are expected to reach 1,770 MW over the same time period, up from the 552 MW already installed.
The data was reported by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) in its May report on capacity changes by fuel type. The report forecasts new solar projects with signed interconnection agreements to total 2,937 MW of new capacity from now until year’s end, landing at a total cumulative 2021 capacity of 10,542 MW.
The three largest solar projects will add a combined 1,883 MW of capacity. The top spot goes to Dawn Solar in Deaf Smith County west of Amarillo, sized at 515.66 MW. Close behind is Plainview Solar, at 514 MW, and Eunice Solar at nearly 427 MW.
The largest battery project is the Crossett Power Battery system, a 203 MW storage facility that has a target operation date of August. Also coming online this year is the Vortex BESS, and Silicon Hill Storage, at 122 MW and 105 MW, respectively.
Wind remains the dominant source of renewable energy in ERCOT. Cumulative wind capacity currently stands at 31,836 MW currently and will increase by another 3,891 MW to 35,727 MW by the end of this year. Texas can expect the High Lonesome Wind project to begin operation this year, adding almost 450 MW to the grid.
The increase in capacity of solar represents a 38% addition of cumulative capacity added from June through December. Wind will add 12% in the same period, and batteries will add an additional 220% of new capacity to what is currently in place.
While growth in renewable capacity is occurring, constraints around current and future transmission capabilities could hamper growth. In its 2020 Long Term System Assessment, ERCOT said the scale and location of wind and solar generation additions are dependent upon sufficient transmission capacity between resource-rich regions and demand centers.
ERCOT estimated if current transmission constraints do not improve, the state could see 7,000 MW less of solar and wind generation through 2035.

ERCOT said it expects the construction of gas generation sources closer to loads to make up for the loss in renewable generation. Another solution under consideration for solving the transmission problem is to add more energy storage, which can help relieve localized congestion.
Solutions that address both regional transfer limits and local constraints closer to urban demand centers are required to accommodate large-scale renewable generation transfers, said ERCOT. Its 2020 Regional Transmission Plan outlined several placeholder projects for areas in the most need, but there is no major economic project currently planned. The grid operator will review the projects again later this year.
As is the case with most grid operators, the need for storage has come under the spotlight for ERCOT. In 2019, it formed a Battery Energy Storage Task Force (BESTF).
The BESTF evaluates operational and market design policies that may be implemented in a two-step approach. It examines rules that can be implemented in the short-term to integrate battery Energy Storage Resources under a “combination model” structure. Then, it examines rules that can be implemented on a longer timeline to integrate battery energy storage resources under a “single model” structure.

Prior to the partnership, the two companies have been collaborating on energy storage projects since the beginning of 2020. The two are now looking to align their strengths in lithium-ion battery recycling and battery life cycle management software. They are also collaborating on services to help developers and utilities decommission energy storage systems safely, recover the valuable materials from within the end-of-life batteries, and return those materials to the economy.
“Renewance and Li-Cycle share the same mission to enable a more sustainable battery energy storage ecosystem,” said Tom Newhall, Chief Operating Officer of Renewance.
Newhall believes that Renewance will be able to provide immediate value for Li-Cycle, via his company’s deep level of experience on regulatory considerations for battery decommissioning and reverse supply chain processes.
Li-Cycle also recently announced plans to build its third North American ‘Spoke’ plant in the Phoenix area, becoming the first such plant located West of the Mississippi.
For Li-Cycle, a ‘Spoke,’ facility is one which produces a ‘black mass’ from spent lithium-ion batteries. This material is then sent to a ‘Hub’ facility, a wet chemistry/hydrometallurgical plant that will refine battery-grade materials from ‘black mass.’ The first Hub is set to be operational in 2022 in Rochester, New York.
The company’s long-term commercial goal is that a handful of regional Spoke plants will produce ‘black mass’ for a regional Hub plant to then refine, rather than having to ship black mass all the way across the country.
The Phoenix location was chosen due to its proximity to California, an early adopter of energy storage projects, and thus will be the site of the first large wave of retiring storage systems.

TVA’s RFP also shares that the entity is interested in procuring BESS for existing utility scale solar projects signed out of the 2017, 2019 or 2020 Renewable RFPs with Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) that do not have BESS currently.
According to the release accompanying the RFP, TVA is specifically soliciting specifically for solar projects. The minimum capacity for any project to be considered by TVA is 2 MW, with the maximum capacity for consideration being 200 MW. Planned projects greater than 5 MW must utilize central-type inverters rated 500 kVA or higher, or other TVA-approved equipment that demonstrates equivalent or better performance. All solar projects, regardless of capacity, must utilize trackers.
Any new project or existing project retrofit must be able to reach commercial operation by between September 30, 2024 and December 18, 2024 or earlier.
The projects procured under this solicitation will be used in TVA’s Green Invest program, which secures solar capacity to meet the renewable energy goals of large-scale customers, like auto manufacturers, data centers, local power companies, cities, and universities. The program has proven to be a success for TVA thus far, attracting customers such as Jack Daniels, Facebook and the city of Knoxville, Tennessee. TVA has increased its contracted solar capacity by 60% since October 2020, through Green Invest.
Proposals for the RFP must be submitted by July 20, 2021. Developers can review TVA’s request for proposal and submit bids here. TVA will announce the selected projects this winter.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/08/pge-deploys-microgrid-to-protect-high-fire-threat-area/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 8, 2021",PG&E deploys microgrid to protect high fire-threat area,"Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) commissioned its first hybrid renewable microgrid, built and installed by BoxPower. The microgrid is planned as a permanent replacement of overhead distribution lines and is the first in a series of microgrids, the utility said.
PG&E said it has located hundreds of areas that would benefit from microgrid deployment and has targeted up to 20 operational remote grid sites by the end of 2022.
The microgrid, which PG&E said will help reduce the risk of wildfires, will supply power to a handful of customers in a High Fire-Threat District (HFTD) outside of Yosemite National Park in Briceburg, California. Rather than having long distribution lines run through HFTD areas to pockets of isolated customers, the microgrid allows for localized electricity delivery.
This microgrid project echoes some principles of the solutions proposed by Sunrun, which has worked to build distributed grids with solar and storage for increased reliability and safety. 
The construction uses BoxPower’s SolarContainer, which provides a total PV capacity of 36.5 kW, as well as a 27.2kW/ 68.4/kWh lithium ferro phosphate storage system. Almost 90% of the energy produced will be generated by renewable sources, with the remainder from two integrated propane generators. A fire suppression system will protect the hardware and facility. 
Californians have witnessed PG&E’s saga, from culpability in wildfires, to bankruptcy, as well as the call for more renewables and storage. The utility also released a 1,000-page Wildfire Safety Plan in response to the tragic wildfires witnessed in recent years.

CI will supervise construction of the projects which are in Howard County, Maryland, between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. The dollar value of the financing was not disclosed.
In April, Clean Capital announced a $300 million commitment from Manulife to fund CleanCapital’s investments in middle market solar and storage.
In April 2020 Howard County signed a power purchase agreement for the energy, which is expected to account for around 30% of the county government’s total annual electricity use. The agreement provides a total anticipated cost benefit of $1.2 million for the 25-year life of the contract.
Solar developer 7X Energy sold its 130 MW Elara Energy Project in Frio County, Texas, to KOMIPO America, the U.S. subsidiary of Korea Midland Power Co. Purchase price was not disclosed.
Morgan Stanley Renewables Inc. is anticipated to be the sole tax equity investor for the Elara project. CohnReznick Capital served as the financial advisor to 7X. Elara is currently under construction and is expected to reach full commercial operation in the fourth quarter.
Elara’s energy and environmental attributes are being sold under three long term off-take agreements. Around 30 MW of the energy and environmental attributes produced by Elara will be sold to EDF Energy Services under a long-term power purchase agreement. The remaining 100 MW is subject to a long-term hedge agreement with Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. And, around 100 MW of RECs will be sold to Fathom Energy, LLC under a long-term purchase agreement.
Swinerton Renewable is the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor and SOLV, a subsidiary of Swinerton, will manage the operations and maintenance for the project, which is southwest of San Antonio. The project uses Nextracker components, Power Electronics Freesun HEM inverters, and more than 435,000 Jinko modules.
Southern California Edison said it completed a $740 million upgrade to its West of Devers transmission lines, enabling an estimated 7,000 MW of renewable and battery energy storage from the eastern part of California to reach load centers.
The project removed and replaced conductors and supporting structures of four separate circuits of 220kW transmission lines through an existing 48-mile corridor from the Devers substation near Palm Springs to the Vista and San Bernardino substations in Grand Terrace and San Bernardino, about 200 miles of power lines. The upgrades tripled the capacity of power delivery from 1,600 MW to 4,800 MW.
SCE applied in 2013 to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission requesting approvals to build the project. Construction began in early 2018 and the improvements went into service about five months before their originally projected timeframe.

Even so, the first quarter 2021 performance was an increase of more than 250% over the same quarter a year ago.
Wood Mackenzie and the U.S. Energy Storage Association’s (ESA’s) latest US Energy Storage Monitor reported the results and said the deployments made Q1 the biggest to date for the U.S. storage market and the third-highest megawatt total for a single quarter.
Deployments are forecast to pick up through the end of the year. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that nearly 12,000 MWh of new storage will be added in 2021, three times the amount added in 2020.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that nearly 12,000 MWh of new storage will be added in 2021, three times the amount added in 2020.

The NREL study said that battery storage capacity could be at least 3,000 times greater than today. It said that depending on cost trajectories and other variables, 2050 storage deployment could range from 130 to 680 GW, indicating a “rapidly expanding opportunity for diurnal storage in the power sector.”
In a commentary by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council published by pv magazine USA, Gwen Brown said that despite reductions in battery prices and demonstrated consumer demand, “outdated interconnection policies remain a significant barrier” to unlocking the full value of energy storage on the distribution grid.
She said that without action to remedy the shortcomings of these policies–which control which storage capabilities are recognized and how efficiently they are evaluated–the clean grid of the future “may be out of reach, at least within the timeframe needed to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.”

In particular, she said that many states’ interconnection rules do not explicitly address energy storage. She said this creates  uncertainty that slows and complicates the interconnection process and that can negatively impact financing prospects.
Additionally, many interconnection policies use unrealistic assumptions when assessing the impacts of potential storage projects on the grid. “These policy flaws present significant barriers to unlocking the broad energy storage deployment that will be needed to achieve high-renewable scenarios,” she said.
The Wood Mackenzie/ESA report said that if a stand-alone storage investment tax credit (ITC) is passed by Congress this year, it could result in a 20-25% upgrade its five-year market outlook in megawatt terms.
With a stand-along ITC, the front-of-the-meter (FTM) segment would see the largest incremental growth, with an extra 6 GW of capacity through 2025. Without the federal tax break, the FTM segment could add 3,674 MW in 2021 and 6,915 MW in 2026.
In March, nearly 150 organizations appealed to U.S. House and Senate leaders to make standalone energy storage projects eligible for the ITC as part of the infrastructure package.

Public interest groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists, the National Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Environmental Law and Policy Center joined forces with solar and storage industry associations to voice their support for standalone storage ITC eligibility.
The Wood Mackenzie/ESA report said that residential storage market set a quarterly record in Q1 2021 and has grown for nine quarters in a row, breaking 100 MW deployed in a single quarter for the first time in Q1. The report said that California will continue to lead the residential segment by a “significant margin through 2026.”
The non-residential market (commercial and community-scale) is not seeing the same rate of growth as other sectors, with between 25 and 35 MW of new projects installed in each of the last five quarters.
The report said that the FTM interconnection queue now sits at more than 200 GW, its largest ever. And while many of those projects will not be built, the report found a “surge” of interconnection queue requests outside of markets that offer incentives.
