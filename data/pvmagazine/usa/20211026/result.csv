Part 1,"Attaching a solar array to a home is a long-term commitment, with many considerations, and one that offers great potential for energy bill savings. A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $10,000 or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, according to EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
In part one of this two-part series, pv magazine reviews the benefit of backup power. In the next installment, costs, benefits, and timing are evaluated.
Blackouts or power outages occur with varied frequency and for different reasons, depending on location. Some regions experience transmission issues on the grid, weather events can knock out power, and some regions like southern California have scheduled rolling blackouts during high energy-demand periods.

A SunPower-backed survey of 1,500 homeowners found that 40% of respondents worried about power outages on a monthly basis. And one-third of respondents said high-profile outages, like the ones caused by winter storms in Texas this past February, are the top reason for considering energy storage.
The next logical question might be: how much battery to install, and for how long should it provide backup?
Installers typically give the choice between whole-home backup, which often require the installation of multiple batteries, or a partial backup, which allows the homeowner to select specific circuits that are tied to desired appliances or outlets. When selecting specific breakers, homeowners often select the refrigerator, garage door opener, home office, or other kitchen appliances.
To understand a home’s power needs, and to evaluate what is most essential to back-up, homeowners can use the Department of Energy’s Energy Saver appliance energy calculator.
One of the most common home batteries is the Tesla Powerwall, which has a 13.5 kWh usable storage capacity. This means it can provide 13.5 kW for one hour, or 1 kW for 13.5 hours, said EnergySage. A second big energy storage brand is from LG Chem, which has  9.6 kWh and 16 kWh models.

Translated to appliances, EnergySage said 13.5 kWh is equivalent to running a 3,500 W air source heat pump for just under four hours, a 200 W refrigerator for 67.5 hours, or five 20 W light bulbs for 135 hours.
EnergySage said a PowerWall can typically back up essentials like WiFi, phone, refrigerator, and some lights for about 24 hours.
Simulations run by the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of residential solar and storage systems operated for backup power purposes suggest that a system with a 7 kW pv array and 10 kWh of storage could support 60-80% of a customer’s average daily load over the course of a year, depending on the region.
Plus, if the sun is still shining, a battery-connected solar array will continue to produce and store electricity. Solar arrays without a battery must power down during an outage, for safety reasons. Without a battery to store the power, there is no safe place for the power to go, so the system must use a rapid shut down device (the grid is inaccessible as it’s being repaired).
Solar installers will typically work with a homeowner to determine backup needs, and will evaluate the readiness of the home’s main electrical panel to be integrated for backup. In some cases, the installer will call for a main panel upgrade to accommodate the battery, Doing this may come at an additional cost.
In part two, we look at other capabilities, consider costs/benefits, and look at the issue of retrofitting existing systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/26/large-format-modules-present-a-new-set-of-challenges/,"PRODUCTS,RACKING,TRACKERS,NORTH AMERICA",TIM SYLVIA,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",Large format modules present a new set of challenges,"In the last two years, the 210mm wafer has emerged as the clear frontrunner in cell size innovation. It has displaced the previous 156.75mm standard that represented more than 90% of the monocrystalline market, and offers advantages in power output that have allowed module power ratings to exceed 600 W from a 60-cell PERC module.
In an industry where cost is everything, the increase in production capacity brought about by large-size products–reducing the cost of labor, depreciation, and operating, management and financial expenses per unit of output–has promised to significantly cut balance of system costs and the levelized cost of electricity.
Yet, as modules change in size and form factor, ripple effects are felt across the entire solar industry, requiring tweaks, modifications, and outright changes to longstanding project development and construction practices.
Perhaps nowhere are these adjustments more impactful than in the module mounting world, especially with regards to trackers. Manufacturers have to take into account and adjust for new size dimensions, weights, and environmental and operational variables presented by a newly dominant module size.

To better understand the challenges that larger modules present to tracker manufacturers in both engineering and installation, pv magazine spoke with experts at two of the industry’s leading companies: Cody Norman, director of applications engineering at Array Technologies, and Nick Mattison, product line manager for NEXTracker’s NX Horizon smart solar tracker.
“Larger PV modules result in higher loads,” Norman said. “These loads are primarily on the module support components, but it’s also on the tracker structure and the foundation.” 
Increased load on the tracker presents two distinct challenges: dead weight load across an installed row and dynamic weight in severe wind and weather events. Dead weight has an effect on the tracker by limiting how many modules can be supported by the tracker in a row.
“With modules that are significantly longer, significantly heavier, we might not be able to achieve a full 100-meter row length,” said Norman. “There’s some mechanical limitations of having that much mass supported along the tracker.”
Row-length limitation has been an issue for NEXTracker, one that the company is still working to conquer, said Mattison.
Both said that the majority of mechanical changes have been pushed by the incident pressures of wind and snow on the module.
Larger modules take wind and snow pressures and turn them into higher forces applied against the module and the tracker structure. This factor has required additional analysis that both companies have had to consider during the design process.
“The modules themselves effectively create a sail,” said Mattison “When you increase the size of that sail, that translates to a lot of extra load.”

To accommodate those forces, Norman said that Array has looked to increase the extent, size, and depth of foundations across the tracker row. It also has turned to using purlins and mounting clamps with more material and more reach.
Wind load is most significant on modules at the end of a row, said Norman. Modules at the exposed end may require additional fasteners to handle the higher wind load forces.
NEXTracker, by contrast, has not added components to bear the static and dynamic loads. Instead, it has opted to “beef up” and reinforce existing hardware, specifically the rails, according to Mattison.
Both said that the tracker drives — the motors which rotate the panels rows to track the sun — were areas of considerable focus. Outside of some adjustments to torque tube layout and position, however, the drives remained essentially unchanged.
As for the installation process, Norman and Mattison both said that it has remained relatively unchanged. The newer, larger modules still require just two workers to install. However, it’s a different story for two-in-portrait (2P) installations where the modules and trackers are higher off the ground.
“You’re managing a module that’s probably five square feet larger and probably 15 pounds heavier, if not more, than what you’re used to working with,” said Norman. “When you’re working well above your head, these heavier, larger modules are kind of challenging to deal with.”
Image: NEXTracker
With the exception of 2P installation concerns, Norman downplayed the challenges these tweaks present, framing them instead as a natural evolution of the technology. To him, the biggest challenge was how quickly 210mm wafer modules became standard across the industry.
It’s not as if either Array or NEXTracker was caught off guard by the new module sizes, far from it. Both Norman and Mattison highlighted how closely their companies collaborate with leading manufacturers.
The issue was that any new standardized form factor needs to go through extensive usage testing, extreme weather resilience testing, and project-level consideration to ensure that the trackers and their hardware are compatible with the new modules in every usage case. Having to accelerate these verification processes was an issue that both companies faced but handled well, according to Mattison and Norman.
Mattison said that NEXTracker has had to test compliance for more than 100 modules that make use of the 210mm cell size.
One future issue is standardization. Some in the industry are concerned that module sizes will just keep growing and changing as new innovations become financially viable. The worry is that there is a breaking point in terms of size, as having to add a third installer per module would throw a wrench into labor costs and installation times. 
Concerns over size variances are real enough that eight prominent module manufacturers, Risen Energy, Zhonghuan Semiconductor, Tongwei, Trina Solar, Huansheng Photovoltaic, Runyang New Energy Technology, Canadian Solar, and Wuxi Shangji Automation, are pushing to standardize 210mm silicon wafers and modules.
“The 600 W+ sizes that we’re seeing, where they’re 2.4 meters long, 1.3 meters wide, 38 kilos, if we start moving past 40 kilos or 1.5 or larger meters wide, it’s just going to be a major sail,” said Norman. “We’re also going to have to start worrying about the mechanical capabilities of the module itself: how much metal is going to be required in the frame to support the load, how much glass is being used and what’s the thickness?”
In late October, Trina Solar said the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) was set to announce a set of standard dimensions for large format modules relying on the 210mm wafer launched by Zhonghuan Semiconductor in 2019.
Having a standard set of dimensions should make thing simpler, and therefore cheaper, for project developers and component suppliers. All of them have to deal with uncertainty over module sizes and electrical characteristics since the switch to larger wafer formats began to play out.
For Mattison, the idea of standardized wafer and module sizes is one that he would support, although he notes that previous standardization efforts have lagged, and that the market tends to settle into a universal size range.
“A year ago, it was all over the place, but it seems to be consolidating down to just a few form factors now,” Mattison said.
Both solar pros predicted that, at least in the short term, innovation in power density will likely shift toward efficiency, as the sector is nearing the apex the size of modules that two workers can install.
“Where we’re at,” Mattison said, “is probably close to where we’re going to be for the next few years.”

The company has partnered with Duke Energy to field test the product.
Honeywell’s battery uses a safe, non-flammable electrolyte that converts chemical energy to electricity to store energy for later use. The solution can store and discharge electricity for up to 12 hours, according to Honeywell. If proven, the battery would provide the system with another distinct advantage over traditional lithium-ion batteries, which currently can discharge up to four hours.
The battery is also comprised of entirely recyclable components. It is touted by Honeywell as being immune to degradation over long periods of use, a paramount issue for all battery storage chemistries and technologies.
According to Honeywell, the flow battery can be combined with the company’s Experion PKS business and asset management, system, and its enterprise performance management solution, Honeywell Forge, for remote monitoring.
In 2022 Honeywell plans to deliver a 400 kWh unit to Duke Energy’s Emerging Technology and Innovation Center in Mount Holly, North Carolina, to determine if the technology is viable for use at scale. Duke will need to make commitments to deploying storage at scale if it hopes to achieve its goals of a 50% reduction of carbon emissions versus 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
According to a Duke representative, the utility plans to install almost 400 MW of battery storage capacity in its service territory over the next five years, though it is unclear if this refers to it’s North Carolina Service area, or total southeast service area including South Carolina and Florida. The representative also added that Duke has a keen interest in breakthrough technologies, like this flow battery.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/26/isun-pegs-its-ci-project-backlog-at-80-million/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,VERMONT",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",iSun pegs its C&I project backlog at $80 million,"Solar company iSun posted preliminary third-quarter results, and said it expects to post a net loss of between $1.2-$1.5 million on revenues of $6.7-$7.2 million.
Year-to-date, the firm said it expected to post revenues of $17.8 million to $18.8 million. 
The Vermont-based company said it has a backlog of commercial and industrial (C&I) projects estimated at $80.7 million. To date, iSun has an installed portfolio of more than 400 MW of solar, including residential, C&I, and utility scale.
Gross margins were between 18-20% in the third quarter, which ended September 30. Year-to-date margins are between 4-6%. The company said it expected its margins to return to more pre-pandemic levels as it works through its project backlog.

Commenting on the preliminary results, Jefferey Peck, CEO, said the backlog does not include a recently announced $30 million commitment secured for Development Services by iSun’s utility division or the project backlog secured by its residential division.
iSun has been active in recent months. In September, it purchased solar installer SunCommon in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The deal included $24 million in cash and $15 million in stock, plus $2.5 million in stock-based compensation to SunCommon employees.
Days later, the company said it secured a contract to develop 448 MW of solar, which outsizes the company’s total installed capacity to-date. The solar capacity would be sited at three Alabama locations, and would make up a large portion of the state’s solar capacity once completed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/26/watch-dragon-scale-solar-tiles-installed-on-google-buildings-in-silicon-valley/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",Watch: Dragon scale solar tiles installed on Google buildings in Silicon Valley,"One of Google’s newest buildings is using a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) product called Dragonscale, which is manufactured by European solar panel company SunStyle.
And it is gorgeous.
The internet giant, which also is a world-leading clean energy procurement company, has installed around 7 MW of the product on two buildings at its Silicon Valley campus. The 90,000 individual solar panels will generate enough electricity to cover around 40% of the electricity use in the buildings, known as Bay View and Charleston East.
Image: Chris McAnneny Heatherwick/ Studio.max
The solar cells are embedded into a sturdy, but flexible, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) layer. Six millimeters of hardened solar glass protects the face of the panels; the back is protected by a layer of fire resistant Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride). Because the edges of the tiles are sealed to keep out moisture — much like a glass-glass solar panel — aluminum framing on the panel is not necessary.
The polyvinyl layer is a highly textured “prismatic” surface, which traps photons within the solar panel that would normally escape from traditional flat solar panels. The result is an increase in the solar panel’s generation.

Technically, if we were to only install one of the panels it would have an efficiency of 15%. That is because the standard shingle doesn’t have a solar cell in the top square due to the product’s overlapping nature. But when we take into account the overlapping configuration, the effective efficiency rating is closer to 17%, which is what the company lists on its website.


The company’s specifications list five separate solar panel types, which fit into the border areas of the roof, taking advantage of the entire roof. 

Sunstyle shared a .gif on its website to show how the product is installed. The solar tiles are screwed directly into the sun-roof structure. The substructure can be made of wood or stainless steel.
A wood lattice substructure is the common roofing technique used in Europe. This allows for solar panels to be better used as building material. In the United States, this lattice substructure would be the rafters located under a plywood base.
The warranty covers the product’s ability to generate electricity as well as its integrity as a building material. The shingles are guaranteed to last 30 years. Energy output is guaranteed to remain above 90% of its rated efficiency after 10 years, and above 80% after 25 years.

The document attacked what SEIA said were a series of “false narratives,” including a “flagrantly false claim that SEIA rejects the need for domestic manufacturing” and other allegations about SEIA’s interests.
In a statement, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said that the trade group “is the voice of America’s solar industry and represents the interests of American solar workers and companies.” She said the group is leading the fight against the tariff request to protect this country’s 10,000 solar companies and 231,000 solar workers from the “monied interests” behind the petition.

In mid October, lawyers for the publicly anonymous group identified to federal trade officials the identities of members involved in American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC). Lawyers for the group asked Commerce Department officials to keep the names confidential from the public because of fears of retaliation.
“SEIA’s statement simply shows that they are willing to enable the unfair and destructive trade practices of state-backed Chinese companies,” said Timothy Brightbill in an email to pv magazine. Brightbill is with the Washington, D.C. law firm Wiley Rein that represents A-ASMACC. “U.S. solar manufacturing is on the rise – and that is the best future for our country and for the world.”
A-SMACC in August asked Commerce officials to investigate whether imports from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam were unfair, arguing that Chinese companies had shifted production to those nations in recent years to avoid existing U.S. duties on solar cells and panels made in China.
In late September, the Commerce Department deferred a decision and asked the group to identify its members.
In its response, the group revealed its members to Commerce officials, said Brightbill. In a publicly available version of the response, which was obtained by pv magazine, the members’ names had been removed. A-SMACC argued that identifying its members could expose them to retaliation from the Chinese solar industry, and could cut off supplies of module components like polysilicon.
In its 28-page filing, the group said the case “implicates China’s strategic economic interests” and was likely to generate a response that “targets A-SMACC’s members if their identities are made public.” It said that overseas investments that are the subject of the tariff request are “the outcome of industrial and strategic economic priorities at the highest levels of the Chinese government.”
The A-SMACC filing also charged that SEIA “is effectively functioning as a Washington, D.C.-based enforcer for Chinese solar interests, making it unnecessary for Chinese entities to directly determine the identities of the members of A-SMACC.”
In SEIA’s rebuttal statement released October 25, Ross Hopper said that “without the integrity to identify who they are and who they represent, a shadow group of anonymous petitioners are recklessly asking our government to misinterpret U.S. law, upend the lives of thousands of American families and undermine any hope we have to mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change.”
In a late September news conference, SEIA said that that almost 80% of all solar modules are imported from the countries that are the subject of the petition, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
“he U.S. will “miss out on another 46,000 solar jobs by 2023, SEIA claimed.

“This is absolutely the biggest risk and issue for our company and the industry,” Hershman said during the press conference. He also serves as Executive Committee chair for SEIA.
Ross Hopper’s October 25 statement said that the trade group earlier had forecasted that Trump-era action known as Section 201 tariffs would cause “significant loss” of deployment, jobs, and investment.
“We now know that at least 10 GW of solar installations, 62,000 American solar jobs and $19 billion in investment has been lost as a result,” she said.
Her statement went on to say that SEIA can “confidently project” that if circumvention tariffs are imposed, the U.S. will “miss out on another 46,000 solar jobs by 2023, including 15,000 lost manufacturing jobs.”
In his email to pv magazine, Brightbill said that “SEIA’s claims about jobs lost are as ridiculous today as they were 10 years ago.” He said that solar is booming and that “the best way to ensure long-term growth is to strengthen the entire industry – and that means manufacturing, R&D, and investment in America, not just in China.”
