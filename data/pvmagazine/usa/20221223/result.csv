However, predicting future developments continues to present a challenge.
It is now projected that somewhere between 230 and 300 gigawatts of solar power module capacity may be installed in 2022 around the world. 
BloombergNEF (BNEF) published one of the industry’s highest estimates of global installed capacity in 2021, at 182 GW. BNEF’s most recent installed capacity projection for 2022 is now 268 GW. If these figures are correct, the market will have grown more than 47% YoY. This rate of growth has not been seen since the 2000s.
Congratulations are in order for solar professionals, for this herculean accomplishment.

Prevailing wisdom states that an industry cannot continue to see high growth rates after it has scaled. If this aphorism is correct, then the solar industry must be continuing to scale today. The evidence supports a growth story: the past ~20 years of solar installations currently total 1 TW of deployed capacity. Going forward, projections of accelerated growth indicate that 1 TW of capacity could be deployed in 2030 alone.
Predicting the future is hard. Not only did our deployed capacity grow by almost 50% in 2022 – so too did our projections!

Around this time last year, projections were suggesting that solar installations in 2022 would total between 162 GW (IEA) and 211 GW (BNEF). The graphic (above) from Wood Mackenzie Renewables and Power suggests that 181 GW will be installed in 2022. (Note that WoodMac sees 152 GW installed in 2021). WoodMac has not yet released their updated estimates for 2022.
And it wasn’t just WoodMac or BNEF that was way off. The following graph charts the projections from a number of respectable analyst groups, starting around the end of 2021. Their estimates increase dramatically over the course of the year:

What’s really interesting about the WoodMac chart (from Q4’21) is that it forecasts 269 GW for 2029. And at the end of 2021, BNEF projected 266 GW by 2028 – not far off of WoodMac’s 2029 estimate. Those estimates were meant to forecast 7 to 8 years ahead. Today, just one year later, they are in the same range as analysts’ estimates for 2022.
BloombergNEF’s Jenny Chase spoke with pv magazine USA on this topic:
pv magazine USA: What most surprised analysts about 2022? Where did we go wrong?
Honestly, China was the biggest upset as usual, and we’re not even totally sure the final number will be our 126GW(DC) current estimate (our estimate was below 100GW for most of the year). However, the modules have got to be going somewhere in Q4. Also Europe has bought over 70 GW of modules from China, though we do not believe it has installed much more than 42GW yet.
So, what might it take to install 400 GW of solar modules in 2023? Is it even technically possible? 
I wouldn’t put anything past the solar industry, but it could make 500 GW of solar modules in 2023, based on existing polysilicon plans and a realistic ramp-up schedule.
Recently, you mentioned that projections beyond 300 GW to 400 GW a year before the end of the decade are tough to make, because even if we can manufacture such a large quantity – where are the national programs and power grids to connect it to?
Honestly, I just can’t bully the local analysts for the individual markets which haven’t already got a lot of solar into forecasting transformative growth. You need new markets to hit 1 TW/year, but progress has been slow – not nonexistent, but slow – in places like Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and parts of southeast Asia (but not Vietnam). There aren’t national programs in these places (at least not ones I trust to do anything, looking at you Saudi Arabia) and often the solar will need to support the grid rather than just connecting to it. 
Can we possibly hit 1 TW/year installed by the end of the decade?
It could absolutely be 1 TW/year by 2030. Solar always surprises. But if you try to allocate that to certain countries you will encounter huge resistance from experts on those countries, including governments of those countries. Also, manufacturing 1 TW/year is trivial compared with finding grid capacity to build it.
Approaching 400 GW
If we do end up installing 268 GW this year, then next year’s year-over-year (YoY) growth would need to be just over 49% to reach 400 GW. This would require an increased deployment volume of 132 GW, while hitting the highest growth percentage since 2009, and beating out this year’s 47% YoY growth.
This is going to be a tough ask.

As Chase explained, it was China’s deployment of 126 GW that caught BNEF off guard in 2022. Where are we going to find another China worth of capacity? Remember, only two years ago in 2020, annual global solar installation capacity was 132 GW. Where are we going to find an extra 2020 that we can attach to 2023?
It won’t be for lack of effort.
Early in 2022, there was talk of the large Chinese manufacturing boom – with the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA) seeing potential for greater than 550 GW for solar cells and 500 GW for PV modules by the end of this 2022. And while it seems that we didn’t quite reach those numbers by the end of 2022, there have been some big announcements.
More recently, both BNEF and Clean Energy Associates suggested that global polysilicon manufacturing capacity will break 500 GW before the end of the year. Also, the six largest solar panel manufacturers – LONGi, Trina, Jinko, JA Solar, CSI Solar, and Risen Energy – will cross 320 GW of manufacturing by the end of this year, and are planning new capacity for 2023.
As Chase noted in our interview, the world could manufacture 500 GW of solar modules in 2023, that doesn’t mean we’ll install all of them in 2023, or even maximize the manufacturing facilities. But we might.
One final question for Chase: ‘Is the old saying true – “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future?”’
Chase: Indeed. And also, it’s especially difficult when the future is not like the past, because you can be more wrong.

pv magazine: How did the global market for PV installations develop in 2022?
Jenny Chase: We have been surprised by the strong build in China, especially for residential and commercial – we initially expected 99 GW new build in China this year and have upped that to 126 GW (DC). Our current estimate for the year’s build is 268 GW (DC). Europe has bought a lot of modules – well over 72 GW – though we expect it has only installed around 42 GW, so there is considerable inventory.
What were the biggest surprises for you this year?
How high polysilicon and module prices have remained right up to the end of the year, indicating strong buying activity counteracting the effect of increased supply. We were also surprised the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed in the United States. The incentives in the law are very generous.
Will a shortage of components affect the development of global PV markets?
It’s still not as easy as it could be to get transformers and inverters, and module prices must continue to fall. But these are not major bottlenecks.
What price development do you expect in the coming year?
We expect the polysilicon price to fall from the current $35/kg to $10-$15/kg next year, and free-on-board (FOB) module prices to $0.22/W in markets without major trade barriers.
How will the expansion figures develop in 2023 throughout the world – especially in Europe?
We expect 316 GW new build worldwide, and 48 GW in Europe next year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/23/perovskite-challenges-addressed-with-new-manufacturing-process/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 23, 2022",Perovskite challenges addressed with new manufacturing process,"A new approach to manufacturing perovskite solar cells developed by researchers at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) addresses previous problems and yielded devices with high efficiency and excellent stability.
Developing highly stable and efficient perovskites based on a rich mixture of bromine and iodine is considered critical for the creation of tandem solar cells. However, issues with the two elements separating under solar cell operational conditions, such as light and heat, limit the device voltage and operational stability. This challenge is often exacerbated by the ready defect formation associated with the rapid crystallization of bromine-rich perovskite chemistry with antisolvent processes.
“This new growth approach can significantly suppress the phase segregation,” said Kai Zhu, a senior scientist at NREL, principal investigator on the project, and lead author of the new paper “Compositional texture engineering for highly stable wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells.” His co-authors from NREL are Qi Jiang, Jinhui Tong, Rebecca Scheidt, Amy Louks, Robert Tirawat, Axel Palmstrom, Matthew Hautzinger, Steven Harvey, Steve Johnston, Laura Schelhas, Bryon Larson, Emily Warren, Matthew Beard, and Joseph Berry. Other researchers involved are with the University of Toledo.
The new approach addressed the problem of the two elements separating, and it produced a wide-bandgap solar cell with an efficiency of greater than 20% and 1.33-volt photovoltage. Little change was seen in the efficiency over 1,100 hours of continuous operation at a high temperature. Ultimately the researchers achieved an all-perovskite tandem cell obtained an efficiency of 27.1% with a high photovoltage of 2.2 volts and good operational stability.
In the tandem cell, the narrow-bandgap layer is deposited on top of the wide-bandgap layer. The difference in bandgaps allows for more of the solar spectrum to be captured and converted into electricity.
The newly developed approach builds upon work Zhu and his colleagues published earlier this year that flipped the typical perovskite cell. Using this inverted architectural structure allowed the researchers to increase both efficiency and stability and to easily integrate tandem solar cells. They ultimately achieved a perovskite solar cell with 24% efficiency that retains 87% of output after 100 days.
In the recent research study, the NREL-led group used that same architecture in that they used an antisolvent applied to the crystalizing chemicals to create a uniform perovskite film. Then they went a step further, and the new approach relied on what is known as gas quenching, in which a flow of nitrogen was blown onto the chemicals. The result addressed the problem of the bromine and iodine separating, resulting in a perovskite film with improved structural and optoelectronic properties.
The previous antisolvent approach allows the crystals to grow rapidly and uniformly within the perovskite film, crowding each other and leading to defects where the grain boundaries meet. The new gas-quenching process, when applied to high-bromine-content perovskite chemicals, forces the crystals to grow together, tightly packed from top to bottom. The researchers found that this significantly decreases the defects. The top-down growth method forms a gradient structure, with more bromine near the top and less in the bulk of the cell. The researchers report that the gas-quench method was also statistically more reproducible than the antisolvent approach.
The researchers also tried argon and air as drying gas with similar results, indicating that the gas-quench method is a general way for improving the performance of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells.
The new growth approach demonstrated the potential of high-performance all-perovskite tandem devices and advanced the development of other perovskite-based tandem architectures such as those that incorporate silicon.
The work is reported in the new issue of the journal Science.

The funds are planned to support a steadily expanding portfolio of large solar and storage projects. Primergy has a near-term portfolio of 3.2 GW of solar and 2.3 GW of storage with targeted commercial operations dates through 2026. The company said a further 5 GW of solar and 4.3 GW of storage are planned for a commercial operations date beyond 2026. Primergy’s projects now span 17 states.
The portfolio includes the previously announced 690 MW solar / 1416 MWh storage Gemini project in Nevada, valued at $1.1 billion. The project has a 25-year power purchase agreement with NV Energy and is developed on Bureau of Land Management controlled lands. It will make use of Maxeon solar panels and single-axis trackers.
Along with Primergy’s 250 MW solar, 200 MW storage Iron Point project and the 350 MW solar, 280 MW battery storage Hot Pot project, Gemini brings Primergy’s expected electricity output in Nevada equivalent to the demand of about 127,000 homes.
Primergy’s near-term projects also include Ash Creek Solar, a 408 MW project in Hill County, Texas. Construction is planned to begin in 2023 and commercial operations date is expected for 2024. The project is expected to provide about 250 full-time construction jobs and local tax revenues.
In Ashley County, Arkansas, Primergy plans one of the state’s largest projects, which will be a 300 MW Entergy-interconnected solar facility built in three phases. Each phase is expected to bring about 100 construction jobs and $10 million in revenues for the county. The first phase is expected to come online in 2024, with subsequent phases rolling out by the end of 2026.
Among the 20 largest solar projects tracked by PV Intel, Texas, California and Nevada represented 15 of the largest projects, while three additional southwest projects popped up, one Ohio project and an Alberta project.
“In all cases, ambitious clean energy goals from both utilities and corporates are driving higher renewable penetration,” said Sylvia Leyva Martinez, a senior analyst in Wood Mackenzie’s utility solar group. “In the case of storage, price volatility and multiple revenue stream monetization is going to help increase the share of hybrids in the system.”
Primergy, headquartered in Oakland, California, was launched in 2020 by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, an Australian infrastructure developer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/23/dragonfly-secures-patent-for-solid-state-battery-dry-powder-coating/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,NEVADA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 23, 2022",Dragonfly secures patent for solid-state battery dry powder coating,"Dragonfly Energy, a manufacturer of deep cycle lithium-ion batteries, has been awarded a patent for its dry powder coating layers used in the electrochemical cell of its battery construction. The patent award is a major step forward toward the ramping up of the company’s domestic manufacturing of all solid-state battery cells.
Dragonfly’s patent adds to the company’s portfolio focused on dry powder coating of lithium ion battery electrodes. The powder coating system is part of the lithium battery manufacturing process, replacing traditional methods, which require heavy machinery by forming a particle layer on a substrate through a dry powder coating spray process.
The company believes this coating process will enable it to significantly reduce space and cost for lithium-ion battery manufacturing. More importantly, the process is integral to scalable production of a non-flammable solution for lithium ion battery applications.
Dragonfly reports that it has received or holds pending patents to more than 30 battery component technologies as of June 30, 2022.
“We have been developing dry powder coating processes for lithium-ion battery production for over a decade, and this newly patented process is a key piece of the foundation for manufacturing our all solid-state batteries here in the U.S.,” said Dr. Denis Phares, chief executive officer of Dragonfly. “Developing a domestically produced battery is critical to the country’s grid stability and our ultimate goal of revolutionizing grid storage.”
Dragonfly is currently constructing a pilot production line and running extensive longevity tests for its line of solid state batteries, with the scale up to mass production and battery pack integration on track for 2023 to 2024, according to a recent investor presentation. Its all solid-state batteries contain a solid electrolyte component rather than liquid, making them lighter, smaller, non-flammable, and less expensive to manufacture than conventional batteries.
The company’s patent receipt caps off a momentous year for the battery cell producer. On October 7, Dragonfly completed a SPAC merger with Chardan NexTech Acquisition II valued at $501.4 million and began trading on October 10 on Nasdaq under the ticker ‘DFLI.’
Leading the ‘lead is dead revolution’
Formed in 2012, Dragonfly produces deep cycle batteries and power components under the brand names Battle Born Batteries, Wakespeed and Dragonfly Energy. The company reports that it has sold more than 175,000 batteries over the last four years to the recreational vehicle, marine, work truck, industrial equipment and off-grid storage markets, designed to displace the less environmentally friendly lead-acid battery market.  Original equipment manufacturers Thor Industries and REV Group use the company’s batteries.
Over the next five years Dragonfly said it expects an immediate off-grid, RV and marine solutions battery market of $12 billion, while its expanding lithium and solid-state batteries have shown an addressable market of $85 billion across the U.S. Consumers switching from lead-acid batteries to its lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) counterparts is a main business driver for the ten-year old company.
Thor Industries, the largest global RV manufacturer with over 140 brands such as Airstream, Jayco and Keystone, invested $15 million in Dragonfly post-SPAC merger and continues to be an active integrator of Dragonfly’s battery cells.
Dragonfly shares traded at $10.66 per share today, down 19% from $13.16 on October 10 when it started trading, with a current market capitalization of $476 million. The company has over 150 employees and generated $78 million in 2021 revenue.
Under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act, the federal government established an Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (PTC), which applies tax credits upwards of $31 billion to the production of cathode and anode materials used in lithium-ion batteries and advanced battery minerals sourced in the U.S. A tax credit is also included for the production of battery cells and battery modules in the U.S. based on the capacity of the cell up to $35 per kWh, and in the case of a module is based on the capacity of the module up to $10 per kWh. For a sample 75kWh battery pack, a tax credit of up to $2,625 for the manufacturer of the battery cells and up to $750 for the maker of the modules is available, according to an IRA policy note by law firm Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe

Form Energy is taking a different approach and is instead developing an “aqueous air battery system” that uses low-cost iron, water and air—or what Form says are some of the safest, cheapest, most abundant materials on the planet.
In a recent study, battery experts from the University of Houston concluded that improvements in aqueous batteries, which use water-based electrolytes, are generally regarded as safe, reliable and affordable alternatives to lithium-ion cells.
“The idea is to develop advanced aqueous batteries that can combine better safety and higher voltage,” said Dr. Yan Yao, the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston.
Form Energy was founded in 2017 by energy storage veterans who shared a unified mission to reshape the global electric system by creating a new class of low-cost multi-day energy storage systems. The company reports that its iron-air battery capable of storing electricity for 100 hours at system costs competitive with legacy power plants.
Emerging from start-up mode, Form expects to begin construction of its Weirton, West Virginia factory in 2023 and start manufacturing iron-air battery systems in 2024 for broad commercialization. The Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to $290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton.
The West Virginia Economic Development Authority allocated $75 million toward the purchase of land and the construction of buildings in Weirton. The governor said he plans on working with the West Virginia Legislature and federal partners to obtain an additional $215 million needed to finalize the agreement.
According to Mateo Jarmillo, co-founder and CEO of Form Energy, the company searched for a site for a year and chose Weirton, West Virginia out of over 500 candidate locations. He described the town as “a historic steel community that sits on a river and has the rich heritage and know-how to make great things out of iron”.
“West Virginia continues to be a leader in energy innovation, and the good-paying jobs and new economic opportunities this will bring are exactly what I had in mind as I negotiated the Inflation Reduction Act,” said U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “I have said it time and again: The path forward is innovation, not elimination, and with this announcement West Virginia and Form Energy are doing just that,”
“The entire state should share in our excitement today as Form Energy, with its revolutionary technology, is choosing West Virginia,” said Roger Hanshaw, speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. “Not only will this facility and this investment truly change the Northern Panhandle as we’ve known it for the past generation, but it also will build on the state’s prominent role of powering the nation as we lead the way in bringing affordable, reliable, renewable energy to the marketplace.”
The company is also working on a grid modeling toolkit called Formware. Form reports that the next generation investment and operational model for power grids has the ability to optimize over multi-year, hourly resolution data sets to capture real-world weather variability, resulting in more reliable and cost effective designs for renewables-driven power.

Wood Mackenzie forecast a 40% decline in utility-solar project deployments, but that hasn’t stopped developers from going bigger and bolder, including with batteries attached. 
With the broader solar market forecast to see a 23% decrease in installation rates, utility solar is expected to wrap up at about 10.3 GWdc installed capacity, as the industry continues to weather supply chain challenges and trade disruptions from the Biden Administration’s PV module tariff imposition and flexing the Inflation Reduction Act to spur American-made modules.  
Macro static aside, state system operators and corporate offtake customers continue to drive the theme of bigger is better, and yes, batteries also better, with PV Intel data showing that close to 50% of near-term utility solar projects are seeing energy storage systems enter the equation for grid resiliency measures. 
PV Intel examined projects with commercial operations falling within the next three years, encompassing utility projects aimed at being wrapped up in the 2023 or 2024 timeframe since just entering the discussion within the last year. While 2020-21 saw projects top out at 250 MW and 300 MW, the 2022 class of projects to enter the interconnection queue is roughly double the class of prior years, with many projects clocking in at 400 MW to 690 MW. 
Among the 20 largest PV Intel projects, Texas, California and Nevada represented 15 of the largest projects among the latest slate of project developments, while three additional southwest projects popped up, one Ohio project and an Alberta project.  
Image: PV Intel, EIA monthly dataset
What is more surprising is that almost 50% of the new large-scale projects pulled by PV Intel are being developed with an average of four-hours of grid-scale energy storage at co-located sites. Nine out of the 20 largest projects are being deployed with a battery storage system to keep electrons flowing into the night. That compares to about one-third of the previous slate of projects looked at through mid-2022 to utilize storage systems.  
“In all cases, ambitious clean energy goals from both utilities and corporates are driving higher renewable penetration,” said Sylvia Leyva Martinez, a senior analyst in Wood Mackenzie’s utility solar group. “In the case of storage, price volatility and multiple revenue stream monetization is going to help increase the share of hybrids in the system.”
Leyva Martinez told pv magazine usa that corporate customers have driven up demand for large-scale utility solar project developments in Texas, while solar deployment in other states like California and Florida is driven by community choice aggregation or utility–specific procurement.  
With the Inflation Reduction Act’s inclusion of a storage investment tax credit, Leyva Martinez said to expect to see the percentage of storage deployments accompanying grid solar projects to increase in 2023 and beyond.    
Wood Mackenzie expects supply chain disruptions to dissipate toward the end of Q2 23, though Leyva Martinez said numerous domestic developers such as Intersect Power, Leeward Renewable Energy, and Primergy are sourcing solar modules from First Solar and other American-made suppliers to reduce trade policy risk affecting imported modules.

Under TVA’s by-laws, the board consists of nine members.
While TVA board members have historically approved new energy projects, earlier this year board members delegated that authority to Jeff Lyash, TVA’s CEO & president, said the Clean Up TVA Coalition.
TVA, a federally owned utility, has announced its intention to replace its Cumberland coal plant with a 1,450 MW combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) facility that requires a new gas pipeline interconnection. The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to evaluate replacing the coal unit with solar, wind, energy efficiency and storage, rather than gas generation and its associated pipeline.
The utility is also deciding how to replace its Kingston coal plant. “We’d like to see any decision about building new gas plants at Cumberland, as well as at the Kingston plant, to be held until the new directors have a chance to review this decision,” said SACE Executive Director Stephen Smith.
TVA is planning its generation mix over the next 20 years, with an integrated resource planning (IRP) process starting next year. The IRP process “could be an opportunity for the federal utility to align its objectives with President Biden’s mandate of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035,” said the Clean Up TVA Coalition.
The Center for Biological Diversity has recommended eight steps for the new TVA board members to take, for TVA to reach 100% renewable generation by 2035.
The coalition provided biographical information for the six new TVA board members:
·      Beth Geer is former chief of staff to former Vice President Al Gore.
·      Michelle Moore is founder of Groundswell and led sustainability and infrastructure teams in the Obama Administration.
·      Robert Klein served as international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
·      William Renick is former chair of the Commission on the Future of Northeast Mississippi.
·      Adam Wade White served as Lyon County judge/executive in Kentucky.
·      Joe Ritch, an attorney, formerly served as TVA Board Chair from 2013-2017.
Separately in Memphis this week the board of the municipal utility voted against accepting TVA’s offered “never-ending contract,” which would have limited the utility from seeking lower-cost renewable power from other sources.
TVA serves 10 million customers in Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
The Clean Up TVA Coalition says that it works to “to propel” TVA into a just, equitable, and fossil-fuel-free energy future by 2030.
