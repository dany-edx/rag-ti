New Leaf Energy was formed last July as a spin off from Borrego, and was purchased by Energy Capital Partners.
“Community solar projects like these will generate clean, reliable energy needed by residents and businesses and are integral in helping New York and Massachusetts reach their renewable energy and climate goals,” said Michael Streams, chief development officer for Standard Solar.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, New York ranks ninth in the U.S. for installed solar, while Massachusetts ranks tenth. New York is one of the epicenters of community solar in the United States, hitting the milestone of 1 GW of cumulative installations earlier this year, and currently holding a pipeline of more than 700 potential projects on the way.
The Copicut project in Freetown, Mass., is a single-axis tracker solar-plus-storage project with over 12 MW of solar and 22 MWh of storage. Upon completion, it will produce 17,924 MWh of energy annually. The project received an award from the state’s Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program, which provides solar and storage project incentives.
The 2.79 MW Main Street Newbury system is a ground-mount system located in Byfield, Mass. and is fully subscribed to commercial and residential subscribers in Byfield and the surrounding area. This project is expected to produce 3,571 MWh of clean energy annually.
The Saunders Settlement project in Sanborn, New York, is over 6 MW and is expected to produce approximately 8,861 MWh annually.
“At New Leaf Energy, we take pride in focusing on projects that provide the greatest value to decarbonizing the electricity system, and community solar projects fit that bill: they bring clean, renewable power to more consumers and add resiliency to the electrical grid,” said Brendan Neagle, New Leaf Energy’s executive vice president for project finance. “We are excited to continue our partnership with Standard Solar and bring more community solar online where it’s needed most.”
These are not the first solar-plus-storage or community solar sites in the northeast to be acquired by Standard Solar. Just over a year ago Standard Solar announced that it had acquired from EDF Renewables a solar-plus-storage project developed on an EPA Superfund site in Acton, Massachusetts. The project is the 4.69MW/4MWh Lawsbrook Solar + Storage project, and it’s housed on the W.R. Grace Superfund Site, an area formerly used for gravel extraction and acquired by EDF Renewables in 2018. The project also operates under Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Targets (SMART) program, which provides incentives for solar and storage projects.
Also announced last February was the acquisition of a 7MW community solar project in Trenton, ME. The project, Trenton’s first large-scale community solar installation, is also part of the state’s Net Energy Billing program, and will bring a 15% to 25% energy savings to nine leading Maine businesses that have subscribed, sharing the benefits without having to connect to it or invest in its development.
Last September Standard Solar, which is based in Rockville, Maryland, was acquired by Brookfield Renewable for consideration of $540 million with the potential to invest an additional $160 million to support the business’ growth initiatives. Standard Solar is a developer, owner and operator of commercial and community distributed solar. At the time of purchase, Standard Solar had approximately 500 MW of operating and under construction contracted assets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/22/rooftop-solar-installed-on-3-acre-toyota-dealership-building/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,ILLINOIS,ILLINOIS",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 22, 2023",Rooftop solar installed on 3-acre Toyota dealership building,"One of the top 100 largest car dealerships in the United States, Arlington Toyota of Palatine, Illinois, commissioned Texas installer Solar One to build a 1,734-module solar array on its 2.9-acre building. 
The rooftop solar array generated 256,930 kWh of electricity in its first five months of operation, offsetting 50% of the site’s demand. It also offset the dealership’s carbon dioxide emissions by 128 tons. 
Solar One offered the dealership an innovative financing solution with no upfront cost to make the project happen. “The up-front investment required has been a hurdle that we were finally able to overcome with this project,” said Aaron Wilson, chief executive officer, Solar One. 
The installation was built and financed by the installer, and the initial investment will be recouped once Arlington Toyota takes in incentives like Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs), rebates from the state of Illinois, and the federal investment tax credit. 
“SRECs become payable upon certain production targets being achieved, which means it is in the interests of both Solar One and Arlington Toyota that the technology we install will produce the most energy possible,” said Wilson.

Looking to maximize production at the site, Solar One tapped its partnership with inverter and optimizer provider SolarEdge. The project called for five SolarEdge 100 kW inverters along with power optimizers attached to each pair of modules.
The optimizers increase energy production while mitigating the effects of soiling and shading. Optimizers allow for independent operation of the paired modules, meaning that installers can make the most of a roof space, installing some panels near obstructions without risking lowering production for the array system-wide. 
“SolarEdge is now an important part of our identity, and it has enabled us to offer something unique in the market,” said Wilson. 
The company’s optimizers can be remotely monitored for production information and fault detection. Solar One will be sent automatic notifications with a pinpoint location of the fault, allowing for a fast repair. The company said this will lead to reduced maintenance costs over the life of the system, contributing to a return on investment of seven years. 
“Following the success of the Arlington Toyota project, we have since funded projects for several other similar sized businesses in the U.S.,” said Wilson. “Our solution means that customers can install solar with no upfront cost and enjoy 100% of the benefits and the energy it generates.” 
“The solar installation is a tremendous asset to our business, our image, and to our electricity bill, which is now 50% reduced from what it used to be before we installed the system,” said Gary Vicari, president of Arlington Toyota.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/22/bill-gates-funds-advocacy-for-siting-new-transmission-along-highways/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 22, 2023",Bill Gates funds advocacy for siting new transmission along highways,"A survey by NextGen Highways has found that 79% of Minnesota voters support siting new transmission along highways. The survey question read: “Thinking about where electric transmission lines are built, would you prefer they be built on private land like farms, forests or neighborhoods, or on existing infrastructure corridors, like power lines, highways or rail rights-of-way?”
NextGen Highways promotes the use of highways and other existing rights-of-way for transmission and communications infrastructure.
More broadly, the advocacy group “supports siting of transmission anywhere it makes sense for the utility/developer and other stakeholders” said Executive Director Randy Satterfield. Existing infrastructure corridors, such as highways and existing transmission rights-of-way, he said, “should be options” for utilities and developers to consider for transmission lines, adding that “siting on existing corridors can help speed the permitting process and impact fewer private landowners.”
A study last year for the Minnesota Department of Transportation co-led by NextGen Highways Founder Morgan Putnam assessed the feasibility of buried high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission.
Transmission needs
Transmission is needed to carry wind power from the central U.S. eastward, according to a major preliminary finding from a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) study, for the U.S. to reach a high level of renewable generation at least cost. Another draft DOE study projects that the U.S. needs 47,000 more GW-miles of transmission by 2035 for a cleaner grid, an amount representing 57% growth over the current level of transmission.
As part of these needs, thousands of relatively short transmission spur lines will be needed to connect new utility-scale solar, wind and storage projects to the existing transmission grid.
The U.S. Government is pursuing research and development of advanced construction methods for undergrounding high-voltage and high-capacity AC and DC cables, said the White House in a report last November, noting that enabling transmission along the 48,000-mile interstate highway system, plus 140,000 miles of freight rail lines, could “accelerate siting and reduce the costs” of adding transmission.
HVDC costs
The feasibility study co-led by the founder of NextGen Highways determined that buried HVDC transmission is “comparable in cost” to overhead AC transmission. The cost analysis compared the costs per GW-mile of nine overhead AC lines in the Midwest’s MISO grid region that are over 100 miles long, to the costs per GW-mile for three buried HVDC lines of lengths ranging from 175 to 350 miles.
Advocacy plans
NextGen Highways has received funding from Breakthrough Energy to develop state and national advocacy coalitions, beginning in Minnesota, to promote transmission along rights-of-way. The organization is targeting states where there is both “a need for electric transmission development” and where state regulations and policies “prohibit the use of these rights-of-way.”
Breakthrough Energy was founded by Bill Gates, the world’s fourth-richest person, and aims “to inspire the world to develop and scale the critical solutions we need to reach net-zero emissions,” its website says. Its division Breakthrough Energy Ventures counts a number of other wealthy individuals as board members or investors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/22/fast-ev-charging-market-to-grow-sixtyfold-by-2050/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 22, 2023",Fast EV charging market to grow sixtyfold by 2050,"The move to increase adoption of zero-emission vehicles requires an accelerated build-out of electric-vehicle (EV) charging stations. Wood Mackenzie corroborates, noting in its report, Commercial landscape of EV charging networks in North America, that the market for public charging networks in North America is forecast to grow rapidly by 2050.
President Biden set a goal of building out a national network of 500,000 EV chargers, which got a boost with the announced funding to accelerate the creation of zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) corridors that expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure.
Pointing to the necessity of these chargers as EV adoption grows, Nick Esch, research analyst for Grid Edge at Wood Mackenzie, noted that public EV charging networks are crucial. “We are seeing collaboration and integrations among EV charging networks both old and new, as well as significant local and federal policy support, and investment across the public charging market,” said Esch.
There are currently 73 active EV public charging networks in the United States and Canada made up of different network types. As demand is growing, many more entrants are expected to join the market, according to Wood Mackenzie’s findings.

“Gas stations, quick service restaurants, and convenience stores with existing locations are in the early stages of deploying public charging infrastructure as they look to capitalize on their existing retail footprint, as well as EV adoption,” said Amaiya Khardenavis, analyst with EV Charging Infrastructure at Wood Mackenzie.
The Subway quick service restaurant chain is one example, having recently announced a partnership with GenZ EV Solutions, an EV charging development company, to pilot Subway EV Charging Oasis parks at new and existing restaurants.
“The growth strategy of charging networks is focused on building their footprint in high-traffic locations, setting up roaming agreements with other networks, and installing high-power charging infrastructure to future-proof their sites,” said Khardenavis.
DC fast chargers
DC fast chargers (DCFC) are EV chargers that can achieve a charge rate between 50 kW and 350 kW. The report finds that Tesla is the DCFC leader with its ‘Supercharger’ network. It has 17, 408 total DCFC ports and ports per station ratio of 10.5, making it the largest fast-charging network in North America. The next three largest include ChargePoint, EVgo and Electrify America, which have fast charging networks near population centers or highway corridors across the U.S.

“A few networks with established footprints dominate the fast-charging landscape in the U.S. and Canada, such as Tesla. They are followed by emerging networks that are established in regional markets with intentions to grow their reach to new markets,” Esch added.
Level 2 chargers
Level 2 EV chargers have a charge rate between 3 kW and 19 kW of AC power, and ChargePoint leads this category with over 48,000 charging ports in nearly every major metropolitan area across the United States.  The Tesla Destination is the second largest Level 2 network with more than 12,500 ports. SemaConnect is the third, which was acquired by Blink in Q2 2022, and now has a combined network of over 10,000 ports. PowerFlex is the fourth largest, but is primarily in California.

Utilities and automakers are showing signs of understanding the needs of this burgeoning market. There currently are 19 utility-owned EV charging networks operating in North America, according to the report, and these are led by Canadian utilities, which account for 69% of DCFC ports and 55% of level 2 ports.
“While US utilities have initiated investments in public charging, their scope is restricted in size and locations where chargers can be installed is limited by regulators. Canadian utilities have launched province-wide networks that outsize their private competitors,” Khardenavis added.
Automakers understand that in order to sell the electric vehicles that they’re manufacturing at an increasing pace, charging networks are required. Several have announced partnerships with charging infrastructure developers or through direct investments in the deployment of chargers. One example is General Motors’ partnership with EVgo through which they plan to install 3,250 DCFCs in cities and suburbs. The company also announced plans to deploy 2,000 EVgo charging ports along Pilot and Flying J travel centers.
In collaboration with ChargePoint and MN8 Energy, Mercedes has committed to installing over 2,500 charging ports at over 400 locations in North America.
“Since the public EV charging space is highly fractionalized, EV automakers are aiming to own the customer relationship after the point of sale and play a larger role in public EV charging. Many are taking on the e-mobility service provider role, facilitating payments and navigation to chargers while also curating charging networks for their customers through integrations with public charging networks,” Khardenavis said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/22/how-installers-can-communicate-the-benefits-of-ess-to-customers/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 22, 2023",How installers can communicate the benefits of ESS to customers,"For those not immersed in the space, energy storage systems (ESS) can be a tricky concept to understand. As an installer, it’s critical to effectively communicate the many benefits of ESS to customers, to assist them in making an informed purchase decision that best suits the needs of their home.
Here are five communications tactics installers can adopt to help guide sales conversations:
One of the most desirable features of energy storage systems is the ability to save energy for later use, whether it be for power outages or to cut costs during peak hours of energy consumption. In states like California, the grid can sometimes be unreliable due to factors like wildfires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. With ESS, customers can store energy for later use, which is beneficial in situations like the above where an extended power outage is anticipated.
Customers should also understand that ESS serve a greater purpose than backup power generation. Some energy storage systems can also be easily installed and AC-coupled with an existing solar system, helping homeowners cut costs daily and help benefit the planet through using clean energy. Customers with a time-of-use plan can decide when, where, and how their energy is used to offset peak periods when energy costs are the highest.
A major piece of legislation we saw come from last year was the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This legislation permits homeowners to claim a 30 percent tax credit on eligible energy storage installation projects, even when paired with an existing PV system, and filed with the IRS. The IRA allows this benefit through 2032. The residential battery system tax credit is currently uncapped. Since the current market has such a demand for energy storage systems, we can potentially see additional incentives at both a state and federal level.
Beyond the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, many states already have, or are planning to implement, ESS-related incentives. New Jersey and Massachusetts already have plans in place, and New York proposed a roadmap to achieve 6GW of energy by 2030. California has long been the hallmark to adopt clean energy solutions.
In December 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission passed a proposal that greatly reduces the amount of potential savings for solar system installations without storage. Due to the passage of this proposal, as of April 13, 2023, grid-tied systems in California will rarely be installed without an ESS.
Some customers might not fully grasp the concept of energy storage systems. In these instances, highlight three easy points – ease of installation, ease of use, and easy on the eye. Since some ESS can be AC-coupled and paired with an existing solar system, or can be connected directly to the grid, they are much quieter when compared to traditional fossil fuel or diesel generators. They’re also much easier on the eye since many designs are sleek, quiet, and floor-standing, wall-supported – meaning they mesh better with their surroundings and are more aesthetically pleasing.
It doesn’t require a lot of research to see the market’s explosive growth in energy storage systems usage in recent years. With an increase during the past decade in lithium-ion production, ESS have become much more attainable for residential and commercial applications. While setbacks like pandemic-induced supply chain issues have occurred, according to American Clean Power, the ESS market saw continued growth in the last quarter of 2022–the biggest quarter ever for clean energy installations. The demand is there for energy storage systems, and for many potential customers it’s only a matter of time before they decide to purchase. During this time, installers should take the time to educate would-be ESS customers and capitalize on national trends to help customers make informed purchase decisions.
Cost savings are a key factor in the market’s explosive growth  in energy storage systems. When communicating with customers,  be sure to highlight the ongoing savings they will see, and provide them with resources to compare quotes. Resources like EnergySage offer free and detailed advice to help find the right installer.
Be sure to communicate with your customers the long-term savings they are likely to see from ESS and develop a close-knit relationship with manufacturers to effectively communicate key features of the product.

Chris Canfield is the Director of ESS Sales at LG Electronics USA. The LG Electronics Energy Storage Systems business represents a fast-growing new area for LG in the United States, leveraging the company’s renewable energy expertise to unlock value for customers and plug into the new era of sustainability.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/22/residential-solar-quotes-average-2-85-per-watt-said-energysage/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 22, 2023","Residential solar quotes average $2.85 per watt, said EnergySage","EnergySage, a residential solar and storage informational site, released its semiannual market report, now in its eighth year. The report analyzes millions of transaction-level data points gathered from quotes sent to homeowners shopping on the website throughout 2022.
Quoted residential solar prices rose in 2022, climbing 6.7% from 2021 prices, when they reached a new bottom. The average price for solar quoted on EnergySage was $2.85 per watt in 2022.
Energy storage increased in quote prices in 2022 as well, rising by $50 per kWh stored, or about 4%, from 2021 to 2022. EnergySage said most quoted battery prices fall between $13,000 and $18,000 for a single battery. Median storage pricing has risen from $1,140 in H2 2020 to $1,339 in H2 2022.
The average quoted system size increased slightly as well, with systems averaging 10.9 kW, up from 10.2 kW from the previous year. Estimated payback periods shortened slightly, as rising utility bills outpaced rising installed solar array costs.
The top brands continue to dominate quoted systems on EnergySage’s website. Enphase, Tesla, and SolarEdge were the top three, respectively, and together accounted for about 80% market share. Homegrid Energy, the lowest-cost battery quoted on the site, was the only battery priced under $1,000 per kWh to be included in more than 1% of all storage quotes in H2 2022.
Customers requested energy storage to be included in the quote 67% of the time in 2022, while battery attachment rates were about 14% nationwide. This is down slightly from 15.5% battery attachment rates in H2 2021. California, Arizona, and Nevada had the highest battery attachment rates, while Tennessee, Indiana, and Georgia ranked within the bottom three states for battery attachment.
Among the top eight largest residential solar markets, Arizona had the lowest cost per Watt average at $2.38, while Massachusetts was the highest at $3.56 per Watt on average. California averaged $2.80 per Watt for quotes system prices in 2022. The north central U.S. has the highest quoted prices nationwide, with Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin all at least $0.50 per Watt higher than the national median quote price. Under these median prices, a quote for the median system size in Arizona would be over $15,000 less expensive than a quote for the same system in Indiana.
Notably, 61% of EnergySage shoppers did not select the lowest-priced quote that they received during 2022. Equipment quality and installer ratings were also often considered with a final buying decision.
Average quoted system sizes were the lowest in California (8.5 kW) while Arkansas had the largest average system size (14.9 kW). The seven states with the largest quoted system sizes in H2 2022 are all south of the Mason-Dixon line. On the other hand, five of the six states with the smallest system sizes are either in the West or the Northeast, said EnergySage.
Over the last two years, Qcells has steadily gained in share in the EnergySage marketplace, overtaking REC in 2022 as the most quoted brand. Throughout all of 2022, 390 W to 400 W panels were quoted the most, with one in five quotes including a panel 400 W or larger. Nearly 100% (99.7%) were 330 W or higher.
“As installers looked to find secure supply during shortages in 2022, the share of quotes represented by the top three brands on EnergySage continued to drop–from 66% of quotes in 2021 to 58% in 2022,” said the report.
Enphase remained the most quoted inverter for the sixth-straight semiannual report. Enphase and SunPower-branded Enphase products were included in 68% of quotes on the EnergySage marketplace.
Brand loyalty continues to grow among installers. In the second half of 2022, 59% of installers offered only a single inverter brand, the highest level of brand loyalty the website has reported in any six-month period since it began tracking this information in 2014.
“2022 was a transformative year for the solar and energy storage industry, marked by moments of celebration as well as new obstacles to overcome,” said EnergySage CEO and founder Vikram Aggarwal. “While the solar tax credit was extended and expanded under the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in August, we also saw California pass new rules that negatively affect its net metering program. Through these highs and lows, consumers continue to depend on EnergySage for help understanding and navigating the complexities of their electrification journey. Our unique, unbiased, first-party data is relied on by contractors, manufacturers, government agencies, policymakers, non-profits, and financing providers as well.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/22/50-states-of-solar-incentives-nebraska/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEBRASKA",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 22, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Nebraska,"Nebraska is ranked thirteenth in the United States with the greatest energy potential from solar power, according to the sun index developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab. Yet, through Q4 2022, Nebraska was ranked 47th in the country for solar installations, with only 83 MW installed, or enough to power just under 10,000 homes.

While both wind and sun are abundant in Nebraska, electricity rates are not motivation enough for residents to go solar. Nebraskans enjoy the second lowest electric rate in the country—currently 9.84 cents per kWh according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Nebraska obtains nearly half of its electricity needs from coal, 25% from wind, 18% from nuclear, 4% from natural gas and 3% from hydropower—it gets just .30% from the sun, per EIA.
Incentives
Nebraska is the only state in the U.S. in which all electric utilities are publically owned. The state currently does not have a renewable portfolio standard, but it does have net metering legislation.
In 2009, Nebraska enacted legislation that established interconnection and net metering rules for all of the utilities in the state, requiring them to provide interconnection and net metering for renewables at or below 25 kW. Net Metering is required until the aggregate generating capacity equals 1% of the utility’s average aggregate monthly peak demand for that year. After tha the utility can choose whether to offer  more net meting capacity or not. Net excell genration must be credited at the utilityy’s avoided cost rate for that month and carried forward to the next billing period, but any remaining at the end of an annualized period must be paid to the customer.
Community solar
Community solar, which is a way for community members to purchase solar energy without having to install solar panels on their home or business, is taking shape in Nebraska, with small, mostly kW-scale installations dotting the state. Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) offers the SunWise program, which enables community solar in its territory and includes what is currently the largest solar plant in the state.

Landmark installation
An 8.5 MW community solar installation in Norfolk is currently the largest in the state. The system was developed by Sol Systems in partnership with EPC firm GenPro Energy Solutions and real estate development firm Mesner Development. Sol Systems and NPPD entered a 30-year power purchase agreement, providing a fixed cost of energy for NPPD and Norfolk residents for decades.
Aside from being the largest installation in the state, the project has a few more claims to fame. It includes NPPD’s first large-scale battery storage system, capable of storing up to 2 MWh. It’s also a pollinator habitat, was led by an all-woman development team, and provides internships to local college students. The development team comprised of all women sets the project apart not only in Nebraska, but across the whole country, as women currently comprise only 30% of the solar.
The internships are part of a partnership between Sol Systems and Northeast Community College (NECC), which awarded three scholarships to students interested in the school’s Electrical Construction and Control Program. In further partnership with NECC, GenPro established internships for students enrolled in the Electrical Construction and Control Program, providing them with hands-on experience helping to construct the array.
“The project will service this community with clean, renewable energy for decades while creating strong community impact through our scholarship work with NECC,” said Anna Toenjes, senior director of business development at Sol Systems. “In addition, I am personally proud to have been a part of an all-female team at Sol that led the contract negotiations, development and financing of this solar + storage project.”
