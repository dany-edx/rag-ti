Schletter Group, an international solar installation manufacturer, launched a redeveloped pitched roof mounting system. The company said its ProLine system is lighter, more load-bearing, and easier to install than its predecessor, due to its new profile geometries and connecting elements. The new product line is available in Europe and will appear in international markets in the next few months.
At the heart of the system lies a newly developed installation profile. The design means that less material is used than with the existing Schletter standard profiles. At the same time, the profile can cope with higher loads. The profile is available in three versions: 35 mm high for lower spans, 50 mm high for medium and large spans, and 70 mm high for large spans. More info available here.
Silicon Valley startup Amber Solutions announced its solid-state-based Energy Traffic Controller with embedded intelligence that enables on-the-fly switching of building electricity sources. The capability uses the company’s digital control of electricity to provide electricity management.
The device would be installed next to the circuit breaker box to monitor a building’s energy demand and available electricity sources, thus supporting autonomous source optimization. It would empower data crunching for dynamic decision making, using metrics such as the price and stability of grid energy during peak hours, the availability of solar power, and the current charge level on any connected battery backup systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/19/massachusetts-lawmakers-send-climate-bill-to-governor-a-third-and-final-time/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 19, 2021",Massachusetts lawmakers send climate bill to governor a third (and final) time,"The Massachusetts state legislature again passed a sweeping climate change bill, sending it to the governor’s desk for a third time. Solar energy and environmental advocates praised the bill and called on the governor to sign it into law.
The bill, “An Act Creating a Next-Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy,” has been bouncing back and forth between the Democrat-controlled legislature and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker over the past few months. Baker “reluctantly” vetoed the bill in January when the legislative session ended.
Determined to push ahead, lawmakers refiled and passed an identical bill shortly after the new session started. Baker then sent that legislation back with a host of proposed changes to address his concerns about financial impacts and what he considered to be misguided, overly ambitious goals.

House and Senate leaders said they accepted some of Baker’s “more technical” amendments, but they ultimately rejected what they said were “efforts to slow the rate of progress.”
The Senate passed the revised bill 39-1 on March 15; the House followed with a 146-13 vote on March 18. Both votes are considered veto-proof majorities.
The final legislation maintains most of the original provisions. In part, it would raise Massachusetts’ renewable portfolio standard by 3% annually for 2025-2029, ensuring that at least 40% of the state’s electric power would be renewable by 2030; mandate more offshore wind energy procurement; set a number of energy efficiency requirements; pump millions of dollars into clean energy workforce development; and, for the first time, codify “environmental justice” into state law.
Although Baker and lawmakers supported the bill’s overall goal to put the state on a path toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, they disagreed on near-term targets. Baker took issue with the bill’s mandate to cut state emissions no less than 50% below 1990 levels by 2030. He proposed a lower, more flexible target of 45%. The final version keeps the higher mandate.
Lawmakers welcomed Baker’s proposals to strengthen the bill’s environmental justice provisions. They also agreed to revise sector-specific emissions limits so that they wouldn’t be legally binding so long as the state reaches its broader goals.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) applauded the bill’s re-passage and commended the legislature for keeping key solar provisions in the final version.
The bill includes a long-awaited agreement between state tax assessors and developers. SEIA played a role in reaching the compromise, which will provide critical tax certainty for solar projects.
David Gahl, SEIA’s senior director of state policy for the East, said, “Solar developers and customers need to know the rules of the road, and this legislation clears up a loophole that could essentially double-tax renewable energy customers.”
The legislation also contains provisions to encourage the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program to serve more low- to moderate-income people.

The legislation also contains provisions that would encourage the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program to serve more low- to moderate-income people, and would exempt businesses with on-site installations from the state’s solar net metering caps.
BlueHub Capital, a nonprofit community finance organization, praised the bill’s low-income solar provisions. For example, BlueHub said the bill would lift geographic restrictions for participation in community solar programs. It said this would help take down barriers that have limited access to solar for low-income households and tenants in Boston, nearby communities, and other environmental justice neighborhoods.
Solar and environmental advocates have called on Baker to sign the bill. Despite the governor’s previous objections, local reports said administration officials indicated Baker is happy with the final bill and likely to sign it. If he decides not to, however, the bill cannot be amended. And because it passed the legislature with veto-proof margins, the bill is almost certain to become law.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/19/watch-grab-a-birds-eye-view-of-this-massive-georgia-solar-portfolio/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GEORGIA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 19, 2021",Watch: Grab a bird’s-eye view of this massive Georgia solar portfolio,"Green Power EMC and Silicon Ranch have announced the completion of a three-project, 200 MW solar portfolio in southern Georgia.
But maybe just knowing about the portfolio isn’t enough for you. Maybe you want a birds-eye view of the projects and a look behind the curtain at their construction. Luckily enough, Green Power EMC posted a project overview on their vimeo channel, with considerable drone footage.
All three sites were developed, funded, and built by Silicon Ranch, which also owns and operates the projects, as well as overseeing maintenance of the arrays. Green Power EMC is buying all the energy and environmental attributes generated by the facilities on behalf of its member EMCs for the next 30 years.
The three projects are: Hazlehurst III, a 40 MW installation active as of December 2019; the Terrell Solar Farm, a 74 MW installation active as of August 2020; and Snipesville I, an 86 MW facility active as of December 2020.
Of the 38 Georgia Electric Membership Corporations that Green Power EMC serves, 32 will share in the three facilities’ generated electricity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/19/how-extending-the-solar-itc-can-foster-an-equitable-energy-transition/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,INTERVIEW,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 19, 2021",How extending the solar ITC can foster an equitable energy transition,"One of the few truly bipartisan aspects of the nation’s shift to renewable energy is the broad agreement that it should not come at the expense of workers who rely on jobs in fossil fuels and traditional automobile production for their livelihoods.
In early March, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) introduced legislation that would use $8 billion in federal funds to bring clean energy manufacturing and recycling to former fossil fuel sites. One goal of the bills is to  help transition workers to jobs in the clean energy sector.
While this legislation is a start, the full transition will take more than just one piece of legislation.
To understand the scope of the effort, pv magazine USA sat down with Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy at SunPower, and a member of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Board of Directors.
“We, as a country, need to first focus on ensuring that we grow demand for clean energy, especially distributed solar and storage,” said Leta.
While manufacturing and recycling are important aspects of PV and the renewable industry as a whole, keeping up demand for residential and commercial solar projects is critical. According to Leta, installers and developers make up more than two-thirds of the roughly 250,000 jobs in the solar industry, and roughly 75% of that workforce is involved in distributed energy in some capacity.
Leta said that demand for solar will be sustained first by a long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). The ITC has historically spurred project development, and a long-term extension would bolster demand. And any distributed solar installation looking to claim the ITC must use a fully-American workforce, which Leta sees as a potential pipeline for fossil fuel workers.
“The main benefit of a long-term ITC is that it reduces the upfront cost” of a solar array installation, she said. Reducing upfront costs can prompt investment from a wider range of customers and opens up accessibility to those who otherwise may not have be able to afford an installation.
A critical related element is net metering, a credit that many homeowners rely on to get the maximum value out of their solar system and one which has been a target for utilities and legislators.
“Net energy metering is fundamental to customer economics,” said Leta.
Another important aspect of ITC extension, and one that Leta said has been under-recognized, is the need for parity between section 25-D of the tax code, which is for individuals, and section 48, which is for corporations.
As it stands, the value of the ITC is at a permanent 10% for corporations under section 48, but drops to 0% for individuals, starting in 2024, under section 25-D.
Leta said that around 70% of the U.S. residential market is sold through cash and loans. And many of these sales depend on the 25-D benefit. Allowing it to fall to 0% by mid-decade could cut accessibility for potential customers. Extending the ITC for individuals under section 25-D is critical to sustaining customer ownership, which also helps with housing affordability, Leta said.
Then, too, making the ITC permanent for corporations but eliminating it for individuals shows a bias toward one type of customer. That bias may hinder the goal of sustaining solar demand and, ultimately, impact the goal of keeping people employed and supporting broad workforce goals for former fossil industry workers.
“Don’t get me wrong: we need a long-term ITC extension for both,” Leta said. “We just want to make sure that it’s truly equal.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/19/sunrise-brief-california-approves-electric-microgrid-program-for-vulnerable-communities/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 19, 2021",Sunrise brief: California approves electric microgrid program for vulnerable communities,"The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approved a microgrid plan for Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) to support local governments and tribes and provide resiliency in the event of utility outages.
One-time matching funds of up to $27 million annually for 2021 and 2022 are available to defray the cost of special facilities or distribution system upgrades. The program reserves one-third of total budget, or $9 million a year, for disadvantaged and vulnerable communities, with an opportunity to increase this reserved amount if needed.
Microgrid systems are capped 20 at MW to account for the typical maximum capacity for a 21 kV distribution circuit. The utility told regulators that facilities larger than 20 MW would need to be connected to a substation bus or transmission line. It said that was a more complex and expensive undertaking and outside of the program’s target scope and funding.
Microgrid systems are capped 20 MW to account for the typical maximum capacity for a 21 kV distribution circuit.

Local and tribal governments developing community microgrids serving multiple critical facilities located in outage-prone areas are eligible for the program. PG&E will provide technical support, including project scoping, project design guidance, and a dedicated project management office.
Hydro-Québec’s Center of Excellence in Transportation Electrification and Energy Storage and the University of South Wales signed commercial agreements transferring patented hydrogen storage technology from USW to Hydro-Québec to enable its commercialization. The pact is part of ongoing efforts to decarbonize industry and provide alternative, cleaner sources of energy.
The USW technology enables hydrogen to be absorbed into material at higher concentrations and densities, increasing its capacity for hydrogen storage.
The technology is expected to offer a number of advantages over existing hydrogen storage options, including greater storage capacity, less weight for the same capacity, increased safety as a result of lower tank pressure, lower manufacturing costs, simplified infrastructure, and no need for liquefaction, generating savings in large-scale transport.
Applications include transporting large quantities of hydrogen safely, or being able to have reservoirs of hydrogen-powered vehicles that can hold larger quantities of hydrogen in a smaller space.
Hydro-Québec said it will work with the patents over the next two years to bring them to the commercial stage.
The San Antonio, Texas, city council granted CPS Energy authority to seek up to a $500 million line of credit to provide liquidity, if needed, to support ongoing operations.
The line of credit is seen as a backstop as the city-owned utility challenges purchased power charges from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) related to the mid-February winter storm that crippled the state’s electric power grid.
<
The council also passed a resolution supporting the utility’s plan to seek and state financial and policy assistance; pursue regulatory intervention; and negotiations. CPS Energy earlier sued ERCOT in an effort to prevent what it said were charges to CPS Energy and its customers.
The state’s regulatory outlook became murkier when the final member of the Public Utility Commission, Arthur D’Andrea, resigned.
Gov. Greg Abbott asked for D’Andrea’s resignation hours after Texas Monthly reported that the regulator told out-of-state investors on a call he would work to stop calls to reverse billions of dollars in charges for wholesale electricity during the storm.
On March 15, the Texas Senate passed a bill to force the PUC to reverse those charges. D’Andrea had publicly resisted such calls.
D’Andrea was promoted to chair by Abbott early in March to replace the previous chair, DeAnn Walker, who resigned over fallout related to the winter storm. The other commissioner, Shelly Botkin, resigned a week after Walker.
Green Power EMC, the renewable energy provider for 38 Georgia Electric Membership Corporations, and Silicon Ranch announced completion of a 200 MW solar portfolio that includes three utility-scale projects in southern Georgia.
The total capacity is spread across two counties in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the state.
The three sites were developed, funded, and built by Silicon Ranch, which also owns, operates, and maintains the arrays. Green Power EMC is buying all the energy and environmental attributes generated by the facilities on behalf of its member EMCs for the next 30 years.
The first site, known as Hazlehurst III, came online in December 2019 and is a 40 MW facility. In August 2020, Silicon Ranch commissioned the second site, the 74 MW Terrell Solar Farm. In December 2020, the partners commissioned the third site in the portfolio, Snipesville I, an 86 MW facility.
