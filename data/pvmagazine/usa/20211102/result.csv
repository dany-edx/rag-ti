The project is supported by eight three-phase SE 66K inverters, and 720 SolarEdge power optimizers. A total of 1,440 LG Neon 400W bifacial modules were installed, and will be monitored via local SCADA as well as a SolarEdge monitoring platform.
The project was funded by the Northwest Arctic Borough’s village improvement funds, the U.S. Department of Energy Tribal Energy funds, and KEA capital funding, with support from NANA Regional Corp.
Alaska has the fourth-highest energy demand per capita in the U.S., and electricity prices are double the national average. KEA consumes more than 1.2 million gallons of diesel fuel per year for electricity, which costs the association as much as $5 million each year.
Fuel use was supplemented by 66 kW of wind power, but that resource was decommissioned once it reached the end of its useful life. A low-cost alternative to diesel and wind was needed, and solar was selected as the solution.
SolarEdge said KEA will now be 25-30% renewably-powered, and the association will save more than 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel, or about $100,000, annually. SolarEdge said KEA will also have lower maintenance costs by cutting the number of diesel generators it needs to operate.
The project was developed by Alaska Native Renewable Industries (ANRI). With a snowy landscape for more than two thirds of the year, ANRI selected LG bifacial modules to utilize the albedo, or reflected light, from the ground. SolarEdge said that using bifacial modules is expected to give the system a 5% boost in production.
The panels are to be used in conjunction with SolarEdge’s maximum power point tracker (MPPT) at module-level, which the company said will cut losses by about 3% the first year when compared to string inverters. SolarEdge said it also will help KEA cut maintenance costs by using its remote troubleshooting service.

The company is the first solar tracker hardware and software provider to reach this benchmark.
The company credits the sales feat to its internal focus on improving financial returns for owners of solar projects.
The company also recognized the success of its TrueCapture smart control software, announcing that the product has sold more than 20 GW across more than 150 projects. The solution helps utility-scale solar power plants mitigate drops in power output triggered by cloud cover or neighboring panels casting a shadow.
On November 09 at our virtual Roundtables USA event, Director of Software Product Management, Aron Dobos, join pv magazine USA and other star speakers to discuss the growing use of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software applications to enhance solar performance.

Navisun acquires, co-develops, constructs, finances, and operates both distributed and small utility-scale and storage projects across the U.S. Founded in 2017, the Massachusetts company targets solar and storage projects ranging from 1 MW to 30 MW.
The deal with Navisun represents OMERS Infrastructure’s entry into the distributed generation space. OMERS Infrastructure is the infrastructure investment advisor and manager of OMERS, the pension plan for municipal employees in the Province of Ontario, Canada.
Financial details were not disclosed. CohnReznick Capital Markets Securities served as financial advisor to OMERS, and Sharman & Sterling provided legal advice. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter, subject to regulatory approval. 
OMERS holdings also include Leeward Renewable Energy, owner and operator of 22 renewable energy facilities with a combined installed capacity of over 2 GW in the United States. In April, Leeward closed on a roughly 10 GW PV development pipeline from module manufacturer First Solar.
In October, Leeward signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with Valley Clean Energy, a California community choice aggregator. The is in Kern County and includes 72 MW solar and 35 MW (144 MWh) of storage.

In the filing, Alliant said it plans to acquire 200 MW of solar energy and 75 MW of battery energy storage from Phase I and II of the Duane Arnold Solar Project. The project will be developed by units of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC in Linn County near Cedar Rapids.
A decision from Iowa regulators is anticipated in the second half of 2022. If approved, the capacity could enter service at the end of 2024. Alliant said it plans to own and operate both projects.
The projects are planned to repurpose a portion of the land and infrastructure at the former Duane Arnold nuclear energy facility. Existing transmission infrastructure on the site will be used.
The utility said it expects to outline plans for the remaining 200 MW of solar generation in Iowa at a future date. Once all the new projects are operational, combined with Alliant Energy’s existing 1,300 MW of wind generation, nearly 50% of the company’s total resource mix in Iowa will be from renewable resources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/02/another-module-maker-may-face-wro-enforcement-roth-capital-warns/,"LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PRODUCTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021","Another module maker may face WRO enforcement, Roth Capital warns","Solar analyst firm Roth Capital Partners said in a note to clients that it believes LONGi may be the next module manufacturer to be the subject of U.S. Customs and Border Protection action under a Withhold Release Order (WRO) issued in June.
“While detainment appears to have not yet happened, we believe it is imminent,” Roth said in a note obtained by pv magazine. The note said that LONGi had been informed that shipments currently on the water were expected to be detained at five ports. “Look for this to impact LONGi in a broad-based way,” the analyst’s note said.
The note said that Trina recently slowed or even stopped module flow “meaningfully” and changed terms on customers, in some cases increasing prices by around $0.10 a Watt.
On June 24, Customs and Border Protection announced that imports containing silica from a Chinese company called Hoshine would be banned due to concerns of forced labor.

On June 24, the Biden administration ordered a ban on U.S. imports from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. over forced labor allegations. The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies, and what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
The three other companies added to the U.S. economic list included Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp.; Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a unit of Shanghai-based manufacturer East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co., part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd.
Industry analysts believe that Hoshine provides around 60% of the world’s metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si) used in the solar industry. The silicon provides feedstock material used in the polysilicon refining process.
In August, reports first emerged that CBP was detaining solar modules that they suspected contained material subject to the WRO.
News of possible CBP action involving another module manufacturer was not unexpected. Federal enforcement of the WRO at U.S. ports of entry has been expected to evolve over time. A challenge for the solar industry is to prove that supply chains do not contain any material sourced from the targeted suppliers. Because Beijing denies that forced labor exists within China, it has been difficult to trace suppliers as far back as the mines, which is what the WRO targeted.
The anti-circumvention tariff issue mentioned in the Roth note referred to a petition filed in August by a group known as American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC). Through its attorneys, the group asked officials at the U.S. Department of Commerce to investigate whether imports from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam were unfair. The petitions argued that Chinese companies had shifted production to those nations in recent years to avoid existing U.S. duties on solar cells and panels made in China.
In late September, the Commerce Department deferred a decision and asked the group to identify its members. In early October the group revealed its members to Commerce officials, but declined to make the names public, citing concern over possible retribution.
U.S. solar panel imports fell during the third quarter by around  27%, the largest single-quarter drop since 2018, according to research firm Panjiva, with analysis provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Total module shipments were also down 11%, compared to Q3 2020, according to S&P.
In an email to pv magazine in October, Timothy Brightbill, an attorney with the Wiley Rein law firm that represents A-SMACC, said that the decline in module imports to the U.S. during the third quarter has been “most pronounced from Malaysia” with the decline beginning in July, and accelerating in August. He said that the A-SMACC petitions were filed on August 16 and that the drop in imports appeared to correspond with the “wide reports that that Customs and Border Protection had detained major solar import shipments.”
He said that imports from Thailand and Vietnam started to fall “sharply” in June and July.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/02/catl-signs-electric-vehicle-battery-supply-deal-with-fisker/,"EV,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",CATL signs electric vehicle battery supply deal with Fisker,"Fisker Inc. signed an agreement with China-based battery supplier CATL for battery capacity for the Fisker Ocean SUV electric vehicle.
CATL will supply two different battery types, with an initial battery capacity of more than 5 GWh annually, from 2023-2025. The primary pack uses a lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cell chemistry. The second will be based on lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) chemistry.
Fisker and CATL teams have been working since 2020 to develop battery options optimized for vehicle structure, crash-worthiness, and high levels of energy density. Currently, the two are involved in testing and validation at the pack and vehicle level.
Fisker CEO and Chairman, Henrik Fisker, said that by using multiple chemistries and designing an efficient pack, his company will be able to achieve its targeted driving range for the Fisker Ocean Sport and bring “segment benchmark-driving range” to the longer-range versions of Fisker Ocean.
The Fisker Ocean battery packs are being designed to enable direct charging from an optional solar roof. Both battery packs are intended to support peak charging of more than 250 kW.
Fisker said it is on target to start production and deliveries in November 2022. It has plans to unveil a production version, including additional battery specifications and product features, at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this month.
In its latest quarterly report, Fisker said it was nearing 17,500 retail and 1,400 fleet reservations for vehicles. In May, the company signed a framework agreement with Hon Hai Technology Group (operating as Foxconn) to develop the vehicles. Foxconn also invested in the electric vehicle project. The two companies set up a program management office between the U.S. and Taiwan to coordinate design, engineering, purchasing, and manufacturing.
