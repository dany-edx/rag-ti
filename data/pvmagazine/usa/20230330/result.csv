More than 50 school system leaders representing 16 U.S. states joined policy makers in Washington, D.C. this week at the first-ever Clean Energy Schools Symposium.
Organized by non-profit group Generation180, the event brought together members of the organizer’s School Leadership in Clean Energy or SLICE network. Comprised of superintendents, facilities directors, transportation directors, and other education leaders, the SLICE members joined with newcomers and federal policy-makers to discuss clean energy benefits to school districts and their communities across the country.
According to a recent report from Generation180, nearly one in ten public schools have a solar installation. The decisionmakers invited to attend are in the top tier of the country leading the adoption of clean energy in the education sector, and this week they were awarded a scholarship for recognition as part of the SLICE network.
Symposium topics included zero emissions goals, solar-plus-storage microgrid incentivization, and federal funding opportunities for schools pursuing clean energy and energy efficiency upgrades.
“Saving money with solar energy has been a game-changer for our district by enabling us to raise pay and retain quality teachers,” said Dr. Michael Hester, superintendent of Batesville Public Schools in Arkansas.
Clean school buses
One entire day of the symposium focused on electric school buses, where participants discussed the electrification of U.S. bus fleets, and received advice and support for creating fleetwide bus plans at school systems, while learning about financial incentives for converting fleets.
In October 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the second distribution of $1 billion of awards from the $5 billion multi-year Clean School Bus Program to 391 rebate recipients. The federal clean bus incentivization program of the Environmental Protection Agency from April 2022 awards rebates to school systems that upgrade their school bus fleets from conventional to electric buses over the next five years.  A first round of $500 million funding was awarded in May 2022.
The second round of Clean School Bus funding of $1 billion will support the purchase of more than 2,600 buses, of which 95% will be electric from more than 400 applicants, according to the federal government.
The federal program awards $285,000 or $375,000 per zero emissions mid-sized Class 3 to 6 or large-capacity Class 7 buses for qualifying school districts that meet one or more of the EPA’s criteria, without preference to any individual criteria:
Generation180
School districts that do not meet one or more of the EPA’s criteria are still eligible to receive $190,000 or $250,000 per Class 3 to 6 or Class 7+ vehicle. The program also awards $15,000 to $30,000 per vehicle funding for buses that switch from conventional fuel to compressed natural gas or propane-fueled vehicles.
As part of the initial funding round, the EPA announced that 22 New York state school districts will share from $69.2 million in federal funding for converting 184 buses to electric buses. In another large award, the South Carolina Department of Education announced a 160-electric school bus order earlier this week from Thomas Built Buses and Proterra. 
“Given the disproportionate impact of poor air quality and climate change on low-income students and students of color, investments in clean technologies like renewables and electric school buses have a central role to play in advancing environmental justice in school communities,” said Sue Gander, director of the World Resources Institute’s school bus initiative, one of the event workshop sponsors.
The Clean Energy Schools Symposium received scholarship and event funding from freight and logistics company FedEx.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/30/tesla-misses-its-own-expectations-for-solar-roof-deployments/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 30, 2023",Tesla misses its own expectations for Solar Roof deployments ,"Tesla announced its Solar Roof to much fanfare back in 2016, and three years ago the company stated that it had a goal of 1,000 installations per week. Yet, only about 3,000 Solar Roof systems have been installed to date, according to data from Wood Mackenzie, with a total capacity of nearly 30 MW (DC).
Wood Mackenzie, for the first time, identified Tesla Solar Roof installations using its proprietary project-level data sets and summarized the key findings in a report titled, ‘Five Years In: Tesla Solar Roof deployments miss expectations’.
“The Tesla Solar Roof, an innovative roofing system made of glass tiles with embedded photovoltaic cells, attracted considerable attention after its initial launch several years ago. But granular installation data has always been elusive, making it challenging to analyze the product’s growth – until now,” said Max Issokson, research analyst and lead author of the report.
Despite Tesla’s 2020 stated goal to install 1,000 systems per week, Wood Mackenzie analysis shows that average Solar Roof installations per week were just 21 in 2022, and the largest quarter for installations was the first quarter of 2022, which saw 32 systems installed per week.

Looking at the entire roofing market in the U.S., which installs an estimated 5 million roofs built annually, Tesla held less than 0.03% of the total roofing market in 2022, according to the report.
“As the residential solar industry continues to grow, solar roofing solutions will play an important role in offering customers flexibility and alternatives to conventional modules. The future potential of Tesla’s Solar Roof will rely on the company’s ability to simplify and streamline installations and tap into a broader customer base,” Issokson concluded.
Tesla is not alone in the building-integrated solar roofing market. GAF Energy, CertainTeed, SunStyle, Suntegra Solar, Forward and Luma Solar are other manufacturers who have gotten in on the game. Today GAF Energy, a prominent residential roofing company, is a market leader in the sub-sector with its Timberline Solar product. Its nailable solar shingle was announced at CES 2022, where it won the Best of Innovation award. What sets the Timberline apart from Tesla’s Solar Roof is that the roof system directly integrates solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials, according to Wood Mackenzie.
“GAF Energy’s Timberline Solar roofing system is better positioned to achieve widespread adoption,” said Issokson. “The product is faster and easier to install, and the company captures customers when they are considering roof replacements.”
Tesla has had a tough time in the residential solar installation market as well. Wood Mackenzie noted in its 2022 solar installer Leaderboard that Freedom Forever had overtaken Tesla in the top three residential market spot for the first time, securing 4% of the U.S. market the previous year. Sunrun and Titan Solar Energy held the top two spots, respectively.
Tesla’s stock, which trades on the Nasdaq exchange as ‘TSLA,’ was up 1.25% today to $196.25 per share, however, it traded down about 5% over the last month.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/30/canada-formalizes-six-year-30-federal-itc-credit-among-other-incentives/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CANADA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 30, 2023","Canada formalizes six-year 30% federal ITC credit, among other incentives","Canada’s federal government outlined a six-year investment tax credit this week that puts a 30% tax credit in place for solar, wind and energy storage projects deployed through March 2034.
The Clean Technology ITC was included as part of the Canadian government’s March 28, 2023 Budget Day fiscal priorities, with the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister releasing the government’s 2023 federal budget titled, “A Made-In-Canada Plan.”
The Canadian government is prioritizing a clean energy economy as one of three main pillars of its multi-year budget. The federal government has a goal of making its electric grid net zero by 2035, spurring $20.9 billion in tax incentives for clean energy projects over the next six years.
Mirroring the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act as a backdrop, Canada’s Budget 2023 includes two new ITCs targeting clean energy and technology manufacturing. In the government’s remarks this week, it said the new plan allows Canada to remain competitive alongside its southern neighbor.
Clean Technology ITC
In the government’s 2022 Fall Economic Statement, it proposed a 30% refundable Clean Technologies ITC, available to eligible properties that are acquired or become available for use on or after March 28, 2023. In Budget 2023, the government expanded this ITC to apply to geothermal energy projects, in addition to solar, wind and energy storage. The term of the ITC was also extended from phasing out in 2032, as was intended under the 2022 proposal, and will remain at 30% through December 2033, stepping down to 15% in 2034 before phasing out altogether after 2034.
Clean Electricity ITC
A new incentive that the Canadian government is providing is a refundable 15% investment tax credit on the capital costs made by non-taxable entities. These include indigenous or tribal communities, municipal utilities and Crown-corporations that make investments in renewable energy, energy storage, interprovincial power transmission and other clean energy infrastructure projects.
The ITC also applies to new hydroelectric, wave/tidal projects, nuclear (including small modular reactors), and abated natural gas-fired generation.
The Clean Hydrogen ITC was announced as part of the government’s 2022 proposals. New details of the basic design elements of the hydrogen ITC include a volumetric ITC credit based on carbon intensity of the project, measured by kilograms of carbon emissions produced per kilogram of hydrogen, and meeting prescribed labor conditions.

As detailed in the above chart, green hydrogen produced using the least carbon emissions and produced with claimable trained labor can see an ITC of up to 40%, while grey or blue hydrogen as its called using lesser carbon recovery can see a 5% to 25% ITC, depending on labor conditions.
Clean Manufacturing ITC 
The government lined up a 30% refundable tax credit incentive for investment in machinery and equipment used to manufacture clean energy project components and extract relevant critical minerals sourced across Canada. This tax credit is available for the manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage equipment, and the recycling of critical minerals used in EV and energy storage batteries.
Recapitalization of SREPs
Under the Budget 2023, Canada’s government pledged $30 billion in recapped investment to the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways (SREPs) program, a program that supports regional priorities and indigenous-led projects.
Similar to the U.S. IRA, the Fall 2022 proposal indicated Canada’s intention to include prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for the proposed Clean Technology and Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credits. Budget 2023 proposes a wage and apprenticeship target for labor related to renewable energy, green hydrogen, carbon capture technology, and excluding zero-emission vehicles or low-carbon heat equipment. The labor requirements apply to work performed beginning on October 1, 2023.
With respect to the wage component, business owners must ensure all covered workers are paid in an amount at least equal to the relevant wage plus the value of standard benefits and pension contributions as would be provided in an “eligible collective agreement.” In provinces other than Québec, the collective agreement is generally comparable for the relevant industry and type of work performed which aligns with the worker’s duties and location. In Québec, the eligible collective agreements are those negotiated under relevant provincial law.
With respect to the apprenticeship component, 10% of total workforce hours in the relevant tax year by covered workers doing work on subsidized project elements must be done by registered apprentices.
The labor requirements apply to those workers engaged directly by the project owner or through contractors and subcontractors on project development or infrastructure projects. Labor requirements do not apply to administrative, clerical, supervisory or executives at such firms.
Canada’s Budget 2023 includes $20 billion in support of clean energy project investments, including at least $10 billion through the Clean Power priority area and at least $10 billion through the Green Infrastructure priority area as constituted by the Canadian Infrastructure Bank.
Toronto-based Westbridge Renewable Energy, a utility-scale solar developer, issued a statement applauding the Budget 2023 initiatives:
“Access to low-cost, clean energy is one of the most critical factors in helping Canada reduce carbon emissions, transition to a green economy, and foster economic growth. With Canada’s power usage expected to double by 2050, it is imperative to invest in clean technology that will help us meet that demand in a sustainable way,” said Stefano Romanin, chief executive officer of Westbridge.

The modules, which will be delivered through 2028, will power EDP Renewables’ U.S. project portfolio.
EDP Renewables is a global renewable energy producer, and its subsidiary EDP Renewables North America currently operates 475 MW of solar projects with 1.6 GW of solar projects under construction. The company also operates more than 200 distributed generation solar sites throughout North America. For example, EDPR has installed 51 distributed energy projects for Walmart across seven states from Arizona and California to New Jersey and Maryland. Including both utility-scale and DG, EDPR plans to add 4.8 GW of solar capacity in North America over the next three years.
“EDP Renewables’ ambitious business plan calls for more than 4 GW of renewable capacity annually through 2026 with nearly half of the new clean energy generation to come from North America,” said Sandhya Ganapathy, chief executive officer, EDPR NA. “Solar is an increasingly important technology in our portfolio, and we are well-positioned to work with innovative and environmentally responsible partners and products that can help us meet our outlined targets and lead the energy transition.”
First Solar is a U.S. manufacturer of solar modules made with cadmium telluride thin-film technology, which has a lower carbon intensity to manufacture than traditional polysilicon solar cells. It is the only company among the ten largest global solar module manufacturers to be a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the world’s largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain.
“We welcome EDP Renewables’ decision to power its projects with our technology and look forward to supporting its growth in the U.S. and, potentially, beyond,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “EDP Renewables joins a growing roster of large, sophisticated developers choosing long-term pricing and supply certainty, and responsibly produced solar modules by powering their projects with First Solar’s technology. This validates the value that our customers place in our differentiation, not just in technology but our way of doing business.”
The module producer’s $1.1 billion Alabama factory and $185 million expansion of its existing facilities in Ohio are expected to bring its total investment in American manufacturing to over $4 billion. The company expects to have more than 20 GW of annual global nameplate manufacturing capacity by 2025. It also expects to add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs and over 100 new R&D jobs, taking its total number of direct jobs in the U.S. to over 3,000 people in four states by 2025.
First Solar generated $1 billion of revenue in Q4 2022, representing a 10% increase from $900 million in revenue from Q4 2021, as the solar module producer ended 2022 with a surge of 48.3 GW (DC) of net booking, representing a 2.76x increase over 17.5 GW (DC) net bookings in 2021.
With this strategic agreement, EDPR increases its commitment to U.S. domestic content, while also pursuing its strategy of supply chain and technology diversification. The partnership between both companies started in 2019, when EDPR acquired a 50% stake in a 278 MW solar portfolio developed by First Solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/30/revolutionizing-agrivoltaic-design-software-with-spade/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 30, 2023",“Revolutionizing” agrivoltaic design software with Spade,"Agrivoltaics, the integration of food production and solar energy on the same land, is an emerging technology that makes better use of limited land and soil resources. Because the industry is young, there’s not yet a snappy web-based application like Aurora or Helioscope to help a solar developer quickly lay out a design, taking into account the crops underneath.
Sandbox Solar, a solar contractor, has been developing such a tool, called Spade. Spade aims to help solar developers determine the best crop types and solar panel layouts for their projects. The tool made it into the fifth and final round of the Department of Energy’s “American Made” solar innovation program.
Spade’s early Beta Version is available now, and it has already been used in developing solar power projects paired with potatoes, hemp, hops and some other high attention crops.

The software generates several key numerical outputs: irradiance, as well as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), two types of light measurements that are less familiar to the solar trade.
PAR refers to the range of wavelengths that are useful for photosynthesis, while PPFD measures the density of photons within that range that reaches a specific surface area. Not all wavelengths of light are equally effective for photosynthesis; plants generally utilize blue (400 nm to 500 nm) and red (600 nm to 700 nm) light more efficiently than green (500 nm to 600 nm) light. PAR and PPFD are both crucial for understanding and optimizing light conditions for plant growth and photosynthesis.

The information is displayed both visually via charts, and numerically, as watts per square meter and PAR/PPFD values. Again, PAR is the quantity of useful light that will reach the plants growing among the solar panels. Most agrivoltaic-compatible crops actually benefit from the reduced irradiance offered by the shade of solar panels.
Spade’s team told us that the fundamental approach to optimizing agrivoltaic projects involves addressing the three C’s: configuration, climate and crops. By carefully considering these factors, a developer can refine their strategies by spacing out and elevating solar panels to maximize land use, ensuring the best possible balance between energy generation and agriculture.
The graphic below captures Spade designer Tom Hickey’s changing inputs on solar designs, which then outputs various potential outcomes of solar designs that meet project requirements.

Hickey has been with Sandbox for over five years, and is currently working part-time with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. He uses Spade directly in design work for customers and Sandbox’s agrivoltaic projects.
“Spade has revolutionized what I have been able to do in-house,” said Hickey.
In a conversation with pv magazine USA, Alexis Pascaris, a lead in the development of the Spade software and CEO of AgriSolar Consulting, pointed out the Massachusetts agrivoltaic program and the unique incentives found in the state’s SMART solar program. With Hickey and Pascaris running the processes, Spade has collaborated with developers as a subcontracted professional who liaises with the Department of Agriculture to move projects through the SMART application process. Pascaris suggested that Spade’s shade analysis tools are more accurate than the tools Massachusetts currently mandates.

Ian Skor, founder of Sandbox Solar, believes that the current iteration of the tool is sufficiently robust to meet the immediate needs of both the company and its consulting clients. However, he acknowledges that there is room for growth in developing the software’s frontend to facilitate improved online interactions and refine its overall functionality. 
Pascaris said the company is developing a budget for bringing Spade to the next level, so they can begin a request for investment proposals sometime in 2023.
At this moment, the team doesn’t have any fully installed projects that were developed with Spade; however, several Spade-designed projects are scheduled to begin construction soon, including an in-house vertical bifacial project.
