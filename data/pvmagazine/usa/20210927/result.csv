In mid-August, a trio of petitions filed by the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention asked the Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
In a news conference on September 27, SEIA said that the petitions should be dismissed on their merits. More broadly, the industry trade group said that the tariffs would cripple the U.S. solar industry and impact the country’s plans to tackle climate change. The group said that almost 80% of all solar modules are imported from the countries, which include Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
George Hershman, president and general manager of Swinerton Renewable Energy said that 90-95% of the modules that his company plans to import could be impacted. And he said that “100%” of the 7.5 GW of projects his company has in the pipeline for this year and next is at risk.

“This is absolutely the biggest risk and issue for our company and the industry,” Hershman said during a press conference hosted by SEIA. Hershman chairs the trade group’s executive committee.
Justin Baca, SEIA’s vice president of markets and research, said that AD/CVD tariffs could mean the loss of as many as 45,000 solar energy workers by 2023.
SEIA has said that not enough capacity exists outside the three countries to meet growing domestic demand for solar. Markus Wilhelm, CEO of Strata Clean Energy, said the solar energy is dependent on a global supply chain and so is “vulnerable” to a possible trade disruption.
The Commerce Department could decide within days on whether to launch a trade investigation into solar cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.
The group filed the petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
The group asked the Commerce Department to investigate the following companies:
If Commerce launches an investigation, it could issue a preliminary determination in 180 days. A final determination could come next summer. Any duties would be retroactive to the start of the investigation, which is why companies are reporting an immediate effect on their business.
Hershman told reporters that the largest solar panel manufacturers have already said they will not deliver product for his company’s projects. “We are not able to issue purchase orders,” he said. He declined to name the panel manufacturers.
In an interview with pv magazine shortly after the petitions were filed in August, Timothy Brightbill, a partner in the Wiley Rein law firm said that the group’s requested action is similar to action taken in relation to cold-rolled and corrosion-resistant steel from China. After duties were put in place, Chinese companies were found to be sending steel to third countries for final processing before being exported to the U.S. In that case, tariffs were imposed country-wide. The scope being sought by the group of solar companies he represents is more narrowly focused on a handful of companies.
One question that Commerce will need to consider is the extent to which those countries add significant value to the manufacturing process. The petitions claim that little material value is added. Most of the economic an intellectual capital comes from China where the manufactures are located. The petitions allege that module assembly  has been located outside of China in an effort to skirt U.S. import duties.
SEIA is arguing that more than two thirds of the value of solar panels is created during the manufacturing process in the three countries. It said the manufacturing process is capital intensive and requires skilled labor and that “nearly all” of the critical technological processing occurs within the countries.

The project is the Aratina solar project, a 530 MW installation made up of five new solar facilities, considered as a single project. Set to be developed by 8minute Solar Energy, the project would sit on 2,300 acres of private land.
If approved, the project would become among the biggest in Kern County, which is already home to a number of large projects, many developed by 8minute, both live and under development.
One of these is the Springbok solar cluster, a group of three projects, all developed by 8minute. The three have a combined capacity of 443 MW and were completed in three phases.
Springbok 1 is the first arm of the installation, coming in at 137 MW. It was completed in July 2016. Springbok 2 is a 191 MW installation, also completed in 2016. The last of the group, Springbok 3, is a 115 MW and was completed in July 2019.
Earlier this year, Clearway Energy Group completed the 192 MW Rosamond Central solar project. Constructed by McCarthy Building Cos., this Kern County installation has power purchase agreements with regional community choice aggregators East Bay Community Energy and Clean Power Alliance, as well as the City of Palo Alto Utilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/27/house-bill-would-channel-3-5-billion-to-domestic-solar-manufacturing/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2021",House bill would channel $3.5 billion to domestic solar manufacturing,"Representative Val Demings (D-FL)  introduced the Reclaiming the Solar Supply Chain Act. It would provide $3.5 billion for U.S. solar manufacturing. 
If passed, $700 million would be invested annually from 2022 through 2026. The legislation would provide funding for the construction of new manufacturing facilities and to retrofit, retool, and expand existing facilities. Priority would be given to manufacturers that provide the greatest potential for domestic job creation and economic development in economically distressed regions.
The bill was cosponsored by Mike Doyle (D-PA) and Debbie Dingell and Elissa Slotkin, both Michigan Democrats. The representatives said the bill would create domestic jobs and address human rights issues in the global supply chain.  
With the Biden administration placing a ban on several companies suspected of forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China, the call for more domestic manufacturing has grown louder. 
The proposed act won support from groups like the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance (ULCSA). ULCSA director Michael Parr said too many solar panels and other components are made in global supply chains with high carbon emissions, and that supporting domestic manufacturing can leverage American innovation and low-carbon manufacturing processes. 
Recent polling from Data for Progress has shown bipartisan support among Americans for domestic solar manufacturing. About two-thirds of likely voters in the U.S. strongly or somewhat support the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which would provide tax credits for PV manufacturers along all stages of the supply chain.

If built, SOO Green would be an underground HVDC transmission line located primarily along Canadian Pacific rail lines between Mason City, Iowa, and Plano, Illinois. It would connect the MISO and PJM regional energy markets, enabling the delivery of 2,100 MW of renewable energy from the upper Midwest to eastern markets.
The 350-mile-long project would use 525KV class underground cable and Siemens’ Voltage Sourced Converter technology. Construction could begin in 2023 and would take three years to complete.
Project developers said that installing transmission cables underground within railroad rights-of-way avoids using eminent domain to secure the project route from multiple private landowners.
Gregory N. Dudkin, executive vice president and chief operating officer for PPL, said the project aims to remove barriers to transmission line construction that will be essential to connect more large-scale renewable energy to the grid.
Owned by investment funds managed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Siemens Energy, Jingoli Power, and PPL Corp., the SOO Green HVDC Link is being developed by Minneapolis-based Direct Connect Development Co.

The facility is on 465 acres adjacent to the Point Beach Nuclear Plant, which is owned by a unit of NextEra Energy Resources. The solar project was proposed in 2017 and construction lasted 10 months.
A unit of NextEra built, owns and, will operate the project. Energy produced by the facility will serve WPPI Energy member communities under a 20-year power purchase agreement. WPPI is a non-profit that serves more than 50 member distribution utilities in Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In 2020, it derived nearly 60% of its energy from fossil fuel sources, and almost 20% from nuclear. Renewable energy resources made up the remaining 20%.
With the addition of the solar capacity, WPPI Energy said that it is on track for a roughly 45% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2025 when compared to 2005.
