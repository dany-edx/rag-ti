According to CS Energy, construction on the portfolio, is expected to commence in 2025 and will be completed in 2026. The portfolio is expected to create hundreds of jobs, though no specific figure was provided. Each project will utilize bifacial solar modules and single-axis trackers. CS has also shared the capacity and location of each project:
The Yellow Barn project will be located less than 10 miles from the Cayuga coal plant, which was retired in 2019.
“As the first company to successfully develop and construct large scale solar in upstate New York, we are proud to continue playing a leading role in the deployment of NYSERDA’s large-scale renewables (LSR) program,” said Eric Millard, chief commercial officer at CS Energy. “Our personalized approach and hands-on experience collaborating with municipalities, state and local agencies, communities, local labor, and New York businesses sets us apart in helping New York achieve its renewable energy goals.”
Millard’s quote references the 216 MW, eight-project solar portfolio that CS Energy began construction on in 2021, after being awarded the projects by NYSERDA as part of its Renewable Energy Standard Request for Proposals in 2017 and 2018. That portfolio includes the recently-completed Branscomb Solar installation, a 27 MW project and the the first utility-scale solar project completed in the state outside Long Island.
The award represents 270 MW of a more than 2 GW portfolio of clean energy projects awarded by NYSERDA this spring. The initiative is being touted as the state’s largest land-based renewable energy procurement to date. Construction and development of the portfolio is expected to create over 3,000 short- and long-term jobs across the state, more than $2.7 billion in private investment, and raise the state’s renewable energy total in its overall energy mix to around 66%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/21/new-on-demand-rooftop-solar-investing-platform/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 21, 2022",New “on demand” rooftop solar investing platform,"Brooklyn-based startup Legends Solar has unveiled a new early-access product, Legends Rooftop, an online “on demand” solar investment platform. The platform allows users to purchase anywhere from one solar panel to an entire array located on a remote commercial rooftop. It is pitched as a way for millennial investors or those who are locked out of the housing market to access the benefits of the buildout of solar energy across the nation.
Users select how many panels they want to invest in in an “on demand” fashion, with the smallest investment starting at a few hundred dollars. The platform tracks the performance of the panels and banks the energy savings created by the solar project in the user’s account. Withdrawals can be made at any time, said Legends Solar.
The company said it chooses rooftop solar projects based on two criteria: an energy offtaker, typically the physical host of the panels, that has low financial risk; and projects that are built with high-quality components. It lists an estimated minimal investment of about $250 for one panel, with an estimated return of 7.3%.
The company notes there are some risks in the investment, including poor weather conditions, failure of payment by the “offtaker” or power purchaser, unexpected maintenance, or natural disasters and physical damage. It said that typically hospitals and universities are very consistent offtakers, and as such are a key customer area for Legends.
“With Legends Solar, you can invest in a single remotely located panel, or a whole rooftop’s worth, even without the suburban minimansion and white picket fence,” said Legends founder and CEO Lassor Feasley.
SDC Energy will serve as financial partner for Legends. The company has performed hundreds of solar financings in the past. “The team at Legends Solar has challenged us to reimagine our approach to raising equity for new solar facilities,” said SDC Energy President Charles Schaffer. “We look forward to unlocking the solar asset class for a wider and more diverse set of retail investors. By doing this, we will accelerate the transition to a carbon free society and spread its financial benefits more equitably.”
Legends said the product offers convenience, side-stepping hurdles to rooftop solar adoption. Users purchase the panels after they have been sited, permitted, built and interconnected with the power grid. Buyers can earn dividends from the panels immediately and the platform helps investors right-size their exposure, expanding access to the energy transition in a way that is not prohibitively expensive.
The tool tracks solar production, the amount of carbon abated, total cash earned, and tracks dividend payments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/21/utility-dominion-energy-virginia-enters-rooftop-solar-space/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,VIRGINIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 21, 2022",Utility Dominion Energy Virginia enters rooftop solar space,"Dominion Energy Virgina, which provides electricity to more than 2.5 million homes and businesses, announced the launch of BrightSuite, a full-service residential solar installation company.
This marks a significant pivot for the utility from a centralized model to a distributed one, bringing clean, local power closer to the point of energy demand. The BrightSuite team is made up of certified installers that have delivered solar arrays to over 2,000 residents and businesses across the state.
Dominion said that customers can save anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000+ over a 30-year period, depending on the size of their system and current home energy use. The company offers a 90% production guarantee, meaning customers are compensated if the system underperforms what the company promised.
BrightSuite installations feature tier one black-on-black mono-crystalline solar panels and Enphase microinverters. Both come with a 25-year manufacturer’s warranty. Battery energy storage for backup power during outages is an available option.
The company said depending on the customer’s city, it can take about six to twelve weeks from inquiry to install, and about another four weeks to be approved for interconnection with the utility. It said the longest step is waiting to get approved permits from the city.

Unlike most home renovations, solar is an investment that generates returns almost immediately. Thanks to substantial electricity bill savings, the average American homeowner pays off their solar panel system in in seven to eight years and sees and ROI of 20% or more, said BrightSuite.
Solar panel and installation costs have fallen over 45% in the past five years, said BrightSuite. Installations are projected to grow with over 3,200 MW of power estimated to be installed in the next five years in Virginia alone.
The Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020 aims to deliver the state’s utility-delivered power to 100% renewable energy by 2045, and directs the construction of 16,100 MW of solar power and onshore wind by 2035.
BrightSuite also offers Level 2 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The company said on average, EV owners spend 60% less on fuel than gas drivers. Charging at home each night offers convenience versus having to make a stop at a gas station to refuel.
“Many Virginia homeowners are interested in solar for their home, and there are many complexities,” said Joe Woomer, Dominion Energy vice vresident of New Business and Customer Solutions. “BrightSuite is the trusted partner to help you navigate those complexities and make the most informed decision. By combining Dominion Energy’s operational expertise with our Virginia-based partner network, BrightSuite is the trusted service provider to deliver the right solution for your home.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/21/consortium-commits-to-spending-6-billion-on-us-made-solar-modules/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 21, 2022",Consortium commits to spending $6 billion on US-made solar modules,"AES, Clearway Energy Group, Cypress Creek Renewables, and D. E. Shaw (DESRI), have formed the US Solar Buyer Consortium to support expansion of the domestic solar supply chain and drive the growth of the American solar industry. As a first step, the consortium launched a competitive RFP to search for qualified manufacturers who are aligned with the consortium’s goals and who can commit to a long-term strategic partnership to supply up to 7 GW of solar modules per year starting from 2024.
“Our group of companies comprise industry leaders that are committed to delivering cost-effective, renewable power for our customers. Our joint commitment to procure at this scale can provide the certainty suppliers need to ramp up capacity and overcome current supply chain constraints,” said David Zwillinger, CEO of DESRI.
Formation of the consortium follows the June 5 announcement by the Biden administration of a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The Administration also invoked the Defense Production Act and said it is using the full power of federal procurement capabilities to boost US solar manufacturing.
A recent Wood Mackenzie report estimated that with supportive policies, an additional 20 GW of US manufacturing would be added. Earlier proposals of the Build Back Better Act contained significant incentives for solar modules, trackers, inverters, and more. With the Build Back Better Act tabled, manufacturers hold out hope for the passage of Senator Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act,  which would offer tax credits for domestic manufacturing of modules, cells, and solar-grade polysilicon, as well as trackers and inverters. The incentives would be available through 2028 with a phase-down over the following two years.
The buying consortium hopes to encourage a stable, domestic supply chain for solar modules, which is sorely needed to get solar installations back on track. Increasing solar energy deployment is essential to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5o C.
“Today’s announcement from the Consortium is just one step toward bolstering America’s solar supply chain,” said Craig Cornelius, CEO of Clearway Energy Group. “With legislation pending before Congress, policymakers can scale our domestic manufacturing workforce and restore our country’s legacy as a manufacturing leader. We appreciate the Biden administration’s commitment to invest in American workers and urge lawmakers to seize this opportunity.”
For suppliers interested in responding to the RFP, send an email to rfp@solar-consortium.com.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/21/new-mexico-community-solar-rules-adopted-by-regulators/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,POLICY,NEW MEXICO",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 21, 2022",New Mexico community solar rules adopted by regulators,"New Mexico became the 21st state to adopt community solar when SB 84 was enacted in 2021. At the time of passage, it was agreed that projects would be capped at 5 MW and the program would expand access to community solar to disadvantaged communities, with a carve out of at least 30% of capacity per project dedicated to low-income customers and service organizations.
“Community solar is the solution for clean energy equity that New Mexicans have been waiting for,” said Beth Beloff, executive director of the Coalition of Sustainable Communities New Mexico. “Expanding access to renewable energy while also cutting costs, especially for our low-income households, is going to improve lives from pueblos to cities. We’re glad the PRC will be implementing this important program on a timeline that delivers the money-saving benefits of community solar at a time when people need it most.” 
Enacting these rules will help modernize and decarbonize New Mexico’s electrical grid and provide savings for ratepayers, it will also generate significant investment in the state that will lead to well-paying jobs. New Mexico has historically ranked among one of the poorest states in the nation, with its economy based on the service sector, mining, and oil production.  A recent University of New Mexico study found that community solar can provide a major economic stimulus to New Mexico at a time when it is desperately needed. The study found that community solar will:
The study also concluded that each county in New Mexico would benefit from $15 million in economic output and 117 new jobs over a 20-year period.
“The PRC has done an excellent job with this rulemaking process for our new community solar program, and we appreciate their willingness to accept input and adjust the program accordingly,” said Senator Liz Stefanics (NM-39), the prime sponsor of the Community Solar Act which enabled a community solar program. “A key element of community solar is the opportunity it provides to bring access to solar and the clean energy economy to anyone who wants to participate, especially low-income households. These rules will ensure that these New Mexicans will have an equal chance to benefit from the implementation of this important program in the state.”
Through community solar, customers can enjoy equal access to the benefits of solar generation by subscribing to small local solar arrays and supporting local solar development. They then receive a credit on their utility bill for their share of the power that is produced, just as if the panels were on their own roof.
“I’d like to commend the PRC for all of their diligent work. The final rule that was adopted will ensure that this program delivers the maximum cost savings, job creation, and equity benefits for New Mexicans,” said Kevin Cray, Mountain West regional director for CCSA.
