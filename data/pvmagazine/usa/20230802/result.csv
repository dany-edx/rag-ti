It places fines on transmission operators that fail to adhere to the standardized deadlines.
FERC Chairman Willie Phillips called the ruling “a watershed moment for our nation’s transmission grid.”
The problem of interconnection is huge. By the end of 2022, over 2,000 GW of generation and storage projects were trapped in interconnection queues, often waiting for approval by utility transmission providers. Average wait times in these queues are around five years, a sluggish process that has been highlighted as one of the most important obstacles for the clean energy transition to overcome.
Solar, wind and storage projects in the interconnection queues make up nearly 94% of the total capacity in the queues, with solar constituting over half of that amount. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and FERC said about 1,730 GW of utility-scale solar, wind and storage projects are now active in the interconnection queues of transmission system operators.
The new order from FERC includes some reforms that developers in some regions are already accustomed to, like stricter site control requirements, increased financial security milestones, and also withdrawal penalties.
Some markets had also allowed for multiple generating facilities to use a single interconnection request, and now the FERC ruling makes this a nationwide standard. This is particularly beneficial to renewable energy projects, as they are often dispersed over several project locations, rather than being large, centralized power plants like gas or coal plants.
Furthermore, FERC recognized that transmission operators were failing to approve interconnection in a fair and timely manner. These organizations acted like gatekeepers holding make a tide of clean, reliable energy with delays and ever-increasing fees to renewables developers.
Now, FERC has ruled that transmission operators must adhere to specific, time-constrained interconnection studies, or they will be assessed with penalty fees.
The ruling includes proposed uniform standards for evaluating and coordinating with “Affected Systems,” another primary source of delays.
“FERC’s Order No. 2023 does two things simultaneously—it catches much of the country up to interconnection procedures that have been in use in organized markets for the past 10 years, while also pushing advanced markets forward by imposing sets of firm timelines and standards,” said Jason Johns, partner, Stoel Rives Energy Development. 
“Today’s rule is an important milestone. But there is so much more to do. The Commission is working diligently on how to address the key issues of regional transmission planning and cost allocation,” said Phillips.
The ruling will take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

In its Q2 2023 earnings call the company reported record revenues of $991.3 million, up 5% from $943.9 million in the prior quarter and up 36% from $727.8 million in the same quarter last year. SolarEdge beat Wall Street’s consensus estimate by 0.21%, an estimate it has now consistently beaten in the last four quarters.
Revenues from the solar segment were a record $947.4 million, up 4% from $908.5 million in the prior quarter and up 38% from $687.6 million in the same quarter last year.
The company reported that it shipped a record 4.3 GW of inverters in Q2, up from 3.6 GW shipped in Q1. It also reported that it shipped 269 MWh of batteries, up slightly from 221 MWh shipped in the previous quarter. The overall GAAP gross margin was 32.7%, while the gross margin from the solar segment was 34.7%.
“We are pleased with our results for the second quarter, in particular our strong performance in Europe in both the residential and commercial solar segments,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer of SolarEdge. “While the U.S. residential solar market is currently seeing some headwinds primarily related to higher interest rates, we are navigating through this period by leveraging our geographic and multi-segment strengths in the solar markets and expect to benefit from the positive long-term outlook for this sector.”
The company said it expects revenue between $880 million and $920 million for Q4, a negative surprised when compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.05 billion.
“The U.S. residential solar market is currently seeing some headwinds primarily related to higher interest rates,” said Lando.
SolarEdge shares were down 18.36%, trading at $195.51 at the close on August 2.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/02/first-commercial-gravity-based-energy-storage-tower-begins-commissioning/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA,CHINA,SWITZERLAND,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 2, 2023",First commercial gravity-based energy storage tower begins commissioning,"There are many ways to store energy, from electrochemical batteries, to pumped hydro, to iron-air batteries, to flywheels, and more. Energy Vault has taken a new approach, building towers with electric motors that lift and lower large blocks, making use of gravity’s force to dispatch electricity when it is needed.
The Switzerland and California-based company announced that it is entering the first phases of commissioning for its first commercial-scale gravity energy storage system (GESS). Slated to be fully grid-interconnected in Q4 2023, the gravity tower will mark the world’s first non-pumped hydro gravity-based storage facility.
The project is located near a wind power facility outside of Shanghai in Jiangsu Province, China. It is a 25 MW / 100 MWh storage system that makes use of the company’s new “ribbon” based lifting systems.
“While this represents a significant milestone, our work in China is just beginning given recent local announcements of multi-GW hours of gravity energy storage buildouts, including projects announced in 2022 supporting China’s ‘Zero-carbon parks’ initiative with Energy Vault’s gravity energy storage technology,” said Robert Piconi, chair and chief executive officer, Energy Vault.
The Energy Vault system, called EVx, has demonstrated round-trip efficiency of about 75% in a demonstration project installed in 2020 in Switzerland. The company said it expects that to be improved to about 80%, placing it in a similar range as pumped hydro storage and even grid-scale batteries.
Energy Vault’s design includes a multi-armed crane tower that lifts composite blocks using an electric (solar-powered) motor. The lifted blocks are stacked, which creates potential energy. As the blocks are lowered, the energy is harvested and dispatched for use.
Energy Vault said the tower’s design is based on the physics of pumped hydroelectric energy storage. However, as a solid “mobile mass,” the composite blocks do not lose storage capacity over time. The composite blocks can be made cheaply, said the company, using excavated soil from the construction site, waste materials like mine tailings and coal ash, and even fiberglass from decommissioned wind turbines.
The tower is controlled by computer systems and machine vision software that orchestrate the charging and discharging cycles. A range of storage durations from two to 12 hours or longer is achievable, said the company. This first commercial installation in China will use a 4-hour duration.
The first commercial installation is being built in partnership with Atlas Renewable and China Tianying. A subsidiary company of China Tianying recently announced it formed an agreement with the People’s Government of Huailai County to build an additional 100 MWh gravity energy storage project. Energy Vault said it will provide more details on this expansion during the company’s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call scheduled for August 8, 2023.
“This milestone could not have been achieved without the unprecedented collaboration between the collective teams in the U.S. and China, as the world’s two largest economies have joined forces to meaningfully address climate change. Energy Vault’s breakthrough, innovative technology is on the cusp of playing a critical role in supporting China’s clean energy transition and 30-60 decarbonization policy,” said Eric Fang, chief executive officer, Atlas Renewable.

For the energy transition, the electrification of transport, and dozens of other technological areas, the relatively short lifetime of today’s battery technologies is a persistent roadblock.
Cracks forming in the electrodes of batteries are one cause of performance loss over time, and an issue that many manufacturers are looking to engineer out of the batteries using new materials more resistant to cracking. Research published this week, however, suggests that getting rid of cracks in the cathode may have an unwanted side effect.
“Many companies are interested in making ‘million-mile’ batteries using particles that do not crack,” explained Yiyang Li, assistant professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan. “Unfortunately, if the cracks are removed, the battery particles won’t be able to charge quickly without the extra surface area from those cracks.”
Conventional wisdom states that the charging speed for batteries should be improved by using cathodes made from smaller particles, since these have a higher surface area to volume ratio, shortening the distance lithium-ions have to travel.
Li and colleagues put this assumption to the test using sophisticated techniques to track the behavior of individual particles as the battery is charged. “Back when I was in graduate school, a colleague studying neuroscience showed me these arrays that they used to study individual neurons. I wondered if we can also use them to study battery particles, which are similar in size to neurons,” said Li.
The setup involved a 2x2cm chip containing 100 microelectrodes, onto which the group scattered nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode (NMC) particles. Using a needle which they say is “around 70 times thinner than a human hair,” the scientists could move the individual particles onto an electrode, allowing them to charge and discharge the particles individually. The group worked with NMC “532” material, containing 50% nickel, 30% manganese and 20% cobalt, and say they would expect similar results for any type of NMC cathode.
The experiment is described in full in the paper “Direct measurements of size-independent lithium diffusion and reaction times in individual polycrystalline battery particles,” published in Energy & Environmental Science. The results showed that the charging speed was not affected by particle size.
Li and Jinhong Min, who carried out the experiments, theorize that this could be down to the larger particles behaving more like a collection of small particles when the cathode cracks, Or that lithium-ions are able to move more quickly at the grain boundary. “Our results overturn the dominant picture of lithium transport in the most widely-used cathode material,” the two stated. “If this electrolyte cracking model is accurate, then our results show that intergranular cracking, long believed to be strongly detrimental to cycle life, is in fact essential for the ability of polycrystalline particles to (dis)charge at reasonable cycling rates.”

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have discovered that cement and water, combined with with a small amount of carbon black, create a powerful, low-cost supercapacitor that could provide a scalable, bulk energy storage solution suitable for a variety of applications.
The key to the new supercapacitors comes from a method of producing a cement-based material with an extremely high internal surface area due to a dense, interconnected network of conductive material within its bulk volume, allowing for high energy storage capacity.
The researchers achieved this by introducing carbon black into a mixture along with cement powder and water, and letting it cure. The water naturally forms a branching network of openings within the structure as it reacts with cement, and the carbon migrates into these spaces to make conductive, wire-like structures within the hardened cement.
The material was then soaked in a standard electrolyte material, such as potassium chloride, which provides the charged particles that accumulate on the carbon structures. Two electrodes made of this material, separated by a thin space or an insulating layer, form a very powerful supercapacitor, the researchers found. They also pointed out that the amount of carbon needed is very small –as little as 3% by volume of the mix–to achieve a percolated carbon network.
“The material is fascinating because you have the most-used manmade material in the world, cement, that is combined with carbon black, that is a well-known historical material–the Dead Sea Scrolls were written with it,” said MIT professor Admir Masic. “You have these at least two-millennia-old materials that when you combine them in a specific manner you come up with a conductive nanocomposite, and that’s when things get really interesting.”
The team calculated that a block of nanocarbon-black-doped concrete that is 45 cubic meters in size–equivalent to a cube about 3.5 meters across–would have enough capacity to store about 10 kWh of energy.
However, they also found that there is a tradeoff between the storage capacity of the material and its structural strength. By adding more carbon black, the resulting supercapacitor can store more energy, but the concrete is slightly weaker. Therefore, for applications such as a foundation, or structural elements of the base of a wind turbine, the “sweet spot” is around 10% carbon black in the mix, the researchers found.
According to the researchers, the availability, scalability and versatility of the carbon-cement supercapacitors opens a horizon for design of multifunctional structures. There is a big opportunity for employing these supercapacitors for bulk energy storage in both residential and industrial applications ranging from energy autarkic shelters and self-charging roads for electric vehicles, to intermittent energy storage for wind turbines.
Having proved their principle on a 1 V and 3 V supercapacitors, the researchers now plan to build a series of larger versions, starting with ones about the size of a typical 12 V car battery, then working up to a 45-cubic-meter version to demonstrate its ability to store a house-worth of power.
Their findings were discussed in Cement supercapacitors as a scalable energy storage solution published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/02/new-technique-to-recover-lead-in-end-of-life-solar-panels/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 2, 2023",New technique to recover lead in end-of-life solar panels,"From pv magazine global
Scientists at Arizona State University have developed a new two-step process to recycle lead (Pb) in photovoltaic modules at the end of their life cycle.
“No recyclers talk about lead recovery because it does not generate much revenue but adds to the cost of recycling,” the research’s corresponding author, Meng Tao, told pv magazine. “In the long run it is a liability for recyclers as it is toxic and will sooner or later leach out from PV panels. We are considering lead recovery as part of the overall recycling process we are developing.”
The process utilizes a leaching solution based on a combination of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which the researchers said works as an efficient leaching agent for Pb “in a matter of minutes.” They specified that each solar cell used in PV panels contains, on average, about 0.2 grams of Pb.
The metal is recovered by dissolving it in the leaching solution. After leaching, the resulting Pb powders are rinsed and dried on highly absorbent paper to minimize the formation of lead acetate compounds, which the team said introduce errors during weight measurements. “It is preferred to recover it in the metallic form so it can be sold back to the solar industry for new solder,” the group said.
The process’ second step is electrowinning, a technique that is generally used to recover metals from a solution by means of an electrolytic chemical reaction. The scientists conducted nine electrowinning experiments for different combinations of CH3COOH concentration. They achieved the highest recovery rates over 99% using a 10% CH3COOH solution. 
“These high recovery rates were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for the post-electrowinning leachates,” they explained. “The 0% CH3COOH solution has the lowest Pb recovery rates for each potential applied, suggesting that CH3COOH aids in Pb electrowinning.”
The scientists noted that the total Pb amount in the solution is approximately 16 mg or 0.05% of the total powder mass. Assuming that 0.2% of the silicon cell’s weight is represented by Pb, the total Pb amount in the 1.3 g of silicon cells should be 26 mg, they stated.
The technique is described in full in the study “Lead leaching and electrowinning in acetic acid for solar module recycling,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. “Overall, the leaching and electrowinning process using CH3COOH shows promise as a feasible and safer approach for Pb recovery from silicon solar modules,” the academics concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/02/sunnova-to-participate-in-battery-emergency-program-in-puerto-rico/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PUERTO RICO",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 2, 2023",Sunnova to participate in battery emergency program in Puerto Rico,"Sunnova Energy International, Inc. is ready to participate in the Battery Emergency Demand Response program in Puerto Rico by coordinating the energy output and storage of its solar-plus-battery customers to help stabilize the grid.
The company reports that it has 55,000 solar and storage customers, with a total installed storage capacity of 727 MWh. The way the Battery Emergency Demand Response program works is that, when the grid is under stress, Luma Energy, the company that manages the grid in Puerto Rico, may request that participating solar-plus-battery systems discharge battery storage to the site or to the grid.
Sunnova expects to dispatch a participating customer’s battery up to a maximum number of 125 events each year. The company reports that in each demand response, the customers’ battery will never be discharged below a capacity level of their choosing. Participating customers will be credited by Sunnova, the company says, for the energy produced by their batteries during these events.
Distributed solar and storage customers sign up with Sunnova to participate in what the company calls the Sunnova Flex Power Program. By compensating customers for the power supplied by their batteries, they are incentivized to participate in a program designed to provide energy that reduces strain on the grid and minimizes blackouts at critical times.
Sunnova CEO, William J. (John) Berger noted that its customers will maintain resiliency and energy independence and that their batteries will never be dispatched immediately ahead of predicted hurricanes or severe weather.
“The unfortunate reality of an unreliable local electrical grid and frequent power outages has plagued Puerto Rico for far too long. Luckily, a new era of energy stability and empowerment is here,” said Berger. “By harnessing the energy stored in batteries during times of high demand or emergencies, homeowners can actively contribute to grid stabilization and be rewarded for their valuable contribution, all while benefitting electricity consumers across the Island.”
Compensation under the program will be based on how much energy each customer’s battery provides when called upon, the company reports, estimating that the average residential customer may receive up to $1,000 annually for their participation. The customer will receive the incentive as credit toward their account each year or they will receive a payment.
Sunnova’s program is being launched under the aegis of the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau’s (PREB) Energy Efficiency and Emergency Demand Response Programs, expected to commence later this year pursuant to the Government of Puerto Rico’s public policy on energy efficiency.
The Puerto Rico Energy Transformation and Relief Act of 2014 (Act 57-2014) requires the PREB to establish energy efficiency programs in order for Puerto Rico to reduce energy consumption from current levels, thereby lowering individual customers’ energy bills and rebuilding a stronger and more cost-effective energy system that reduces the need for more expensive fossil fuel generation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/02/battery-blocks-and-the-future-of-direct-procurement-in-utility-scale-energy-storage/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 2, 2023",Battery blocks and the future of direct procurement in utility-scale energy storage,"Vikash Venkataramana: Procuring the DC battery block directly from battery manufacturers gives customers flexibility to pair the battery with their choice of inverter. This approach is not new and is the preferred procurement approach in the solar industry. You rarely see utility customers procuring solar panels and inverters from the same entity. Since large-scale ESS is relatively new, early integrators were able to add value by reducing technology integration risk with turnkey solutions. However, as the industry matures, we already see customers preferring direct procurement from battery manufacturers.
Vikash Venkataramana: Large battery manufacturers, like Gotion, are truly vertically integrated, with ownership in everything from lithium mines to DC block manufacturing facilities. Tighter control over subcomponent lead times enables a predictable supply chain, which allows punctual delivery of high-quality products. Gotion batteries and Gotion BMS systems are pre-integrated into Gotion-owned factories, and the systems are fully tested before being shipped to customers. This gives customers confidence in the product they receive and provides customers with a single entity that is responsible for manufacturing and delivering the solution. Customers also have greater confidence in battery manufacturer performance guarantees and warranties, as manufacturers have the best understanding of technology with strong R&D teams.
The challenge for system integrators is that they are dependent on multiple technology providers, thereby exposing themselves to larger supply chain risk. When the supply is limited, in particular, prioritization of access to battery materials and components can be complex. Often, this risk is transferred onto the customers. Also, when issues occur with product performance and safety, sometimes the end customers don’t have clarity on who is directly responsible, the battery supplier or system integrator.

Vikash Venkataramana: Gotion has over 100 GWh of battery production globally and is among the three largest LFP battery manufacturers in the world. For the US energy storage system (ESS) market, Gotion promotes UL certified products such as battery cells, modules, packs, racks, and DC battery blocks. For the utility-scale solar market, our most popular offerings are the fully integrated 20-foot DC battery container block solutions that come in 2 variants ─ the air-cooled version at 2.7 MWh and the liquid cooled version at 3.4 MWh.
Vikash Venkataramana: Gotion contracts multiple GWh’s of DC battery block solutions for large-scale projects. We see project developers with experience in energy storage directly working with technology providers and moving closer to procuring inverters and batteries separately – especially on large ESS projects. However, we also recognize that some customers prefer a turnkey integrated solution, particularly for smaller projects. I would say the market for direct DC block procurement is growing.
