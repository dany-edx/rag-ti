McCarthy Construction announced it completed building the project. 
The project is primarily located on 1,800 acres of Evraz Rocky Mountain Steel property in Pueblo. It is one of the largest on-site solar facilities in the US dedicated to a single customer, with more than 750,000 solar panels. The plant recycles scrap metal to produce new steel products, including railroad track. 
Kevin Smith, CEO of Lightsource bp, Americas said the project proves that even “hard-to-abate sectors like steel can be decarbonized.” 
Lightsource bp financed, owns, and operates Bighorn Solar and sells the electricity it generates to Xcel Energy under a 20-year power purchase agreement. As part of that arrangement, Evraz will receive energy from Xcel Energy through 2041. The project will enable Xcel Energy to abate 433,770 metric tons of CO2 emissions. The steel maker is Xcel Energy’s largest retail electric customer in Colorado and one of Pueblo’s largest employers. The deal for fixed-rate power gives EVRAZ the low, predictable electricity prices it needs to stay in Pueblo and invest in its future there, keeping more than 1,000 jobs in the city. 
The project is expected to generate $22 million in local tax revenues.
“We’re committed to being a long-term partner and continuing to advance Colorado’s clean energy economy,” said Stephen Barnes, senior vice president, project management & construction for Lightsource bp. “The Bighorn Solar project along with Sun Mountain brings Lightsource bp’s current investment to over a half billion dollars in building infrastructure to diversify the Colorado electricity supply with clean and secure energy. With our large pipeline of solar projects in the region, and across America, this is just the beginning.” 
McCarthy’s Renewable Energy & Storage has a portfolio of nearly active or completed 70 utility-scale projects across the country since 2010. It has delivered a combined capacity of more than 6.6GW of clean energy and 340MW/770MWh of energy storage. The company provides engineering, procurement, and construction services for private solar developers and utilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/14/community-solar-interconnection-bottlenecks-and-other-barriers-to-growth/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 14, 2022",Community Solar: Interconnection bottlenecks and other barriers to growth,"Achieving the US government’s ambitious climate goals will take an all-hands-on-deck approach. Several studies have looked at how much solar must be installed to meet the goal of 80% clean electricity by 2030, and the consensus is that at least 103GW of distributed solar and 137GW of distributed storage must be deployed every year in order to achieve the President’s goals at the lowest cost.
Another of the President’s goals is to deliver at least 40% of the overall benefits from federal investments in climate and clean energy to low- to moderate-income (LMI) individuals. Key to what is called the Justice40 initiative is a new focus on community solar, which is a way to build a more equitable clean energy grid. Not everyone can put solar on their roof—some live in apartment buildings or condos, their roof may not be oriented to benefit from solar, or the residents may not be able to afford the up-front cost of solar or may not have the credit needed to finance.
The community solar model enables members subscribe to a portion of a solar array, usually located in or near their community. As the solar array produces energy, subscribers receive a portion of the revenue from the energy produced, typically as a savings on their monthly electric bill — a critical factor for low-income and disadvantaged communities whose energy burden is three times higher than for non-low-income households.
US commitment
At the annual summit of the National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP) in January, the DOE announced a goal of powering the equivalent of five million households by 2025 with community solar and creating $1 billion in energy savings. Achieving this target would mean an increase of more than 700% of installed community solar in the next four years.
“With the combination of DOE’s NCSP initiatives and the adoption of other critical actions by state and federal policymakers, the industry can meet this goal and satisfy pent up demand, save American consumers and businesses money, create local jobs, enhance grid resilience and protect the environment and community health,” said Jeff Cramer, President and CEO of CCSA.
While the community solar industry experienced a record-breaking year of growth in 2020, to continue that trajectory the expansion barriers must be removed and incentives offered. At the Community Solar Power Forum held Boston at the end of February, five key takeaways highlight the challenges for the industry:
Making community solar equitable
The median income for a household that has adopted solar has historically been higher than the average US household, however, there seems to be a shift underway. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory released the latest edition of the annual report, Residential Solar-Adopter Income and Demographic Trends, which looks at 2.3 million residential solar adopters across the country in 2020, representing 82% of all US systems. The study showed that the disparity between solar-adopter incomes and the general population has been narrowing over time: Between 2010 and 2020, median solar-adopter incomes in the US fell on an absolute basis from $138k to $115k. The researchers reported that the drop reflects the fact that the solar market is deepening, by appealing to less affluent households, and it is broadening into less affluent states. This is good news because, according to the DOE, low-income households face a disproportionately higher energy burden (energy burden is the percentage of gross household income spent on energy costs.
The Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) of the DOE has a goal of accelerating “the development and deployment of solar technology to support an equitable transition to a decarbonized electricity system by 2035 and decarbonized energy sector by 2050”.  SETO is developing strategies for expanding equitable access to solar energy by trying to solve financing, business, market, and other barriers for residential and community solar.
“Community solar is one of the most powerful tools we have to provide affordable solar energy to all American households, regardless of whether they own a home or have a roof suitable for solar panels,” said Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm. “Achieving these ambitious targets will lead to meaningful energy cost savings, create jobs in these communities, and make our clean energy transition more equitable.”
Interconnection issues
Both Wood Mackenzie and the Institute for Local Self Reliance have recently identified interconnection as the most significant barrier to expanding distributed energy resources (DER). PJM, the nation’s largest electrical grid operator responded to its backlog of over 1,200 energy projects not by speeding up review of applications, but instead by pausing the review process for two years—a response that many industry experts discussed at the recent RE+ Northeast.
The white paper, “Integrating Distributed Solar and Storage: The Keystones of a Modern Grid,” provides specific recommendations and cites many examples of state and agency efforts that have made progress improving interconnection and DER integration practices to help guide policymakers, regulators, and utilities with respect to the steps they must take.  The white paper outlines four strategies for reforming the interconnection process: developing and implementing improved interconnection procedures; compensating utilities to integrate DERs; fairly distributing costs to update the grid among all customers who benefit from increased grid resilience; and providing clean, cost-effective electricity to all Americans.
“Following the recommendations in this report will make utilities more of a partner and less of an obstacle to rooftop and community solar interconnection,” said Sean Gallagher, vice president of state and regulatory affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Siting and interconnection woes lower forecasts
Nearly three-quarters of the US market for community solar is concentrated in four states: Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York, although 22 states and Washington, D.C. currently have state policies that support community solar deployment. “Community solar needs state-level polices in order to thrive,” said Rachel Goldstein, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie. New Mexico and Delaware both passed legislation in 2021 for new or improved community solar programs. Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all have proposed bills working their way through state legislatures.

Goldstein noted that Minnesota and Maryland’s forecasts decreased due to continued siting challenges in both states. The forecasts for Massachusetts and Maine have also been revised downwards due to delays related to interconnection studies. “As community solar penetrates more markets, it will have to contend with interconnection challenges due to grid congestion and outdated infrastructure,” Goldstein said. The Wood Mackenzie report stressed that interconnection difficulties represent a major challenge facing the community solar sector and is one that will continue in the coming years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/14/global-solar-drone-data-assessment-shows-rise-in-pv-anomalies/,"MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 14, 2022",Global solar drone data assessment shows rise in PV anomalies,"RaptorMaps, a technology-driven aerial solar inspection provider, released its annual report on data from over 20GW of inspections. The inspections span 32 countries and 66 million modules. Utility-scale, commercial, and industrial projects were analyzed in the report.
The company operates its inspections with drones or planes. Often, both thermal infrared imaging and RGB imagery are used to collect data. The company creates digital twins of solar assets to organize inspection findings and facilitate comparisons over time. The findings are identified with machine learning, which can arm solar asset managers with information to make objective, quantitative decisions based on improving productivity, power output, and return on investment.
RaptorMaps analysis found a trend of an increase in power affected by PV anomalies. Last year, 2.63% of capacity analyzed was mitigated by anomalies, up from 1.85% in 2020. This represents more than 100MW in energy production, said RaptorMaps.
The report categorized numerous anomalies, including issues in the cell, circuit, lamination, combiner box, diode, hot spot issues, short circuits, shading, soiling, physical obstructions, vegetation, string underperformance and more. Thermal imagery can more easily identify when power is properly flowing through a given component.
The five categories estimated to have the largest impact on energy production were strings, inverters, combiners, module-level issues and trackers. Module-level anomalies represented 11.51% of power affected, said the report.
“Our inspection data shows that solar assets are becoming more anomalous each year,” said CTO and co-founder Eddie Obropta. “These findings against the backdrop of increased costs of capital and supply chains underscores the need to use advanced technology to maximize power output. Operational excellence is no longer enough. Solar financiers, asset owners and asset managers must leverage data and analytics to make intelligent decisions that reduce soft costs.”
The report also breaks down the data on what percentage of modules are affected by a given anomaly, rather than production. It found that trackers are responsible for the most module-level issues at 1.13%, followed by strings, module-level issues, and inverters.

The new section will add more than 1,100 solar panels and will produce an additional 500-kilowatts of energy. The utilities will construct the remaining three sections planned for the site once they are fully subscribed.
Subscribers to the Solar Share program earn credits on their monthly bills based on their subscription level. The facility has been delivering clean energy credits to customers since 2019, having produced more than 4 million kilowatt-hours of energy. More than 2,800 customers currently participate in Solar Share. Watch in near-real time as the facility generates power through the utilities’ Solar Share live online dashboard.
“Our portfolio of tools and programs, like Solar Share, make it possible for customers to support renewable energy sources right here in Kentucky and the region,” said LG&E and KU Vice President-Customer Services Eileen Saunders.
The utilities are part of a commitment by parent company PPL to achieve net-zero carbon (CO2) emissions by 2050, with interim reduction targets of 70% from 2010 levels by 2035, and 80% by 2040.
The Solar Share program is available to LG&E and KU’s residential, business and industrial customers, providing them with clean energy for as little as 20 cents per day. By participating in the program, customers get the benefits from solar energy without having to pay the added up-front and long-term expenses that come when installing and maintaining a private solar system.
The utilities provides a Renewable Choice Calculator that lets customers explore available local and regional options. By providing basic information including customer type and average monthly bill, the calculator provides a solution for most customers equal to 100% of their power consumption for less than $1 per day or about 5% more on their monthly energy bill, according to the utilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/14/mit-scientists-develop-pv-cleaning-system-based-on-electrostatic-repulsion/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 14, 2022",MIT scientists develop PV cleaning system based on electrostatic repulsion,"Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a lab-scale solar module cleaning system prototype that uses electrostatic repulsion to cause dust particles to detach and virtually leap off the surface of panels.
They described the system in “Electrostatic dust removal using adsorbed moisture–assisted charge induction for sustainable operation of solar panels,” which was recently published in Science Advances. They said it is a device that is able to “actively charge” dust particles and impart strong Coulombic force for dust repulsion.
“Our approach overcomes the prior limitations that occur due to reliance on relatively weak, short-range dielectrophoretic/triboelectric force and eliminates the issue of electrical shorting,” the scientists explained.
The waterless system can be operated automatically via an electric motor and is activated by an electrode placed on top of the module surface. The electric charge it releases repels dust particles from the panels. The bottom electrode consists of a glass plate coated with a 5 nm transparent and conductive layer of aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), using atomic layer deposition (ALD). It is mobile to avoid shading and moves along the panel during cleaning with a linear guide stepper motor mechanism.
The system can be operated at a voltage of around 12V. The researchers said that it can recover 95% of the lost power after cleaning for particle sizes greater than around 30 μm.
“We use Arizona test dust (intermediate and miscellaneous test dust fractions from Powder Technology Inc.), also known as crystalline silica dust, whose chemical composition emulates that of typical desert mineral dust particles in our experiments,” the researchers said.
One of the researchers, Sreedath Panati, said that the group performed experiments at a range of humidity levels, from 5% to 95%. “As long as the ambient humidity is greater than 30%, you can remove almost all of the particles from the surface, but as humidity decreases, it becomes harder,” said Panati.
The simulations showed that the electricity consumption of the device is negligible.
“There is no current flow between the top and bottom electrodes and therefore no electrical power consumption. The only mode of power consumption is that associated with the translation of the moving electrode,” they said, noting that more cost reductions could be achieved by further reducing the thickness of the electrode coating.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/14/humans-install-1-terawatt-of-solar-capacity-generate-over-1-petawatt-of-solar-electricity-in-2021/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 14, 2022","Humans have installed 1 terawatt of solar capacity, generated over 1 petawatt of solar electricity in 2021","Milestones may be arbitrary, but the morale boost they provide is not. Humans have very recently installed enough solar panels to generate one terawatt of electricity directly from the sun. It’s a pretty good feeling!
The expectation that our species would hit 1,000 gigawatts of solar was first based on estimations that we installed at least 183 GW in 2021, and that we had 788 GW of capacity in place at the end of 2020. These two values total 971GW of installed solar.

To estimate our capacity at this exact moment, let’s assume that humans will install 210GW in 2022. Today marks the 73rd day of the year, which is exactly 20% of 2022. Naturally, 20% of 210GW – is “the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything” – 42.
These numbers suggest that Earth’s solar capacity has breached 1,010GW, and that we can officially start measuring solar capacity in terawatts!
Good job, Earthlings! The galactic council sees this as a positive development.
Let’s add two caveats to show the difficulty in obtaining a precise estimate: overestimation can result from the small percentage of capacity that has been uninstalled, since roofs do sometimes get replaced, and severe weather events do occasionally destroy installations. Additionally, capacity numbers have been regularly underestimated because the installation data that researchers seek is constantly changing, and obtained from a number of manufacturers spread all over the planet.
The largest contributor to this capacity is China, who broke through — and blew past — 100GW in late 2016, or early 2017. The European Union hit 100GW in 2015, just before China. In the United States, the 100GW number was hit in the first quarter of 2021. These three regions represent more than half of the world’s installed solar capacity.
BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2021
From a generation perspective, 2021 was also a milestone year. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, the world generated 26,823 terawatt hours of electricity in 2020. 855 of those TWhrs – 3.1% – came from solar. Since solar grew 23% in 2021, it is likely that next year’s BP Statistical Review will show that solar generation broke 1 petawatt hour of generation in 2021.
Going forward, models predict that dozens of terawatts of solar capacity will be needed to decarbonize the earth’s electricity, transportation, heating, and industrial systems.
