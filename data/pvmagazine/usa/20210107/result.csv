Well, if that boat happens to have a Mercury Marine engine on board, you can also imagine rooftop solar.
That’s because Mercury Marine, a division of Brunswick Corp., added a solar array at its world headquarters in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, part of its ongoing effort to enhance sustainable operations. The array sits atop a warehouse, includes 320 solar panels, and will help power operations over the system’s expected 30-year lifespan.
The project follows a solar array Mercury installed at its European headquarters in Petit‑Rechain, Belgium, in 2017. That installation, along with some insulation updates, slashed the facility’s dependence on grid power by a third, leading to savings on utility bills and more reliance on clean energy.
(Hog maker Harley-Davidson added rooftop solar at one of its big Wisconsin plants in December. Read about that project here.)
The solar project at Mercury Marine in Wisconsin is part of a goal President Chris Drees announced last year to meet at least half of the company’s electricity needs with renewable resources by the end of 2030. Parent company Brunswick has a similar 50%-by-2030 renewable energy target.

In addition to solar, Mercury has taken several more energy-friendly measures, including upgrading lighting and HVAC systems and focusing on power optimization. On Earth Day 2020, the company won a Wisconsin’s Focus on Energy program award for its efforts.
“These steps will combine with many others over the next 10 years,” Drees said in a statement. “We are committed to our focus on sustainable business practices, including investment in renewable energy and reduction of our carbon footprint. We will continue to elevate our commitment to sustainability across all of our global locations.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/07/new-rules-move-washington-state-closer-to-carbon-free-electricity/,"POLICY,WASHINGTON",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 7, 2021",New rules move Washington State closer to carbon-free electricity,"Regulators in Washington State have adopted a package of rules that move the state a step further toward its goal of removing carbon emissions from electric utility services.
The rules were adopted by the state’s Utilities and Transportation Commission and implement parts of the Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA), passed in 2019. CETA requires the state’s electric utilities to eliminate coal-fired electricity by 2026, transition to a carbon-neutral supply by 2030, and source 100% of their electricity from renewable or non-carbon-emitting sources by 2045.
The new rules address utility practices when planning for and acquiring new energy resources, promoting diversity among suppliers and contractors, calculating greenhouse gas content in their resource mix, facilitating public engagement in planning and procurement, assessing impacts of resources on vulnerable communities and establishing caps for utilities’ spending in compliance with CETA.
The commission’s rules apply to the investor-owned utilities operating in Washington: Puget Sound Energy, Avista, and Pacific Power. The state’s Commerce Department developed similar rules that apply to municipal and other consumer-owned utilities.
The UTC-approved package contains three separate rules: Purchase of Resources (Docket UE-190837), Energy Independence Act (Docket UE-190652) and Clean Energy Implementation Plans and Integrated Resource Plans (CEIP/IRP) (UE-191023).
Purchase of Resources, Docket: UE-190837
The new rules update utility purchasing practices and require utilities to conduct outreach to minority-owned and other diverse businesses.
Changes include:
• When purchasing new resources, utilities must consider both the energy and non-energy benefits and burdens to highly impacted communities and vulnerable populations.
• Utilities must seek potential bids from underrepresented organizations and bidders, such as minority-, women-, disabled- and veteran-owned businesses to encourage equitable participation in the bidding process.
• For resource contracts by the utilities, the utility must collect and report their contractors’ use of diverse businesses, including but not limited to women-, minority-, disabled- and veteran-owned businesses.
• Where utilities are required to use an independent evaluator, the utility must consult with stakeholders and commission staff when choosing an independent evaluator.
• The independent evaluator’s assessment of resources is expanded to include the benefits and burdens of a resource choice to highly impacted and vulnerable communities.
Clean Energy Implementation Plan/Integrated Resource Plan, Docket: UE-191023
These updated rules provide guidance to investor-owned utilities and their stakeholders as utilities transition from fossil fuels, establishing policy and process changes that incorporate recent advances in the energy industry and improving the IRP process for regulated companies, stakeholders and the public.
Under these rules, utilities will create utility advisory groups to discuss the equitable distribution of benefits and reduction of harm to overburdened communities during the clean energy transition. Additionally, these rules clarify the public participation processes for utilities when developing resource plans and implementation plans.
Energy Independence Act, Docket: UE-190652
In October 2019, the commission initiated a rulemaking to update rules implementing the Energy Independence Act, or EIA, a law established in 2007 by Initiative 937. This act requires utilities over a certain size to provide at least 15% of electricity from renewable energy sources and pursue all cost-effective conservation. These updates incorporate new requirements enacted in CETA and other legislative action, and improve the processes for administering the EIA.
Changes include:
• Adding several definitions included in CETA, notably “energy assistance,” “energy assistance need,” “energy burden” and “low-income.”
• Strengthening rules governing energy conservation programs for low-income customers.
• Amending rules that address the use of renewable energy credits, tradable certificates that represent energy generated by renewable resources.
• Adding a calculation of greenhouse gas content to energy and emissions intensity reports that utilities must file.
The UTC is the state agency that regulates private, investor-owned electric and natural gas utilities in Washington.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/07/sunrise-brief-6-months-and-counting-as-renewables-dominate-capacity-additions/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 7, 2021",Sunrise brief: 6 months and counting as renewables dominate capacity additions,"All of the new generating capacity added between June and November 2020 came from wind (2,987 MW), solar (2,218 MW), and hydropower (24 MW).
In November alone, all new U.S. utility-scale electrical generation capacity added came from five new units of wind (882 MW) and 10 units of solar (626 MW).
The additions were reported by the SUN DAY Campaign, which reviewed data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Renewable energy sources now account for 23.52% of the nation’s total available installed generating capacity. Wind’s share (9.42%) now surpasses nuclear power (8.61%). Solar (4.16%) eclipses oil (3.31%). The generating capacity of wind and solar is now 13.58% of the nation’s total, not counting distributed solar, SUN DAY said.
The report also said that “high probability” generation capacity additions for wind (minus anticipated retirements) reflect a projected net increase of 27,622 MW; solar is foreseen growing by 32,784 MW. By comparison, net growth for natural gas will be 21,489 MW.
In a separate analysis, the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said that natural gas burned to generate electric power reached a record high in 2020, averaging 31.6 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d). That was 2% more than the 2019 average. The increase occurred despite slightly lower total U.S. electricity consumption. Natural gas consumed by electric power plants set a daily record high of 47.2 Bcf at the end of July, EIA said.
Natural gas spot prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana averaged $2.05 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), the lowest annual average price in decades. In June, the average Henry Hub price fell to $1.66/MMBtu.
Vistra said that its Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility connected to the power grid and began operating in mid-December.
At 300 MW/1,200 MWh, the lithium-ion battery storage system located at Vistra’s Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County, California, will be among the largest of its kind in the world.

Construction is underway on Phase II, which will add 100 MW/400 MWh to the facility by August, bringing its total capacity to 400 MW/1,600 MWh.
Phase I can power roughly 225,000 homes during peak electricity pricing periods. The system is made up of more than 4,500 stacked battery racks or cabinets, each containing 22 battery modules.
Phases I and II of the Vistra Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility are backed up by long-term resource adequacy contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E).
The site can handle up to 1,500 MW/6,000 MWh of storage capacity should market and economic conditions support it.
Canadian Solar Inc. said that its Recurrent Energy business unit completed the sale of the 144 MW Pflugerville Solar project to Duke Energy Renewables, a unit of Duke Energy.
The project is under construction in Travis County, Texas and is expected to enter service in mid-2021. Energy will be sold to Austin Energy under a 15-year power purchase agreement.
This is the fifth utility-scale project that Duke Energy Renewables has acquired from Recurrent Energy, including the Rambler Solar project in Texas, which reached commercial operation in 2020.
Pflugerville will use roughly 489,600 pieces of Canadian Solar’s bifacial BiKu modules across 932 acres. The engineering and construction for the project is being performed by Signal Energy. To fund construction, Recurrent Energy in August closed debt and tax equity financing totaling over $234 million.
Hunt Military Communities, an owner of U.S. military housing, said it is adding solar rooftop PV systems across its facility at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.

The 2.8 MW PV system will produce around 3.5 million kWh of electricity annually. It will enable the community to draw 15-20% of its total electricity supply from renewable energy.
Hunt has installed more than 20 MW of solar across its housing communities nationwide. The Scott project is slated to be completed by late 2021.
Installation and operation will be handled by affiliates of True Green Capital Management, Hunt’s solar energy partner. True Green has installed roughly 12 MW of solar across six military housing sites.
Hunt Military Communities owns roughly 52,000 homes on Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Army installations across the U.S.
Researchers from Binghamton University will receive $2.6 million from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office to develop ways to reliably support higher amounts of solar power on the grid.
The three-year project will focus on advanced grid-forming PV inverter control technologies so that the renewable energy source can be more efficiently and reliably integrated with electricity generated by coal, natural gas or other non-renewable methods.
The goal of the research is to demonstrate a new grid-forming control algorithm at a 1 MW hybrid PV plant at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. The proposed controls will be scalable and replicable to multiple hybrid PV plants.
Principal investigator on the research, Associate Professor Ziang “John” Zhang, said that today’s power system uses synchronous generators that have been well studied for decades. It is well known how they will behave under different conditions — as a rotating mass, a synchronous generator following Newton’s Law of Motion. However, renewable energies such as a PV system connect to the power system through an inverter, “which will behave based on the control software.”
One issue facing the Binghamton team, he said, is that alternating current generated by traditional methods is able to naturally synchronize with existing power on the grid if the electricity is properly fed into it. A large amount of renewable energy in the grid could cause problems if we lack a thorough understanding of how these inverters will behave under different grid conditions.
“The way we currently use renewable generation is that we just dump all of the power into the grid and conventional generators are doing all the balancing work,” Zhang said. “If we have fewer conventional generators in the system, something has to pick up this balancing work.”
