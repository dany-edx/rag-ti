The reservoir was built on a retrofitted gravel pit near the township’s water treatment plant.
The project is being headed by White Pine Renewables a company with a national presence in floating PV development. According to representatives from White Pine, the project will come in at a capacity just around 1 MW. White Pine said it was not always certain that the project would be floating.
“When siting projects, we simply choose the best technology for the project,” White Pine CEO, Evan Riley, told pv magazine USA. “We didn’t go into this project thinking “How do we put a floating solar project here?”, rather we approached this project like we do all projects with the question, “How can we apply clean technology to help save our customer money and help them achieve their environmental goals?”’
According to Riley, the decision to develop a floating solar project with a power purchase agreement (PPA) came after a site visit and over a year of due diligence and design. Riley said the floating project was selected as the best technical and financial solution, and is one that also helps the township achieve their environmental goals while minimizing land use impact.
Riley also shared that White Pine is currently evaluating options for suppliers of the solar modules and floatation docks and solar modules.
In March White Pine completed a floating solar array in northern California, the 4.8 MW Healdsburg Floating Solar Project, which is among the largest in the country. The photovoltaic-generated electricity will cover around 8% of the city’s total energy demand, moving it toward a goal of 60% renewable energy usage before 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/19/heres-why-you-need-to-support-california-net-metering/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"NOVEMBER 19, 2021",Here’s why you need to support California net metering,"Guess what folks, you’ve got to make some hard choices. They have to be adult choices, because the consequences are real.
Simply stated, if you want to save turtles, trees, and turnips in California – put your name down in support of Net Metering.
The choice is on how much solar you want on large solar farms in the desert, or on farmed flat land, and how much solar power you want to build on top of commercial buildings, homes, and parking lots.
Since you want to live in an energy dependent society, we have to generate clean energy for our homes and transportation.
How do we clean these things? Well, we all could ride bikes, but Californians love cars. We could all move to temperate climates where we don’t need air conditioning, but much of California’s population lives in a desert.
We’ve chosen an energy dependent lifestyle, we’ve chosen suburbia, and we’ve decided to move beyond nuclear generated electricity. We want that cake and, dammit, we’re gonna try to eat it too.
So, let’s lay the choices out in front of us.
California electricity utilities are attempting to cut the value we pay locally generated solar electricity. However, we need net metering to fully recognize the value of solar power on our homes and businesses if those rationally minded folks are going to invest.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), rooftop solar alone – using modern 20% efficient solar panels – has the potential to meet almost 90% of California’s electricity needs as of 2020. You can up that to roughly 100% if we covered our roofs in 22% efficient solar panels.
Recognizing this, the State of California recently passed legislation requiring that all new homes include solar panels, and that’s an amazing start. However, if we’re going to fight climate change, we cannot wait for the state to rebuild all of its buildings.

What about when the power lines are shut down? Investor-owned utility Pacific Gas & Electric incompetently managed powerline maintenance which led to hundreds of deaths due to forest fires. Now, to manage this risk, the utility’s solution is to intermittently shut down power lines during fire season.
To combat utilities shutting down the power grid, a southern California water treatment district is consulting with this author to build two solar power plus energy storage facilities to keep the water running during these fire events. The group has recently signed on for a $25 million facility upgrade.
The state knows this isn’t how we should be living our lives, that’s why they put money up for energy storage. If we believe energy storage is important in these fire hurt regions, why take away money for the electricity source for those batteries?
In terms of the power lines that catch the forests on fire, we need billions of dollars fewer of them when we install more local rooftop solar. This is because bigger power lines are needed to bring electricity from the desert to where we live. Building those lines costs money, money that local solar saves us.
In addition to power lines, one research group found that by 2030 alone, distributed solar and energy storage could save electricity customers $109 billion since private people are investing their own money into upgrading the power grid.

It seems distributed solar makes more money for people when it gets built, and saves money for people by lowering grid upgrade costs. Not to mention, it’s home and local business owners who save money on their electricity bills from solar.
It starts to make sense though that the centralized power company – which makes guaranteed money by having a big centrally managed power grid – might fight back against a network of home and business owners who tie their power plants together.
The increase in costs between rooftop solar and desert solar is mostly salesperson commissions, paperwork, and hourly wages for electricians and mechanical system installers. After all, it takes a lot of time to move residential solar power projects through the sales, permitting, interconnection, procurement, and construction process.

Some will point directly to the low cost of electricity contracts signed by large-scale solar power to suggest that is why it’s cheaper. However, no homeowner gets to buy electricity for a few pennies per kilowatt hour. The homeowner has to pay the guaranteed 10% profit margin for the utility, not to mention paying the cost for the thousands of miles of power lines. And, the homeowner has to pay the power company to cut down trees around its transmission rights of way to reduce fire danger.
This author wonders whether spending more money on human beings to install solar power is really such a bad thing? Is it really a bad thing that our neighbors are getting paid a little bit more to help build our planet’s clean energy revolution?
Research in Maryland suggests that the monies paid to local electricians, engineers, warehouse workers, installers, shop people, drivers, was worth more than then electricity cost.
Those who control the decision making at centralized utilities have decided that class warfare is the best way to attack your neighbors. The standard line of attack against net metering is that it increases the prices of electricity for everyone else.

In California, the utilities tell the state that solar power is for rich white people.
First, this is absolutely a lie. The largest chunk of solar owners are in no sense rich – they’re people whose household incomes range from $50,000 to 100,000 a year.
They are YOU.
Second, the wealthy attacking homeowners is part and parcel of class warfare. Why get mad at the fat cat who doesn’t drive their own car, when we can get mad at Joe and Susan down the street who drive a nicer car than me?
Remember, these are the same companies who lied to you about climate change and have known about its reality since the 1960s.
If you want to push back against those who care more about their guaranteed public approved monopoly return on investment, put your name down in support of California Net Metering.

This opportunity led the National Center for Appropriate Technology to launch what it said is the nation’s first AgriSolar Clearinghouse to connect farmers, ranchers, land managers, solar developers, and researchers with information about co-locating solar and agriculture.
The clearinghouse features a library of peer-reviewed information, videos, podcasts, news, and a forum for agrivoltaics discussion. More than 30 partners and stakeholders in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, national energy laboratories, the Smithsonian, and leading universities participated in its creation.
(Read: “Researchers develop a novel design for agrivoltaics”)
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said. The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland.
Arizona State University also conducted a study and found “probable barriers to wider adoption” that ranged from mechanized farming and harvesting to the additional costs of elevating PV arrays to allow for food production.
The clearinghouse project was funded by a three-year, $2 million cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office.

Future energy resources will be characterized by both a mix of larger, utility-scale generation centers, and an increasing share of smaller, flexible distributed energy resources (DERs).
That was the outlook shared by mPrest CEO Andy Bennett, who joined pv magazine to talk about the future of DERs and the role of distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS).
Bennett’s company began as a defense systems manager, developing algorithms for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense program, a highly complex and dynamic anti-aircraft system. mPrest later moved into energy, bringing experience with real-time, highly complex security systems management into its ground-up build of a DERMS service offering.
DERs that are located near load centers, like rooftop solar, are better able to respond to extreme weather events, national security events, or other unforeseen circumstances than centralized resources. They also come with a set of benefits for the grid, able to perform services like providing backup power under outages, supplying power in times of high demand, and, now increasingly, selling power in wholesale markets.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC’s) Order 2222 marked an important moment for DERs. It allows the aggregation of distributed resources for participation in wholesale energy markets. Expected benefits include lower costs for consumers through enhanced competition, more grid flexibility and resilience, and more innovation in the electric power industry.
Bennett said the FERC order will lead to a proliferation of entry of non-regulated aggregators and virtual power plants (VPPs), driving competition and complexity in the market. He said this broader market participation is good for the grid and for consumers, and opens the door for DERMS to derive more value from these flexible resources.

Bennett said that the economic stimulus package passed during the Obama administration led to a wellspring of advancement in grid control innovation, and a flood of intellectual capacity was drawn into the energy space. He said the stimulus may have placed too great a focus on the development and distribution of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). He said that this time around, it may be best for policy to consider non-wires alternatives, like the ones seen connected and managed by DERMS. The Biden bill is much larger than the Obama-era stimulus, and Bennett said he sees even more innovation on the way if it passes.
Bennett said that the U.S. simply cannot repair and replace the grid as it was, and that distribution will be the most cost-effective way forward.
“Electric vehicles alone increase a home’s energy load by nearly 50%,” said Bennett. “This puts a whole new set of difficulties for transformers already in need of replacement.” Combined with growing electrification, and a higher reliance on distributed renewable energy, and it becomes clear that the old way of building the grid doesn’t fully match up with new needs, he said.
DERs include solar PV, inverters, heating and cooling systems, energy storage, electric vehicles and their chargers, and more.
Bennett said that while DERs can be more resilient and reliable, they need to be managed properly to maintain that status. He said that DERMS de-risk distributed solar, EVs, and other connected DERs, and make them better able to predict and respond to disruptive events, like an overloaded transformer that fails, for example.
Bennett said the time to adopt better management tools before these problems occur is now. “We don’t want backlash on what we know is a fundamentally good thing in distributed energy resources, something that better protects the environment and saves people money.”

SunPower said it will coordinate charging and discharging customers’ batteries, while keeping some electricity in reserve for backup power to the home. Participating customers will be told ahead of time that their battery will be discharged and can choose to bypass or pre-set their system so their reserve does not fall below a certain level. In return, customers are expected to be paid by the utility for the use of their stored energy.
SunPower’s first offering is called ConnectedSolutions and will be marketed to customers served by Eversource and National Grid in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.
The SunVault battery uses lithium iron phosphate chemistry and is available in 13 kWh and 26 kWh sizes.
Customers will be able to participate during their local utilities’ virtual power plant season, which runs from June through September each year. SunPower will pass through all grid payments to participants. The company said participants can earn “hundreds of dollars” per year through the program.
In October, SunPower said it would double down on its residential business and weigh options for its Commercial & Industrial Solutions business, including new ownership.
As part of its focus on residential, the company acquired residential solar provider Blue Raven Solar for up to $165 million in cash. The move is intended to help SunPower expand in the Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.
Blue Raven currently books more than 90% of its volume in 14 states. Those states account for around 5% of SunPower’s sales. SunPower said this creates “a significant net-new geographic coverage opportunity.”
