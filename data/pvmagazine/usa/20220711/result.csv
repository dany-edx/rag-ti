Rystad estimates that recyclable materials from PV panels at the end of their lifespan will be worth more than $2.7 billion in 2030, up from only $170 million this year, and the value will approach $80 billion by 2050.
PV recycling is still in early stages, but it has been successfully implemented in Europe where the Waste Electrical and Electroni Equipment (WEEE) directive requires 85% collection and 80% recycling of the materials used in solar panels. In the US, California-based Solarcycle recently raised $6.6 million in growth funding to advance its solar recycling platform. Investors include some solar veterans such as SolarCity founders Peter and Lyndon Rive, and former CEO/CTO of Sunpower, Tom Dinwoodie.
Rystad projects that solar PV waste will grow to 27 million tonnes per annum by 2040, and they estimate that recovered materials from retired panels could make up 6% of solar investments by 2040, compared to only 0.08% today.
Not only is material recovery expected to be big business, but reclaiming the minerals will become increasingly necessary as the growing demand creates a short supply.
“Rising energy costs, improved recycling technology, and government regulations may pave the way for a market where more defunct solar panels are sent to recycling rather than the nearest landfill. Recycling PV panels can help operators save costs, overcome supply chain woes and increase the likelihood of countries meeting their solar capacity goals,” says Rystad Energy analyst Kristin
Based on the rate of installations in 2022 and assuming a 15-year lifespan for solar panels, Rystad looked at which regions and countries will benefit most from solar recycling in 2037. The findings showed that China will account for 40% of global installations this year, and when these panels mature in 15 years, the estimated recycling value will be $3.8 billion, out of a $9.6 billion global total. India will trail in second place with an estimated $800 million in value, followed by Japan with $200 million in estimated value. North America in 2037 is projected to be worth $1.5 billion, with Europe set to hold $1.4 billion.
The components in a solar panel with the highest value are aluminum, silver, copper and polysilicon. Silver accounts for about 0.05% of the total weight but makes up 14% of the material value, Rystad estimates. To recycle polysilicon requires an energy intensive process, which is why recycled polysilicon has a high price. Glass is not on the list of high value components because, while there’s a lot of it on solar panels, it has a low resale value.
Rystad estimates peak solar energy implementation in 2035 of 1.4 TW, by which time the recycling industry should be able to supply 8% of the polysilicon, 11% of the aluminum, 2% of the copper, and 21% of the silver needed by recycling solar panels installed in 2020 to meet the material demand. The result will be increased ROI for the solar industry, an enhanced supply chain for materials, as well as a reduction in the need for carbon intensive mining and refinery processes.
In September 2021, NREL scientists published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry. The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. The Rystad analysts point to the EU’s regulatory mechanisms for jumpstarting the recycling industry in Europe. And while policy can be a promote an industry, the economic potential of the solar recycling industry may be the greatest motivator.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/11/us-battery-startup-to-produce-solid-state-batteries-with-bi-layer-cell-design/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARYLAND",TRISTAN RAYNER,"JULY 11, 2022",US battery startup to produce solid-state batteries with bi-layer cell design,"From pv magazine global
Ion Storage Systems, a US battery startup based in Maryland, has received $30 million in Series A venture capital funding from the likes of Toyota Ventures, Tenaska, and Bangchak Corp. The company aims to develop factories to reach mass battery cell production.
Ion Storage is developing solid-state batteries and aims to produce 10 MWh per year and generate commercial revenue by the end of 2023. The key differences to other solid-state and next-generation batteries is a bi-layer cell design. This reduces typical lithium-ion battery defects, and works with existing and next-generation cathode chemistries, avoiding the use of critical raw materials like cobalt, nickel, and gold.
Neil Ovadia, Ion’s vice-president of operations, told pv magazine that the company can target multiple markets, ranging from defense to consumer products to electric vehicles and stationary grid storage. Ovadia noted that Ion is working on a variation to the core product meant for stationary storage applications.
“Ion’s unique technology unlocks the power of solid-state batteries through its patented Bi-layer cell design. The dense ceramic electrolyte separator is connected to a porous ceramic electrolyte scaffold,” explained Ovadia. “The porous scaffold acts as a “sponge,” creating uniform and continuous pathways for lithium metal plating without external volume change, while the dense layer acts as a solid-state separator blocking lithium metal dendrites – thereby avoiding the need for compression and preventing short circuits. This architecture makes Ion’s solid-state electrolyte compatible with a wide range of existing and next-generation cathode chemistries.”
“Ion bi-layer cell architecture is made of inexpensive, nonflammable materials and use of a lithium metal anode has been able to meet next-generation performance metrics, including high-energy density, strong cycling performance, wide temperature range, and fast charging all at room temperature and without compression,” he said.  “Its ability to utilize both existing and next generation cathode chemistries removes the need for supply constrained materials such as nickel and cobalt. The manufacturability of ION’s technology also sets us apart as we utilize already-scaled processing and high-speed green body manufacturing techniques for our ceramic electrolyte and largely utilize existing lithium-ion manufacturing processes for cell production.”
Furthermore, the battery allows for a “cathode agnostic” approach, opening a wide range of cathode materials to be used, he said.
Ion has previously said it aims to produce more than 1 million cellphone-size batteries annually, And while those figures were not restated, the plan is to develop Ion’s pilot manufacturing facility at its Beltsville headquarters in 2023. It will then supply samples to interested parties and first market customers.
In terms of the struggles that companies face to scale-up production processes, Ion says it “employs existing industrial scale ceramic preparation methods.” It claims its unique structure “allows for the use of widely deployed Li-Ion battery manufacturing equipment for final cell assembly.”

The three countries have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng said reflects the countries’ shared commitment to combat climate change and develop renewable energy.
The Section 201 tariffs, originally imposed under former President Donald Trump, imposed a 30% duty on all imported solar cells and modules, in an attempt to prop up US manufacturing of those products. In opposing the tariffs, Canadian officials argued that American import levels of Canadian hardware are too low to justify the tariffs. Since the Section 201 imports were put in place in 2018, Canada-to-US solar panel trade has decreased as much as 82%, said the Canadian government.
According to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, the new deal contains a mechanism to ensure that solar product imports from Canada do not undermine the existing US safeguard measure on imports of solar products. The deal and its terms also apply to Mexican solar manufacturers, but Canadian manufacturers have been notably hit harder by the tariffs, with the United States importing a higher volume of modules from Canada than Mexico.
In February, the Biden administration said that it would extend the Section 201 tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar panels and solar cells above an annual 5 GW tariff rate quota, thus upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and doubling the tariff rate quota for cells. The extension was described by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) as “a balanced solution in upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and increasing the tariff rate quota for cells.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/11/virginia-approves-55-minimum-bill-for-community-solar-the-highest-nationwide/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,VIRGINIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 11, 2022",Virginia approves $55 minimum bill for community solar – the highest nationwide,"The Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a minimum bill of $55.10 for the state’s new “shared solar” program. “Shared solar” allows customers to sign on for a portion of off-site solar generation when rooftop solar is not a suitable option.
This represents the highest charge of its kind in the United States, and it has come under fire from Virginia senators and solar advocates. The program is administered by utility company Dominion Energy, which originally sought an even higher minimum bill of $75.10.
State Senators Emmett Hanger, Scott Surovell, and delegate Rip Sullivan wrote in a letter to the commission that the high charge undermined the purpose of the bill, which was designed to create a market for third-party developers to construct community solar facilities. Under Dominion’s “Shared Solar” program, third-party community solar projects developers sign up interested customers and sell the power to the utility, and customers receive a bill credit for the power generated by the project.
The approved legislation also set the rate for bill credits under the program. Customers are paid $0.11765/kWh; however, customers of Dominion Energy pay upwards of $0.124/kWh for traditional electricity, and rates are steadily on the rise. Generally, community or shared solar programs offer bill savings or at least price parity with the market, but under this program, the economics aren’t particularly attractive to residential customers.
“We did not pass legislation to create a program that exists in name only,” said the senators in their letter to the commission. “(The shared solar program) should be implemented with an underlying assumption that the program needs to work. A competitive shared solar program is a new and exciting frontier for Virginia, and we recommend taking serious consideration of the input provided by industry and advocates with regards to what has proven successful in other markets.”
Dominion argued the high charge is designed to offset the “cost shift” that non-participants would receive as a result of the program. The company has not yet provided evidence of how much of a cost shift would be borne by non-participants.
The “cost shift” argument is standard in the monopoly utility playbook for quashing distributed solar projects and third-party participation in their territories. Read about California’s struggle with the cost shift argument and a debunking of its false assumptions here.
“It is correct that the record does not include evidence that specifies exactly what cost shift would occur under Dominion’s proposed minimum bill, or any of the other proposed minimum bills,” wrote SCC Hearing Examiner Mathias Roussy.
“If Dominion were so concerned about the costs shifted to non-participating customers, it should have endeavored to support its proposal with evidence quantifying this purported cost shift,” wrote Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Will Cleveland in a brief for Appalachian Voices. “The failure to meet this burden of proof should not result in program participants bearing completely speculative costs that have not been proven with evidence.”
The legislation is expected to discourage the buildout of clean energy in the state, going in direct contrast with Virginia’s climate change mitigation targets.
“It will certainly deter many Virginians from participating in it,” said Tim Marvich, vice president of Apex Clean Energy. “It’s been a challenge working in the commonwealth,” he said.

The storage systems will be used across a series of solar and storage projects that Cearway is developing in California and Hawaii. The five-project portfolio includes 75 MWac/300 MWh located in Hawaii and 415 MW/1.7 GW in California.
In Hawaii, Clearway is developing the Mililani I Solar and Waiawa Solar Power facilities on the Island of Oahu and represent Wärtsilä’s first large-scale energy storage systems in the state. The addition of energy storage will help Clearway Energy Group ensure reliable delivery of sustainable energy and contribute to Hawaii’s goal of reaching 100% renewable energy generation by 2045. The orders for Mililani I Solar and Waiawa Solar Power were booked to Wärtsilä order intake in the first quarter of 2021, and construction is expected to finalize in 2022.
In California, 482 MW of solar and 275 MW/1.1 GWh of energy storage are being split across the Daggett 2 and Daggett 3 projects, which are being developed in San Bernardino, California, adjacent to the site of a retired coal and natural gas plant. The storage systems will deliver renewable energy during increasingly volatile peak periods and help the state reach its goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. The order for Daggett 3 was booked to Wärtsilä order intake in third quarter of 2021, and the order for Daggett 2 was booked in fourth quarter of 2021. Construction has commenced on both projects with expected completion dates in 2023.
In addition to the Daggett projects, Wärtsilä is also supplying a 147 MW/588 MWh energy storage system that will be connected to the operating 192 MWac Rosamond Central solar facility in Kern County, California. The energy storage system will increase the effectiveness of the solar facility by performing ancillary services, primarily solar shifting, for the California Independent System Operator. The order was booked to Wärtsilä order intake in July 2022 and construction is expected to be completed in December 2023.
Each facility will include Wärtsilä’s GridSolv Quantum, a fully integrated, modular and compact energy storage system, as well as the GEMS Digital Energy Platform, Wärtsilä’s energy management platform for power system optimisation. All five projects will also include long-term service agreements with Wärtsilä, which includes capacity guarantees and maintenance for the lifecycle of the energy storage systems.

More than 700 MW of solar modules will be provided by Boviet as part of the order, with delivery slated for 2023. The shipment will include Vega Series 550 W panels.
The Vietnam-based solar PV manufacturer said its panels feature high-purity monocrystalline wafer technology combined with PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar, and large cell design modules. The Vega Series 550 W module features 10 busbars, 144 cells, a silver frame, and a transparent backsheet. It holds a module efficiency of 21.1%, and a system voltage of 1,000/1.500 V DC. It has a maximum power output of 433 W, and is rated to operate between –40 F to 185 F.
Each module measures 90.40 inches x 44.65 inches x 1.38 inches and weighs just under 64 lbs. It has a 25-year linear output warranty with 2.5% degradation in the first year and less than 0.6% from the second year until the end of the warranty. It also comes with a standard 12-year product warranty. Full specifications can be found here.
The solar modules have been a PVEL top performance product on its scorecard since 2019, and BloombergNEF Tier 1 status since 2017. BloombergNEF’s tiering system for PV module manufacturers is primarily based on bankability, the most important feature of a utility-scale solar module for most developers.
The deal adds to 255 MW and 138 MW module orders in June, both to serve single utility-scale projects, said Boviet Solar. In April, it announced several research and development projects in collaboration with three universities in Vietnam and one university in China.
The company said it is working on a new N-TOPCon cell technology, which it claims is more efficient and stable. It is also developing a second R&D project to integrate N-TOPCon cells into 600 W-plus modules. The modules will feature advanced casing and will benefit from a low temperature coefficient, low attenuation, and higher double-sided ratios, said Boviet.
In addition, Boviet Solar is targeting heterojunction (HJT) cell technology. The manufacturer said it expects HJT to become the next-generation mainstream technology, with an efficiency rating of 27.5%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/11/the-stabilizing-effect-of-vertical-east-west-oriented-pv-systems/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,DENMARK,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 11, 2022",The stabilizing effect of vertical east-west oriented PV systems,"From pv magazine global
Scientists from the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences have looked at the potential impact of deploying vertical west-east oriented PV systems on a massive scale in the German energy market. They have found that such installations could have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the country’s grid, while allowing greater integration with agricultural activities than with conventional ground-mounted PV plants.
The researchers used the EnergyPLAN model developed by Aalborg University in Denmark. It is commonly used to simulate the operation of national energy systems on an hourly basis, including the electricity, heating, cooling, industry, and transport sectors. It helps to predict how the German energy system might look like with more vertical PV by 2030.
“Only two parameters are systematically varied: firstly, the share of installed power of the different PV variants,” the academics said, noting that they did not consider solar trackers. “Secondly, two scenarios are considered, in which either a large-scale electricity storage is integrated or not.”
For conventional ground-mounted systems, the scientists considered a tilt angle of 20 degrees and an average estimated energy yield 1,020 Wh/W. For the bifacial vertical west-east oriented systems, they assumed a bifaciality factor of 90% and an annual energy yield of 999 Wh/W, while for vertical systems with a north-south orientation the annual energy yield was indicated at 926 Wh/W.
“In our model electricity demand for 2030 increases to 1,214 TWh/a and depends mainly on the assumptions for energy saving and fuel switch,” they said. “The greatest uncertainties are in the heat supply for buildings and industry.”
They also took into account the higher costs of bifacial panels, as well as that the installable power per area of vertical installation is lower due to shading effects, as the module row distance usually ranges from 8 meters to 12 meters, which in turn increases wiring costs.
“The additional cost for the land itself must be shared with the retained agricultural land use or benefit due to biodiversity promotion,” they said.
The scientists found that vertical PV systems can shift solar yield into hours of higher electricity demand and more electricity supply in the winter months, thus reducing solar curtailment.
“If electricity storage of 1 TW charging and discharging power and 1  TWh capacity is integrated into the energy system model, the effect is reduced to CO2 savings of up to 2.1 Mt/a with 70% vertical east-west and 30% inclined south facing modules,” they said. “Finally, while it might seem unrealistic for some to achieve a rate of 70% vertical power plants, even a lower rate has a beneficial impact.”
They described their findings in “Integration of vertical solar power plants into a future German energy system, published in Smart Energy. “The intention of this paper is by no means suggesting for all utility PV systems being vertically mounted in future,” they concluded. “Much rather a new opportunity is highlighted. Vertical PV systems can support the overall energy system.”

The SunSpec Alliance has developed guidance for implementing the standard, and has announced that the guidance is now ready for use in test deployments.
A separate standard for electric vehicle charging equipment enables chargers to accept direct current (DC) power from EVs, convert it to AC power, and deliver it to the grid.
SAE’s approach for EVs is known as V2G-AC, and the approach for EV chargers is known as V2G-DC.
The SAE standard “defines the interactions” between an EV charger and an EV, for the EV to be “granted permission” to discharge to the electric grid, says the introduction to SunSpec’s guidance.
The SunSpec guidance is designed to assist manufacturers of EVs and EV chargers, as well as operators and system integrators, to implement the SAE standard together with a communications protocol developed by the global engineering institute IEEE, known as IEEE 2030.5.
Grid value
California’s investor-owned utilities “seem to be proponents of the V2G-AC effort,” said SunSpec Alliance Chairman Tom Tansy, “given the fact the state has selected IEEE 2030.5 as its operator-to-DER protocol, and because having visibility into/control of EVs is central to the utilities’ grid operating and reliability strategies.” The term DER refers to distributed energy resources, including EVs.
The SunSpec guidance is in “test” status, meaning that the document is “unlikely” to contain significant defects and that it is ready to be implemented in demonstration projects, field tests, and early deployments, SunSpec said in a statement. If defects of any type are discovered, the statement said that technical comments are submitted and are then remedied in a new “test” document, with the process repeated until the work group developing the guidance decides to change the document’s status to “approved.”
The SunSpec guidance, technically known as a profile, “fills in gaps” in the communications protocol as well as the functional behavior of the EV and the EV charger that are not directly addressed in other standards, the statement said.
The mission of the SunSpec Alliance, says its website, is to accelerate the growth of the distributed energy industry and expand the market for renewable power by specifying de facto standards.

The good news is that cost-competitive solar is here to stay. As the costs of solar components have come down, the industry is now focused on advancing affordability through reducing soft costs and financing costs.
Energy storage technologies have seen a similar trajectory of lower costs, but the most cost-effective applications today are generally limited to shorter-term reliability use cases. Long-duration energy storage technologies are just now scaling up, many using DOE resources to cross the bridge to bankability. (The notable exception is pumped-storage hydropower (PSH); however, unlike PSH, electrochemical storage has few to no locational requirements, lending to its current popularity even in the presence of other storage technologies.)
Between two essential technologies for grid-scale decarbonization – one already being deployed at gigawatt scale and the other quickly reaching revelance for utilities and operators – a 100% clean grid might seem like it’s just waiting for low-cost battery storage technology. But it doesn’t have to be, if customer-owned assets  can play a broader role in helping manage the grid.
The limits of solar & storage today
To fully understand why virtual power plants (VPP) are positioned to leverage solar plus storage systems, we first need to understand the technical limitations of both solar and storage that restrict them from acting as a one-size solution to the climate challenge at utility scale.

As I’ve mentioned before, renewable generation is low cost today, but it is variable and not so available on-demand. For this reason, many solar and wind projects have added short-duration storage – because that is all the grid will pay for.  In order to decarbonize retiring dispatchable and baseload generation, we will need new tools that shift load with the same level of dexterity that we currently reserve only for electricity supply.
VPPs maximize DER utilization
Pioneering utilities have invested in their own storage at the distribution level for basic reliability services, but most haven’t ventured further than a few hours because lithium-ion batteries are expensive beyond that application.  Other battery chemistries promise to be able to provide more cost effective long-duration storage, but they are early in their commercialization cycle.  On the other hand, customers are willing to pay top dollar for energy storage on site.  Critical institutions like hospitals have an infrequent but mission-critical need for long-duration back-up power; solar homeowners are increasingly installing at-home batteries for when the grid is down or they fear it might be; before long, EV owners will be using their vehicles’ batteries not just to commute but to provide backup power for their home; and the list goes on.
What if utilities or grid operators utilized these distributed energy resources (DERs) during the vast periods they sit idle?  Or what if we utilized these distributed assets not just on infrequent occasions to provide local resilience at home, but used them daily to provide benefits to the grid at-large?
Solar, storage, and VPPs in the real world
These questions aren’t just theoretical; VPPs are already offering a straightforward solution for maximizing the value of renewable supply and energy storage proliferating at the grid edge.  While novel implementations like the vehicle-to-grid case I highlight are still in early stages, utilities and aggregators together are already pioneering expanded functionalities for distributed solar/storage VPPs at scale:
These projects are differentiated by the degree to which dispatch is automated, how data is exchanged with the wholesale market and/or utility, and the grid services each is providing. In the world of VPPs, software is driving this breadth of innovation, though not without a deep appreciation for the underlying DERs. While not an exhaustive survey of American VPPs, these three examples show the wide range of possibilities for aggregated, behind-the-meter solar and storage in the United States today. They are only a piece of what’s being accomplished across the country, and a sliver of what VPPs are capable of around the world.
No matter where the future takes us, solar and storage technology will continue to be a foundational part of the strong value proposition of VPPs.  If recent history is any indication, we will only grow increasingly capable of optimizing DERs to maximize penetration of renewables and defer infrastructure investment without compromising reliability.
