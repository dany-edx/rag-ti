By unreasonably limiting Duke’s near-term procurement of clean, low-cost solar resources, the Commission’s order will increase costs for ratepayers and delay reductions in Duke’s carbon emissions.
Under landmark legislation passed by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2021, the Commission was required to adopt a plan for reducing Duke’s North Carolina carbon emissions by 70% (against 2005 levels) by 2030, unless the deadline is extended by the Commission under certain allowable circumstances.
Last May, Duke filed a proposed Carbon Plan. It included several portfolios for achieving the required carbon reductions, but only one that would do so by 2030. Interested parties, including renewable energy suppliers, customer groups, environmental organizations, the North Carolina Attorney General, and the state’s consumer advocate, filed thousands of pages of comments and expert testimony on Duke’s plan. Our companies were active participants throughout the proceeding through our trade association, the Clean Power Suppliers Association.
The Commission held a three-week hearing in the fall, and on December 30 issued a 137-page order directing Duke to take a suite of 39 actions to begin reducing its carbon emissions and to continue and improve the planning process going forward.
The Commission’s order deals with a wide range of complex issues. However, at its core the order seeks to establish a comprehensive plan for retiring Duke’s expensive and dirty coal plants and replacing them with cleaner alternatives. The key question in the proceeding is what that alternative resource mix should look like to achieve 70% decarbonization in the least-cost manner while maintaining or improving system reliability, as required by the legislation.
Duke and other parties presented a variety of resource “portfolios,” which included various combinations of new solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear, battery storage and hydroelectric resources. In support of their alternative portfolios, commenters produced detailed modeling, developed by nationally recognized energy consulting firms. Many of the alternative portfolios presented could have achieved quicker emissions reductions than Duke’s, and at lower cost.
The Commission appropriately concluded that it’s not necessary to settle on a single portfolio now, and instead approved a series of steps to be taken over the next two years that are intended to make reasonable progress toward achieving the goal while keeping a wide range of portfolio options on the table.
One of the most important of those steps is the procurement of new solar resources by Duke. No party disputed that solar and solar-plus-storage are the most proven, affordable, and scalable zero-carbon generation resources available to Duke’s system. It was also undisputed that the least-cost pathway for achieving compliance with the decarbonization mandate while maintaining reliability would be to maximize solar additions in combination with other resources that provide power when the sun isn’t shining.
CPSA’s expert witness documented that ratepayers could enjoy huge savings by adding substantially more solar than proposed by Duke, including $860 million of savings in 2030 alone, assuming conservative solar costs and not accounting for Inflation Reduction Act incentives. While our modeling showed the need for natural gas additions comparable to those proposed by Duke, it demonstrated that adding more solar would avoid the need to invest in more costly and uncertain zero-carbon resources like small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Other intervenors, including the Attorney General and its expert witnesses, reached similar conclusions Other intervenors, including the Attorney General and its expert witnesses, reached similar conclusions with respect to the benefits of greater solar additions.
The Commission ignored virtually all of this evidence and agreed with Duke that that it need only procure 3,100 MW of new solar through 2024. This is a bad outcome for ratepayers and for the goal of reducing Duke’s carbon emissions in a timely fashion while maintaining reliability.
Duke claimed that the solar resources it is required to procure should be limited by the rate at which it thinks it can interconnect such resources to its system. The Commission declined to require Duke to test its ability to improve its interconnection rate by procuring and trying to interconnect more solar, arguing that doing so might require Duke to pay more for solar if prices come down over time. Leaving aside the uncertainty as to whether solar prices actually decline, this argument ignores the fact that failing to include more solar in the overall resource mix means that significantly more expensive resources will have to be procured instead.
Although the Commission claims that it hasn’t given up on achieving H.B. 951’s decarbonization mandate by 2030, its refusal to require Duke to procure more solar through 2024 almost certainly makes 2030 compliance impossible. The Commission can correct this error, save ratepayers money, and expedite the required reduction in carbon emissions by adjusting the solar procurement volumes upward this year and next, by significantly increasing solar procurement volumes in the next iteration of the Carbon Plan, and by pushing Duke to investigate ways to improve its interconnection performance. We urge it to do so.

The software is aimed at improving operational efficiencies and speeding the rate of installations. The tool helps developers make decisions in program funding, asset management, and field resources. The company said solar developers experience up to 140% project portfolio growth with the platform due to built-in best practice business processes.
Sitetracker said its software can reduce project turnaround time streamlined site discovery, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. The residential solar platform includes dashboards, reports, and AI-driven analytics to empower decision-making. Real-time visibility is enabled through the software, showing live views of project schedules, job information, and site maps.
Today, residential solar installers are facing challenges like skilled labor shortages, permitting, and reducing installation cycle times. “[Developers] need a powerful tool that they can implement quickly and that gives them the best-of-the-best when it comes to process, intelligence, and strategy of deployment operations,” said Parjanya Rijal, head of energy products, Sitetracker.
Mexico-based Energia Real used the software platform to boost its nationwide distributed solar energy deployments.
“Prior to Sitetracker, we could deploy only about 30 sites at a time because the logistics, personnel, supply chains, and collaboration with partners and regulators consumed too much of our time and overwhelmed our tech tools,” said Santiago Holschneider, chief operating officer, Energia. “Now, with Sitetracker, we have a more efficient, intelligent, mobile solution to handle those tasks, and we can speed up the deployment of our clean, renewable energy PPA systems more than 150 installations at a time.”
The company also recently developed Quickstart courses for EV charging infrastructure and telecom development.
In September 2022, the company completed a round of equity and debt financing totaling $96 million.  Energize Ventures led a new round of equity funding totaling $66 million, and BridgeBank, a subsidiary of Western Alliance, provided a $30 million revolving credit facility. The new financing brings Sitetracker’s total capital raised to nearly $200 million since 2013.
“Helping companies deploy critical infrastructure as efficiently as possible is our mission, and we’re innovating at every step based on real-time customer feedback,” said Rijal.

Trina Solar‘s U.S. unit has revealed that it will start operating a 6.5 GW silicon wafer factory in Vietnam to exclusively supply its operations in the U.S. utility, commercial and residential solar markets. The move comes after the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) determined in December that solar cell and module imports from Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand were circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on cell and module imports from China.
The DoC preliminarily found that Trina Solar was attempting to bypass U.S. duties by processing its China-made solar cells and modules in Thailand before importing them to the United States. Trina’s U.S. subsidiary said it expects the wafers, cells and modules imported from the new factory in Vietnam to “receive an exemption from circumvention.”
“Prior to the DoC preliminary AD/CVD determination in December 2022, Trina worked to expand production locations, arrange business operations, and diversify supply chains to comply with U.S. regulations and minimize tariff impact on its products,” said the manufacturer. “Trina’s ongoing process already includes polysilicon sourced outside of China and manufacturing modules and cells in Southeast Asia. The wafer facility is a further step in Trina’s supply chain diversification.”
Solar cells and modules from Vietnam are also affected by the DoC’s preliminary findings, but companies operating in the Southeast Asian country are “permitted to certify that they not circumventing the AD/CVD orders, in which case the circumvention findings will not apply,” according to the DoC website. The same applies to Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand.
Trina Solar’s new Vietnam facility is expected to start operations in mid-2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/12/from-300-gw-to-3000-gw-per-year-a-utopia/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",ECKHART GOURAS,"JANUARY 12, 2023","From 300 GW to 3,000 GW per year – a utopia?","From pv magazine 01/23
At the “Forum New Energy World” conference hosted by Conexio in Berlin in September 2022, one panel session posed a provocative question: “Three thousand [GW] instead of 300 GW of solar additions – crazy idea or hard-hitting reality?”
Ten years ago, pv magazine and the forum – then both part of renewable energy consultant Solarpraxis AG – suggested a similar utopian figure by launching a campaign to reach 300 GW of annual global PV additions in 2025. Back in 2012, talk in Germany concerned solar taxes, over-subsidization, and the 52 GW solar capacity ceiling. Nevertheless, Solarpraxis founder Karl-Heinz Remmers called for Germany to hit 200 GW of cumulative PV by 2025, alongside the global 300 GW annual goal.
Since then the German government has adopted a goal of 215 GW of solar this decade and the world will probably see 300 GW of new solar installations this year. It is now widely accepted that an increased solar ambition is required to address climate change and energy security. With the electrification of heat, transport and other sectors opening up potentially huge markets for solar, what should the target be?
In my remarks in the forum, I provided the international context and tapped our global network of reporters to shed light on the situation and outlook of key PV markets.
I drew upon trade body SolarPower Europe’s “Global Market Outlook 2022-2026,” and the world’s three biggest solar markets – China, the United States, and India – were assessed by Vincent Shaw, Anne Fischer, and Uma Gupta, respectively. Pilar Sanchez, in Valencia, Spain, provided an update on Spain, Europe’s second-biggest PV market, after Germany.
China, the U.S., India, and Spain contributed 54.9 GW, 27.3 GW, 14.2 GW, and 4.8 GW of new solar capacity in 2021, respectively. The global total in the year was 167.8 GW, 21% more than 2020, when the pandemic hit. If the industry maintains the 25% average growth rate recorded over the past decade, an annual addition of 3 TW per year could be achieved within 10 years.
SolarPower Europe expects continued strong growth and its most ambitious scenario predicts more than 300 GW of solar this year. “No single energy technology ever in history has grown as massively steeply as photovoltaics,” said Christian Breyer, professor of solar economics at Finland’s LUT University, in reference to the PV learning curve in the past 20 years.
As a result, institutions underestimate solar’s growth potential, even SolarPower Europe itself, as executive advisor Michael Schmela admitted. Breyer pointed to frequent failures by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to anticipate the meteoric rise of PV. In view of the proven dynamism of the industry and pressing need to address climate change, it is incomprehensible how IRENA can expect annual global PV installations to plateau at around 440 GW per year of new solar from 2030 to 2050.
As Silicon Valley venture capitalist-turned solar entrepreneur Bill Nussey explained in his 2022 book, “Freeing Energy,” “economies of volume” are at play in the solar and semiconductor industries. In the US alone, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is expected to lead to the installation of 950 million solar modules. This massive scale drives solar’s exponential growth. By comparison the global number of coal- and gas-fired power plants is tiny and this fundamental difference makes forecasting PV adoption all the more complicated.
Solar, though, needs suitable conditions to flourish and help cap the rise in average global temperature this century at 1.5 C. As LUT’s Breyer points out, it’s not just a matter of replacing fossil-fuel power plants with renewables but also of electrifying – and thus, decarbonizing – sectors including transport and industry, as part of renewables-driven power-to-X. For such a vast undertaking, 3 TW per year of solar may be too little. That’s why Breyer ventured even further in the 3,000 GW session by asking the audience whether 3 TW is “crazy, realistic, necessary, or maybe even too low.”
Breyer said 15 to 20 years ago the world did not have 5 TW of power plant generation capacity, full stop. No one then was mulling power-to-X and decarbonizing supply chains.
The IRA addresses the upstream solar industry of component manufacturing as well as the downstream market of PV installations. Previously, US solar manufacturing was marked by ugly bankruptcies such as Solyndra or German business Solarworld’s Oregon subsidiary, as American companies followed in the footsteps of their European peers.
The IRA introduces a ten-year investment tax credit of 30% with “adders” to raise the credit even further, such as an extra 10% for using American components. Upstream companies can claim advanced manufacturing production credits. For example, European module maker Meyer Burger will receive $0.07 per watt for each module from its new Arizona plant. The IRA – which also opens doors for Canadian and Mexican manufacturers – creates perfect conditions for a long-term PV boom.
Similar efforts are needed in Europe and elsewhere to tackle the climate crisis and reach or exceed 3 TW of annual additions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/12/interactive-mapping-tool-for-siting-renewable-energy-projects/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 12, 2023",Interactive mapping tool for siting renewable energy projects,"A dynamic geospatial mapping tool was developed by Argonne National Laboratory as a free, open resource to identify suitable locations for siting solar, wind, and other clean energy infrastructure projects. Based on desired parameters, the tool will generate a “heat map” of ideal locations. 
Users of the Geospatial Energy Map (GEM) can locate sites with high suitability for both clean power generation and energy transmission corridors in the United States. Project developers can browse and download geographical information systems (GIS) data layers or create a customized suitability model to target areas for energy development. 
GEM is backed by large sets of relevant geospatial data, including energy resources and infrastructure, demographics, boundaries, utility territories, and more. The tool comes loaded with over 190 data layers, and nearly 100 modeling criteria. Users can select for population density, proximity to nearest substation, slope, wildfire risk and low-income household percentage, and more. 
As a new feature, the map can quickly orient itself to a focus technology like solar, wind, or EV charging infrastructure. This allows for a quick loading of multiple data layers directly relevant to the technology under development.
All told, GEM includes preconfigured models for over 40 types of energy infrastructure. Land-based wind turbines or utility-scale photovoltaic solar are two examples of technology presets. The preset data layer groupings provide a starting point that users can then further customize to their desired specifications. 
“Choosing where to build utility-scale renewable energy development is a tremendously important decision with effects that reverberate beyond the generation of electricity,” said Michael Levin, a GEM user and Ph.D. student studying renewable energy landscapes at Columbia University.  “GEM not only makes energy suitability maps public but allows for the user to customize the model used to produce such a map.” 
GEM was first publicly launched in 2013 as the Energy Zones Mapping Tool (EZMT), and has since been redesigned, rebranded and reengineered. It is hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory with funding from the DOE’s Office of Electricity. 
“In GEM we applied lessons learned from almost 10 years hosting the EZMT, including making it easier to learn and use, updating the software architecture, and choosing a name fitting its current scope of uses,” said Jim Kuiper, principal geospatial engineer and GEM technical coordinator. 
A diverse community of users are expected to make use of GEM, much like its predecessor EZMT. Kentucky’s Office of Energy Policy used the EZMT for prototyping its Solar Site Suitability on Reclaimed Mine Lands tool. Other users include private industry, public service commissions, regional transmission organizations, national laboratories, educational institutions, and energy and natural resource nonprofits.
Argonne will host a virtual tutorial of GEM on Tuesday, January 17th at 2 p.m. CT. Click here to attend the webinar via Microsoft Teams.

This week Seattle announced it had provided more than 1,000 rebates and no-cost upgrades to low-to-moderate income residents to switch to electric heat pumps from conventional boilers and HVAC systems.
Not a bad start for a mid-tier city whose population is 733,919, an increase of just under 37% since the Dot Com era brought numerous technology companies to the region. Targeting climate pollution in buildings is one of Seattle’s top priorities, while its Clean Heat program rebates incentivize and support building owners to make the transition from oil and propane systems to energy efficient electric heat pump systems.
Seattle’s Office of Sustainability and Environment launched the Clean Heat program in 2017, providing an instant $1,500 rebate to qualified contractors to apply credit to customer’s invoices when they convert their HVAC system to electric systems like a heat pump. Households that qualify as low-to-moderate income are eligible to receive a heat pump conversion at no cost through the city’s Office of Housing bureau.
An additional $2,000 tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act brings the total rebate ticket to $3,500 for Seattle residents to recoup from switching to electric heat pumps.
Residents interested in converting to heat pumps can visit the OSE’s website to enroll, while the city has set up a Clean Heat Program website to find contractors available to install a Mitsubishi Electric heat pump.

The average household uses 500 gallons per year for heating, or 5 metric tons of carbon emissions, the equivalent of driving 12,244 miles in an average car.
With about 18,000 households tied to oil heating systems at the start, the Sustainability office estimates up to 1,500 householders per year have been transitioning from oil to electric systems.  This shows a 28% conversion rate based on a cumulative drop to 13,000 oil systems on the high end.
By December 2028, Seattle homeowners with traditional oil tanks may be mandated to upgrade their tank to a code-compliant tank in order to prevent leaks or otherwise remove the tank without fear of penalty. The Seattle City Council recently budgeted $2.6 million for 2023-24 for oil conversion incentives, while repealing its oil tax ordinance.
Electric heat pumps not only reduce carbon emissions, they are also three times more efficient than an oil furnace. The technology has also improved over the last decade, as current systems detect changes in temperature and adjust accordingly, with increased reliability. Despite their name, heat pumps also provide air conditioning during the Summer, providing a dual system that as an electric system runs year-round providing temperature-controlled comfort throughout the house. A heat pump’s filtration system can meanwhile be increased during seasons of increased wildfire risk, when smoke and poor air quality can extend into urban environments.
According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, as of November 2022 more than 15 states and 100 U.S. cities have moved to electrification via heat pumps and other means such as EV charging systems, with four states – New York, California, Massachusetts and Maine – calling for a full electrification to heat pumps by 2030.

The portfolio consists of projects expected to enter COD operations by Q4 2023, and  located in Chautauqua, Columbia, Erie, Oneida and Onondaga counties, New York.
Once completed, the community solar projects will provide clean energy to power over 10,000 residential and commercial subscribers within the National Grid utility territory of central and western New York.
New Yorkers in the National Grid territory will be eligible to subscribe to the community portfolio beginning in mid-2023.
The community solar portfolio supports New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which set a goal for the state to meet 70% of its electric demand from renewable energy by 2030, with net zero emissions from renewables by 2040.
The Empire State represents the largest community solar market for Nautilus, based in Summit, N.J., with 200 MW of development-stage and operational assets in New York.
New York continues to lead the nation in community solar development, with a total installation rate of 693 MW of solar assets deployed through December 2022.
Initiated in 2011 by then Governor Andrew Cuomo, NY-Sun is New York’s solar incentives and financing platform that makes solar available to all residential homeowners, renters, and commercial businesses.
At the recent NYSEIA New York Solar Summit in Albany, N.Y., the NY-Sun program neared its one-year anniversary for the state’s Distributed Solar Roadmap, in which it set a goal of deploying 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030.
On December 28, the state’s energy development group the New York Research Development Authority outlined an Energy Storage roadmap which calls for 6 GW of new energy storage projects for stationary standalone and paired with solar applications.
Empire State climate leadership
Earlier this week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced the state’s Cap-and-Invest Program to fund a sustainable and affordable future as part of the 2023 State of the State. The program includes a Climate Action Rebate incentive that will shake up $1 billion of future cap and invest proceeds.
The Cap and Invest program is a sister program to the state agencies NYSERDA and Department of Conservation’s co-penned CLCPA, which was finalized this past month.
The Climate Act is a broad-reaching climate accord, which through 2030 intends to enforce and penalize infractions to residential, C&I and utilities that do not adhere to strict carbon emissions protocols.
The distributed energy market is further incentivized by the CLCPA program, with the solar, wind and energy storage asset categories to receive additional credits for new installations while promoting the green energy workforce, promoting energy justice, and switching consumers off of fossil fuel appliances and onto heat pumps, electric stoves and EVs, to name just a few.
Further details on the Cap-and-Invest program and CLCPA platform can be found here and here.

Also known as Blythe Mesa Solar II, it generates 224 MWac / 310 MWdc of reliable solar energy, enough to power approximately 94,000 homes, and features 448 MWh of co-located storage. 
“This project is much more than a significant new source of clean energy for California’s energy system; it’s also a case study in how the clean energy industry can maximize our impact by prioritizing domestic supply chains and union labor to ensure the benefits of the clean energy transition are felt by all Americans,” said Sheldon Kimber, CEO of Intersect Power.
The Athos III solar project is part of Intersect Power’s near-term portfolio totaling 2.2 GW of solar PV and 1.4 GWh of co-located storage. The remainder of the portfolio will be operational in 2023. Construction of the Athos III solar project created 500 peak union jobs.
The Athos III solar project is using First Solar thin-film modules and features Nextracker’s TrueCapture tracker optimization and control software to capture additional energy gain during diffuse light conditions. The technology continuously refines the tracking algorithm of each individual solar array in response to existing site and weather conditions. Nextracker said the software can deliver energy gains from 2-6%.
Intersect Power named Signal Energy as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm of the project.

Funding for the project’s construction and operations was secured as part of the broader portfolio financing announced last November, when Intersect Power closed on roughly $800 million in construction financing to fund construction of Athos III along with 415 MWdc Radian Project in Brown County, Texas, southwest of Fort Worth. The portfolio term debt was provided by HPS Investment Partners. The Tax Equity was provided by Morgan Stanley Renewables Inc. Construction debt was provided by Coordinating Lead Arrangers MUFG and Santander Corporate & Investment Banking, along with Cobank, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Helaba, and Nord LB as Joint Lead Arrangers.
Intersect Power has a base portfolio of 2.2 GW of solar PV and 1.4 GWh of co-located storage that is under construction or in operation. The company’s business plan includes growth in grid-tied renewables, as well as large-scale clean energy assets including green hydrogen.

Granholm pointed to a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) evaluating Mexico’s renewables potential.
Granholm’s tweet preceded President Biden’s meeting with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Mexico City, to discuss topics including climate and energy.
NREL’s study found that Mexico’s target of 35% clean electricity by 2024, under its energy transition law, could be met largely by increasing solar’s contribution from its 2021 level of about 4% to 9%, and wind’s contribution from about 8% to 12%. Mexico reached 27% clean electricity in 2021, including about 10% hydropower.
NREL conducted its study as part of the U.S. government’s broader ongoing engagement with Mexico on clean energy and climate issues, said an NREL spokesperson. The work was funded by the U.S. Department of State and managed by the Department of Energy.
Granholm said that with “rapid growth” in renewables deployment, Mexico could generate high levels of investment, increase energy access, reduce costs to consumers, and help improve grid reliability.
NREL’s study said that deploying renewables in Mexico “at scale” would also create new high-quality jobs, and represents “the most cost-effective way” to provide rural electrification, which “enhances education, health, and other social services that improve quality of life.”
Clean electricity is also needed, the study said, to electrify transportation, “which would improve air quality.”
NREL’s study cautioned that private-sector renewables projects modeled in its high-renewables scenario “would have a very low probability of completion” if legal, regulatory and market frameworks were changed in a way to “create significant barriers to market entry.”
Conversely, “given the right mix of policies and technical measures, the country could attract large-scale investments” in renewables, providing “social and economic benefits to its citizens.”
Southeast Mexico has a “very strong potential” to become Mexico’s “most important clean energy hub,” the study said, powering growth in the region and “exporting clean energy capabilities” to the rest of the country and to Central America.
Nationwide, Mexico’s solar capacity potential is 137 times the projected electricity demand for 2024, NREL said. The Mexican state of Baja California Sur, an electrical islanded system, has 743 GW of solar capacity potential, and could “transform” its power system into a clean energy system, NREL said.
NREL’s study showed that distributed generation deployment in Mexico, such as rooftop solar, reached 2 GW in 2021, and achieved an annual growth rate of over 40% that year.
The New York Times has reported that renewables developers in Mexico face difficulties as they seek to bring solar and wind projects online.
