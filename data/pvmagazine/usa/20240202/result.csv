Additional subscribers will be public schools, a municipality, non-LMI households, and various private organizations, including two affordable housing providers, a community recreation center, religious institutions, and a housing association.
The seven projects boast a combined capacity of 14.4 MWac, estimated to avert 667,788 metric tons of CO2 emissions or the equivalent to eliminating 748 million pounds of coal burned over the lifespan of the projects.
The six Illinois community solar projects are located in Chicago Heights, Ford Heights, Monee, Granite City, and Rockford, and will serve qualifying customers of ComEd and Ameren. The New York solar project is located in Oswego County and will serve qualifying customers of National Grid.
Reactivate, a renewable energy company, in collaboration with Walmart and U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance closed a tax equity transaction on the portfolio.
According to Reactivate, 90% of the cost savings delivered by the projects will go to LMI households who will see a minimum 20% reduction on their retail electricity costs, up to the amount of their subscription to project output. Total customer savings from the projects in this investment are projected to exceed $17 million over the lifespan of the projects.
“Projects like Reactivate’s are shining examples of how renewable energy developers can distribute the direct benefits of grid-decarbonization to historically underserved communities,” said Clark Conlisk, vice president, assistant director of project management & impact capital at U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance. “For the LMI households subscribed to the project, the money that no longer must be spent to keep on the lights and A/C is a benefit to real people and empowers them to spend or save as they choose.”
Reactivate, founded by Invenergy and Lafayette Square, specializes in developing, owning and operating renewable energy projects that improve the lives LMI households and energy transition communities across the country. The company focuses on community solar, commercial and industrial, small utility-scale, energy storage, and EV charging projects.
Walmart set a goal to bring at least 2 GW of community solar projects in service by the end of 2030, and the retailer reports that this investment is an example of its energy transformation strategy of focusing on projects that make access to clean energy affordable, reliable, and equitable.
“Serving our customers and communities is core to our purpose at Walmart and our support of this high-impact portfolio demonstrates our continued commitment to that purpose,” said Frank Palladino, vice president, renewable energy strategy at Walmart. “These projects will assist in building a stronger and cleaner grid, expand access to clean energy for underserved communities and help people save money on their utility bills.”

The company’s Accelerator Program sold 2,000 vehicle reservation slots that were made available to prospective customers investing $10,000 or more in the company. The program was launched in January 2023, with the top investor committing nearly $4 million to the company. Aptera has secured over $100 million in funding over the past two years.
The reservations are for Aptera’s Launch Edition vehicle, which supports a 400-mile range and is equipped with 700 W of solar cells. Aptera said the solar cells onboard enable grid-free electricity generation for up to 40 miles of additional range per day. The company targets a full-scale production vehicle with a range of 1,000 miles.
The Aptera vehicle is designed to have low-drag for increased range, contains liquid-cooled electric motors, and can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds, the company reports. The vehicle is equipped with all-wheel drive.
In October 2022, Aptera said it would partner with major solar module provider Maxeon to source the vehicle’s solar cells.
Aptera said funds raised through the Accelerator Program will contribute to the procurement of low-volume tooling and the buildout of the company’s first production-intent vehicles that will be used for testing and validation. After these vehicles are validated, the final step is to raise capital for high-volume production.
“When we first launched Aptera as a solar mobility company, we were amazed by the overwhelming support from thousands of prospective Aptera owners,” stated Chris Anthony. “With over 46,000 reservation holders, we are dedicated to securing the remaining funds required for scalable, high-volume production of our solar EV.”
Aptera said its high-volume production line will produce vehicles using ten times less capital than traditional automakers. This is a lofty claim, and time will tell if the company can execute on such a goal.
As Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla, the world’s largest EV manufacturer, once said, “Prototypes are easy, production is hard.”

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/02/utility-opposition-stymies-fair-access-to-community-solar-act-in-washington/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,WASHINGTON",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-02,Utility opposition stymies Fair Access to Community Solar Act in Washington,"Washington state was home to the first community solar project in the nation; but it is no longer the leader. In fact, it ranks 31st in the nation in community solar deployment. Despite best efforts by legislators to advance community solar in the state with passage of The Fair Access to Community Solar Act, it was recently stymied for another year due to utility opposition.
The Act was put forward by Washington Representative David Hackney (D-King County) and State Senator John Lovick (D-Mill Creek) who filed HB 2253 and SB 6113, bills intend to expand equitable access to the benefits of locally sited solar power to all Washington rate payers.
The legislation intends to advance community solar in the state as well as to help the state meet its energy goals. In addition, the bills are expected to create jobs and help the economy.
The Act establishes a community solar bill crediting program to ensure subscribers earn a proportionate credit on their monthly utility bill. If passed, it would allow community solar developers to leverage state and federal incentives to bring energy savings to Washington rate payers.
When the legislation was presented in the House Energy & Environment Committee, it was met with such hostile amendments by the utilities that it was tabled until 2025, according to Derrick Chernow, Western Regional Director of the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA). The amendments were opposed by the broad coalition in support of the original bill, Chernow said.
“In a regrettable course of action, Washington state’s electric utilities have effectively killed The Fair Access to Community Solar Act, dealing a setback to our shared goals of advancing climate action and promoting energy equity,” said Chernow. “This disappointing move hampers the collective effort of our diverse coalition and Washingtonians striving for a sustainable energy future.”
By enabling access to community solar, this legislation would have supported state in achieving its decarbonization goals sooner, and bringing energy rates down for those who need the assistance the most. CCSA said that Washington will now fall further behind with the loss of this bill, and residents will continue to face high energy burdens.
“As soon as constituents and my colleagues learn how community solar works, they realize the immense benefits it can bring,” said Representative Hackney. “Our state is long overdue for this type of legislation to implement a competitive community solar program in order to bring energy justice and economic growth for all Washingtonians.”

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/02/transportation-department-testing-dual-use-solar-snow-fence/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-02,Transportation department testing dual-use solar snow fence,"In colder regions, like in Minnesota, high winds and snowfall can lead to drifts that build up on roadways, making them hazardous and difficult to clear. These regions often build snow fencing along the roads to block the drifts from accumulating on the pavement.
Now, researchers at North Dakota State University and the Minnesota Department of Transportation are evaluating adding solar panels to the snow fencing, adding a dual benefit of adding clean energy production to an already developed space.
The solar fence is comprised of six-inch-wide solar panels with spaces in between. The fence functions by blocking snow drifts. A 100-foot section of fence can produce about 20 kWh to 30 kWh per hour during the daytime in the northern climate, said Mijia Yang, associate professor of North Dakota State and lead researcher on the project.
“They’re producing enough energy with this 100-foot section to meet the home energy needs for a typical household,” Yang told Minnesota Public Radio. “And that was pretty eye opening. If you did this across a mile that would be 50 homes.”
The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) maintains about 36 miles of composite snow fence across the state, part of a network of 177 miles of various types of windbreaks.
Some models of the solar fence developed by MnDOT also have electricity-powered heated mats powered by the PV array. This may help the department manage snow drifts, which can reach 10 feet high.
Economic analysis of the PV highway-side fence showed that it could reach breakeven in about four years, while the fence could last well over 20 years.
The next stage for the research is to develop a plan for where to send the electricity production. One possibility would be powering electric vehicle charging stations at roadside rest stops. MnDOT is also mulling selling the generation to electricity offtakers, generating more revenue for the department.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/02/array-technologies-announces-dual-row-solar-tracker-upgrade/,"MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-02,Array Technologies announces dual-row solar tracker upgrade,"Array Technologies, a specialist in utility-scale solar tracking solutions, enhanced its Array STI H250 solar tracker with a new driveline motion transmission system, which Array said increases precision and efficiency.
The transmission system in this tracker comes from Array’s DuraTrack tracker. The company said this addition enables “effortless” removal of the driveline. This capability makes the tracker applicable for agrivoltaic installations, as the slew drives restrict the movement of each row when disconnected, which can allow passage for tractors and streamlining maintenance tasks between rows.
Other changes to the Array STI H250 include a reduced number of piles per tracker, improved east-west tilt, a wider north-south angle between rows and an integrated control system. It also can integrate with Array SmarTrack energy optimization software, designed to address specific challenges in utility-scale solar projects.
The suite includes specialized products like Array SmarTrack Backtracking, Array SmarTrack Diffuse, Array SmarTrack Automated Snow Response, and Array SmarTrack Automated Hail Response. Array said some utility-scale challenges can be undulating terrain and weather considerations, and that the new STI H250 can adjust its tilt based on the terrain, prevailing weather conditions and the specific geographical location of the installation.
Array is a 30-year-old tracker specialist that went public three years ago. In 2022, the company acquired European tacker company STI Nordland, expanding its geographic footprint. Array has since expanded into South and Central America.
Array said it is committed to domestic sourcing and manufacturing, and in 2022 announced an agreement with Lock Joint Tube, a manufacturer of mechanical and structural-grade steel tubing, to secure supply from a new steel mill in Texas. Using locally sourced steel in the production of solar tubing is in response to domestic content requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Lock Joint Tube also produces steel tubing for Array at a torque tube mill in South Bend, Indiana.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/02/2023-delivers-best-year-this-century-for-irradiance/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,2024-02-02,2023 delivers best year this century for irradiance,"From pv magazine global
2023 was not only the hottest year in modern records, but was also the sunniest year so far this century, according to analysis by Solcast.
2023’s margin as the sunniest year of the century was particularly large for non-polar landmasses – the places we live, and the places
where our solar PV systems are located, as El Nino kept moisture and cloud over the Pacific Ocean, and deviations in the Arctic circulation pulled low pressure systems further north into the Arctic Ocean. Large regions were 10% or more above long term trends, including Western and Northern Europe, Eurasia, much of China, Southern Australia, the Midwestern and Southern US, Central and most of South America.
2023: Sunniest year so far this century
Analysis by Solcast reveals that for the entire planet, 2023 saw the highest total solar irradiance of any year this century, using data from Solcast and ECMWF ERA5. 2023 saw total solar irradiance near 0.5% above the long-term average – a small percentage, but equating to an increase of solar energy received of approximately 16,000 TJ.

The anomaly was 1% for combined non-polar land areas, a much larger deviation than any seen in the last 15 years. This deviation was larger than the global total, due to increased cloud formation over the oceans offsetting some of the reduced cloud formation over non-polar land areas.
Americas
The Americas saw above average irradiance, as an early El Nino created a lot of moisture and cloud over the tropical Pacific Ocean, pulling cloud away from the surrounding land areas.
In Central and South America, Brazil and neighboring countries to the north saw the highest irradiance in over 15 years, in a year marked by significant drought in the Amazon. Argentina and Chile further south saw near or slightly above average irradiance. In total, 13 countries in the Americas saw the highest irradiance year in over a decade, including Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
North America saw slightly above average irradiance in total, although the North-West and North-East United States both saw cloudier than average conditions. In the North-East conditions will also have been impacted by aerosols, from the Canadian wildfires that burned
for much of the year.
In the U.S. this was offset by large areas of above average irradiance in the Mid-West and South. This was good news for solar production in Texas, which had another record year of solar capacity installations and generation according to the SEIA.
Africa, Europe and the Middle East
Western Europe and Northern Europe saw well above average irradiance, due to Arctic circulations contracting north, reducing the intensity of associated cloud from low pressure systems. Estonia saw the sunniest year they have seen in over 10 years. Whilst these patterns delivered several large and intense storms, cloud cover was lower than average.
Eastern Europe and the Middle East saw below average irradiance as moisture from both the Eastern Mediterranean and Indian Ocean was pushed onshore. Much of Africa saw a relatively normal year for irradiance, with only small deviations relative to average. Despite small deviations, Tunisia, Liberia, Eritrea, Kenya, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Rwanda saw more irradiance in 2023 than they have for any other year in the last decade.

Asia
China saw above average irradiance, with some areas seeing 110% of long term averages, although this was less intense towards the coast. Japan saw the highest national average irradiance in over a decade, especially along the eastern coast near Tokyo, as anomalous westerly winds kept Pacific moisture offshore.
A positive Indian Ocean Dipole contributed to overall below average irradiance across most of India, although the south-western Indian states saw above average irradiance. Across Asia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Bhutan, and Japan saw higher irradiance than the last 10 years.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.
ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1940 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/02/wafer-prices-stable-ahead-of-chinese-new-year-festivities/,"COST AND PRICES,OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,2024-02-02,Wafer prices stable ahead of Chinese New Year festivities,"Wafer FOB China prices have stayed consistent for the third consecutive week due to a lack of significant changes in the market fundamentals. Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafer prices remain steady at $0.246 per piece (pc) and $0.357/pc, respectively.

Cell manufacturers who intend to keep up production throughout the Chinese New Year break have started to accumulate raw materials, which has increased the volume of wafers traded. The amount of wafers produced and in stock is adequate to meet downstream demand, momentarily dashing wafer makers’ expectations of additional price increases.
Divergent views exist regarding the near-term outlook for wafer prices in the marketplace. According to a market observer, polysilicon companies appear to be banding together to drive up polysilicon prices perhaps as a result of the relative scarcity of N-type polysilicon. This foundation may lead to an increase in wafer pricing, the source said, adding that wafer makers may boost prices even if demand does not recover in the near future because of manufacturing cost considerations.
On the other hand, a downstream market participant believes that there aren’t enough fundamental prerequisites for price hikes in the supply chain market as a whole due to the oversupply of upstream materials. The polysilicon production output in January is expected to be equivalent to about 70 GW of downstream products, significantly greater than the module’s January production output of roughly 40 GW, according to this source.
OPIS learned that only the major cell producers will continue regular production throughout the Chinese New Year break, with nearly half of the existing cell capacity in the market suspending production during the holiday.
The wafer segment is expected to reduce plant operating rates during Chinese New Year but is less evident as compared to the cell segment, resulting in higher wafer inventories in February that may exert downward pressure on wafer pricing in the coming weeks.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
