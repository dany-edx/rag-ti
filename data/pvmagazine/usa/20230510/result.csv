A companion bill now heads to the state’s House for approval.
In recent years Texas has become the largest wind energy market in the United States and is soon to take over as the number one state for solar, potentially leapfrogging California. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) expects the state to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, building on the 16 GW that is active to date, and making it the nation’s sterling example of harnessing the sun’s energy.
Texas lawmakers showed their support for SB 624 in late April.
The law singles out solar and wind facilities, requiring them to obtain a permit from the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of Texas, while excluding fossil fuel facilities. Governor Greg Abbott, who has long shown an affinity for fossil fuels, has appointed all the PUC members, who now would act as gatekeepers for any renewable energy project.

pv magazine USA touched base with several project developers where Texas is a primary market for project development activity. Many developers have stated that if SB 624 remains, they would consider focusing development activity in other states.
Karlis Povisils, senior vice president of development at Apex Clean Energy said, “if this bill becomes law, projects currently in development will be delayed, downsized, or cancelled altogether, harming rural communities that are anticipating new tax revenue for schools, services, and infrastructure.”
“The bill also threatens Texas landowners who want to exercise their private property rights to earn multi-generational income for their families by harnessing energy resources on their land. Texas will lose thousands of megawatts of new, clean, low-cost capacity and economic development at a moment when it’s crucial that the state adds more generating capacity to meet surging demand and ensure the diversity of its power fleet,” Povisils said.
This week, Apex Clean Energy and Powin announced the development of the 195 MW Angelo solar-plus-storage (100 MW | 200 MWh) system using Powin’s Centipede modular battery systems. The project was advanced despite the threat posed by SB 624 and other anti-renewable energy bills in the Texas senate.
Mike Wietecki, senior vice president of strategy and regulatory affairs of Powin said, “Texas has undergone a rapid and seismic shift in its generating fleet. An incredible number of resources have gone into converting the state to a global leader in the energy transition. Such rapid transformation is expected to be challenging and hit some speed bumps, but it is hard to argue against Texas’ leadership and success,” he said.

“This new legislation will undeniably hinder continued transformation of the Texas grid and threaten investment, growth, workforce advancement, and energy cost reduction within the state,” Wietecki said. “Because of the rapid transition, and the potential for unintended consequences, there may be an opportunity to evaluate progress thus far to ensure the continued deployment of clean energy happens in an efficient manner. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the goal of this legislation. Rather it seems intent on putting up illogical roadblocks that will cost Texans real dollars by increasing energy costs, all while reducing the status of Texas as a leader in the sector,” added Wietecki.
Diane Sullivan, senior vice president, environmental and permitting of Chicago-based Hecate Energy said, “Texas invited us in more than a dozen years ago and continues to be one of the largest renewable producers. Now with a shift this one administration has changed the way we look to do business in Texas.”
Hecate Energy has developed more than 554 MW of Texas solar and 1 GW of storage projects.
Raina Hornaday, co-founder and general manager of Caprock Renewables, an Austin, Texas-based utility solar and wind project developer said, “While the bill lists a series of items that a project must provide, PUC’s authority to approve or reject a project is entirely subjective. There is no objective criteria that projects could meet to be assured approval.”
“This is deliberately designed to allow the wealthy and politically-connected to control the process, and creates chaos in the renewables development world,” Hornaday said. “We are working with industry groups here in Texas to fight this legislation.”
To date, Caprock has installed over 1.2 GW of renewable energy projects across the Lone Star State.
Caprock is among several Texas developers that are members of CleanTX, a statewide clean energy advocacy platform that in late April partnered with REAL Houston, the Advanced Power Alliance (APA), the Consumer Energy Alliance and the Texas Land & Liberty Coalition to provide webinars and various community-wide educational sessions for locals and regional constituents. The programs are designed to inform various stakeholders on SB 624 and the various bills that could blunt the growth of Texas’ burgeoning renewable energy market, such as SB 6, SB 7 and SB 2014.
The other Texas legislation packages are geared towards incentivizing natural gas fired power plants (SB 6), including coal, nuclear and gas-powered resources as “dispatchable energy resources” as an affront to distributed energy resources (DER) (SB 7),  and the termination of the state’s Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ), renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS) and renewable energy credits (REC) (SB 2014).
A replay of an April 27 informational CleanTX webinar is available here.
The Advanced Power Alliance published an April 27 report from NERA Economic Consulting  and Astrapé Consulting highlighting that in 2024, renewable generation in the ERCOT grid will deliver $6 billion in net system operating cost savings with more than 18 GW of reliable capacity contributions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/10/biden-administration-outlines-energy-permit-reform-priorities/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 10, 2023",Biden Administration outlines energy permit reform priorities,"Building clean energy projects in the U.S. at the speed and scale needed to adequately address the climate crisis requires strategic reforms that improve the way such projects are sited and permitted at the federal, state and local levels, said a press release from the Biden-Harris Administration.
The administration released its objectives for permit reform, a hot issue working its way through the energy transition discussion. To accelerate the federal permitting process, the administration is establishing a new interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to facilitate the timely, responsible, and equitable permitting of electric transmission infrastructure.
The White House press release said the Administration is in support of reforms contained within Senator Joe Manchin’s Building American Energy Security Act, as a “bipartisan compromise.”
“The reliability, economic, and environmental benefits of expanding our transmission system are well documented, but the means to permit, plan, and pay for these facilities unfortunately lag far behind. We cannot afford for this to be the case any longer – the expansion and modernization of our national power grid is central to meeting our urgent climate and energy security goals. The steps the Biden administration took this week will unlock new financing and regulatory tools, improve coordination among federal agencies and transmission developers, establish clear milestones and deadlines for decisions, and provide early and meaningful consultation with impacted communities and key constituents. These helpful actions demonstrate a commitment to building out the electric grid we need to realize America’s clean energy future. We urge Congress to build upon this important progress by passing meaningful, bipartisan permitting reform legislation.” Gregory Wetstone, president and chief technology officer, American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE)
However, environmental groups have argued the legislation ignores critical technologies that support energy efficiency and local, small-scale, and responsibly sited renewable energy projects.
“Most of Congress’ ‘permitting reform’ proposals assume that utility-scale renewable energy that relies on large-scale transmission build-out on public lands, regardless of responsible siting and community and environmental impact, is the silver bullet to decarbonization—an assumption that should be intellectually interrogated instead of being willfully accepted,” said the Center for Biological Diversity.
Recommendations to Congress
The administration suggested that Congress should expedite connection of interstate and offshore electric transmission lines by providing for electric transmission siting and cost allocation. It also directed Congress to reform the transmission interconnection queue so that new generation projects are not stuck in line waiting for approval for over four years.
Furthermore, the Administration said regional electricity transfer requirements should be established to avoid events like the 2021 Texas freeze, which became a humanitarian and economic crisis. Notably, communities that had local solar generation paired with energy storage were able to keep power on and avoid the worst effects of the Texas winter storm Uri, which took the lives of hundreds of Texans.
The administration also asks Congress to boost transmission financing by clarifying that the Secretary of Energy is able to to make loans for transmission outside of designated transmission corridors, if it is deemed to be in the national interest.
The Energy Act of 2020 directed the Department of the Interior to permit 25 GW of renewable energy on departmentally managed lands by 2025. The nation is already on track to surpass this goal. It recommended that Congress should update goals for 2030 and 2035 to facilitate ongoing identification of zones for the development of renewable energy and for the siting of necessary transmission to attach that generation to the grid.
The Biden-Harris administration also made recommendations to ease permits for critical minerals mining and support deployment of hydrogen and carbon dioxide infrastructure. While carbon capture technologies reduce emissions of fossil fuels, environmentalists argue that these technologies perpetuate technologies that are more costly and less carbon-efficient than renewables like solar.
“Dangerous distractions–including carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture, enhanced oil recovery, dirty hydrogen, so-called ‘advanced’ or ‘chemical recycling’ processes for plastics, and other technologies that perpetuate fossil fuels–and biomass and factory farm biogas, must be banned from coming online,” said the Center for Biological Diversity. “Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels, and public funds should not be used to prop up oil and gas companies’ efforts to extend the demand for fossil fuels and existing infrastructure for as long as possible.”
Permit reform
The administration made several direct recommendations for the reform of permits in pursuit of “prompt and legally defensible decisions.” It recommends the creation of a programmatic review fund to execute more reviews rapidly. It supports long-term programmatic reviews that may be relied upon for five years, unless there are new circumstances.
“Congress should require Federal agencies to examine and propose the use of categorical exclusions for clean energy projects where feasible,” said the White House release.
Federal agencies often use “antiquated” reporting systems, and the administration recommends that Congress makes resources available to develop an automated, joint electronic permit application for agencies. It requests creating maps for project development locations, establishing clear information submission deadlines, and the development of automated workflow tools compatible with existing federal agency reporting dashboards, and creating a permitting technology steering group.
The White House recommendations, which can be read in full here, continue with recommendations for cutting duplicative analyses, improving community engagement, addressing gaps in the permitting workforce, establishing clearer requirements for mitigating environmental harms, and incentivizing state and local permit reform and standardization.
DOE proposal
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has begun work on some of the objectives the White House has laid out. The Grid Deployment Office issued a Notice of Intent and Request for Information (RFI) to inform the designation of National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETCs). NIETCs are geographic areas where electricity limitations, congestion, or capacity constraints are adversely affecting electricity consumers and communities.
“Designation of a NIETC unlocks critical federal investment and regulatory and permitting tools to spur urgent transmission investments needed in these geographic areas to improve reliability and resilience and reduce consumer costs,” said DOE.
The RFI seeks stakeholder feedback to improve the NIETC designation process to more accurately pinpoint areas experiencing the greatest transmission need and with the greatest potential for immediate transmission deployment.
“A reliable and resilient electric transmission system is essential to the Nation’s economic, energy, and national security,” said Maria Robinson, director, Grid Deployment Office. “We must improve and expand national transmission capacity to meet the challenges of more frequent and intense weather, provide access to diverse sources of clean electricity, and fulfill electricity demands driven by increased electrification of homes, businesses, and vehicles.”
A NIETC designation can unlock Federal financing tools, specifically public-private partnerships through the $2.5 billion Transmission Facilitation Program under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the $2 billion Transmission Facility Financing Loan Program under the Inflation Reduction Act, said DOE.

The Solar and Wind Grid Services and Reliability Demonstration program will deploy clean energy technologies with a goal of learning more about technologies that support a resilient grid that automatically adjusts to changing demands.
“As threats and climate risks to America’s energy infrastructure continue to evolve, DOE is laser-focused on ensuring our power grid is strong and reliable as it incorporates a historic level of renewable resources,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm.
The program is funding eight projects at 15 sites in 13 states and Puerto Rico, and will involve research teams consisting of utilities, laboratories, universities and industry. The teams will test how wind and solar plants can more reliably transmit clean energy and protect against disruptions to the network of high-voltage power lines that carry electricity from centralized generation sources. Monitoring and test controls will also be implemented that allow the grid to restore power quickly and efficiently after power outages.
The selected projects fall into two topic areas: Wind and solar grid services design, implementation, and demonstration; Protection of bulk power systems with high contribution from inverter-based resources (IBRs).
The Electric Power Research Institute was awarded $3.4 million for the Collaborative Ancillary Service Accelerator for Renewables (CASAR) project. This project will develop a multi-level control architecture for power systems that supports ancillary services to the grid, including active and reactive power event and non-event reserve services. This project will work with multiple balancing authorities and utilities to perform demonstrations of grid services at sites across Michigan, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, and California.
GE Renewable Energy was awarded $3.5 million for the Grid-ready Wind project. The work is primarily taking place at the Great Pathfinder wind power plant in Iowa, and it includes a commercial-scale demonstration of grid services using emerging grid-forming technology in Type-III wind turbines with electricity output controlled by converters. This project is jointly funded by WETO and SETO.
Portland General Electric Company was awarded $4.5 million for a project that will develop a 300 MW wind, solar and battery storage combined power plant. The project aims to demonstrate grid services using mixed grid-forming and grid-following technologies at the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility in Oregon, North America’s first energy center to combine wind, solar, and energy storage systems in one location.
Veritone was awarded $3.9 million for the Advanced Reliability and Resiliency Operations for Wind and Solar (ARROWS) project, which aims to boost confidence in renewable power investment using Veritone’s artificial intelligence-powered distributed energy resource management system (iDERMS) technology. The AI-powered platform will be used to forecast, optimize, and control IBRs on New Mexico’s power grid in real-time.
Con Edison of New York was awarded $3 million with an awardee cost share of $1.4 million for a project that demonstrates reliable protection for an IBR-dominant grid. The project aims to improve existing grid protection strategies and enable new technologies to maintain reliable system protection in systems with a very large number of IBRs.
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was awarded $2 million with a cost share of $600,000 for the Protection of Inverter-dependent Transmission Systems (PROTECT-IT) project. NREL will partner with University of Idaho, Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Tesla, and the Public Service Company of New Mexico to investigate the impact of high levels of IBRs on bulk power transmission protection systems.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company was awarded $2.5 million with a cost share of $700,000 for development of a sensitivity-driven wide area protection (SWAP) coordination tool for high penetration of IBRs. The intent is to develop an analysis tool that can be incorporated in commercial platforms used by transmission utilities and system operators nationwide.
University of Illinois at Chicago was awarded $3 million with a cost share of $1.1 million for a project that uses an innovative modeling, protection, and control framework to ensure reliable operation of a bulk power system with 100% of its generation coming from IBRs, which have much different fault characteristics than traditional synchronous generators. The IBR model under development by this project will be able to perform accurate protection simulation and be easily implemented in the existing commercial simulation software. This project will demonstrate protection strategies in Illinois and Puerto Rico.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/10/energy-policy-recommendations-from-environmental-groups/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 10, 2023",Energy policy recommendations from environmental groups,"As energy in the U.S. makes its broad transition towards solar and other renewables, permit reform has taken center stage in political arenas as an issue to tackle to more rapidly deploy clean energy capacity.  
However, environmental groups say that both Congress and the Biden Administration are failing to execute permit reform plans that integrate justice, equity, and environmental common-sense practices. 
A group of environmental groups led by the Center for Biological Diversity submitted a letter to U.S. political leaders and released an accompanying report of their vision of more beneficial permit reform legislation. 
The groups argue that Senator Joe Manchin’s permit reform proposal, which has gained steam amongst his colleagues, undermines the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Clean Water Act by fast-tracking fossil fuel development. A letter signed by over 750 organizations was released in opposition to his proposal. 
The policy report first recommends Congress pursue a just renewable energy system through what they describe as commonsense solutions. The core of this recommendation is supporting a buildout of energy efficiency and local, small-scale, distributed energy. 
“Most of Congress’ ‘permitting reform’ proposals assume that utility-scale renewable energy that relies on large-scale transmission build-out on public lands, regardless of responsible siting and community and environmental impact, is the silver bullet to decarbonization—an assumption that should be intellectually interrogated instead of being willfully accepted,” said the report. 
The groups recommend policy that prioritizes energy conservation technologies, distributed energy resources (DERs), and larger-scale renewables on parking lots, canals, rights-of-way, and degraded lands that have ready access to existing transmission lines and don’t harm communities or wildlife.
(Read: “Three ways to implement solar and renewables to reduce land use“)
Energy efficiency and conservation is the first logical step in the report’s recommendations. Deployment of energy efficiency and conservation technologies could reduce annual electricity use by 26% in 2030, according to a report published in Science Direct. Efforts should include weatherization like insulation, basic electrification like heat pumps and electric or induction stoves, and demand response technologies like smart equipment, sensors, and controls. 
“At the same time, wasteful energy-guzzlers like crypto-mining should be restricted and regulated. Bitcoin crypto-asset mining facilities use up to 1.4% of domestic electricity—the same as the electricity needed to light every home in the country,” said the report. 
The report directly recommends that Congress direct Inflation Reduction Act funds to energy efficiency, while regulating energy-intensive cryptocurrency operations and cutting national defense spending to open more funding for equitable clean energy buildout. 
Another chief recommendation is the prioritization of distributed energy resources. DERs are proven to offer co-benefits over their utility-scale counterparts, including greater affordability; greater resilience in extreme weather events, power outages and disasters; local economic benefits of jobs; avoided wildlife impacts with larger scale clean energy projects and transmission. DERs also limit power losses in line transmission, as 5% to 20% of energy is lost in transmission alone. 
The groups recommend that Congress support the buildout of distributed energy resources on all private and public rooftops and parking lots, prioritizing service to disadvantaged communities. They also recommend Congress to create financing avenues for non-federal public entities to adopt solar.
Congress can maximize responsible siting of large-scale renewable energy infrastructure on canals, degraded lands, and nonresidential highway corridors, said the report. A study concluded that if every canal in California was covered by solar panels, that would add approximately 13 GW of capacity, enough to power nearly 10 million homes. This effort would simultaneously reduce water loss by 63 billion gallons of water per year due to evaporation, and reduce aquatic weed growth, reducing the need for pesticides.
Third, the groups recommend that Congress fulfill the remaining energy demand not met by distributed resources with responsibly-sited projects.
The report said passing the A. Donald McEachin Environmental Justice for All Act would help in this effort. The Act restructures current permitting processes so that cumulative impacts are considered properly and consistently as new infrastructure develops in environmental justice communities. The bill also directs federal agencies to seek Tribal government input in the NEPA process, and to ensure that Indian Tribes are invited to hold the status of a cooperating agency for proposed actions that might impact their reservation lands and sacred sites. 
The report also suggests that Congress forms a master energy planning agency that oversees a more just energy transition and overcomes barriers to inefficient energy systems.
Fourth, the groups recommend eliminating energy technologies that are deemed “distractions” from effective decarbonization efforts.
“Dangerous distractions–including carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture, enhanced oil recovery, dirty hydrogen, so-called ‘advanced’ or ‘chemical recycling’ processes for plastics, and other technologies that perpetuate fossil fuels–and biomass and factory farm biogas, must be banned from coming online. Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels, and public funds should not be used to prop up oil and gas companies’ efforts to extend the demand for fossil fuels and existing infrastructure for as long as possible,” said the report.
The report, which can be read in full here, continues with recommendations for equitable permitting guidelines, reform to interconnection processes, and the enactment of a state of emergency for climate change.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/10/california-gold-rush-supporting-2023-residential-solar-market/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOFTWARE,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 10, 2023",California gold rush supporting 2023 residential solar market,"Multiple parties have suggested that the residential solar market would slow down in 2023 after having a very strong 2022. One quarter into 2023, the slowdown is evident, but it is showing in a more complex manner than most projected, with California NEM 2.0 applications beating industry expectations while many other states in the West and South are performing less well due to the effects of interest rates.
Higher rates have led to third party-financing ownership increasing in multiple state markets, according to Ohm Analytics, with Nevada and Arizona seeing increases from 8% and 12% in late 2022 to 12% and 19%, respectively, in March 2023. Sunrun also noted the strong performance of its subscription-based Shift product in the California post-NEM 2.0 landscape in its recent earnings call, suggesting that California could see a bigger rise in third-party ownership.

Several months ago, Ohm Analytics told pv magazine USA that they believed 2023 would experience slower growth. Ohm based this prediction on increasing interest rates, as well as a possible lull in California after NEM 3.0 rolled out in mid-April. However, Ohm also believed there would be regional differences due to variations in electricity pricing, incentives and installation costs, all of which influence return on investment.
During a recent conversation with pv magazine USA, reflecting back on the year so far, Ohm Analytics’ Joseph Wyer and Rohan Humphrey said that much of what’s happening in the residential solar sales market in Q1 2023 was foreshadowed in its “Q4 2022 DG Solar and Storage Market Report.”
Wyer explained,
“What we’re seeing in the data is divergent regional growth with a lot of the southern Sunbelt and Mountain States seeing slower demand on the year, initially because of the challenges around financing and interest rates, but then also some installers losing access to M1 payments. This has put financial pressures on installers, particularly in some of the southern states.”
M1 refers to the first solar project milestone payments, where traditionally a portion of the payment was paid out to the installer when the contract was signed, then another is paid after permit submission, installation, and other stages, Wyer said.
It was suggested that larger companies were reallocating resources toward solar markets with higher electricity rates or greater incentives. Humphrey said higher interest rates could result in monthly loan payments approaching or exceeding current electricity bills.
Humphrey also noted that as with all businesses, specifically in the high capital expenditure construction industry, cashflow is important to the residential solar market. Contractors that were using loan products and getting an upfront cash injection once they signed project contracts were using cashflow to finance salaries, and general business expenses. With these advance payments slowing down, cash is tighter for installers.
Sunrun and Sunnova also gain additional financial benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act and general solar finance that regular homeowners do not. As commercial entities, these groups can gain an additional 10% tax credit if they use domestic content or install in energy communities. Moreover, they are allowed to depreciate assets associated with solar projects.
One thing that surprised many was the strength of the solar market in California leading up to the end of Net Metering 2.0 on April 14, 2023. Ohm says that the number of people that signed up for solar prior to the April date are enough to build large books of business and support solar installation teams for months.
Ohm is releasing its updated market forecast and insights to customers over the next few weeks in its “Q1 2022 DG Solar and Storage Market Report.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/10/svb-reemerges-as-a-lender-extends-credit-to-100-mw-pivot-energy-community-solar-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,COLORADO,HAWAII,ILLINOIS,MARYLAND,MINNESOTA,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 10, 2023","Silicon Valley Bank reemerges as a lender, extends credit to Pivot Energy community solar portfolio","Just two months after the receivership and takeover of Silicon Valley Bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, now under the ownership of First Citizens Bank, SVB has reemerged as a lender to the solar development market.
The lender closed a $203 million debt financing to support construction of a 100 MW multi-state distributed generation solar portfolio of Pivot Energy, a Denver-based community, commercial and industrial solar development company.
Tax investor Foss & Company is committing an initial tax equity round in the portfolio, which comprises 35 community solar and C&I projects planned to reach commercial operation (COD) between mid-2023 and mid-2024.
Community solar subscribers in the portfolio include municipalities, healthcare facilities, food service, and retail companies, as well as 8,000 low-to-moderate income (LMI) residential households.
With community solar projects in Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, Hawaii, Maryland, and California, the portfolio represents what the company said is one of the most extensive LMI solar portfolios developed to date in terms of diversity and geographic reach.
SunCentral, a community solar subscriber management and acquisition platform, will manage the community solar portfolio through operations.
The debt transaction led by SVB includes a construction loan, tax equity bridge loan, and term loan. SVB led the financing as coordinating lead arranger (CLA) and sole bookrunner.  Other lenders committed to the DG solar portfolio include J.P. Morgan, National Bank of Canada, Bank United, Cadence and Comerica. The debt facility also represents J.P. Morgan’s first debt issuance to the community solar market.
The SVB financing represents Pivot’s second debt syndication closed with the SVB-led lender group. In 2022, the developer raised $190 million in credit to finance a 90 MW community solar portfolio in New York, Illinois, Colorado, Minnesota, California, and New Jersey.
Bret Labadie, chief financial officer for Pivot Energy, told pv magazine USA that for the new financing, Pivot had been in the market since Q4 2022 and were set to close the second debt facility with Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, but the federal takeover of the commercial bank put the financing process on hold.
“Each of the banks in this syndicate worked with Pivot and we were able to navigate the temporary uncertainty to retain the initial terms of the deal,” Labadie said.  “It’s a testament to the leadership from each of the parties that we were able to stay the course and see this loan through.”
“We are pleased to have led and structured this portfolio of solar projects across 35 sites in 7 key markets,” said Bret Turner, head of project finance, Silicon Valley Bank. “We appreciate the confidence and trust placed in the team at SVB to continue moving this asset class forward.”
When combined with the Foss tax equity contribution, the total financing package enables Pivot to construct, operate, and own the multi-year and multi-state portfolio.
“This initiative will expand access to clean, affordable energy for small businesses and low-income households, reinforcing our commitment to invest in tax equity within under-served market segments,” said Bryen Alperin, managing director at Foss & Company.
CohnReznick Capital was Pivot’s financial advisor on the transaction. Stoel Rives was counsel to the company. Milbank represented SVB while Winthrop & Weinstine represented Foss.
The financing is Pivot’s second project development portfolio to be built, owned, and operated since the company’s June 2021 acquisition by Energy Capital Partners (ECP).
Safe asset class
Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest U.S. commercial bank, was shuttered on March 9, 2023 and placed into receivership by the FDIC. After parent company SVB Financial filed for bankruptcy on March 17, First Citizens Bank entered an agreement on March 27 to acquire Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, effectively resuming the corporate debt financing platform of the bank.
SVB extended $56 billion of venture capital financing to climate-technology focused companies in 2021. Several solar development executives told pv magazine USA for the April print edition of pv magazine that the bank’s demise was not expected to create widespread challenges to development clients in the community and commercial and industrial (C&I) solar market, as well as utility scale solar companies.
“The biggest threat to the pace of project development is definitely not available capital, it’s the significant and ever-increasing pushback on project siting and land use at the local level,” said Mark Richardson, chief executive officer of U.S. Light Energy, a community solar developer in upstate New York, told pv magazine USA. “We are not even close to operating at full speed, because of local opposition, not because of a lack of financing,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/10/three-ways-to-implement-solar-and-renewables-to-reduce-land-use/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 10, 2023",Three ways to implement solar and renewables to reduce land use,"In 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To help energy planners and policymakers move in that direction, The Nature Conservancy studied strategies that maximize clean energy benefits while minimizing land use. The report, Power of Place: Clean Energy Solutions that Protect People and Nature, combines analysis of energy development impacts on emissions, land, and communities in the continental United States, in an effort to identify low-impact pathways to a net-zero national economy by 2050.
The report acknowledges the momentum behind clean energy development and said that recent investments by Congress will accelerate development, shore up and expand infrastructure and encourage deployment of other green technologies such as hydrogen, storage and carbon capture. However, it cautions that the rapid buildout could have a negative impact on land, natural habitats and more.
The report estimates that between 3.1 and 3.5 TW of wind and solar generation capacity is needed for the U.S. to reach net zero by 2050. If development continues with current methods, it would take over 250,000 square miles to produce that much clean energy. Instead, the researchers have developed a 70% impact reduction scenario where only 135,000 square miles would be needed.
The 70% scenario is achievable by adopting approaches that take up less space and to avoid sensitive areas. Three recommended approaches include: co-locating of wind and solar; siting agrivoltaics on farmland; and employing fixed-tilt solar.
Locating solar and wind systems on the same site is an effective way to save land, as the report estimates that land use would decrease from 9,467 square miles under current practices to 5,200 square miles in the 70% scenario.

Looking at agrivoltaics, the study estimates that under current practices, about 6,000 square miles of productive cropland would be used for energy generation. Whereas, in the 70% scenario it drops to 4,000 square miles; a 33% improved land utilization rate.
Fixed-tilt solar installations takes up less space and are a good land-saving option, the report points out. While single-axis trackers generate more electricity in the sunnier, southern regions, the report concludes that fixed-tilt is better for places with smaller average project sizes or high land cost.
Implementing the 70% impact reduction scenario will cost about 6.3% more than the current trajectory, the study says. However, the researchers acknowledge that this may be an overestimate because by avoiding sensitive areas, there will be a reduction in cancellation rates, permitting delays, the need for mitigation, and more.
Framework
Tradeoffs will continue between providing clean energy for all and minimizing disruption to communities, protecting natural areas and maintaining productive croplands. It is because of these tradeoffs that the researchers provide a framework for designing policies and practices that will balance these issues.
The framework begins with long-term transmission planning, which the report notes should take into account conservation and community data. “Inclusive, participatory planning processes are needed to ensure that economic and environmental benefits and burdens from decarbonization are shared equitably.”
Adopting a regional approach is the second step in the framework. The report notes that the U.S. is regionally diverse in terms of geography and land use, electricity markets, economies and more. Energy policies also differ from state to state. It is important for policy makers at all levels to understand the differences in each region in order for them to enable a “responsible energy buildout”.
Further recommendations include ways of speeding up interconnection queues, community engagement, adopting incentives for land-saving approaches on croplands, and prioritizing transmission investments in inter-regional connections.
The report authors acknowledge that decarbonizing the economy is no small feat and will cost an estimated $1.87 trillion. They note that it is larger than the buildout of the interstate highway system that took place between 1950 and 1980. And it is because the clean energy transition is cost effective and beneficial to all, the researchers encourage “informed, equitable and early planning” that considers the use of land-saving technologies and investments.
