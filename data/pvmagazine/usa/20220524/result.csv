The loan platform features a streamlined online application process with real-time approvals. The company said eligible clients can be approved for 100% financing with no money down in 48 business hours or less.
The loan product comes with no dealer fees, meaning no there are no unexpected upfront costs. Climate First Bank said dealer fees are often imposed on solar loans as a way to advertise low or even 0% interest rates, but often these fees can be as high as 25% of the system costs.
Under the loan program, clients can prepay fully at any time without penalty. Any payments made in addition to the contractual monthly payment will be applied to a reduction in the principal balance of the loan. Customers are also able to directly access their 26% federal investment tax credit if they wish, or they can apply it to the loan.
“Now with a few clicks, clients can increase their property values, drastically reduce or even eliminate costs and save the planet all by investing in renewable solar energy,” said Ken LaRoe, founder and CEO of Climate First Bank. “I wish something this simple existed when I was putting solar on my house.”
The company said it is interested in partnering with top-tier residential and commercial PV installers. Those looking to become a preferred partner can apply by following this link. It said benefits for preferred partners include a dedicated personal banker, expedited approvals and processing, and 50% payment at project commencement, 50% at payment at project completion.
“Our robust tool is the next step forward for sustainable lending, making it easy for anyone who wants to stick a solar panel on top of their roof,” said Lex Ford, president of Climate First Bank. “Thanks to our transparent solar financing, consumers can purchase a solar energy system with no undisclosed surcharges or fees. Clients, installers and the planet alike all win with this new platform.”
A 2019 study by real estate web giant Zillow found that solar raises a home’s property value by 4.1% on average. On a $500,000 home, that is an increase of $21,500 in value.
Solar financing is a common path to owning a PV system. SolarReviews said secured loans such as HELOC run between 3 to 8.5% APR, depending on credit score. The rate of PACE loans tends to be higher, with APRs between 6.5 to 8.5%. Unsecured loans have higher APRs, and generally vary widely in their APRs. In general, they range 6 to 30%, and having a good credit score helps keep rates low.
Many solar loans are zero-down, but where down payments are required, they typically range between $0 to $3000. You can find a solar loan as short as three years or as long as 30, but typically they range from 10 to 20 years, said SolarReviews.
Climate First Bank is currently offering the first 100 loans generated via the new platform a special promotion of 3.99% APR for 25 years with zero dealer fee.
With currently less than 1% of all roofs topped with PV in Florida, the Sunshine State, Climate First Bank and its competitors have a lot work ahead in providing financing for the energy transition.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/24/incentives-drive-solar-adoption-among-low-to-middle-income-residents/,"FINANCE,MARKETING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,CONNECTICUT,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 24, 2022",Incentives drive solar adoption among low- to middle-income residents,"Many US states offer incentives to promote residential rooftop solar adoption; however, as prices of solar have declined, the incentives have phased down or out. The truth remains, though, that for low- to moderate-income (LMI) households, the relatively high up-front costs of going solar are often a deterrent.
Eric O’Shaughnessy, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, studied the importance of subsidies in driving solar adoption among LMI households. His report, “Rooftop Solar Incentives Remain Effective for Low- and Moderate Income Adoption,” indicates that incentives drove adoption for about 80% of LMI households that otherwise would not have gone solar – implying that ongoing incentive support will be rewarded by strong solar policies.
Definitions vary, though a common definition for low- to moderate-income in the United States is earning less than 80% of the area median income. In California’s San Francisco County, for example, the household would have to make less than around $95,310 to qualify. In Connecticut’s Fairfield County, the cutoffwould be around $78,031.20.
According to another recent LBL report, “Residential Solar-Adopter Income and Demographic Trends: 2022 Update” a large number of solar adopters in 2020 could be considered “middle income” – 32% have household incomes in the $50,000 to $100,000 range. Solar adopter incomes skew high relative to the population at large: Median income of all US households was $63,000 in 2020, compared to $115,000 for 2020 solar adopters.
LBNL
According to O’Shaughnessy, it was important to study LMI solar incentives to understand whether these incentives are still driving adoption. Broader incentives have phased out because incentives become less influential in adoption decisions as prices decline. It is generally inefficient to continue offering incentives to households who would have adopted otherwise. However, even if incentives no longer drive adoptions among high-income households, incentives could still play a role in supporting LMI solar markets.
Two programs
Many states offer some form of incentives to help LMI households go solar including rebates, production-based (such as a renewable energy certificates), or tax credits. “A real disadvantage for LMI households is that many lack the tax appetite to directly benefit from tax credits,” said O’Shaughnessy. His Berkeley Lab study focuses on the California Single-Family Affordable Solar Homes program and the Connecticut Solar for All program, examining the impacts these programs have had on LMI solar adoption. He chose these programs because they’re relatively large and have many years of data.
California has by far the largest subsidy program, putting aside 10% of its California Solar Initiative funds to support LMI. “The maximum deployment could be 10% of the program’s total, but in reality, it is far less,” O’Shaughnessy said. He explained that to subsidize a typical relatively highincome adopter, “they were motivated by partial subsidies that reflected relatively small portions of the system cost.” But with the LMI programs, which are trying to promote equity, the subsidies are more generous per customer. “When a state has a 10% carve-out for LMI program funding but LMI incentives are higher per customer than other incentives, you’ll have proportionally fewer installations,” said O’Shaughnessy.

The study found that in the cases of California and Connecticut, LMI solar subsidies increased solar adoption. Through econometric analysis, the Berkeley researchers estimate that roughly four of five LMI subsidy recipients in California and Connecticut would not have adopted solar without some kind of subsidy. In addition, the research shows that the programs had sustained impact over several years, showing spikes that occur at the time the subsidies are offered, and then adoption spikes back up.
Eventually you
are giving incentives
to households who
would have adopted
anyway and at that
point the incentives
aren’t effective
anymore. Eric O’Shaughnessy
The reason for the spike could be that the programs continue to reach new people, that installers continue to market in specific LMI areas, and that some wait until others have successfully navigated the process before jumping in themselves. Another effect of LMI incentive  programs is that some LMI households chose to adopt solar even without receiving subsidies, and this is called “spillover.”

Spillover theory
In his report, O’Shaughnessy directly tests the spillover hypothesis by looking at areas where LMI incentives are offered and then exploring changes in adoption patterns among households that did not receive incentives. Previous research shows that when a neighbor sees that a neighbor has installed solar, they become interested and are “primed” for adopting solar themselves. It appears that is still true for LMI households, O’Shaughnessy said. Some of the spillover customers will qualify for incentives, and others may even install it themselves without incentives, according to O’Shaughnessy.
Targeted incentives
While the overall conclusion of the report is that targeted incentives are a key component of nascent LMI rooftop markets, the question remains as to how long these markets will be nascent. O’Shaughnessy said that they still are, but that may be changing. The study found that eight out of 10 recipients would not have installed solar without some form of incentive, but that will decline over time.
O’Shaughnessy explained that, for example, the number of households that would not install solar without the incentive would soon be seven out of 10, then six out of 10, and so forth. “Eventually you are giving incentives to households who would have adopted anyway and at that point the incentives aren’t effective anymore,” said O’Shaughnessy. “It’s not effective because those customers don’t need the incentive, prices have come down and the market has taken over.”
The issue of rooftop solar equity is an emerging trend that has somewhat tarnished the image of solar and undermined public support because people see solar customers as those with high incomes. Utilities and regulators are obligated to deliver energy that is just and reasonable to everyone, regardless of income.
The Rooftop Solar Incentive report notes that fewer than a quarter of PV adopters are LMI households. “If solar were perfectly equitably adopted then 50% of adopters would earn less than the national median, but instead about a quarter earn less than the median – so there is the equity gap,” O’Shaughnessy said. The good news, though, is that it is changing. Just like any technology, O’Shaughnessy said, “it expands and diffuses.” As you get more LMI households adopting solar, the average income of adopters goes downyear over year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/24/bank-of-america-banks-on-electrify-america-ev-charging/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 24, 2022",Bank of America banks on Electrify America EV charging,"Bank of America and Electrify America announced the two have reached an agreement in which the financial institution will double the number of its financial centers that will be equipped with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.
Beginning this year, Bank of America had 172 Electrify America chargers across 46 financial centers, and it now plans to increase that investment to 350 chargers across 90 locations by the end of 2023.
Bank of America is an EV100 member and has additional EV charging stations at its employee offices at more than 100 locations. It launched a workplace EV charging initiative in 2017. EV100 is a global initiative of corporations committed to switching their owned and contracted fleets to electric vehicles by 2030. Other EV100 members include ABB, AstraZeneca, Goldman Sachs, GlaxoSmithKline, Lyft, National Grid, PG&E, and many others. The full list of corporations and their stated commitments can be found here.
Electrify America is among the largest installers of DC fast charging networks in the US and is investing $2 billion over ten years in EV infrastructure, education, and access. The company expects to have more than 1,800 charging stations with over 10,000 chargers in the US and Canada by 2026.
“Electrify America is expediting the electric future by providing ultra-fast charging to customers in convenient locations,” said Anthony Lambkin, senior director of operations at Electrify America. “Collaborating with companies such as Bank of America – who share our goals for a more sustainable future – helps to accelerate the transition to electric transportation and meet customers’ needs.”
Earlier this month, Electrify America announced its chargers are now 100% backed by renewable energy. It signed on for a 75 MW solar project in San Bernardino County, Calif., which is expected to reach operations in mid-2023. In the meantime, the company has purchased renewable energy credits to support its charging operations with clean power.
The 75 MW solar project will significantly expand the company’s exposure to PV, which it currently owns in a distributed fashion in solar canopies installed at many of its charging sites. It has invested $2 million in 30 Level 2 charging stations in rural California that are fully off-grid. Each station includes a sun-tracking solar array that can charge two vehicles at a time, with a maximum rate of 3.5 kW. It can charge during any weather condition or time of day thanks to the attached energy storage on the off-grid system.
Electrify America also installs on-grid solar on canopies at many of its EV charging stations. Its Baker, California station has DC fast chargers on-site. The company said a Level 2, 7.2kW AC charger can take one hour to deliver about 27 miles of EV range. A 50 kW DC fast charger can deliver the same 27 miles of range in about ten minutes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/24/anheuser-busch-adds-2-4-mw-of-solar-at-eight-craft-breweries-throughout-the-us/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 24, 2022",Anheuser-Busch adds 2.4 MW of solar at eight craft breweries throughout the US,"ForeFront Power, a solar and energy storage solutions developer based in San Francisco, is partnering with Anheuser-Busch to develop solar energy systems at eight breweries in its craft business unit, Brewers Collective. ForeFront Power has completed solar energy installations at Goose Island Beer Co. in Chicago, Blue Point Brewing Co. in Patchogue, N.Y., Virtue Cider in Fennville, Mich., Breckenridge Brewery in Littleton, Colo., Devils Backbone Brewing Co. in Lexington, Va., Four Peaks Brewing Co., in Tempe, Ariz., Karbach Brewing Co. in Houston, and 10 Barrel Brewing Co. in Bend, Ore. Combined, these solar energy systems total 2.4 MWdc and will help Anheuser-Busch avoid over 2 million pounds of carbon dioxide per year.
“Many craft breweries are more than production facilities; they are now major tourist destinations and community hubs,” said Michael Smith, CEO of ForeFront Power. “On-site solar generation can not only substantially reduce utility costs, but also serve as a tangible demonstration of a brewery’s environmental stewardship and commitment to taking climate action. We applaud Anheuser-Busch for its clean energy leadership in the beverage sector, and it has been so rewarding for our team to help breweries across the US achieve their sustainability goals.”
Anheuser-Busch launched its RE100 campaign in 2017, committing to purchase electricity only from renewable sources by 2025. The move made it the world’s largest brewer with the commitment to 100% renewable energy. Two years later, the company signed the 7th-largest corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) to date, a 15-year contract for the entirety of the electricity generated by Recurrent’s 222 MWac Maplewood 1 solar project, located in Pecos County, Texas. When the plant came online in 2021, the entirety of Anheuser Busch’s portfolio of beers were brewed with 100% renewable electricity.
While Anheuser-Busch achieved its goal four years early, it continues on its path to sustainability with installations at its craft breweries. The Goose Island 377 kW-DC rooftop solar array sits atop Goose Island’s Barrel House, a 139,000 square foot brewing facility and event space that is home to over 15,000 barrels, all within a historic Art Deco brick warehouse. The electricity generated annually will help Goose Island avoid 750,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year, or approximately the amount of carbon sequestered by 420 acres of forest in one year.
“The ForeFront Power team helped make going solar a turnkey process, and we are pleased with our system’s performance, the utility savings it provides, and its positive contribution to our region’s climate goals. Goose Island is proof that if solar can work in the Windy City, it can work anywhere,” said Todd Ahsmann, president of Goose Island Beer Co.
At Long Island’s Blue Point Brewing Co., the 217 kW-DC rooftop solar array marks an important milestone in Blue Point Brewing’s decades-long sustainability program. The solar project will generate over 285,000 kWh of electricity annually, the equivalent of 247 acres of US forestry conserved.
“Blue Point is surrounded by water and has always focused our sustainability efforts on protecting our waterways,” said Nick Rosenberg, Blue Point’s environmental safety manager. “Becoming a solar brewery was the logical next step to fight climate change and lower our utility bills at the same time. We are thankful for ForeFront Power’s expert guidance through every phase of the project, from permitting, to installation, to construction and energization.”

Interestingly, the terms of the deal also includes a shared commitment by both companies to increase domestic supply and promote lower-carbon production processes. The emphasis on securing American-made products enables Silicon Ranch to support US manufacturing and job creation, improve the carbon footprint of its supply chain, and reduce volatility and logistics risks, and Nextracker has already taken steps to make its supply chain more U.S.-focused.
In April, Nextracker and JM Steel, a division of JENNMAR USA, announced a partnership under which a dedicated solar tracker production line was built on the campus of a new Steel Dynamics manufacturing facility near Corpus Christi, Texas. The new Nextracker production line will support about 50 new local direct jobs and provide multi-GW of solar tracker capacity annually. Earlier in May, Nextracker announced a second new manufacturing line dedicated to producing steel tracker components for use in utility-scale solar power plants, with this one located at Atkore’s Phoenix, Arizona facility, which has been expanded and reconfigured with new capacity dedicated to Nextracker products.
As for the carbon footprint aspect of the agreement, the Steel Dynamics facility utilizes electric arc furnaces in its manufacturing, which have been described as a “next-generation” process for steel fabrication, one which can lead to electric arc furnace facilities being up to 75% less carbon-intensive than traditional blast furnaces. As for the new Atkore manufacturing line, it has not yet been shared whether or not the company will look to institute low-carbon fabrication practices.
Today’s deal also marks the second such large component supply agreement that Silicon Ranch has closed this spring. In April, First Solar announced had come to terms on a multi-year master supply agreement with Silicon Ranch to supply 4 GW of advanced thin film photovoltaic modules to Silicon Ranch’s projects in the United States from 2023 to 2025.
While this is not the first supply partnership to be reached between the two companies, the level of commitment dramatically expanded on their prior partnership, under which First Solar supplied modules to over 30 projects totaling more than 1 GW since 2015. The deal uses First Solar’s agile contracting approach, which means that Silicon Ranch will benefit from any advances in technology First Solar achieves prior to the first delivery of modules. The contract also includes a recycling clause, under which end-of-life CadTel modules from Silicon Ranch projects can be processed by First Solar’s recycling program, which recovers approximately 90% of CadTel material, allowing those materials to be used to manufacture new modules.

For the purposes of this project, a NWA is any sort of generation/storage system that removes or defers the need to construct or upgrade components of a distribution and/or transmission system. This 10 MW/40 MWh of energy storage paired with 15 MW of solar will be constructed nearby Cicero’s Pine Grove substation, and is intended to provide seamless reliability to customers served by the substation by charging the batteries when electricity demand is low and discharging when demand outstrips supply. During off-peak days, Convergent will participate in the market to provide clean energy for National Grid customers.
Utilities across the country are increasingly looking to storage as a way to meet afternoon demand spikes in lieu of traditional gas-fired peaker plants, which provide reliability at the cost of high emissions, dure to the fast-start/fast-stop nature of demand spikes.
“National Grid is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the amount of renewable energy on the grid while improving reliability and affordability for customers,” said Brian Gemmell, National Grid’s chief clean energy development officer. “Our recently released Clean Energy Vision plan outlines a pathway to achieve a fossil-free future to our energy systems that incorporates renewable sources of energy and storage solutions such as this NWA Pine Grove. Convergent Energy + Power’s expertise in developing and operating energy storage solutions that benefit utilities and communities made them a natural fit for this project.”
National Grid’s Clean Energy Vision plan is a comprehensive plan that the company released, outlining the pathways it will take to ensure net-zero emissions in operations. The plan also includes a goal to fully eliminate fossil fuels from both the company’s gas and electric systems by 2050.
The 10 MW/40 MWh of energy storage and 15 MW solar project is part of Convergent’s portfolio of eight solar-plus-storage systems in Central and Upstate New York. The solar-plus-storage system was constructed by CS Energy. GE provided the DC-Coupled energy storage package. $2.3 million of the project’s development and construction costs were provided by the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) through its NY-Sun Program, the state’s $1.8 billion initiative to advance the scale-up of solar while driving costs down and making solar energy more accessible to homes, businesses, and communities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/24/have-your-say-on-the-future-of-automation-in-solar-om/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"MAY 24, 2022",Have your say on the future of automation in solar O&M,"A series of PV market, technological, macroeconomic, and even geopolitical developments have coalesced to make the automation of solar O&M provision a compelling proposition in 2022. In a recent pv magazine webinar, Wood Mackenzie Principle Analyst Daniel Liu described O&M automation as, “one of the last few place to unlock additional cost efficiencies on a project.”
The webinar was delivered in partnership with robotic cleaning provider Ecoppia, and the company’s CTO Ziv Ramati Miller noted that with two years of Covid-19 lockdowns making site visits at time impossible, automated O&M became the only way production, and profitability, could be maintained.
“It was only on sites that were fully automated that production was allowed to continue almost the same,” said Ramati Miller. “You needed to implement automation just to stay where you are.”
Given the imperative to adopt automation in O&M, pv magazine has partnered with Ecoppia to conduct a first-of-its kind survey into the subject. The short survey has been designed to take less than five minutes to complete and has been constructed to reveal insights into the opportunities for automation in O&M, and potential impediments to its more widespread adoption.
Complete the survey to influence how automation will be employed in O&M provision today and into the future.
While O&M may not be the first item on a project developer’s agenda, the webinar presenters agreed that how plants are to be maintained should be considered in the early development stages.
“It is true that solar is a very simple and robust technology, but we must keep in mind that your project starts with the early development phase and sometimes we tend to overlook some key considerations,” said Nicolas Chouluer, a partner at Europe-based independent engineers Everoze. “Good maintenance will help keep your asset viable.”
Inside automation
In terms of good maintenance, Ecoppia CTO Ramati Miller argued that technological development has delivered a host of opportunities for O&M automation. And in the current solar market, it is “not only a possibility but a necessity.
“You really have to combine the data from all sources, and it is not just about solar panel cleaning, but infrastructure, and corrective maintenance. If you can tell in advance which panels need to be switched, then you don’t need to have people on site constantly monitoring the situation. But you need to combine all of these [data] sources.”
Ramati Miller outlined how it is possible today to equip robotic cleaners with a host of sensors that can collect detailed information on module health – and importantly how things develop over time. With robots passing over modules on a regular basis, their ability to collect data in an ongoing fashion is unparalleled, he said.
“There are a lot of options for what can be fitted to a robot,” said Ramati Miller. As an example, he explained how simple sensors can monitor a tracking system’s health.
“One of the most basic situations we offer is just [to monitor] the angle of the panels. When we measure that we can see if angle keeps changing on trackers. Usually, you have a sensor in the middle of a row, at the motor, which might cover two tables. But the angle at the corners might change, and just by monitoring the angles in the corners it lets you know about material fatigue.”
In terms of the size of the opportunity, Wood Mackenzie’s Daniel Liu explains that given the current size of the installed PV fleet, “as a rule the industry needs to be much more proactive about all O&M and in this module washing.” He said that WoodMac anticipates annual non-residential solar O&M spend to reach $15 billion by 2030.
“Automation should ultimately help asset owner identify the true site conditions and give people a better handle on what is needed,” said Liu. “Predominately we have seen is that degradation is much higher and one of the main reasons why is that the soiling losses are higher than expected – even in place where you would expect rain to be quite frequent.”
The survey results will be presented and analyzed in the pv magazine Global magazine.
