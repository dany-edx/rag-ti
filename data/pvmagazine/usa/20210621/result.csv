Halide perovskites are organic materials made from abundant and inexpensive ingredients. Rice’s new seeded growth method addresses some performance- and production-related challenges faced by perovskite photovoltaic technologies, said the researchers.  
The process has allowed the engineers to make homogenous thin films comprised of uniformly thick layers. The engineers said that in laboratory testing, photovoltaic devices made from the films proved both efficient and reliable, two metrics that previously came as a challenge for both 2D and 3D perovskite applications. 
Study authors have claimed state-of-the-art efficiency of 17%, before optimization. The engineers at Rice said they are confident that efficiency can be improved. Their work was published online in Advanced Materials.
The seed-grown photovoltaic films were reported to have preserved more than 97% of their peak efficiency after 800 hours under illumination with no thermal management. Historically, 3D halide perovskite PV devices have been efficient but prone to rapid degradation, and 2D devices have been inefficient but long-lasting. 
In the seeded-growth method, seeds are made by slow-growing a uniform 2D crystal and grinding it into a powder, which was then dissolved into a solvent. The seeds retained the same ratio of ingredients as the traditional recipe, and the solvent is then spin-coated onto discs, identical to the original pervoskite-yielding method. The evaporation and crystallization steps mimic the original process. The seeded solution yields films with a homogeneous, uniform surface, similar to the material from which the seeds are ground. 
Seeded growth has often been demonstrated for inorganic crystals, but the researchers said this is the first time it’s been shown in organic 2D perovskites. The process is an often-attempted but rarely realized goal in nanomaterials: a self-assembly method to make macroscopic materials that live up to the promise of the individual nanoparticles of which they are composed. 
The researchers said they are hopeful this process can be replicated for other applications in nanomaterials.

According to the senator’s office, the act would boost the U.S. solar supply chain to create American clean energy jobs, compete with offshore manufacturers, and support energy independence. The incentive would be available through 2028 with a phase-down taking place the two years following.
Modules would receive a credit of 11 cents, multiplied by the capacity of the module; cells would receive 4 cents, multiplied by the capacity of the cell; wafers would be credited at $12 per square meter; and solar-grade polysilicon would receive a credit of $3 per kilogram.

Ossoff is working with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) to include the proposal into a broader clean energy plan that may be attached to an infrastructure bill later this year. The legislation is co-sponsored by senators Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia), Michael Bennet (D-Colorado), and Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan).
The bill is supported by Q-CELLS America, Hemlock Semiconductors, LG Electronics USA, REC Silicon ASA, Wacker Polysilicon North America, Sunnova Energy International Inc., First Solar, Mission Solar, Leading Edge Equipment Technologies, Auxin Solar, Swift Solar, 1366 Technologies, Silfab Solar, Heliene, and the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance.
If passed, the bill would be a boost to President Biden’s American Jobs Plan, which already has significant renewable energy provisions, including a 10-year extension of tax credits for solar and wind, and the establishment of other clean energy tax credits and includes direct pay of said credits.
The legislation has been met with open arms by the solar industry, with Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) releasing a statement of support. “While the broader U.S. solar industry continues to flourish, America’s solar manufacturing sector has languished,” she said. Now is the time to “seize the promise” of American solar manufacturing.
The statement also included a call to increase the country’s annual domestic production capacity tenfold by 2030. SEIA set a solar-specific target of 50 GW of annual domestic production capacity by 2030. This goal would create American solar manufacturing capacity equal to over 150% of the 19.2 GW of solar deployed in 2020 and would covers “all key elements of a solar energy system,” SEIA said, including polysilicon, ingots and wafers, cells and modules, racking and trackers and inverters.

The project is set to be constructed on nearly 1,800 acres in Clinton County, about 50 miles northwest of Indianapolis. Work is expected to begin this fall, with the project reaching commercial operation in 2023.  Invenergy will develop and manage the project’s construction.
Hardy Hills represents the most recent entry in Indiana’s solar renaissance with new, massive, utility-scale solar projects popping up for development in the Hoosier State seemingly every week. The shift in generation philosophy has been notable, as Indiana has been a state historically committed to fossil fuels, with just under 1 GW of solar installed to date and much of that capacity coming on-line since the start of 2021.
The Solar Energy Industries Association projects the state to install nearly 4 GW over the next five years. That would be good enough for the 8th most expected capacity additions of any state in the country.
Earlier this month, Leeward Renewable Energy acquired the rights to the 150 MW Blackford Solar project from developer Tri Global Energy. That project, located in Blackford County, Indiana, northeast of Indianapolis, was originated in 2019. Tri Global is in the process of securing permits before construction starts. The project is expected to enter service in 2023.
In May, RES announced the company was working with local officials in St. Joseph County to bring a 150 MW solar installation to the area, dubbed Project Honeysuckle. According to RES, Honeysuckle has been in the works for more than a year and the company is looking to begin construction in 2022 and finish in 2023.
In March, Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO) signed a build-transfer agreement for the 200 MW Elliot Solar project, set to be built in the southwestern part of the state with Capital Dynamics.
Later, the utility company announced 900 MW of solar across three projects: the 200 MW Cavalry Solar project, paired with 60 MW of energy storage; the 265 MW Dunns Bridge Solar I project; and the 435 MW of solar and 75 MW of battery storage Dunns Bridge Solar II project.
NIPSCO also signed a long-term power purchase agreement for 280 MW of the power generated by Capital Dynamics’ upcoming Gibson Solar project and a build & transfer agreement for the 200 MW Indiana Crossroads Solar Park.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/21/watch-solar-project-feasibility-tool-from-sunfig-can-boost-bottom-line-results/,"FINANCE,PROCUREMENT,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 21, 2021",Watch: Solar project feasibility tool from Sunfig can boost bottom-line results,"Sunfig, a solar software company recently acquired by Gibraltar Industries, said it delivers a 5% to 15% increase in project returns for utility solar developers and asset owners through its Sunfig Instant Feasibility Tool (SIFT).
A design, performance, and financial modeling solution used early in the project development cycle, the company said that SIFT streamlines complex projects, resulting in more profitable solar investments.
Since SIFT’s launch in 2017, the  company said it has seen customers achieve 5% to 15% gain on internal rates of return (IRR) when compared to traditional project definition strategies. This helps smaller developers secure more capital and win more projects, while larger developers and owners reap greater value across their portfolio.

SIFT also uses data from the U.S. Geological Survey and Google Earth for accurate early topography studies and automated slope analyses.
“SIFT has allowed us to efficiently develop preliminary layouts for our prospecting sites while analyzing the impact of DC/AC ratio and GCR on energy generation,” said Rich Clark, vice president of engineering at 7X Energy. “This has significantly improved our layout optimization process with respect to project NPV and IRR. The ability to download and share the project layout CAD file and kmz allows quick and easy collaboration within our company.”
With SIFT, users can pinpoint the best configuration, identify the most suitable technologies, and reflect the impact of updated tariffs or time-of-use data to maximize project value. SIFT is the first project modeling platform to offer a complete IRR financial model. The company said that as a cloud-based software, SIFT requires no additional tools or training to use and enables faster computing.
Sunfig joined Gibraltar’s Renewable Energy Group in December 2020. Combined with RBI Solar, TerraSmart, and SolarBOS, SIFT brings intelligent project optimization to the group’s mounting and balance of system portfolio.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/21/renewable-energy-group-challenges-mississippi-power-plan-that-sidelines-solar/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MISSISSIPPI",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 21, 2021",Renewable energy group challenges Mississippi Power plan that sidelines solar,"In Mississippi Power’s first integrated resource plan, solar was not selected in any scenario until 2027, and did not show up in most scenarios until 2032, according to the advocacy group Southern Renewable Energy Association (SREA).
No battery resources were added in any scenario through 2031, and wind power was excluded from the modeling, the group said.
“Looking across the scenarios, does the Mississippi Public Service Commission really believe that zero renewable energy sources will be developed in the state for the next decade?,” asked SREA Executive Director Simon Mahan in formal comments. He said that “any reasonable analysis” would find that outcome “highly improbable and undesirable for Mississippi ratepayers.”
Solar facilities are achieving 20-25% capacity factors, comparable to the fossil facility’s 21% capacity factor, SREA said.

SREA said that because Mississippi Power is in the Southern Company’s power pool, its avoided costs are summertime afternoon peaking costs “even though the utility claims to be a winter peaking utility.”
The omission of solar until 2031 showed that either the utility’s modeling did not allow solar to be selected in the near term, said SREA, or that the model did not find opportunities to reduce costs by lowering the dispatch of existing fossil units, or retiring them altogether.
“Either problem should cause major concern regarding validity of the resource plan results,” SREA said. The group called on Mississippi regulators to reject the utility’s plan.
Mississippi Power is a subsidiary of Southern Company and serves southeast Mississippi. SREA said that only one of the utility’s modeled scenarios, the “carbon intensity” scenario that would add 390 MW of solar in 2027, “would come close to achieving Southern Company’s net zero carbon commitment.” The group called for adding at least that much solar by 2027.
SREA also challenged Mississippi Power’s choice to assign a 0% capacity value  to solar. The group said that grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) assigns a capacity value of 50% to solar and 15% to wind power. Combining these resources and adding energy storage would increase overall capacity value across all seasons, SREA said, citing MISO research.
Overall, SREA listed 16 “significant deficiencies” in Mississippi Power’s IRP, including:
SREA also made 11 recommendations that it said would help regulators “protect ratepayers against poor resource planning in the future.”
SREA said Mississippi Power’s action plan only covers decisions already approved by state regulators or the company itself, concluding that the IRP process “appears to have had no effect” on the utility’s future plans.
The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy also filed comments on the resource plan, focused on demand side management issues. A filing from the Sierra Club focused on coal plant retirement and transparency in resource planning.

The platform aims to reduce 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions and to empower 1 billion people with distributed renewable energy.
In mid-June, the International Finance Corp., the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced a partnership to deploy $150 million of capital in blended finance to leverage up to $2 billion of private sector investment in distributed renewable energy. The two said they will prioritize countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions, where both organizations have identified immediate opportunities.
The new global platform aims to deliver power to the 800 million people worldwide who lack electricity.

The Rockefeller Foundation will incubate the platform in RF Catalytic Capital Inc., which the foundation launched in 2020. This offers a way for impact investors and governments to combine their resources and expand their global philanthropic reach.
Researchers from North Carolina State University and North Carolina Central University said in a new paper that when a power system combines energy storage and solar power generation, the end result is greater than the sum of its parts in terms of the system’s ability to handle peak energy demand.
“Our work suggests that solar power can offer greater benefits to reliability than sustainable energy skeptics suggest,” said Jeremiah Johnson, one of the researchers and an associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State.
For their work, the researchers looked at the power system in North and South Carolina. With data on power demand and the mix of power generation sources, they built computational models to assess how much power a system could expect from different sources during periods of peak energy demand.
The models allowed them to vary the size of solar farms in the system and the amount of energy storage in the system to determine how those changes might affect the overall reliability benefits during periods of peak demand.
A system that combines solar and energy storage can be relied on to provide up to 40% more power.

“We found that solar power generation reduces the peak load that would need to be met with stored energy, and reduces the duration of that peak demand,” Johnson said. He said that, in effect, a symbiotic relationship exists between the technologies.
The paper, “The Symbiotic Relationship of Solar Power and Energy Storage in Providing Capacity Value,” appears in the journal Renewable Energy.
Two astronauts completed the delayed deployment of a new ISS Roll-Out Solar Array (iROSA) at the International Space Station.
In a second effort at deployment in June 20, astronauts unfolded the solar array, bolted it into place, and connected cables to the station’s power supply to complete deployment. They also removed and stowed hardware in preparation for releasing a second iROSA from the flight support structure for installation. The pair will work toward the second solar array upgrade during another spacewalk, tentatively scheduled for June 25.
NASA is augmenting six of the eight existing power channels of the space station with new solar arrays to ensure a sufficient power supply is maintained for NASA’s exploration technology demonstrations for Artemis and beyond as well as utilization and commercialization.
Fully deployment of the array required two space walks after one of the astronauts experienced errors with his suit’s status display. After resetting the suit, the data stabilized, but the delay caused the two astronauts to return for the second spacewalk on June 20 to complete the deployment.
SOO Green HVDC Link selected Prysmian Group in a tenative $900 million contract to supply high-voltage direct current cable systems for a planned 2,100 MW transmission project to be installed underground along existing railroad rights of way.
The project would connect the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) serving the central U.S., to the eastern PJM Interconnection, and deliver renewable energy to loadcenters from Chicago to the mid-Atlantic region.
Prysmian Group would provide ±525 kV class HVDC cable. Award is subject to the finalization of contract. The construction part of the project, currently under finalization, would be performed by Jingoli Power and will be added to the overall contract value. Prysmian will be responsible for the full turnkey contact.
The 350-mile-long project will require 700 miles of paired ±525 kV cross-linked polyethylene class cables installed underground primarily along existing railroad rights-of-way. The line is planned to connect SOO Green’s converter station in northern Iowa to a converter station west of Chicago. Cable production is expected to start in 2023 at Prysmian’s South Carolina facility, which will be upgraded to supply the high-voltage cable.
SOO Green HVDC Link is owned by investment funds managed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Siemens Energy, and Jingoli Power, and is being developed by Minneapolis-based Direct Connect Development Co.
JinkoSolar Holding Co. said that its Shangrao JinkoSolar Industry Development Co. subsidiary plans to increase capital and shares in Inner Mongolia Xinte Silicon Materials Co. a unit of Xinte Energy Co. The investment will be used to construct a high-purity polysilicon production line with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons. After the capital increase is completed, JinkoSolar will hold a 9% stake in Inner Mongolia Xinte.
