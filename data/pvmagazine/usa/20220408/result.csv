The state has a particularly strong commercial solar presence, and residential solar can provide significant cost savings to homeowners, who pay nearly 50% more for electricity than the national average, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
In addition to the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which is 26% of system costs through 2022, residents of Connecticut have access to several incentives for solar PV. Residential solar increases home value, but it is exempt from property taxes and the state’s 6.35% sales tax.
Connecticut also administers zero emissions renewable energy credits (ZRECs). It is a capped block program and a lottery system that provides credits to systems across sectors. Details can be found here.
Perhaps the most successful program in the state has been the Connecticut Green Bank. The program provided significant upfront incentives, and it exceeded its expanded goal of 382MW deployed ahead of scheduled. Earlier this year, the program surpassed $2 billion in total investment.
New incentives in 2022
The Green Bank program was replaced at the beginning of 2022 by the Residential Renewable Energy Solutions program, which supports projects up to 25kW-AC, and will run for six years. 
The program will be administered by utilities Eversource and United Illuminating (UI). Customers have two options: a buy-all incentive or a netting incentive similar to traditional net metering.
The buy-all program is administered as follows: The utility will purchase power from homeowners at a rate approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). Customers will receive compensation as either an on-bill credit to offset monthly bills or a cash payment once per quarter. Customers may specify a percentage of the compensation to be split between the two options. Homeowners will purchase the electricity needed to power their homes directly from Eversource or United Illuminating. Any on-bill credits not used to offset the bill can be cashed out once annually, and any cash payments (quarterly or annually) must go to a third party that is not the account holder.
The rate for the buy-all program locks in for 20 years, and it includes that value of any ZRECs earned. The current buy-all rate for both Eversource and UI customers is $0.2943 per kWh. With the Buy-All Incentive, power generation and consumption are measured using separate meters installed at the home.
Under the netting option, power produced by the system, but not consumed within the month, is “netted” at the same rate paid to Eversource for electricity. Net credits are applied to the bill in dollars and will be used to offset future customer, supply and delivery charges. Any excess credits can be carried over each month and cashed out if electric service is stopped. Once enrolled, the compensation rate (in dollars per kilowatt hour) for net production will fluctuate with the prevailing retail rate over a 20-year term.
Currently, Eversource customers are offered $0.0318/kWh, and this extends for 20 years. UI customers do not receive an additional incentive beyond the benefit of retail priced net metering. Customers will also take in a quarterly ZREC payment.
Both options come with adders, including a $0.025/kWh value adder for low-income customers, and designated “distressed municipalities” will receive an additional $0.0125/kWh.
Connecticut has a multitude of state level incentives in pursuit of climate-related goals. The Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE) outlines them here.
Notable project
In North Stonington, Connecticut, a 6.1MW solar facility is expected to provide $9 million in savings for five Connecticut state colleges and universities in its first 20 years of operation. Developed by Greenskies Clean Focus, the project uses a virtual net metering mechanism to provide colleges with clean energy. The project will serve Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Manchester Community College in Manchester and Tunxis Community College in Farmington.
“In addition to the financial benefits, this project is expected to generate upwards of 8.8 million kWh of clean, renewable energy every year. Over the next 20 years, that’s enough clean, renewable energy to offset 125,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of taking more than 27,000 cars off the road or preserving over 153,000 acres of U.S. forests,” said Stanley Chin, CEO of Greenskies.
The project is comprised of 14,000 solar modules and occupies 27 acres of land, which was leased from a local meat and dairy farmer.
State statistics
SEIA ranks Connecticut 22nd in deployment nationally, not bad for a state 29th in population. It estimates 1097.4 MW have been installed through Q4 2021, and enough photovoltaic electricity is produced to power the equivalent of 174,333 homes.
In Connecticut, over 2,000 people are employed by the solar industry across 135 companies. The state holds 27 manufacturers and 54 Installers/Developers. SEIA estimates $2.7 billion in economic activity related to solar has occurred in the state.

The battery’s duration has not yet been made available, however project of this caliber tend to utilize 4-hour duration battery systems, which would equate to 660MWh. The project, which has been dubbed the Koshkonong Solar Energy Center is expected to inject $140 million into the local economy over the life of the plant and create 600 jobs during peak construction, according to Invenergy. Once complete, a number of utilities owned by WEC Energy Group and Madison Gas and Electric plan to spend $649 million to buy the plant from Invenergy.
We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service will 90% of the solar and battery storage project, assuming the deal goes through, while Madison Gas and Electric will own the remaining 10 percent. Construction is to start later this year with a target date of December 2024 for completion.
The Koshkonong Solar Energy Center is ties for largest project with Wisconsin is Madison Gas and Electric Badger Hollow Solar Farm, another 300MW installation that had its first phase completed in 2021. Located near Montfort and Cobb in Iowa County in Wisconsin, west of Madison, Madison Gas and Electric owns 50MW of the 150MW Phase I, while Wisconsin Public Service owns the remaining 100MW. Construction is underway on the 150MW second phase of the project, of which Madison Gas and Electric will own 50MW and Wisconsin Public Service will own 100MW.
While Wisconsin has historically been middle of the pack in terms of installed solar nationally and slightly ahead of the pack for the Midwest, with roughly 840MW installed to date, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the state has recently seen an uptick in large-scale development activity.
In March, WE Energies, Wisconsin Public Service, and Madison Gas and Electric signed on to purchase stake in the Paris Solar project, an Invenergy-developed solar PV and battery energy storage facility. Sized at 200MW of PV and 110MW of lithium-ion battery energy storage, which won regulatory approval in 2020.
In 2021, Wisconsin regulators voted to allow Alliant Energy’s subsidiary, Wisconsin Power and Light, to buy or build, own, and operate six solar electric facilities with a combined capacity of 675 MW. Prior to this decision, regulators also approved 1,078 MW of utility-scale solar generation in Wisconsin..

If violations are found, a 50-250% tariff can be placed on solar panels entering the US. Module prices can represent 50% or more of a project’s cost, so for a $300 million utility-scale project, that’s as much as $375 million in risk. What’s more, the fee is retroactive to the February 8th petition by Auxin Solar led DOC to launch the investigation.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that roughly 75% of companies report cancelled or delayed module supply, 50% said that 80% or more of their 2022 project pipelines are at risk, and that the investigation has a “devastating negative impact” on 60% of solar and 35% of storage businesses.
In his industry note, Philip Shen, managing director, ROTH Capital Partners, wrote, “the module procurement process has been turned upside down.” He continued to share that some solar developers may be willing to take on the risk and continue to procure and deploy, but that activity will mostly occur in the distributed generation space rather than the utility-scale. “Our AntiCirc checks this week suggest C-Si utility scale module volume for the rest of the year may largely shut off,” said the note.
Shen’s team believes the DOC will take the full 150 days it is allotted to make a determination on the case, which places the deadline on August 26th. He notes that the passing of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act may play a role in the determination.
The note added that mid-week, facilities in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia have started to reduce production.
Shen’s team has also noted an increase in power purchase agreement (PPA) prices and a trend of smaller developers reselling projects to larger developers.
Costs are particularly rising in the distributed generation space, with pricing skyrocketing to $0.60-$0.70/W, rising from last year’s $0.40-$0.50/W/ This translates to residential end-user costs rising from $4-4.50/W to nearly $6/W, said ROTH.
In reaction to the launched investigation, American Clean Power Association CEO Heather Zichal wrote, “American workers will bear the pain of the decision to allow one rogue antagonist (Auxin Solar) to abuse and manipulate trade laws for their own gain. The 230,000 proud Americans who work in the solar industry are calling on President Biden and Secretary Raimondo to reverse their decision and bring this matter to a speedy conclusion. Every day this investigation hangs over the solar community is a day of lost jobs and postponed solar projects critical to the Administration’s climate agenda.”

Trajectory Energy Partners will lead the development of the sites and Aspen will provide the financial support of approximately $96 million, as well as overseeing the design, subscriber management, and long-term ownership of the assets.
The portfolio consists of ten projects across the mid-Atlantic region. Four of the sites are in Maryland and will participate in the state’s pilot community solar program. The remaining six sites are in Pennsylvania and will be developed in advance of that state’s pending community solar legislation.
A few of the highlights of the portfolio include: a community solar project with a historic church in Prince George’s County, Maryland; another project with a non-profit foundation working to preserve a historic site in Prince George’s County, Maryland; and project on a reclaimed former coal mine in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania.
Through Aspen’s partnership with Trajectory, the company will expand access to clean distributed energy for consumers and businesses across all income levels. Trajectory Energy Partners, based in Illinois, focuses on Illinois, Maryland, and Pennsylvania markets. Along with the community solar projects in Maryland and Pennsylvania, Aspen is also developing community, multifamily, and commercial and industrial rooftop projects in California, Maine, and New York.
Aspen was incubated at Energy Impact Partners (EIP), a global investor in the transition to a sustainable future. EIP has made over 80 investments exceeding $2.5 billion in the energy decarbonization transition. Some of its investments include Form Energy; a battery manufacturer; Enchanted Rock, a microgrid deployer; Arcadia, a community solar platform; and the AI-backed energy management company, Urbint.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/08/6k-awarded-1-5-million-massachusetts-manufacturing-grant-to-fund-battery-recycling-equipment/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MASSACHUSETTS",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 8, 2022",6K awarded $1.5 million Massachusetts manufacturing grant to fund battery recycling equipment,"6K is a Massachusetts-based company that produces advanced materials used in additive manufacturing and in the production of batteries for electric vehicles, grid storage, and consumer electronics. The grant will fund advancement of the company’s UniMelt microwave technology, which recycles scrap materials or used metal powder and transforms it into premium metal powder used in 3D printing for the production parts used in aerospace, defense, medical, and automotive applications.
The $1.5 million grant from the Massachusetts Manufacturing Innovation Initiative (M2I2) was announced by Lt. Governor Karyn Polito and Housing and Economic Development Secretary Mike Kennealy during an event at 6K’s new battery material production facility, which was followed by a tour of 6K’s proprietary UniMelt advanced production plasma systems. The state grant will fund the purchase of one new UniMelt system, a technology that is designed by 6K and will be manufactured by Helfrich Brothers Boiler Works in Lawrence, Massachusets with components from AVS, Inc. in Ayer, Massachusetts.
“M2I2 allows us to target support toward companies that, like 6K, are committed to growing their operations here in Massachusetts,” said Governor Baker during his testimony to the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities & Energy in January 2022.  “Through this grant we are funding new infrastructure that will lead to job growth and production, but we’re also supporting a game changing, clean technology that promises to revolutionize the supply chain for batteries by keeping more of this production here in the Commonwealth.”
The new solution is cost-competitive with traditional material manufacturing methods, but it is cleaner and faster.  The UniMelt system produces material in two to three seconds with no hazardous waste, a 6X reduction in water usage, and a 3X reduction in both power use and CO2 emissions, the company reports.
“6K is honored to be the recipient of the M2I2 grant.  Our UniMelt production platform transforms the way performance materials are produced and we can use this system for training a local workforce for the future of manufacturing,” said 6K’s vice president of government affairs Mary Cronin.
The Baker-Polito Administration has committed more than $100 million in funding to the M2I2 effort, which allows the Commonwealth to co-invest in projects supported by the national Manufacturing USA initiative, helping promote innovation and job growth across the state. The 6K project is also receiving support from the national manufacturing institute America Makes, a public-private partnership focused on additive manufacturing technology and education.
