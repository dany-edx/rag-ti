The project is being developed by Harvey Solar Project, LLC, a subsidiary of Open Road Renewables. The company estimates that construction of the project will create between 300 and 400 jobs, with the hope being that these positions will be filled by local laborers. The project is also anticipated to generate $3.15 million in property tax revenue for the county.
Harvey Solar is the second largest project to be proposed during the development boom that has hit Ohio in the last two years.
The largest project proposed during the boom is the 577 MW Fox Squirrel Solar project, which will occupy approximately 3,444 acres within a 3,766-acre area located in Madison County, west of Columbus. Fox Squirrel Solar is being developed by EDF Renewables and its 577 MW of capacity ties it with OCI’s multisite Alamo project in San Antonio as the 5th-largest American solar project known to pv magazine.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/05/posigen-closes-100-million-preferred-equity-financing/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,CONNECTICUT,LOUISIANA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 5, 2022",PosiGen closes $100 million preferred equity financing,"PosiGen, a provider of solar PV and energy efficiency solutions to low-to-moderate income (LMI) households announced the close of a $100 million preferred equity financing, led by Magnetar Capital’s Energy & Infrastructure group. The Investment group will nominate two directors to join PosiGen’s board. PosiGen’s existing investors Emerson Collective, Irradiant Partners, Activate Capital, The Builders Fund, SJF Ventures, and the Kresge Foundation also participated in the financing.
PosiGen said the financing will aid business growth, and will help close the affordability gap of solar, storage, and energy efficiency upgrades for LMI customers. To date, PosiGen has served over 19,000 customers. About 50% of PosiGen’s customers are in communities of color, the company said.
Tom Neyhart, CEO of PosiGen said, “We believe that serving LMI customers who will benefit the most from our solar plus energy efficiency offerings creates a virtuous cycle of value – making a difference in the lives and communities of the families we serve, while at the same time driving customer engagement and portfolio performance.”
Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati served as legal advisor to PosiGen, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP advised Magnetar. The transaction was facilitated by Marathon Capital. PLEXUS Solutions provided diligence support to Magnetar and is planned to provide ongoing monitoring for PosiGen’s asset financing.
Headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, PosiGen sprung into action when Hurricane Ida ripped through the local community, downing old transmission wires and leaving thousands in the dark. The company deployed 12 solar power stations at disaster supply sites across the affected area.
The self-contained solar power stations included 30 solar panels providing 11,400 W, along with an inverter and battery capable of providing 27,000 watt-hours of electricity.
The company also has a history of working with the Connecticut Green Bank to provide no-upfront-cost solar leases with no credit requirements to LMI customers in the state. A case study on the 2015-established program was run this year, finding an increase in payment delinquencies compared to typical solar leases, but a reasonable return on investment resulted from the program.

The order makes a significant impact on the company’s commercial backlog of orders, bringing it from $9.6 to $38.9 million. iSun said it expects an initial delivery of 450 canopies in 2022. Shares were up 19% at opening upon the announcement. 
“iSun has built a platform capable of addressing the needs of each segment of the solar industry, which includes serving the EV infrastructure demands of our new and current customers,” said Jeffrey Peck, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of iSun. “This award validates not only iSun’s innovative solar canopy products, but also our strategy for addressing the Nation’s EV infrastructure needs.
In addition to experience with solar projects across all sectors, and off-grid solar canopies, the company offers what it calls a “mobility platform.” This is a product, software, and service, featuring an integrated solar canopy with connected EV charging, energy management systems, and support. It is supported by AmpUp, the company’s operating and monitoring software that provides real-time updates on production.
The company also contains a data contracting division, building the electrical components of data management systems for commercial and institutional customers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/05/appalachian-power-purchases-firefly-energy-solar-project-in-virginia/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TENNESSEE,VIRGINIA,WEST VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 5, 2022",Appalachian Power purchases Firefly Energy solar project in Virginia,"Canadian Solar Inc. announced its wholly owned subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, LLC  completed a purchase and sale agreement with Appalachian Power for Recurrent’s Firefly Energy solar project located in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Firefly Energy is expected to be operational in the 2nd quarter of 2024.
Firefly Energy has a capacity of 150 MWac, Appalachian Power’s largest solar energy acquisition to date. Once completed Firefly Energy will help the utility meet its clean energy requirements under the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).
Passed in 2020 by the Virginia General Assembly, the VCEA seeks to end carbon dioxide emissions from the utility industry in Virginia. The Act establishes renewable portfolio standards for Applachian Power calling for the utiity to be 100% carbon free by 2050.  SEIA estimates that in 2020 Virginians were receiving 3.25% of energy needs from solar and the state was ranked 9th in the nation for solar installations, with nearly 6000 MW forecast over the next five years. The Act establishes that 16,100 MW of solar and onshore wind is “in the public interest.” The law also expands net metering and requires Virginia’s largest energy companies to construce or acquire more than 3,100 Mw of energy storage capacity. Appalachian Power intends to meet its VCEA targets primarily through future investments in solar, wind, energy storage, and energy efficiency measures.
The Firefly Energy solar project will be developed and constructed by Recurrent under a Build Transfer Agreement (BTA). Once construction is completed, Appalachian Power, which has 1 million customers in Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee (as AEP Appalachian Power, will be the long-term owner of the project. Pending local and state permits and other regulatory approvals, construction of the project is expected to start in early 2023 and reach commercial operation in 2024.
“This will be our largest solar project yet in our journey to deliver clean, reliable power to our customers,” said Chris Beam, Appalachian Power president and chief operating officer.
Recurrent received approval on its Siting Agreement for the Firefly project last month from the Pittsylvania County Board of Supervisors. The agreement provides $2.25 million in upfront payments to Pittsylvania County in addition to long-term revenue for public services over the life of the project.
