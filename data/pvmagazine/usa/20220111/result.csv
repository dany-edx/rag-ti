Within the portfolio, three of the projects have already been completed and reached commercial operation: Robinson Road, a 7 MW installation in Orleans, NY, north of Syracuse on the New York-Canada border, the 7 MW Wayside solar project, located in Pamelia, NY, just south of the Robinson Road installation, and the 7 MW installation installed on State Route 122A.
All of these installations were placed in service at the end of 2021 and are fully contracted with a mix of residential, commercial, public sector and non-profit organizations, including low-income households.
The last project included in the portfolio, a 7 MW installation dubbed Pulaski Solar, in Oswego County, is expected to be connected to the National Grid network by the end of Q1 2022.
In addition to these four projects, OYA has started construction on two projects with a combined capacity of 13 MW that are expected to be operational by Q2 2022, as well as another portfolio of thirteen projects totaling roughly 85MW, which are anticipated to start construction in the spring. By the end of 2022, OYA expects to have approximately 125 MW in operation in New York.
The four projects financed by Greenprint Capital, as well as the two projects that are expected to be operational by Q2 2022, are additionally being financed by Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company and the NY Green Bank, a division of the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority.
OYA has been making a significant community solar development push in New York as of late, and, in June, the company closed on an exclusive co-development agreement with Omni Navitas to develop, construct, and own 600 MW of community solar projects across the Northeast U.S., at least 240 MW of which will be located in New York.
This builds on OYA’s already substantial North American development pipeline which, prior to the closing of this deal, sat at 3 GW of community and utility-scale solar.

EV managed charging coordinates charging based on people’s travel needs, electricity supply, and grid conditions. This flexibility could be especially valuable for the grid as it transitions to high shares of variable renewable (VRE) generation, like solar and wind.
An NREL team recently completed a literature review on the potential value of EV managed charging, the findings of which are published in an Energy & Environmental Science article.
Understanding that the large-scale adoption of EV charging can have large-scale consequences for energy and electricity systems, including great opportunities for significant load growth. NREL reports that it found that unmanaged EV charging can stress existing grid infrastructure, possibly leading to operational, reliability, and planning challenges.. A solution is effective charging management, which offers significant benefits including support for power system planning and operations during normal and extreme conditions.. The report acknowledges that the costs of enabling these services must be weighed against the benefits they provide.
The report discusses the value of demand-side flexibility in the evolving power system and it states that it’s often more efficient to have demand match supply than the more traditional approach of making supply match demand. Managed EV charging can provide the flexibility needed in a distributed response (DR) system.
Any form of EV managed charging requires communication between the utility and the vehicles. In some approaches, the communication is one-directional and less frequent. More complex implementations require two-way dynamic communication.
“Managed charging can be a tremendous resource for the grid but there are trade-offs to solutions at different levels of commercial readiness,” said Matteo Muratori, NREL analyst and principal investigator of the study. “Some solutions offer a wider range of grid services and value streams but require increasingly complex communication and control technology and demands on users, which come with a cost.”
Managed charging complements variable renewables
NREL researchers found significant benefits of EV managed charging, including decreased emissions, improved reliability, supporting large-scale deployment of variable generation (such as wind and solar), and lower power system costs. Managed charging is valuable in systems with high levels of variable renewables because it provides the flexibility to match supply and demand. Overall the report found that managed EV charging can support and complement the expected large-scale VRE deployment, with implications for long-term planning.
The value of managed charging will change over time and additional data are needed to estimate future needs and constraints.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/11/grid-expert-slams-nem-3-0-as-proposed-dystopia-offers-ten-reasons-why/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 11, 2022","Grid expert slams NEM 3.0 as “proposed dystopia” in ROTH Capital webinar, offers ten reasons why","The proposed Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 is set to be decided by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on January 27th. Many view the proposed decision as a catastrophic blow to the value of solar in California, lowering solar export payments by nearly 80% and adding steep fixed monthly charges of $8 per kW to solar customers.
For a customer with a moderate system size of 7 kW, that is an additional $56 per month for fixed charges alone.
Utility rate design and NEM expert Dr. Ahmad Faruqui, who acts as an independent agent and economist-at-large, said the plan in its current form is not a proposed decision, but a “proposed dystopia,” ballooning the solar payback period to 20 years, and setting up roadblocks for electrification and decarbonization.
His view was shared in a webinar held by Philip Shen, managing director at ROTH Capital Partners.
Before the webinar, in a series of Twitter posts, Dr. Faruqui offered ten reasons he believes the decision is damning to the California solar industry, its customers, and citizens at large: 
The nation’s largest solar market at stake
About half the nation’s solar customers are in California; 1.3 million have gone forward with a solar installation. It has been critical to driving the U.S. energy transition.
Dr. Faruqui is calling for a complete rebuild of the proposal. In a recent webinar held by Roth Capital Partners, he shared that there is little hope that the CPUC will overturn the decision and hear the petitions of Californians, and that intervention from a “higher power” (Governor Gavin Newsom) will be needed to shut it down.
One sticking point for Dr. Faruqui is the fixed charge of $8/kW for solar customers. Not only does he view it as making solar nearly cost-prohibitive, but it is also a nonsensical penalty to rooftop solar customers. He said, “Why should someone buying carrots at the grocery store have to pay more because they also grow carrots at home?”
Purchasing a solar system with a 20-year payback period offers a poor economic picture for hopeful solar customers in California. Given the expected 20–25-year life of a solar array, “Who in the right mind would buy solar?” said Dr. Faruqui. Plus, the rise in cost of electricity for homeowners will discourage electrification of heating systems and the use of electric vehicles.
Dr. Faruqui said a combination of a minimum bill amount, plus time-of-use charges, would be most beneficial to Californians at large. Rather than a solar-customer only fixed charge than can quickly be upwards of $75 a month, he advocated for a minimum bill for all customers, regardless of solar ownership, somewhere around $30 to $35 a month. He said this would provide more than enough revenue to solve the import issue utilities face as more solar is interconnected.
Dr. Faruqui said he remains convinced that the proposed NEM 3.0 will not pass in its current form. He said the rate design will be condemned by the industry, the public, and the international community, and that the reputation of the CPUC board members is at stake. Perhaps at stake, too, is the reputation of Gavin Newsom, who has the opportunity to step in and retain California’s status as the nation’s solar frontrunner, and the font of environmentalism and innovation in the United States.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/11/feds-to-rescind-review-of-48-chinese-crystalline-silicon-companies/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 11, 2022",Feds to rescind review of 48 Chinese crystalline silicon companies,"The Department of Commerce has made a preliminary determination to rescind its review of the countervailing duty order on solar cells from 48 companies Chinese companies, a review which has been ongoing since February 4, 2021.
Those 48 companies will now join the 11 that had their reviews rescinded on July 23, 2021. The 59 companies in total were determined by the Department of Commerce to not be manufacturing or exporting any subject merchandise.
In addition, a number of companies included in the review, including Trina Solar Energy Co. and its cross-owned companies were found to have made shipments during the period of review, so the Department of Commerce is requesting entry information on those shipments, before a determination is made to continue or rescind the review.
The Department of Commerce also determined that countervailable subsidies were provided to the companies under review during the period of the review, meaning that the products under review were subsidized by the Chinese government, in order to circumvent the negative impact of American tariffs on the products.
Included in the 48 companies to have their review rescinded are: Chint Solar (Hong Kong and Jiuquan), GCL System Integration Technology Co., Jinko Solar International Limited, JinkoSolar Technology, ReneSola, Talesun Energy, Talesun Solar, and Yingli Green Energy.
Outside of Trina Solar and its related companies, Canadian Solar, Jinko Solar Co., LONGi Solar Technology Co., and Suntech Power Co. all remain on the “Non-Selected Companies Under Review’ list.
It should be noted that reviews rescinded under this order are not related to the petitions filed by The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention, which looked to address alleged antidumping and countervailing duty orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/11/millions-saved-with-onsite-mulching-of-solar-trash/,"SUSTAINABILITY,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 11, 2022",Millions saved with onsite mulching of solar trash,"Florida Power & Light (FPL) – owned by the renewable energy power house NextEra – has spent the past two years mulching the cardboard boxes and wooden pallets used to ship solar panels.. The mulch is then applied onsite.
Images were released of the ongoing process at a McDavid, Florida facility. The Cotton Creek Solar Energy Center is the company’s standard 74.5 MWac facility, with an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 panels installed, translating to roughly 90 to 120 MWdc. The site manager estimated that 9,900 pallets and cardboard boxes were used to deliver the solar panels.
Generally, trash removal from a facility involves paying for rented construction dumpsters to collect the material, plus the disposal fees of the garbage that fills the dumpsters. FPL’s project manager suggested that this project offsets costs by $180,000 per site vs a standard trash management process.

The new process saves approximately $130,000 per site even after accounting for the $50,000 cost of renting the grinding machine. Apply that over the company’s goal of installing 30 million modules by 2030, and the company says they expect to save close to $10 million via this technique.
The utility’s environmental team researched the specific materials in the pallets and boxes, choosing products that would be in compliance with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program regulations on what can be mulched.
The company first tested the process at the Lakeside Solar Energy Center in 2019. Since then they’ve repeated that process on 16 more sites, saving over $2 million in 2020 and 2021. The technique has become FPL’s standard disposal process for packaging.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/11/standard-solar-acquires-28-5-mw-commercial-solar-project-in-idaho/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,IDAHO",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 11, 2022",Standard Solar acquires 28.5 MW commercial solar project in Idaho,"Standard Solar, a specialist in the ownership, operation, funding and development of commercial and community solar assets, today announced it acquired a fully operational 28.5 megawatt (MW) solar project from funds managed by True Green Capital Management. The acquisition is the company’s first in Idaho, one of Standard Solar’s largest to date. Idaho currently has 590 MW installed, according to SEIA, and ranks 27th for solar installations in the country.
“We are actively pursuing growth opportunities through acquisition of existing and operating solar projects and adding the Mountain Home project to our asset base  is a significant milestone for Standard Solar,” saidMike Streams, Standard Solar’s Chief Development Officer.
The system is located in Mountain Home, the largest city in Elmore County, and has been providing energy savings to area residents and businesses since 2017. Idaho Power purchases the power generated from the system to provide energy to its customers at a discounted price. The Mountain Home system produces 54,716 megawatt hours of clean energy annually, enough to offset over 4.3 million gallons of gasoline consumed and the charging of 4.7 million smartphones.
This announcement follows Standard Solar’s recent acquisitions of solar project portfolios in Maine and Oregon totaling more than 15 MW. With this project addition, the company’s ownership footprint now spans 21 states.
Standard Solar was recently listed as the fifth largest portfolio owner of commercial solar by Wood Mackenzie, a leading energy research and consultancy group. Standard Solar was founded in 2004 and began as a residential installer and regional EPC. The company’s first major commercial solar project was a 205kW roof-mounted system for the Department of Energy Headquarters in 2008. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, Standard was named to the Inc. 500 Fastest-Growing Private Companies in America. In 2017, Standard Solar was acquired by the international energy giant, Énergir. Now with $600 million of in-house development capital from the acquisition, Standard Solar invests in direct development, partnerships and expanding its portfolio of company-owned and managed assets such as the Mountain Home project.
