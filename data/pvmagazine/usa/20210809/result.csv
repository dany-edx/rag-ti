Those are some of the allegations included in a report released by Environment America, the Frontier Group, and the United States Public Interest Research Group Education Fund.
The first part of this series looked at the report’s investigation of national anti-solar players, including the organizations and front groups that use cash and influence to advance their anti-solar agenda.
While these groups may be national, their targeted campaigns almost always are focused at the state level. The report looked at a handful of such campaigns, starting on the East Coast.
Established in Massachusetts in 2013, NERA has a record of opposition to net metering policies in New Hampshire and Maine, according to the report. It gained national notoriety in 2020 for its efforts to substantially roll back net metering in Maine.
In April 2020, the group filed a petition asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to roll back net metering and replace it with gross metering. Under the proposal, utilities would pay solar users a low credit for supplying solar energy to the electric grid, and charge those users a higher electrical rate equivalent to what non-solar users paid for any energy they consume. The group argued that distributed solar energy sales should be regulated under the federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act. The petition also would have laid the groundwork to eliminate the state’s ability to promote renewable energy policies that incentivize solar.
The petition ultimately was unanimously dismissed by FERC, after a concerted effort across the renewable landscape to oppose the measure. FERC concluded that NERA failed to prove any harms or controversies that the commission specifically should address. It did not, however, explicitly rule out FERC jurisdiction over solar customer sales to the grid.
The report authors point to Ohio as a case study of how aggressive utility anti-solar campaigns have resulted in policy changes that undermine rooftop solar.
First, the authors outlined how utilities succeeded in convincing Ohio lawmakers to weaken the state’s renewable energy standard (RES). In 2014 the RES (which was designed to achieve a 12.5% renewable share by 2025) had its progress frozen for two years and the end date moved back a year.

This, however, pales in comparison to the saga of HB 6. Passed by the state legislature in July 2019, the legislation was referred to by clean energy expert David Roberts as “the worst piece of energy legislation in the 21st century” and “the most counterproductive and corrupt piece of state energy legislation” he had seen.
HB 6, which took effect in October 2019, cut the renewable energy standard target to 8.5% by 2026 and eliminated the standard altogether after 2026. The law also cut utilities’ required savings from energy efficiency from 22% below 2008 levels by 2027 to 17.5% – which most utilities had already achieved – and then allowed them to end their efficiency programs.
Additionally, HB 6 imposed surcharges on ratepayers to bail out two nuclear power plants, which First Energy, an Ohio utility, claimed were losing money; and two coal plants, one in Ohio and one in Indiana, owned by a utility-controlled collective. The effect of the new law was to remove incentives for further renewable energy development and energy efficiency increases in the state while providing over $1 billion to subsidize four uncompetitive power plants.
On March 31, 2021, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill passed unanimously by the state Senate which revoked HB 6’s nuclear subsidies, though it did include a provision keeping subsidies for the coal plants and maintaining the renewable energy and energy efficiency rollbacks.
Florida has no renewable portfolio standard, does not allow solar power purchase agreements (PPAs), and requires homeowners to carry general liability insurance for any residential solar power system over 10 kW in capacity. While the state offers net metering, property tax exemptions for renewable energy equipment, and special residential loans for renewable energy property upgrades, the reports authors argued that the state’s overall policy framework is not conducive to rooftop solar growth.

Historically, the authors said, the state’s three investor-owned utilities, Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy, and Tampa Electric Company, have backed campaigns and policy changes which have served as roadblocks to expanding the role distributed solar plays in the state.
The report cited a 2018 study by Integrity Florida, which claimed that the utilities directed more than $43 million to political parties, candidates and committees over the 2014 and 2016 election cycles. That was followed by another alleged $9.2 million doled out in 2020.
The authors argued that this spending is an attempt by the utilities to influence how they are regulated by contributing to  legislators who would, once in office, be in charge of nominating a list of potential regulators for consideration by the governor.
The report also alleges that the utilities purposely delayed connecting new systems to the grid for months, which would cost customers significant money, and that the state’s utilities have backed groups that point out the shortcomings of distributed solar.
The last East Coast state analyzed in the report is South Carolina. The report focused on Dominion Energy South Carolina’s 2020 proposal to state regulators, which would have more than doubled monthly ratepayer service charges, added a $5.40/kW solar subscription fee to solar customers’ monthly electric bills, and cut the net metering credit that customers receive.
Multiple advocacy groups claimed that Dominion’s proposal would have slowed the state’s rooftop solar market. Frank Knapp, president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce said that approval of the proposal would essentially say goodbye to all future residential solar development in the state.
South Carolina regulators unanimously approved an alternative, solar-friendlier bid to keep net metering in place while also gradually transitioning Dominion Energy’s net metering program to an existing time-of-use rate schedule for customers.
Attempts to discourage rooftop solar development aren’t limited to the East Coast. The report touched on action that has occurred west of the Mississippi, even in states where rooftop solar has long enjoyed success as a resource. More on that in the next entry in this series.

The project brings the company’s total community solar capacity to 54 MW in New York alone. The company has not yet shared the project’s specific location, what hardware will be used in the installation, nor any details on potential construction partners.
In the last two years, New York has made unprecedented community solar capacity additions. According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the state added 549 MW of community solar capacity in 2020, leading the nation. More than 90% of the state’s 2.7 GW pipeline of projects under development that have been awarded NY-Sun incentives, and are expected to come online in the next two years, are community solar, comprising more than 800 projects.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the next five years will see the U.S. community solar market add more than 4 GW of total capacity.
EDP Renewables NA Distributed Generation currently owns 72 MW of community solar assets either operating, under construction, or in the development phase across the Northeast and Midwest. There is an additional near-term pipeline of 42 MW expected to be operational within the next 12 months.

The agency said that warmer weather in 2020, especially a particularly mild winter, increased electricity usage from air conditioning, but cut U.S. electricity usage for space heating during colder months.
EIA reported that from 1960 to 2010, per capita U.S. electricity use posted a 3% average annual increase. That trend slowed over the past decade due to warmer weather and energy efficiency upgrades. Since 2010, per capita residential electricity use has fallen 5% in the U.S.. That means 2020 represented an uptick in demand relative to the broader trend.
Use varied widely from state to state, with people in Hawaii using the least power at 2,018 kWh per capita. People in Louisiana used about 6,663 kWh per capita in 2020, said EIA.
Weather is often the biggest indicator of home electricity use. During the summer, air conditioning use, fans, dehumidifiers, and pool pumps, among other devices draw a significant amount of power. Rising temperatures due to climate change also are boosting the amount of power Americans are using to keep their homes cool.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, roughly 39% of homes use electricity as their primary heating fuel. That percentage grows as homeowners look to electrify their homes and add ductless mini splits (heat pumps) to their homes.
In 2020, per capita energy needs decreased the most in southern states where consumers use electricity as their main heat source. Milder winters required less electricity, EIA said. Arkansas ranked at the top of the list in demand reduction, using 4% less energy in 2020 than 2019, per EIA.
It was a different story in the West. States experienced their warmest summer on record in 2020, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Arizona’s per capita residential energy use increased by 10% in 2020, followed by California, Nevada, and Alaska at 9% each.
Climate change has made it clear that residential energy needs are going to change, and often unpredictably. This presents challenges for both homeowners looking to pay their bills, and grid operators planning for a reliable energy mix in the future.
A solution that addresses the problem from multiple angles is residential solar, especially when paired with energy storage. Residential solar contracts allow homeowners to secure a long-term energy rate, providing clarity in an uncertain future.
When energy storage is paired with home solar, stability can increase. Batteries often come coupled with smart technologies that allow homeowners to use their solar generation more intelligently, storing energy for use on peak demand hours and reducing strain on the grid. These batteries can often be reprogrammed to charge and discharge based on the current utility rate structure, giving homeowners greater flexibility and control over their rates.
The changing climate is producing powerful storms, wildfires, and unpredictable events that can increase power outages and leave homeowners in the dark. Energy storage can provide backup power at home in these critical events that are expected to become more frequent.
Plus, residential solar and storage help reduce energy-related CO2 emissions, which fuel climate change. The path to net zero emissions is going to be a global challenge that requires efforts on multiple fronts, said a report by Princeton, and home solar is one way U.S. residents can exercise choice and play a part in this effort.

The ordinance bans the development, construction, and official consideration of any solar energy system 15,000 square feet or larger. Officials have been steadfast in their stance that the moratorium is not the first step in a goal to ban solar projects, but rather an attempt regulate their appearance more strictly, though one councilor did share with local press that he doesn’t “want Augusta to be the solar power capital of Maine.”
Many of the cited community complaints have been in regards to the recently-completed project off Route 3, colloquially referred to as the Board of Trade project. Residents have allegedly taken issue with the 6.3 MW project’s high visibility and have inquired about camouflaging it or other projects.
Since the route 3 project has been completed and has achieved commercial operation, any new solar regulations or ordinances passed will have no effect on its appearance.
In the meantime, the moratorium puts significant stress on local developers working on or delivering projects in the near future, and any developer with a contracted delivery date by the end of the year will be hard-pressed to meet that deadline.
One local developer requested that city councilors cut the moratorium time in half, down to just 90 days, but officials declined to reduce the length of the moratorium to anything less than the proposed 180 days.
Historically, Maine has lagged from a national and regional perspective in its commitment to solar as a resource. That fact has changed recently, however, and the vast majority of the state’s nearly 250 MW of installed capacity has come active since the start of 2020, according to according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).  The majority of this capacity has come from utility-scale solar projects, whereas what little solar the state had prior to 2020 was a more distributed mix of project sizes, per SEIA.
While taking a pause to make sure the right regulations and measures are in place to best serve the community is understandable, a prolonged moratorium could do damage to an industry just now securing a foothold in the region.

Here are two new approaches to designing your solar project,"From pv magazine Global
The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has designed a new approach for building east-west-oriented solar parks which it claims can prevent soil deterioration and offer the same yield as south-oriented PV plants.
In a dedicated study, the Dutch scientists explained that, although east-west solar parks are becoming increasingly popular in the Netherlands where land constraints and high land costs are pushing developers to build solar plants with a highly packed panel density, these installations present a challenge for the soil, because they are placed so closely together and cover almost all the ground beneath, thus reducing the light reaching it over a 25-year period or more.
According to the researchers, industry-standard east-west solar parks built in the country have a ground coverage ratio of over 90%, which is highly detrimental for the soil beneath the panels.
“It will then take a great deal of time and effort to restore the soil quality that existed before the solar farm was constructed,” the TNO scientists said.
To combat this, the researchers have developed two variants of their novel design. The first sees module arrays built in portrait orientation that are eight meters long, feature a large gap between the arrays, and have a ground coverage ratio of around 77%.
“Clearly the irradiance below the bottom gap between an east– and a west–facing module is very high but it also allows more light in the immediate region below those modules,” the academics said. “Also the larger top gap allows more light and distributes that light over a fairly large region.”
In the second variant, which has the same ground coverage ratio as the first, the scientists halved the height of the module arrays and the size of the gaps and, at the same time, utilized semi-transparent bifacial modules. 
“A 77% coverage design with semi-transparent, bifacial panels scores better in terms of the effect on soil quality than south-facing standard panels with 53% coverage. As a result, almost 100% of the soil receives sufficient sunlight at a higher degree of coverage,” they further explained.
The TNO said this new research is in line with another study published earlier this year by the Netherlands’ Wageningen University & Research, on the effects of solar parks on biodiversity. “The “educated guess” of the project partners is that well-designed, operated, and maintained solar parks can have a positive impact compared to well-defined reference situations, and especially compared to intensive agricultural monoculture use,” Wim Sinke, principal scientist for solar energy at the energy transition unit of TNO, told pv magazine in May 2021.
