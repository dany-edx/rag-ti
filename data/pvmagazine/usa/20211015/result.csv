The portfolio includes six projects to be built in New York, which has become one the country’s hottest markets for community solar development. Three are set to be constructed in Maryland, which also features a strong community solar market.
For the New York portfolio, two projects will feature on-site energy storage, combining for more than 19 MWh of  storage. Sixty percent of the energy generated by all six of the projects will go to residents and small businesses, while the remainder will go to commercial and industrial (C&I) offtakers.
Under New York state law, any projects that seek NY-Sun incentives must have at least 35% of their nameplate capacity dedicated to low- and middle-income (LMI) customers. The projects are expected to begin construction in Q1 2022 and reach commercial operation by the end of 2022.
In Maryland, the three acquired projects total 9.5 MWs with all of the off take going to residents and small businesses. The projects are currently under construction and expected to reach commercial operation by Q1 2022.
DSD will manage C&I customer acquisition for the New York locations, and Arcadia will be contracted for community solar mass market customer acquisition across the entire portfolio.
This is DSD’s second project portfolio acquisition in October. Earlier in the month, DSD acquired a portfolio of four community solar projects in New York – totaling 22.3 MW in capacity – from Source Renewables.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/15/targeted-marketing-more-supportive-policies-could-boost-low-income-solar-adoption/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 15, 2021","Targeted marketing, more supportive policies could boost low-income solar adoption","Low- and moderate-income (LMI) households are less likely to install rooftop solar photovoltaics, and policymakers, stakeholders, and community leaders are calling for a more equitable adoption of these technologies.
Research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Clean Kilowatts suggest improved marketing strategies could help.
Researchers to date have focused on demand-side explanations for adoption inequity. Those factors include cash constraints, lower homeownership rates, building structural issues, and language barriers. Likewise, LMI policies largely have been designed to address demand-side barriers, such as adoption subsidies and carve-outs in community solar programs.
The report argued that supply-side factors may pose significant barriers, as well.
For one thing, the industry often selects to market to high-income customers. The report found a significantly lower number of project quotes are shown to LMI customers.  Fewer quotes mean those customers have fewer opportunities to gather information and make an informed buying decision. Higher price quotes also can occur as there may be less competition among installers in LMI markets.
The report noted one study of solar industry quotes and contracts that found that customers who received fewer than four quotes were about three times less likely to adopt solar than those who saw more.
The report suggested that the supply side issues in solar can be addressed in a way similar to inequity in food access. It said that large grocery stores stocked with healthy foods often are located in affluent areas, while LMI areas often host low-quality food stores. Through a series of state and local interventions, policymakers responded by providing supply side incentives to induce health-oriented grocers to open in LMI areas.
The researchers offered three policy solutions for improving LMI solar access:
1) Providing subsidies or non-financial incentives to solar installers who will site their headquarters in LMI communities.
2) Offering incentives for submitted quotes in LMI communities, rather than installed systems. The research found that increased numbers of quotes drive higher adoption, despite installers having a bias that LMI customers install solar less frequently.
3) Funding programs to train installers to understand the unique needs of LMI customers.

They said that lessons learned could lead to improvements in the way manufacturers strengthen their products against what is known as light-induced degradation.

NREL said that light-induced degradation, or LID, shaves the efficiency of silicon solar cells by about 2%, which adds up to a significant drop in power output over the 30- to 40-year lifespan of the technology deployed in the field. Solar cells made from silicon account for more than 96% of the global market, and the most commonly used semiconductor used in the manufacture of these cells is made from boron-doped silicon. But boron-doped silicon is susceptible to LID, NREL said, so manufacturers have developed methods to stabilize the solar modules.
Without an understanding of the defects at the atomic level, the researchers said it is impossible to predict the stability of those modules.
“Some of the modules are stabilized completely. Some of them are only half-stabilized,” said Abigail Meyer, a Ph.D. candidate at Mines and a researcher at NREL. She is the lead author of “Atomic Structure of Light-Induced Efficiency-Degrading Defect in Boron-Doped Czochralski Silicon Solar Cells,” which appears in the journal Energy & Environmental Science.
The collaboration between NREL and Mines researchers relied on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to identify defects responsible for the LID. The microscopic examination revealed a distinct defect signature as the sample solar cells became more degraded by light.
The defect signature disappeared when the scientists applied the empirical “regeneration” process to cure the LID that industry has adopted. To their surprise, the researchers said they also found a second, “broad” EPR signature affected by light exposure, involving many more dopant atoms than there are LID defects. They hypothesized that not all atomic changes induced by light lead to the LID.
The techniques developed to study LID can be extended to reveal other types of degrading defects in silicon solar cells and in other semiconductor materials used in photovoltaics including cadmium telluride and perovskites, the scientists noted.
The researchers said the problem of LID has been studied for decades but the exact microscopic nature of what causes the degradation has not been determined. Researchers have concluded, through indirect experimentation and theory, that the problem decreases when less boron is used or when less oxygen is present in the silicon.

BOSS is designed to enable the granular control of charge and discharge of individual battery racks through a process called galvanic isolation. Alencon described galvanic isolation as an effective method of breaking ground loops by preventing unwanted current from flowing between two units sharing a ground conductor. This feature is intended to improve battery energy storage system (BESS) safety by allowing batteries to float as intended by their manufacturer while being isolated from the rest of the system.
The company said the device has practical applications in solar projects where electric circuits must communicate, but where their grounds are at different potentials.
According to the company, a galvanically isolated DC-DC converter serves the dual purpose of mapping PV voltage to battery voltage while” isolating the differential grounding schemes that could be present.”
The patent Alencon was awarded (#11,146,079), addresses BOSS’s Silicon Carbide-based, galvanically isolated topology, as well as the differentiated benefits the BOSS brings to BESS, whether those systems are stand-alone or DC-coupled with solar.
Additionally, the patent covers the BOSS’s approach to rack-0level battery charging and how the device can help balance the state of charge of batteries with differing states of health. Such charge balancing is particularly critical as BESS age and their component cells degrade, said the company.
In another project with Duke Energy in North Carolina, researchers at Alencon Systems studied issues that can arise from retrofitting existing solar structures with battery storage systems. The study examined DC-coupled storage systems, which many proponents say offer compelling advantages over AC coupling.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/15/eia-global-forecast-sees-a-resurgence-of-coal-for-electric-power/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"OCTOBER 15, 2021",EIA global forecast sees a resurgence of coal for electric power,"The Energy Information Administration projected that renewable resources—particularly solar and wind—will be the largest contributor to the growth in global electricity generation through 2050. It cautioned, however, that certain regions will still mainly use coal resources for electricity generation.
The projection are part of EIA’s International Energy Outlook 2021.
It said the absence of regional carbon policies or regulations along with rising natural gas prices after 2030—particularly in Asia and in regions that rely on higher-cost liquefied natural gas (LNG)—are likely to make coal the most economical generation fuel to pair with increased generation from wind and solar.
“This shift reverses the trend observed over recent decades,” EIA said. Although the cost of mining coal will likely raise coal prices after 2030, “we project that coal prices will remain low relative to natural gas prices and provide a cost-competitive option to natural gas-fired generation.”
Increases in coal-fired generation in Other non-OECD Asia—which includes Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, among other countries—is forecast to account for over 75% of EIA’s projected increase in global coal-fired generation from 2030 to 2050. For other parts of non-OECD Asia, EIA projected that renewable energy sources would account for about 60% of the generation increase, primarily from wind and solar. Coal-fired generation will account for nearly all of the remaining growth, it said.

For Other non-OECD Asia, EIA projected that renewable energy sources will account for about 60% of the generation increase over the projection period, primarily from wind and solar. Coal-fired generation will account for nearly all of the remaining growth.

EIA said that Other non-OECD Asia is a geographically diverse region and that several countries in the region have limited domestic natural gas resources and have constrained access to natural gas pipelines and LNG regasification terminals.
EIA projected that in 2030, coal-fired generation will start displacing some natural gas-fired generation in Other non-OECD Asia because of abundant coal resources that can be competitively mined, natural gas prices that are projected to increase after 2030, and a lack of carbon policies or regulations in the region.
It said that coal-fired generation “will steadily increase” in Other non-OECD Asia through 2050; coal’s share of the region’s generation mix is projected to increase from 33% in 2020 to almost 50% in 2050.

To help meet its goals, the utility launched a request for proposals (RFP) public process and filed its first Distribution System Plan (DSP) at the Oregon Public Utilities Commission.
The utility said it will need around 1,500 – 2,000 MW of clean and renewable resources and approximately 800 MW of non-emitting dispatchable capacity resources. It also said it is working to speed up its exit from the coal-fired Colstrip plant by the end of 2025.
The utility’s RFP process aims to procure around 1,000 MW of resources and bring on roughly 375 – 500 MW of renewable resources. The utility said it also will seek around 375 MW of non-emitting dispatchable capacity.
It also estimated that as much as 25% of the power needed to meet peak demand could come from customers and distributed energy resources, such as solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles.
By 2030, PGE said it anticipates the potential for four times as much distributed solar and storage as today, bringing 500 MW of clean electricity to the grid. It said there are around 35,000 electric vehicles in Oregon today, and the state has goals to add 250,000 registered zero emissions vehicles statewide by 2025 and 1.1 million by 2030.
The company serves around 900,000 customers with a service area population of 2 million people in 51 Oregon cities. It owns 16 generation plants across Oregon and other Northwestern states.
