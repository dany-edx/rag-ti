The Excelsior project is the largest project approved for construction in New York, a state which is more known for its prowess in building out community solar projects than large-scale installations. Of the 3,443 reserved for the installation, the project’s footprint is expected to encompass 1,716 acres. The installation, which will also include a 20MW battery energy storage system of yet unshared duration (likely four hours, making it 80MWh), and is expected to create 290 construction jobs, three to four full-time positions and job opportunities for landscaping and snow plowing throughout the solar farm’s lifespan.
In addition, the Genesee County Economic Development Center estimated that the cost of the project will come out to $345 million and said it will provide a $117.5 million economic impact, including $37.4 million in revenue to the county, town and school district in tax benefits for public investment.
While it is the largest project to be approved in New York, the Excelsior Energy Center isn’t even the largest project to be proposed in Genesee County.
In June 2021, Hecate Energy submitted an application with the New York State Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES) to build a $500 million, 500MW solar farm in the towns of Elba and Oakfield, southwest of Rochester.
The project would be located on more than 65 parcels of land comprising 4,650 acres of leased private land owned by 31 landowners. The project’s total footprint would be a little more than half of that total. The proposed project would use ground-mounted, single-axis tracking.
New York State’s Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act created the new ORES and rules for the permitting of large-scale renewable energy projects. It is intended to enhance the siting and construction of projects with input from local communities. Hecate’s Cider Solar 94-c application is one of the first new applications submitted to ORES.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/07/eagleview-high-resolution-aircraft-imagery-enabled-platform-may-cut-solar-sales-to-install-by-two-weeks/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 7, 2022",EagleView high-resolution aircraft imagery-enabled platform may cut solar sales to install by two weeks,"For solar installers, a shortened project time can be the difference between a completed project and a cancellation. Delays can create a negative customer experience, and typically in the industry, a shorter project time equals a higher project pull-through rate. 
EagleView, an aerial imagery company with origins in governmental contracts and insurance, recognizes this pressure on installers, and is now set to release a new product that promises to cut the solar project cycle by as much as two weeks. The company is releasing two products early Q2 this year that provides installers with the full suite of planning, design, and customer-facing sales. The products build upon capabilities demonstrated in EagleView’s Inform platform.
The “secret sauce” to the platform is the extremely high-resolution imagery that EagleView uses a fleet of 130 aircraft to capture. The company flies its craft above the project site, taking images from overhead and multiple low angles. Pieced together on the software platform, the images create a navigable 3D model of the building. 
Peter Cleveland, EagleView’s VP of Solar, sat down with pv magazine at the recent NABCEP solar training conference in Phoenix to demonstrate the tool. This author’s residence was used as the demonstration site, and the level of detail was impressively sharp. Obstructions like piping and air conditioners on the roof were clearly modeled in 3D with pinpoint accuracy, and the shading analysis provided was quite detailed. 
Cleveland held up a breath mint at the conference hall table, comparing it to a basketball. He said the difference in the two are representative of EagleView’s resolution compared to conventional initial design imagery. The aircraft capture six-inch resolution at fifteen-minute intervals. This is about four times more detailed than standard aerial imagery, and as much as 70 times more detailed than standard satellite imagery.
The result of this ultra-high resolution? Confidence. 
Within moments, the tool was able to generate an optimal layout for the roof, taking in considerations like local roof setback policies and aesthetic preferences. Cleveland said that solar installers are often quite conservative with their initial customer designs, preferring to under-promise and over-deliver. While this is a reasonable customer service practice, it could lead to losing out on a bid versus another company that was more aggressive. 
Now, with EagleView’s TrueDesign Sales platform, installers can confidently create a sales-ready design with accurate PVWatts-backed production forecasts. The shade analysis results were on-par with SunEye shade analysis.
The platform creates a sales-ready report for customers, empowering sales representatives to move projects forward. To use it, you don’t need solar design experience, said Cleveland. 
The second product, TrueDesign, takes the platform beyond the point-of-sale, and creates an install-ready design. It has a one-button planning process and can fully generate a CAD design after a few hours of processing. “This is only possible through EagleView’s level of granularity,” said Cleveland. 
This saves installers a lot of time and resources, as a truck roll is no longer necessary to bring a site surveyor to the home. It minimizes risks for installers who have employees climbing ladders for manual pen-and-paper site surveys on rooftops, as well. Interior structures must still be manually observed, but the shortened site survey time makes teams nimbler.
Cleveland said the user-friendly tool simplifies the installation process, and it is a readymade platform that could support roofing contractors looking to break into the PV space.
The two products are currently going through trials in an early evaluator program of 40 companies. Cleveland said the trials have been effective in cutting project times as promised. The company held a webinar April 7th to introduce the products.
“EagleView reports help us to eliminate in-person site surveys and shorten project lifecycles by up to two weeks. Everyone wins: homeowners go solar faster, our dealers avoid an additional site visit, and we reduce project overhead,” said Jake Wachman, VP of software at SunPower.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/07/designs-control-strategies-for-pv-integrated-shading-devices/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 7, 2022","Designs, control strategies for PV-integrated shading devices","Frompv magazine global
An international research group has conducted a comprehensive review of all designs and control strategies for PV-integrated shading devices (PVSDs), in order to help bring the technology closer to commercial viability.
“Currently, the application of the solar panels to the kinetic shading devices is very limited so that is not possible to come across any instances implemented in the urban buildings, despite some prototypes,” researcher Ayca Kirimtat told pv magazine. “The basic criterion to consider before implementing such a system still is and will be the return of investment rather than sustainable energy development for green life. The implementation cost of conventional panels is very high for many customers and the tailor-made panels for shading devices would be considerably higher. However, given the fundamentals of new product development, the costs should be automatically lowered by the market, as the demand gets higher.”
Kirimtat and her colleagues said that module orientation is crucial in PVSDs, as it strikes a balance between power generation and the use of sunlight to reduce the heating, cooling, and lighting needs of buildings.
The control strategies used to optimize the performance of solar shades were divided into three groups. Hard control techniques use dynamic systems such as energy and daylight simulation models in order to evaluate the thermal behavior of the buildings. Soft control methods utilize mathematical models to predict system behavior analytically. Other techniques involve reinforcement of learning control and multi-agent control, while hybrid methodologies are based on all of these approaches.
The scientists presented a detailed literature matrix to provide an overview of previous studies on different methods for PVSDs in buildings. It was based on PVSD type, control strategy, and building type, with 77 business cases identified and briefly introduced.
The scientists stressed the importance of considering long-term performance monitoring of PVSDs as a crucial aspect for their viability, as well as the issue of replacing the shades.
“To shorten the payback time of the PVSD systems, relevant control methods should be encouraged to be used in the early design process of these systems,” they said. “However, for each PVSD design, the optimal control method could change based on the climatic characteristics, building type, and orientation.”
Kirimtat said the commercial viability of PVSDs may be accelerated by the green energy policies ruled by the governments.
“Simple and less expensive solutions offered by the competitive market players will be beneficial for this niche market to reach some size. Every market, whether niche or not, would eventually reach the maturity, by definition,” she said.
She estimates that it would be possible to see some instances of PV panels operating on the kinetic shading devices in 10 to 15 years.
The scientists presented their findings in “Control of PV integrated shading devices in buildings: A review,” which was recently published in Building and Environment. The research team includes scientists from the University of Hradec Kralove in Czechia, Auburn University in the United States, and the University of Zilina in Slovakia.
“The major goal of this paper is to offer an interdisciplinary and integrated state-of-the-art of PVSD system practices using various control methods and technologies. A systematic literature review was undertaken in order to conceptualize and offer a full knowledge,” the scientists said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/07/250mw-solar-project-planned-for-former-west-virginia-coal-mine/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,WEST VIRGINIA",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 7, 2022",250MW solar project planned for former West Virginia coal mine,"SEVA WV has gained approval to build a solar project on the site of a former coal mine, the likes of which West Virginia has never before seen. Not only is the Sun Park installation set to be the largest solar project in the state, its 250MW of capacity multiplies the state’s PV capacity by a factor of ten.
The solar array will be developed by Savion, while SEVA WV will lead other developments in a multi-phase project to revitalize the area of the former mine, with additional industry, lodging, hospitality, and recreation investments planned, including  80 miles of new trails as an extension of the Hatfield-McCoy ATV system.
The project is set to be located 3,000-acres of what used to be the Hobet surface mine site in southern West Virginia, according to project officials. Up to 300 workers are expected to be employed during construction, with the total project cost estimated to come in at around $320 million, which is considerably more than the $54 million in total solar investment in the state previously, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
According to data from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, the state of West Virginia, as a whole, has installed just 18 MW of solar, the third-least in the entire US. Sun Park will also dethrone what was set to be the largest installation in the state: EDF Renewables’ 92.5MW Wild Hill Solar project, which is set to be constructed on 795 acres of agricultural land in Jefferson County.
In 2020, the state passed a bill that authorizes electric utilities to own and operate up to 200 MW of renewable generation facilities to help meet the state’s electricity needs. A statement said the addition of new renewable generation may encourage economic development, as a “growing number of companies” require that a portion of the electricity they buy be generated by renewable sources.

The Gaskell West 2 and 3 project is located in Kern County, California, and is fully contracted holding five long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with cities and utilities in California. One of the first 20-year PPAs was signed in 2017 with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) for 45MWac. It was the first PPA signed by BART under its Wholesale Electricity Portfolio Policy, which requires 100% of BART’s power to come from renewable sources by 2045 while maintaining low and stable operating costs.
The solar-plus-storage project is expected to reach commercial operation in late 2022, and will generate enough clean and low-cost electricity to power approximately 16,800 California homes and displace approximately 178,500 metric tons of carbon emissions each year. This hybrid project marks the first transaction between Matrix Renewables and Recurrent Energy.
Canadian Solar’s majority-owned subsidiary CSI Solar will continue to support the project by providing the turnkey lithium iron phosphate-based battery storage solution for the 80MWh storage part of the project. The integrated technology solution includes the supply, installation, and commission of the battery system. In addition, CSI Solar will support the battery storage system with capacity and performance guarantees, ensuring system output, safety and reliability. CSI Solar has delivered several battery storage solutions to California projects including the Mustang, Slate and Crimson battery storage projects.
Matrix Renewables has been expanding its presence in the United States, its sixth country of operations, and opened its US headquarters in Florida in August 2021. It is backed by TPG Rise, a fund established by Texas Pacific Group (TPG) in 2016 in partnership with Bono and Jeff Skoll (the first president of eBay), and its mission is to invest in companies that drive measurable social and environmental impact along with business performance and strong returns. The company’s current portfolio includes 2.1GW of operational, under construction, or near ready-to-build solar PV projects and an additional 2.7GW pipeline of renewable energy projects under development, across the US, Europe, and Latin America.
“Through this project, we are continuing to grow our presence in the US, drawing from Matrix Renewables’ ambitions to become a major renewables platform across the US, Europe and Latin America,” said Cindy Tindell, managing director and head of US for Matrix Renewables.
Last month Canadian Solar announced a new 420W rooftop solar module with 21.5% efficiency. Manufacturing is expected to begin this month for these modules. Also last month the company reported mixed Q4 results but issued guidance for FY 2022 total project sales that missed expectations.
