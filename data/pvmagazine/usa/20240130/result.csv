Perovskite solar technology company Solaires Entreprises has switched on a pilot production line to manufacture indoor perovskite PV modules in Langford, British Columbia.
The company wants to sell the panels to automotive, consumer electronics, sensor, and LED component manufacturers. “The pilot line will produce 200,000 units per year, each unit measures 3.82 cm x 7.62 cm,” Solaires CEO Fabian De La Fuente told pv magazine.
The types of applications Solaires targets include self-charging electronic devices, wireless keyboards, smart door locks, electronic shelf labels, and sensors. Solaires says its modules can be standalone or paired with rechargeable batteries.
Solaires will produce the complete stack in-house.
“We have all the equipment to do so. Our manufacturing process is a sheet-to-sheet process for rigid glass substrates using slot-die coating, screen printing, laser ablation and lamination. We also have in-house quality control and testing equipment,” said De La Fuente, adding that the manufacturing equipment is commercially available and scalable.
The modules are based on perovskite tuned for indoor light absorption and have a power conversion of 35% in indoor light. Current prototypes have an aperture area of 17.22 cm2 and an active area of 14.70 cm2.
Under halogen lamp illumination at 1000 lux, the panels achieved a power density of 0.15 mW/cm2 and a power maximum power point (MPP) of 2.2 mW, with current MPP at 0.52 mA, and short-circuit current at 0.60 mA.
Under light-emitting diode lamp illumination at 1000 lux, the power density is 0.06 mW/cm2, the power MPP is 0.9 mW, the current MPP is 0.23 mA and the short-circuit current is 0.27 mA. The voltage MPP and open-circuit voltage are the same for both types of lamps, at 4 V and 5 V, respectively.
The company, which originated at Canada’s University of Victoria, was founded in 2022. It started out as a producer of mixed halide perovskite solutions, a product it called Solar Ink, with an energy bandgap of 1.54 eV. It stood out from the competition due to its longer shelf life, according to De La Fuente.
Solaires will continue to sell perovskite materials in addition to manufacturing modules. “Our business model is to license our technology to manufacturers around the globe and includes providing materials, such as our perovskite ink and other unique layers in the full module stack,” said De La Fuente.
De La Fuente said that thin film technologies, particularly perovskites, excel in absorbing indoor light compared to silicon, due to their intrinsic material properties.

It now moves to the state Senate for a vote.
The bill would require the owner or operator of solar assets to pay 12.5% per $1 of revenue earned for the sale of electricity exported out of the state. Each county would have its board of supervisors administer the program and collect the funds.
Funds would then be redistributed equally to residents in the county. This structure is similar to the oil export tax in Alaska, which cut a check of $1,312 to each resident last year.
This law would apply specifically to solar assets that deliver power to utilities outside the state. Residential rooftop solar, commercial and industrial on-site solar, off-grid solar, and solar owned by a public service corporation regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission (like APS or SRP) would be exempt from the tax.
Proponents of the bill said it would compensate Arizona residents for the harm created by companies that “exploit the land.”
Senator Priya Sundareshan, a Democrat from Tucson, argued that creating a tax on renewable energy that mimics Alaska’s oil dividend creates a false equivalency.
“Mining and oil and gas, these are all extractive industries that will result in some level of disturbance to the land, that is fundamentally pollution, impacts to the water quality,” she said. “There’s a lot more that goes into the extraction of oil and gas and other mining industries than, let’s say, passively sitting and letting the sun fall onto a solar panel.”
White Mountain Independent reported that Stan Barnes, a lobbyist for the Interwest Energy Alliance, argued that the law runs the risk of creating a trade war with other states. Taxing power delivered to a utility in another state would effectively push the cost onto the ratepayers in that state, he argued.
“More than one state can play this game,” said Barnes. “If other states did what Sen. Borrelli is proposing … our rates go up. It’s a bad game to play, it’s a trade war starting, anti-business kind of thing that Arizona would lose.”

Researchers at Switzerland’s ETH Zürich have conducted an extensive analysis on the commissioning timelines of a set of renewable energy projects deployed worldwide between 2005 and 2022 and have found, surprisingly, that completion times increased on average over the past two decades.
The academics investigated, in particular, the timelines of 12,475 projects using PV, wind onshore, wind offshore, biomass, and run-off-river hydropower spread across 48 countries. “The regions are defined as per World Bank country and lending group classification and sorted continently into Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD groups, as those in the OECD group tend to be wealthier countries,” they explained.
Their analysis considered project size, technology, project and developer characteristics, project site, and a project’s related market. They utilized project-level data sourced from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BloombergNEF) and other country-level data and environmental data from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Worldwide Governance Indicators, among others.
“We only considered projects where permitting and commissioning dates are recorded in the data and where a country has at least five transactions for any given technology,” the group specified. “The sourced data include details on installed capacity, names of actors developing the projects, project geocoordinates, permitting dates, and commissioning dates.”
One of the first conclusions drawn by the scientists is that, although PV is the technology that requires the least time to commission, the completion times for the deployment of utility scale solar plants in many countries increased from 2015 to 2022. “The findings further indicate that the mean time for deployment has increased for all technologies in the OECD and non-OECD groupings, except for biomass electricity in non-OECD countries,” they stated.
Referring to the critical factors that may delay projects, the academics said size has an “insignificant” impact and added that developers’ experience is, instead, a significant predictor of commissioning times, although only for PV and wind onshore. “This is likely due to low experience build-up in the other technologies due to relatively low deployment compared to solar PV and wind onshore,” they emphasized, noting that the presence of a domestic developer or a state-owned company may speed up deployment.
The analysis showed that completion times for PV and wind onshore increased by 0.5 years and 0.9–1.2 years respectively for OECD and non-OECD countries. “The upward trend also holds for different regions within the OECD and non-OECD groupings, with only Europe and Asia-Pacific showing a reduction in commissioning times for small hydro RoR and biomass electricity respectively,” the researchers noted.
The analysis also showed that factors such as currency devaluation and GDP contraction, as well as the COVID-19 crisis, had a significant impact on project timelines. It also showed that the average project size for solar PV during the 2005-2022 period is 17.3 MW in OECD countries and 34.4 MW in non-OECD countries.
The research group presented its findings in the study “A global analysis of renewable energy project commissioning timelines,” published in Applied Energy. “Future research could strengthen the econometric analysis with other potential factors and variables, and potentially apply them to energy technologies beyond renewables, such as electricity storage or grid assets, which might shed light on the robustness of our framework,” the scientists concluded.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/30/maine-blueberry-grower-goes-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,MAINE",ANNE FISCHER,2024-01-30,Maine blueberry grower goes solar,"Wyman’s, a 150-year old grower of wild blueberries, has partnered with ReVision Energy and REC Solar to install more than 17,000 solar modules on 35 acres of non-productive land in Maine. Wyman’s owns 55,000 acres of land in Maine and is a top-selling brand of frozen fruit in the U.S., according to Nielsen data. 
ReVision Energy is installing the project, which will have both Hanwha Q Peak Duo 400 W and REC380 solar modules. It is expected to generate 8.5 GWh of clean energy in the first year of operation, offsetting an estimated 8 million pounds of carbon every year, or the equivalent carbon sequestration of planting 60,735 trees.
This project is designed to offset 73% of Wyman’s energy use through net energy billing credits, meaning that the Maine utility, Versant Power, will give Wyman’s credit against its electric bill for every kilowatt hour generated. REC is the investor and owner of the solar plant, which Wyman’s will have a right to purchase after 20 years.
“For 150 years, we’ve been driven by the desire to produce healthy food, provide gainful employment, and protect natural resources,” said Tony Shurman, Wyman’s president and chief executive officer.
Wild blueberries took root in Maine more than 10,000 years ago and Maine is the only state in the U.S. where wild blueberries are commercially grown in abundance. These berries grow in their natural ecosystem, so there’s no artificial breeding or genetic modifications, and the plants are connected by an underground root system called rhizomes.
Wyman’s is not the first project to bring solar power to blueberry production. Solar was part of a pilot program at the University of Maine. The 4.2 MW solar project was built on a 10-acre blueberry farm. The project was developed by BlueWave, which worked with CS Energy, the EPC partner, and Navisun, the owner operator, and University of Maine, the research partner, to study solar construction techniques as well as ways of harvesting blueberries that are grown among solar panels.
Wyman’s is also partnering with the University of Maine on a research study that is  exploring how conditions caused by climate change, such as heat, drought, erratic rainfall patterns, and early frosts, impact production.
“The decision to go solar fits squarely with our ethos to do the right thing and seek a better way. Being powered by the sun is an important opportunity to ensure Wyman’s continues to provide healthy fruit for another 150 years and beyond,” said Shurman.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/30/solar-power-purchase-agreement-prices-rise-15-year-over-year/,"COST AND PRICES,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-01-30,Solar power purchase agreement prices rise 15% year-over-year,"LevelTen Energy released its quarterly power purchase agreement (PPA) pricing index for North America, releasing data for the full year ending in 2023. The company operates a PPA marketplace with over 900 project developers, energy advisors and resellers, and some of the world’s largest clean energy buyers.
The report noted that P25 prices for PPAs rose 3% in Q4 and 15% for the full year 2023. P25 pricing represents the 25th percentile of prices developers are offering in contracts, not the final transacted PPA prices.
LevelTen reported a mixed picture for the solar market regionally. P25 prices rose 15% in CAISO, California’s regional grid operator, while lowering in other markets.
“The increases were likely driven by regulatory adjustments, prevailing market conditions and increasing buyer demand,” said Sam Mumford, analyst, energy modeling at LevelTen Energy. “The CAISO increase in particular was likely caused by select developers pricing projects much higher than the previous quarter’s P25 price, potentially to account for expectations around cost of capital or future REC value.”
Meanwhile ERCOT (Texas) prices declined 3%, and Southwest Power Pool (SPP) declined 2%.
“The downward pressure on PPA prices during Q4 can be attributed to factors such as a moderation in panel prices, alleviation of supply chain constraints, and expectations of future interest rate changes,” said Mumford.
The report said that lower PPA prices in ERCOT can largely be attributed to lower interconnection costs and faster timelines.
(Read: “Bringing ERCOT’s speedy interconnection process to the rest of the U.S.”)
Mumford said that push-pull dynamics persist in solar PPA pricing. He said the market is seeing improvement in challenges related to the solar supply chain and module prices, but now the impact of high interest rates is impacting project returns and making it difficult for developers to reduce PPA prices.
LevelTen said its developers in its PPA marketplace have shown preference for contracting with a single credit-worthy large offtaker rather than managing multiple PPA contracts, even if that means contracting less of a project’s production volume. This can make it more difficult for new, smaller buyers to enter the competitive PPA landscape, but despite these barriers, LevelTen helped facilitate 19 first-time buyers in 2023.
The report said corporate demand for PPAs has remained strong, driven by changes like the electrification of transportation and buildings to rapidly increasing power requirements from datacenters supporting functions like AI and cryptocurrency. Corporate buyers and PPA sellers will have to adapt to the higher interest rate environment over the coming years, which leads to stricter financing requirements from banks.
“Increased competition and growing demand have resulted in challenges, many of which stem from a shift in negotiation power toward sellers,” said Guidehouse Insights in an interview section in the report. “Heightened demand/competition has led to more assertive requests from developers, who aim to transfer market risks and cost/price uncertainty to buyers. As such, buyers now face heightened exposure to outcome volatility and higher standards from developers on issues like minimum volumetric commitments and credit capacity.”
“Buyers and sellers will need to continue embracing a partnership approach to continue getting deals done,” said Mumford.
