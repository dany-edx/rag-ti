VETO letter from DeSantis on FPL's anti-solar bill: pic.twitter.com/aJvsHzm78L

When the bill initially passed on March 8, it did so by a combined vote of  83-31, with five abstaining in the House, and 24-15 in the Senate, garnering 68% of the total vote. In vetoing the bill, DeSantis sends it back to the House, where it will be available for consideration until the end of the current session. In Florida, it takes two-thirds of the members voting in each house to override a veto.
Since its introduction and through the bill’s passage in the state legislature, it received significant backlash with Will Giese, southeast regional director of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) calling it ” A nightmare for anyone who believes in energy freedom and the rights of people to choose the energy that works for them and their families.” A recent Sachs Media poll found that 86% of the 722 polled Florida voters, regardless of political affiliation or age, said they wanted Governor DeSantis to veto the bill, including 82% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats.
THANK YOU @GovRonDeSantis for the VETO of HB 741—the Net Metering Bill that would’ve DESTROYED Florida’s solar industry
I’m PROUD to be 1 of only 3 Republicans in the entire FL Legislature to VOTE NO on this bad Bill
I will NEVER support corrupt special interest legislation!
— Rep. Anthony Sabatini (@AnthonySabatini) April 27, 2022

Had the bill been signed by Gov. DeSantis, starting in 2023, payments to solar customers would have regress from a retail rate to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a minute fraction of the retail rate. The phase out was set to slash payment rates to solar customers by 50% in four years and would drop further still to the avoided cost rate by 2029. The bill would have also allowed for fixed charges to grid connected solar customers starting in 2026, with no limit on the fixed charges outlined in the bill text.
The bill was founded on “cost shift” rhetoric, claiming that those using their own energy are raising the cost of service to those who don’t, usually in an economically disproportionate fashion. However, only about 90,000 of the 8.5 million electric customers in Florida are topped with solar. The utility argues that this some 1% of Floridians are creating significant costs for the other 99%. Studies completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar. In his veto, DeSantis described House Bill 741 as a burden itself, one that would “contribute to the financial crunch that our citizens are experiencing.”
In a statement, SEIA called the veto a “major win for energy freedom and Florida’s clean energy economy.”
“Today, Governor DeSantis helped secure the livelihoods of thousands of solar workers and protected the rights of Floridians to lower their electricity bills with solar,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA. “Florida is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the country with new businesses popping up all across the state. This veto signals that Florida’s energy economy is open for business, and that the rights of state residents should be placed ahead of monopoly utility interests.”
Katie Chiles Ottenweller, southeast regional director at Vote Solar levied similar praise to Hopper, saying:
“Thank you to Governor DeSantis for siding with job and energy freedom by vetoing this harmful legislation. I’m glad the governor recognized the devastating impacts that HB 741 would have on our economy, workforce, and energy freedom. Today, Florida lives up to its name as the Sunshine State.”

The 8.4 MW portfolio is comprised of  two solar canopies (1.7 MW and 886 kW) at Caesars Atlantic City, two canopies (1.93 MW and 1.94 MW) and a 913 kW rooftop system at Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City, and a 1.01 MW canopy at the Tropicana Atlantic City. The installations will also bring quality of life improvements to each of the properties they are installed on, reducing snow removal costs, providing shading for staff and customers, reducing the heating costs of Harrah’s Resort, and extending the roof lifespan at Harrah’s.
“We are excited to break ground on our new solar panel portfolio today at Tropicana, Caesars, and Harrah’s Resort – a critical step in our CodeGreen strategy in Atlantic City region,” said John Koster, Regional President for Caesars Entertainment’s Eastern Division. “Our Caesars Entertainment Atlantic City resorts are committed to being leaders in environmental sustainability, as we work toward reducing our environmental footprint and aim to create more clean energy in the market.”
DSD will serve as long term owner and operator of the systems, and will fully develop and finance the installations. DSD and Caesars Entertainment are exploring solar projects located at other Caesars destinations across California, Illinois, Maryland, and Nevada, as Caesars, under its CodeGreen strategy, has a stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 100% before 2050.
The gaming industry is no stranger to embracing renewable energy, specifically solar, though capacity additions on the gaming front have namely come out of Nevada. In 2016 MGM Resorts  completed an expansion of the solar project on the roof of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center to 8.3 MW, as the largest contiguous rooftop solar array in the United States. A few years later, in 2021, MGM activated the 100 MW Mega Solar Array, a project that supplies power to 13 of its Las Vegas strip properties.  
The resort giant said the array is capable of providing 90% of its daytime energy needs. This equates to about 35% of total energy use by buildings that typically have significant nighttime demand. 
The Invenergy-developed project is structured through a 20-year power purchase agreement. Earlier this year, Invenergy sold 75% of its stake in the project to AEP Renewables, a unit of Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power. 
The 323,000-module system sits on 640 acres of land 30 miles north of Las Vegas. MGM said the location was selected with attention to environmental impacts on landscape and biodiversity in the location.

A group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has fabricated a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell that is able to harvest high-energy photons from a white-hot heat source and convert them into electricity.
The device is described as a heat engine with no moving parts that is able to produce power from a heat source of between 1,900 to 2,400 C. This concept is known as thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) and consists of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C. “It is a battery that takes in electricity, converts it to high-temperature heat, stores the heat and then converts it back to electricity by TPVs on demand,” the US group explained.
The system was built with two-junction TPV devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that were optimized for the planned temperature range and TEGS applications. These cells use band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter.
The scientists tested several system configurations and a thermophotovoltaic device with bandgaps between 1.2 and 1.4 eV was found to have the highest efficiency at 41.1% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 C. Another device with a 1.2/1.0 eV bandgap reached a maximum efficiency of 39.3%, at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 C.
The thermophotovoltaic cell should now be integrated into a grid-scale thermal battery. “The system would absorb excess energy from renewable sources such as the sun and store that energy in heavily insulated banks of hot graphite,” the researchers emphasized. “When the energy is needed, such as on overcast days, TPV cells would convert the heat into electricity, and dispatch the energy to a power grid.”
The device was presented in the study “Thermophotovoltaic efficiency of 40%,” which was recently published in nature.  Their work demonstrated the main parts of the system in separate, small-scale experiments and the research group is currently working to integrate the parts to demonstrate a fully operational system. “Thermophotovoltaic cells were the last key step toward demonstrating that thermal batteries are a viable concept,” said MIT researcher Asegun Henry. “One of the advantages of solid-state energy converters are that they can operate at higher temperatures with lower maintenance costs because they have no moving parts.”

The rules appear to specifically target the Guthrie Solar Project being developed by NextEra. These rules define the project, in its current form, as a nuisance to the town.
As of press time, pv magazine USA has not found the rule change documentation on the town’s website; however, on the front page of their site is a letter from the town’s mayor – “Talking points on solar power”. The letter points to anti-solar sentiment, and claims that “the proposal includes constructing parts of the facility on land which is zoned for single-family use.”
Oddly, Mayor Shaw’s letter explicitly states that the city attorney is contacting property owners based on rumors of where a solar system is to be placed. The letter claims that developers have not contacted the city regarding the construction.
That the city is contacting residents based upon rumors could explain why NextEra said they haven’t released a map of properties signed to lease their land to the general public, and that they would only release a map showing where solar would not be installed.
Per the city’s lawyer, the jurisdiction is allowed to regulate private land within one half mile of city limits.
The rule changes include:
The rule changes were specifically made after solar developer NextEra submitted plans to develop a 100 MW facility that will utilize 600 acres of land in Callaway County, none of which – per a Twitter communication – will be built within city limits.

Standard concerns of property value and future land development were referenced by townspeople.
City Attorney Nathan Nickolaus also brought up the risk of fire. The ordinance appears to be referencing a pv magazine USA article, stating “there were 155 fires caused by solar panel systems from 2015-20 with 71 at non-residential systems.”
“Representatives with the New Bloomfield Fire Protection District have stated that their department lacks the facilities to fight a fire within a utility scale solar facility comprising of hundreds of acres,” Nickolaus said.

According to an updated analysis based on the organization’s survey for solar workers and companies already affected by the investigation, SEIA has predicted that the case will result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021. In losing this capacity, SEIA also estimates that the United States will emit an additional 364 million metric tons of carbon by 2035, missing the opportunity to effectively take 78 million internal combustion-engine vehicles off the road. By 2025, imposition of tariffs will cause solar capacity to fall 75 GW short of the pace needed to reach the president’s goal, equal to the size of the entire US solar market prior to 2020.
These predictions are based on the assumptions of an affirmative decision on the Auxin petition, with tariffs imposed in the 50% to 250% range; sharply restricted module import supply from countries named in the investigation,with manufacturers in non-named countries needing time to pick up the slack; and the updated results of the impact survey.

According to the most recent publication of SEIA’s survey, with over 700 responses current to April 26, 83% of respondents that purchase or use modules reported cancellations or delays in their module supply agreements. This is up from 75% reports of cancellations or delays when the first results of the survey were released on April 5, with those results stemming from roughly 200 respondents.
Looking geographically at where responses came from, 13 states (Maine, Delaware, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota) had 100% of respondents share that they were experiencing delayed or canceled module supply. Across the nine business segments respondents came from (Residential, Community Solar, Commercial, Utility Scale, Domestic Manufacturing, Importing, Distribution, Finance, and Others), every single segment has at least 85% of respondents reporting that the investigation will have a devastating or severe negative impact on their business in 2022. When domestic manufacturers are removed, that number jumps to 90%.
The impact is not just on solar projects either. 65% of respondents working in energy storage expect the investigation to have a devastating to severe impact on their business as well.
Projects in purgatory
Based on SEIA’s voluntary reporting, responses have outlined to SEIA that a total of 318 utility scale projects accounting for 51 GW of solar capacity and 6 GWh of attached battery storage are being cancelled or delayed. What’s more is that a large percentage of delayed projects could move into the realm of cancelation, as developers don’t know when they might be able to get modules and som delays may drag on to the point of project failure.
Image: Nextracker
With respondent data from 39 states, all but two of those states are reporting utility scale project cancellations and delays above 100 MW in capacity. Leading the pack are Texas, with just over 13 GW of projects at risk, California at 7.5 GW, Ohio at 4.4 GW, Indiana at 3.6 GW, and Illinois at 2.5 GW. The figures are especially problematic for Ohio and Indiana, both of which are states that have historically not been leaders in installing solar, but have hit their stride as of late and had been projected to be two of the most active states across the entire country for development over the next five years.
SEIA shares that these figures also likely only represent a fraction of the investigation’s true impacts. Across the US as a whole, 42% of the known utility scale solar development pipeline has been disrupted. Indiana and Idaho both reported 100% of each state’s known pipeline being disrupted.
In each of those top-five states, every GW of cancelled projects represents roughly $1 billion in investment at risk. The ratio is actually a bit higher in California, where 7.5 GW of at-risk projects account for roughly $8 billion in investment risk.
Jobs at risk
70% of survey respondents report that at least half their solar and storage workforce is at risk and more than 200 companies report that their entire workforce is at risk.
“If tariffs are imposed, in the blink of an eye we’re going to lose 100,000 American solar workers and any hope of reaching the President’s clean energy goals,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “This would be a monumental loss for our nation, which has the potential to lead our clean energy future, with the right policies. Instead, the Commerce Department is on track to wipe out nearly half of all solar jobs and force a surrender on the President’s climate goals.”
It’s important to clarify that the figure of 100,000 jobs lost also includes new jobs not added, though SEIA asserts that the vast majority would be layoffs of existing workers. 16,000 to 18,000 solar manufacturing jobs would be not realized between 2022-2023 due to the imposition of tariffs, the majority of which would be layoffs. For context, roughly 31,000 people were employed in solar manufacturing in 2020, the most recent year for which survey data is available.

Eligible projects must come online by December 31, 2024. Proposals for the program are due by May 6, and PG&E said it expects to execute agreements and to seek approval from the California Public Utilities Commission this summer.
The projects will be distributed throughout PG&E territory and will directly influence the growth of the Solar Choice program administered by the utility. Solar Choice is an opt-in program for customers who prefer to have their energy sourced by renewables and are willing to pay a premium for clean energy. The program strives for transparency, providing a map of local solar projects like the ones requested in this procurement effort that power customers’ homes.
When enrolled in Solar Choice, customers choose between 50% or 100% options, and will pay a small premium based on their enrollment level. A customer receiving 500 kWh in Solar Choice service would pay about $3.50 per month on top of their utility bill. Rates can be calculated here.
Solar Choice is part of the greater Green Tariff Shared Renewables Program, established in 2013 by Governor Jerry Brown. The program supports renewable energy access for institutional, commercial, and individual customers.
“These new projects will directly contribute to the continued growth of PG&E’s renewable energy customer programs — which have experienced steadily increasing customer enrollment over the past few years — while at the same time helping to create prosperity for California and supporting the planet,” said Fong Wan, senior vice president, Energy Policy Procurement, PG&E.
Those interested in staying up to date with future projects can sign up for PG&E’s project procurement distribution list.

UCS reached that result by modeling the US grid using the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDs) model, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and now available for free. ReEDS is NREL’s flagship capacity planning model for the North American electricity system, and it simulates the evolution of the bulk power system—both generation and transmission—from present day through 2050.
UCS may be the first advocacy group to use the ReEDS model, given that when NREL was asked about other recent uses of the model, they provided three examples that were led by university-based researchers at UC Berkeley, Harvard, and ETH Zurich.
The UCS study “looked at the potential of action by self-identified leadership states—members of the US Climate Alliance,” said Paula García, UCS senior bilingual energy analyst. The Alliance is a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to its website.
UCS modeled meeting 100% of electricity consumption with renewable energy by 2035 in the 24 states, while electricity demand increased 56% through 2040 due to electrification of heating and transportation. Costs for doing so in the 24 states were 0.1% lower over 20 years, relative to the “no new policy” scenario, said García.
Renewable electricity standards focus on consumption of renewable electricity, not generation, García said, and the UCS modeling showed many gas generating units in the 24 states operating through 2040. Out of concern for “communities that have borne the brunt of pollution,” she said, the UCS report recommends policies to ensure environmental justice and to “expand equity in access to rooftop solar, energy efficiency, and electrification.”
Modeling skills
To use the ReEDS model, UCS modeling staff licenses the GAMS modeling software that ReEDS requires, along with a CPLEX linear programming solver from GAMS. Running the model also requires the languages Python and R, said Sandra Sattler, UCS lead energy modeler. UCS used a computer with a 16 bit operating system and 16 GB of RAM.
NREL “is good about answering questions about particular aspects of our analyses,” said Sattler. “Also, now that the model is publicly available, there is a good amount of documentation and a robust online users community.”
The UCS analysis used the low renewable cost projection from NREL’s 2020 Annual Technology Baseline for renewable cost and performance assumptions. For the extent of electrification, UCS used the high electrification scenario from a 2018 NREL study, which incorporates load flexibility.
The ReEDS model ensures that demand is met in all seasons at all times, “using a reduced-order dispatch in 17 time-slices within each model year,” says NREL’s documentation. The model also ensures resource adequacy.
The UCS report, titled “On the road to 100 Percent Renewables,” also projected health and jobs benefits from higher renewables. Three local environmental groups partnered in the study: COPAL in Minnesota, GreenRoots in Massachusetts, and the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition. UCS also published breakout analyses for Massachusetts, Michigan and Minnesota, and a technical appendix.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/27/wacker-falls-to-fourth-in-global-polysilicon-ranking/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,CHINA,GERMANY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MAX HALL,"APRIL 27, 2022",Wacker falls to fourth in global polysilicon ranking,"From pv magazine global
German polysilicon manufacturer Wacker Chemie‘s increased focus on semiconductor-linked material, rather than the silicon needed for solar panels, will see the business continue to fall down the global poly producer rankings, according to analyst Johannes Bernreuter.
A press release issued by the analyst’s company, Bernreuter Research, warned that development, together with the huge push in solar-grade polysilicon fab expansion being witnessed in China, will see the latter nation corner more than 90% of global supply by 2023.
‘Follow China’s lead’
“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has opened the eyes for what it means to be economically dependent on a dictatorial regime,” said Bernreuter. “Western governments should not make the same mistake with China. It is high time to establish non-Chinese solar supply chains. China has demonstrated what the ingredients of success are: low electricity rates for power-hungry polysilicon and ingot production, loan guarantees for private investment, cost-efficient equipment manufacturing, and strategic foresight.”
With Tongwei having supplanted Wacker as the world’s biggest polysilicon producer in 2020, the German manufacturer has been shunted down into fourth place, based on last year’s performance as recorded by Bernreuter Research.
On the climb
GCL Technology has climbed to second on the list. Like Tongwei, it produced more than 100,000 tons of polysilicon last year. Both companies, according to Bernreuter Research, will have the capacity to make more than 370,000 tons per year by 2023.
Daqo New Energy remains in third place in the latest ranking, followed closely by Wacker in fourth; Xinte Energy; and number six Xinjiang East Hope New Energy, which produces polysilicon in Xinjiang.
Silicon production in Xinjiang is a controversial issue outside China – particularly the topic of whether forced labor is a part of the solar value chain. The US House of Representatives in December drafted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which proposes banning all imports from Xinjiang unless it can be proven forced labor played no part in their manufacture.
Bernreuter Research predicted the expansionary strategy of Chinese poly makers would see Wacker’s market share contract further with the German business due to trail Xinte and East Hope by 2023, in sixth place.
Losing share
That would mark a similar path to that taken by former world number one, the US-based Hemlock Semiconductor, which is owned by US tech company Corning. Since losing top-dog status in the poly ranking in 2012, Hemlock has steadily fallen down the list to ninth in the current edition.
South Korean poly maker OCI, which manufactures most of its product in Malaysia, is seventh in the ranking and the only European presence in the top 10 is related to the 15% stake Norwegian company REC Silicon holds in the Shaanxi Non Ferrous Tianhong REC Silicon Materials joint venture in China, which is 85% held by a state-owned miner. REC’s fully-owned silicon production facilities are based in the US.

In its Q1 earnings report, the company reported first quarterly revenue of 4.34 trillion South Korean won (KRW) or approximately $342 million USD, and an operating profit $204 million, although income was down.
Despite the demand for its cylindrical battery cells and increased productivity through its automated manufacturing system, the company said its consolidated revenue was down 2.2% on-quarter and net income was halved from the previous year at $204 million. The company achieved an operating margin of 6%.
LG Energy Solution attributed the drop in revenue to the rising costs of raw materials, ongoing global semiconductor shortage, and supply chain disruption caused by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and periodic COVID lockdowns. The policy of prioritizing replacing recalled batteries also cut into sales in the first quarter. Materials costs have been a challenge for battery manufacturers, with nickel, lithium and cobalt prices escalating. LG Energy Solution said that the company, nevertheless, saw steady operating profit.
Looking forward, LG Energy Solution annual sales target is $15. 1 billion, an increase of 8% on-year, due mainly to the burgeoning market for electric vehicles. The company currently has a backlog of $236 billion, with many of the major automakers as customers.
“Despite global economic uncertainties, LG Energy Solution will continue to make prudent investments to revamp quality and raise product competitiveness,” said Youngsoo Kwon, CEO of LG Energy Solution. “As a responsible and loyal business to our partners, shareholders and investors, LGES will lead the energy industry toward a battery-powered future with unrivaled competitiveness.”
The company plans to invest about 7 trillion KRW in to boost its battery manufacturing capacity to 200 GWh this year, with a goal of 520 GWh by 2025. By region, the company’s battery capacity in 2025 would account for 41% in North America, which would be the largest share in the region, 37% in Asia and 22% in Europe. Last month, for example, the company announced plans to invest approximately $1.4 billion (US) to construct a factory in Queen Creek, Arizona for the purpose of manufacturing cylindrical batteries. The construction of this 11 GWh capacity site is set to begin in the second quarter of this year, with plans for mass production slated in the second half of 2024. The cylindrical batteries will be supplied to EV manufacturers as well as electric tool companies in North America.
All of the company’s manufacturing facilities will be transformed into smart factories to  drive down costs while reinforcing manufacturing competitiveness. The new Arizona facility will be a fully automated smart factory with remote support, manufacturing intelligence, logistics automation, and more.
To improve profitability despite escalating materials prices, the company said it plans to secure raw materials through long-term agreements and strategic equity investments. To secure product competitiveness, LG Energy Solution is working is developing technology to better control thermal propagation in pouch battery packs. The company is also developing new cathode materials, while introducing high-capacity cylindrical battery cells in new form factors.
