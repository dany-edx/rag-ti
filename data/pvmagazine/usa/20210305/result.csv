The funding echoes testimony by Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm during her confirmation hearing, when she highlighted her desire for DOE to increase its cleantech innovation investment through loan programs and funding for small companies and startups.
The new funding announcement said that clean energy R&D projects can cover a wide range of topics, including grid modernization, carbon removal, renewable energy, and energy storage. Granholm has long been a supporter of research and investment in carbon capture technologies.
The funding will be administered by DOE’s Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs. These programs were set up to encourage diverse communities to take part in technological innovation and boost tech transfer between research labs and small businesses, another of Granholm’s goals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/05/new-mexico-bill-would-set-up-a-statewide-community-solar-program/,"COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COST AND PRICES,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW MEXICO",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 5, 2021",New Mexico bill would set up a statewide community solar program,"A bill aimed at creating guidelines for a statewide community solar program is making its way through the New Mexico legislature, having passed a Senate vote on Mar. 4.
The bill, SB 84 would call on state regulators to evaluate existing community solar programs and develop rules for a state program to be adopted by April 2022. The bill sets its own rules for regulators to use to form the program:
The provisions for minimum subscriber counts and an anchor tenant would offer some certainty of a financial return to project developers.
The bill also calls on regulators to develop a list of low-income service organizations and programs that may pre-qualify low-income customers. This feature has been identified by Vote Solar’s Access & Equity Advisory Committee as a way to ensure successful  and equitable solar expansion programs.
In February, the University of New Mexico Bureau of Business and Economic Research released a report that found that a single 5 MW community solar facility could create up to 38 jobs, $1.47 million in labor income, and $5.17 million in output.
If signed into law, the bill could also help chip away at New Mexico’s renewable portfolio standard, which is currently set at 50% by 2030, 80% by 2040, and 100% by 2045. Solar and wind generation currently make up more than 30% of the state’s electricity sales.
The bill passed the Senate by a  27-14 vote, with all votes against coming from Republican senators. It heads to the House next, which is controlled by Democrats, 44-25, with one independent.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/05/facebook-likes-more-solar-power-under-tva-green-invest-program/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 5, 2021",Facebook ‘likes’ more solar power under TVA Green Invest program,"The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) again is partnering with Facebook on a renewable energy project under the power agency’s Green Invest program for businesses.
As part of the new deal, TVA is working with developer Origis Energy to build a 150 MW solar farm and 50 MW battery energy storage system in Lowndes County, Mississippi, around 150 miles northeast of the state capital, Jackson. The solar-plus-storage project will support Facebook’s two data centers in the Tennessee Valley.
Origis, through a long-term power purchase agreement with TVA that was signed on Facebook’s behalf, will own and operate the plant. The project is expected to create three to five full-time operations and maintenance staff. Origis will complete the facility in late 2023, pending environmental reviews.
TVA said this is the fourth renewable energy project and first battery storage system the agency and Facebook have collaborated on.
Facebook said it remains committed to powering all of its operations with renewable energy. To support that goal, the company signed a Green Invest agreement last August for a 70 MW solar project being built in Tennessee. In total since 2018, Facebook has announced purchases of 597 MW of power generated by multiple solar farms linked into the TVA electric grid in Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi.
Facebook ranked among the Top 5 U.S. corporate renewable energy buyers of 2020, inking deals for 725 MW. The company also ranks among the top green corporations globally, with a total clean energy portfolio estimated at about 6 GW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/05/sunrise-brief-a-texas-sized-oops-for-grid-operator-ercot/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 5, 2021",Sunrise brief: A Texas-sized ‘oops’ for grid operator ERCOT,"Oops. In a Texas-sized error, the Electric Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) may have charged $16 billion more than it should have for electricity during the mid-February winter storm that knocked out power across much of the state for days.
Potomac Economic, an independent market monitor, said in a letter to state regulators that ERCOT set the price of electricity at the $9,000/MWH maximum, but left that price in place for days longer than necessary. The firm recommended that the pricing be corrected and that $16 billion in charges be reversed.
The letter said that correcting the apparent error would not result in any revenue shortfalls for ERCOT’s generation resources. It said the corrected prices would cover the generator’s as-offered costs and reflect the actual supply, demand, and reserves during the roughly 33 hours from midnight Feb. 18 to 9:00 a.m. Feb. 19.
In a related development, Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative, which meets the wholesale power needs of four rural electric distribution cooperatives in northeast Texas, asked state regulators to order ERCOT to suspend invoicing, billing, and collection of charges related to February’s power outages.
Rayburn said that it and its four members provided service during the storm to 225,000 customers, 90% of whom are residential. It said the charges invoiced by ERCOT “stand to cause Texans financial devastation, with sky-high bills from the basic failure of the energy markets.”
Earlier this week, the ERCOT board fired its CEO, Bill Magness. On his way out, Magness reportedly turned down $800,000 in severance. And earlier in March, Texas Public Utilities Commission Chair DeAnn Walker resigned. She and the commission faced criticism for their handling of the February energy crisis.
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory are using artificial intelligence (AI) and game theory to develop a model that they said can help decision-makers harden electric infrastructure for resilience.
The model assesses which parts of a network cause the greatest cascades of utility failures when damaged. The insights should lead to better infrastructure design and disaster recovery practices.
In practice, the tool estimates what the researchers called “dependency connections” between utilities. Using the tool, they assessed how failures could cascade across these connections by turning assets on and off and watching what happened.

The researchers modeled Puerto Rico’s electricity-dependent water treatment plants, which were impacted by Hurricane Maria in 2017. In a typical treatment plant, electricity flows out of large power plants, across transmission lines, into substations, and then into water treatment plants. If a substation fails, so too would the treatment plants.
The researchers found that by introducing redundancies—for example, by connecting key plants to two substations—utility equipment can remain operable even after partial network disruptions.
They said that redundancy means having more than one critical path in order to reduce the potential to lose power to critical loads, like hospitals and water treatment plants.
Finding system dependencies can also improve restoration decisions immediately after a failure. Those kinds of post-disaster decisions, the researchers said, depend on knowing utility dependencies: Which equipment, if restored, will have the greatest overall net effect? And how can the greatest number of services be restored in the fastest way possible?
VEIR announced $10 million in Series A financing and debuted a new architecture for high-voltage superconducting transmission lines (HTS) to transform the grid. The investment was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, with participation from existing investor Congruent Ventures and new investor The Engine. The financing brings the company’s total funding to date to more than $12 million.
HTS uses smaller transmission lines and better use of existing rights-of-way, but has been hampered from widespread use by higher costs, distance limitations, and overall system complexity. VEIR’s approach is based on a novel cryogenic cooling system for high-voltage superconducting transmission lines. The new capital will allow VEIR to scale its team and begin to develop and test systems required to deploy its product to the transmission grid. VEIR will also use the funding to establish a physical development site in Massachusetts to demonstrate its approach.
The company said its technology enables increasing the amount of power transmitted in a given right-of-way by a factor of five.
NV Energy issued a request for proposals (RFP) to design, engineer, procure, deliver, and install a 350 kW community-based solar project at a school in North Las Vegas, Nevada.
