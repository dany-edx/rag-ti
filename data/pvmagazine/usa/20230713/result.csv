Because while recent legislation has unleashed an unprecedented sum of public money for the clean energy transition, it’s clear that marshaling climate action at this scale is as much a matter of industrial policy as it is foreign policy.
This dynamic is especially apparent in the electric power space, which consists of electricity only and combined heat and power (CHP) plants whose primary business is to sell electricity, or electricity and heat, to the public. The White House aims to decarbonize it by 2035. Indeed, beyond the clear need to channel investment toward renewable power additions, as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) promises to achieve, the U.S. must ensure that electric utilities and other power providers have the hardware and equipment they need to deliver.
Enter China, America’s foremost geopolitical competitor and, arguably, its most indispensable trade partner. China manufactures over 80% of the world’s polysilicon, the essential material in solar photovoltaics, and other solar panel components. But that’s not all. Across the global clean energy landscape, China boasts a stranglehold on the supply of critical minerals and the production of components needed not just for solar cells, modules and wafers, but for batteries, wind systems and other energy transition technologies. This imbalance sits at the epicenter of U.S. economic competition with China and, perhaps obviously, poses significant implications for America’s energy transition.
For Washington’s part, the IRA aims to help level the playing field by shoring up U.S. clean energy supply chains, expanding the menu of domestically sourced clean energy options and, in return, dramatically reducing reliance on China. Yet, as was demonstrated over the course of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s recent mission to Beijing, the bitter irony is that the U.S. simply does not possess the capacity to produce these emissions reducing technologies on its own. And should Washington maintain its efforts toward “friendshoring,” via the ongoing implementation of the IRA and follow-on policies, it invites risk of retaliatory measures by Beijing that will delay, or worse, outright scuttle the country’s incremental decarbonization objectives.
Sec. Yellen’s job, then, was to walk that tightrope: keep China supplying what we need while not forfeiting our drive to friendshore critical domestic capacity.
It was a tall order heading into her trip. Tit-for-tat protectionist and national security measures have marked the U.S.-China relationship of late: China imposing fresh restrictions on critical minerals including gallium and germanium exports, two metals used in the production of solar panels and semiconductor chips, while the Biden administration restricts semiconductor exports and mulls additional curbs on sales of AI chips to China, while keeping in place tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of imports from China imposed by the preceding administration.
Accordingly, and as anticipated,  Yellen’s trip yielded no breakthroughs, but she was able to deliver the important message that the world’s two largest economies and greenhouse gas emitters need to seek cooperation, keep open lines of communication, and pursue – as she put it – healthy economic competition.
We have our work cut out for us.
Take America’s solar industry which, over the last decade, has ceded approximately 80% of its global market share in solar component production. Indeed, only a few months prior to the enactment of the IRA, the U.S. DOE concluded that the country faces an “acute shortage” of domestically produced solar equipment, estimating that U.S. manufacturing capacity alone could meet less than a quarter of near-term market demand and less than a tenth of what would be needed to meet Washington’s “climate and energy security needs.”
With that, it stands to reason that while the IRA provides generous tax credits for both installation of solar facilities and the domestic manufacture of their component parts, the confluence of project permitting delays, grid interconnection backlogs, infrastructure and labor constraints, and yes, import-dependent supply chains is all but guaranteed to protract mission achievement.
But there’s reason for optimism yet. With support from state and local governments in the U.S. Southeast especially, American companies are announcing big plans for billions of dollars in green manufacturing projects. The solar industry declares a domestic manufacturing boom is underway. At the time of this writing, SEIA, the de facto voice of the U.S. solar industry, projects that domestic module production capacity is on track to exceed 60 GW per annum by 2026, ahead of the 50 GW by 2030 goal targeted by the organization only a few months ago.
Despite this promising future, though, the authorization, financing, and operationalization of manufacturing facilities take time. Our current reality requires access to Chinese mines and factories in order to power the transition to a clean and secure energy system. Making the U.S. more competitive is a formidable undertaking when one considers that China currently boasts a whopping 392 GW in cumulative solar capacity — more than the rest of the world combined.
The good news is that despite macroeconomic headwinds, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain constraints, the speed of the clean energy transition is accelerating at a record pace. Last year, investment in global low-carbon energy technologies topped $1 trillion for the first time.
The central tension at the heart of the IRA – limiting dependence on competitors like China while undergoing an energy transition that we cannot accomplish without them – will inform, and even dictate, so much of U.S. policy going forward. It will impact trade and industrial policy, climate policy, energy policy, and even national security. Sec. Yellen acquitted herself well walking this tightrope in China.
Yet while she may have been the latest to walk the tightrope, she will not be the last.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/13/michigan-utility-settlement-revises-resource-plan-to-add-3-8-gw-of-renewables/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,MICHIGAN",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 13, 2023",Michigan utility settlement revises resource plan to add 3.8 GW of renewables,"A coalition of renewable energy and climate science groups in Michigan scored a victory as utility DTE Energy revised its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) in a settlement.
The plan calls for retiring Michigan’s Monroe coal plant ahead of schedule. It also calls for 3.8 GW more renewable capacity by 2030 above the previous target set by DTE. The developments are a win for DTE’s 2.3 million customers as the state works towards securing clean, low-cost electricity.
“Today’s agreement is a step forward for Michigan’s clean energy transition, and a beacon of what’s possible when policy know-how, regulatory expertise, and community voices converge,” says Will Kenworthy, senior regulatory director for the Midwest, Vote Solar.
The settlement was the result of work by the Clean Energy Organizations, a coalition that includes Vote Solar, Union of Concerned Scientists, and Ecology Center.
Another provision win in the settlement was the raise of the utility’s distributed generation (DG) cap, which sets a hard limit of what percent of the generation mix small-scale facilities like rooftop solar can contribute to the grid. The cap was raised six-fold from 1% to 6%, raising it from one of the most draconian cap levels in the nation to a higher level. Last year the coalition scored a similar victory for Michigan’s Consumers Energy utility.
There is also bill on the table in Michigan to remove the distributed generation cap altogether. Senate Bill 362 would both remove the DG cap and restore net metering to the state. The legislation would be a reviving force for the state’s rooftop solar industry and a boon to customers looking to secure their own local, reliable, low-cost, and clean electricity with rooftop solar. DTE Energy has stated it is opposed to the bill.
In addition to boosting renewables, the DTE Energy settlement pushes the timeline forward three to five years on shutting down the Monroe coal facility. Expert analysis calculates that the settlement would avoid $432 million $972 million in total health costs and 39 to 87 premature deaths that would otherwise be caused by burning coal at the units through 2035 under DTE’s original proposal. DTE will also close its Belle River plant three years ahead of schedule under the IRP leading to another potential 71 to 159 prevented premature deaths from the negative health effects of coal burning.
“Accelerated coal retirement, replaced with clean renewable energy, will have widespread implications for air quality and public health. There’s no question that this will save lives,” said Alexis Blizman, policy director, Ecology Center.
DTE Energy also agreed to allocate $38 million to organizations and programs designed to provide bill payment assistance and energy upgrades to income-qualified families. Of that total, $8 million will help implement home readiness, energy efficiency, distributed generation and energy storage programs for low-income communities.
“This will help address two critical concerns of our clients,” said Environmental Law & Policy Center associate attorney Daniel Abrams. “First, that low-income Michigan families will be provided sustainable, enduring means to lower their energy bills. Second, that the clean energy revolution leaves no one behind.”
DTE Energy’s original proposed IRP was filed in November of 2022. Since then, hundreds of Michigan residents have made public comment on the proposed plan. In March, the Clean Energy Organizations filed expert testimony in which they outlined an alternative to the IRP. The settlement now goes to the desk of the Michigan Public Service Commission for approval.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/13/former-coal-plant-to-house-100-hour-iron-air-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 13, 2023",Former coal plant to house 100-hour iron-air battery,"The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has approved Form Energy’s construction of a 10 MW/1 GWh iron-air long-duration energy storage facility for Xcel Energy. It is slated to be built on the site of the former Sherburne County Generating Station, also known as Sherco, which is a coal-fired generating plant on the banks of the Mississippi River. The project will replace a facility previously capable of delivering over 2.2 GW of coal-generated power.
Xcel plans to start construction in mid-2024, aiming to bring the site online by mid-2025.

The project proposal submitted to the Minnesota PUC is largely redacted, concealing many details, including specific cost information, from the public. This is somewhat ironic given the “Public” nature of the utilities commission.
The filing does disclose that the project’s location on a brownfield/coal site qualifies it for an additional 10% tax credit adder under the Inflation Reduction Act. Furthermore, the filing implies that the project might also be eligible for a 10% domestic content tax credit adder, as Form Energy has expressed commitment to ensuring their product’s qualification.
In a recent development, Form Energy announced the establishment of a manufacturing facility in West Virginia.
According to a different Minnesota PUC docket, a white paper from Form Energy (Docket No. ET-2/RP-22-75) prepared as part of the slower-progressing Cambridge Energy station, provides insights into the cost inputs for the financial modeling tools (see table below).
Form Energy estimates the cost of iron-air energy storage hardware, under the “All-in Capital Cost,” to be between $1,700 and $2,400 per kW, with operating costs of $19/kW per year.

Although the hardware costs are two to three times higher due to its unique nature (100-hour battery capacity), Form Energy projects the operating costs to be less than half of those for eight-hour lithium-ion batteries.
However, Form Energy adds a caveat, noting that, “Cost assumptions used for iron-air in this analysis are representative, and should not be considered to be indicative of Form Energy’s pricing for commercial projects in 2030.” Meanwhile, the lithium-ion costs are sourced from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 2022 Annual Technology Baseline.
The company also forecasts that it aims to offer capacity at $20/kWh.
In Form Energy’s 2020 Best Modeling Practice Study, the company suggests new approaches to energy resource optimization, utilizing two different modeling techniques: time-sampled and co-optimization methods.

The time-sampled method uses a comprehensive set of 120 hours from different seasons and peak days, based on the Regional Energy Deployment System model, to understand the potential impact of time sampling in large-scale energy systems. Meanwhile, the co-optimization method explores various scenarios, such as varying wind conditions, high gas costs, high demand, and transmission constraints. This approach employs the open-source tool, Renewables Ninja, to simulate wind production profiles and imposes ‘lost load’ penalties when demand is not met.
Furthermore, Formware, a capacity expansion and economic dispatch model, is used to calculate the most cost-effective mix of assets and operational strategies. Through these innovative techniques, the research aims to offer a more realistic cost perspective and improved resource optimization in energy systems modeling.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/13/desalinated-ocean-water-for-green-hydrogen-production/,"HYDROGEN,CALIFORNIA,NETHERLANDS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 13, 2023",Desalinated ocean water for green hydrogen production,"While electrochemical batteries can serve many of our needs from mobile devices to vehicles and grid-scale storage, some applications like heavy trucking and industrial processes require huge amounts of energy to be dispatched, making hydrogen an attractive option.
Over 80% of the cost of hydrogen goes toward the electricity needed to split the water atom in a process called electrolysis. When paired with low-cost, emissions free electricity sources like solar or wind, hydrogen production is considered “green hydrogen.”
Ohmium, a Fremont, California-based company that develops green hydrogen electrolyzers, announced it has found a partner in Aquastill, a provider of desalinated water systems. The two will partner to produce green hydrogen fuel from desalinated ocean water.
Aquastill’s desalination device uses waste heat as an input, and will make use of residual heat from Ohmium’s electrolysis process. This offers co-benefits in cooling Ohmium’s system while powering desalination.
The two companies are currently developing how to optimize integration of the systems, which are highly modular and can be scaled from megawatt to gigawatt scales. Offshore wind energy was highlighted as a potential electricity source for the modular system, and solar is often a great match given its high modularity and ability to be installed on bodies of water.
“Utilizing Aquastill’s membrane technology to efficiently produce green hydrogen from seawater has the potential to be a game changer for companies operating in coastal or rural regions that want to affordably and sustainably decarbonize,” said Arne Ballantine, chief executive officer, Ohmium International.
Ohmium’s second generation proton exchange membrane electrolyzer produces at a rate of 9.0 kg per hour with a 4 second ramp up time. It is compatible with 3-phase with 480 VAC/60Hz, 415 VAC/50Hz, or 400VAC/50Hz with optional DC integration. Find the full specifications sheet here.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) targets reduced green hydrogen costs. Launched in 2021, the Hydrogen Shot program has a “1-1-1″ goal, targeting costs of $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade. In 2022 renewable energy-fueled hydrogen cost roughly $5 per kilogram, so this target represents a cost reduction of 80% in one decade.
DOE investment in green hydrogen is on the rise. In 2021, it supported $285 million in funding, and in 2022, the President’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request included the application for $400 million in funds for green hydrogen development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/13/spi-energys-solar4america-plans-hjt-solar-cell-factory-in-the-u-s/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 13, 2023",SPI Energy’s Solar4America plans HJT solar cell factory in the U.S.,"Solar4America, a wholly owned subsidiary of SPI Energy Co., Ltd., plans to begin manufacturing N-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cells in the United States.
This follows the company’s January announcement that it was increasing solar module production to 2.4 GW in its Sacramento, Calif. factory. While the Inflation Reduction Act has so far incentivized many module manufacturers to begin production in the U.S., cell and wafer manufacturing has yet to ramp up.
“The production of HJT solar cells aligns with our commitment to providing cutting-edge renewable energy technology while reducing carbon footprints globally,” said Denton Peng, chairman and CEO of SPI Energy.
HJT uses N-type monocrystalline silicon as a substrate, depositing silicon-based thin films with unique characteristics and transparent conductive films on the front and rear surfaces. By combining the benefits of crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon thin-film technologies, the company reports that HJT technology offers excellent photo absorption, passivation effects as well as exceptional efficiency and performance. Key advantages of HJT solar cells include enhanced conversion efficiency, superior energy yield, reduced degradation rate, improved weak light performance, and it is adaptable to thinner wafers.
Solar4America plans to begin manufacturing HJT solar cells in the U.S. by the end of 2024. This announcement adds to the company’s manufacturing plans, which includes not only cell but also wafer manufacturing. Last year SPI Energy registered its U.S. solar wafer manufacturing business, SEM Wafertech, Inc., for production of wafers starting this year with initial capacity of 1.5 GW, with plans of expanding manufacturing capacity to 3 GW in 2024. At the same time, SPI Energy hired Franz Feuerherdt as VP of sales and marketing to lead the Solar4America module production business. Feuerherdt joined Solar4America from Mission Solar Energy, and held prior roles at Flex and SolarWorld.
Formed in 2006, SPI Energy is based in McClellan Park, California. It went public in January 2016 and its EV affiliate Phoenix Motorcars went public in January 2022, with the companies trading on Nasdaq.
