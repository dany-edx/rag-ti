https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/07/solar-microgrid-to-support-critical-water-infrastructure/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,OHIO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Solar microgrid to support critical water infrastructure,"With a rise of extreme weather events and an aging centralized electric grid, extended power outages are a rising threat to community resilience. Aware of these threats, AEP Ohio contracted Eaton to help construct a solar microgrid dedicated to supporting its Tussing water booster station.
A microgrid can operate fully independently, or on “island” mode, providing continuous power through long-term outages. The water booster station’s microgrid includes 100 kW of onsite solar generation and 440 kWh of battery energy storage. The Eaton project is fully commissioned and expected to achieve operations this quarter.
The microgrid supports the City of Columbus climate action plan to reduce emissions by 45% and implement five microgrid pilot projects by 2030 on the path to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. It was funded partially through AEP Ohio’s Smart City program.
“Climate change is already impacting quality of life in central Ohio, and the challenges stemming from its very existence will only continue to grow more frequent and more common in the years ahead,” said Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther. “We have an obligation to strengthen the resiliency of our infrastructure and to meet these challenges head on.”
The EPA said as much as 40% of operational costs for drinking water is tied to energy use. The new microgrid is an example of supporting this critical infrastructure more sustainably while remaining cost-effective.
Microgrid adoption
Microgrids are increasingly being adopted by critical infrastructure and transportation providers to ensure long-term resilience of operations under a changing climate and grid. According to Wood Mackenzie data, the U.S. microgrid market saw a 47% increase in solar and storage capacity additions in 2022 compared to 2017 levels.
Moreover, the data shows that more than 175 solar projects and solar-plus-storage microgrids have been in active development and were scheduled to come online by the end of 2022. The U.S. microgrid market reached 10 GW in the third quarter of 2022, with more than 7 GW in operation and the rest in planning or construction stages.
Military microgrid installations will likely grow as a result of the U.S. Army’s resiliency goal to install a microgrid on every base by 2035. These will include renewable generation and large-scale battery storage, with the goal being able to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all Army installations by 2040.
Pittsburgh International Airport became the first major US airport to be powered entirely by a microgrid using natural gas and solar energy. In its first year of operation, carbon dioxide emissions were cut by about 8.2 million pounds, said Tom Woodrow, Pittsburgh Airport’s senior vice president of engineering and infrastructure intelligence. It is estimated that the airport saved $1 million in energy costs.
The 20 MW microgrid powers the entire airport and hotel and remains connected to the grid as an option for emergency or backup power if needed. Due to the cost savings, the airport is considering doubling the number of solar panels from over 9,000 to over 18,000.
In a remote community in Alaska, residents of the village of Shungnak, Alaska have become accustomed to burning diesel fuel for its electricity. As oil prices soared in early 2022, the village paid $8.25 or more to keep its smelly, loud diesel power plants running.
A solar plus battery energy storage project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Northwest Arctic Borough fundamentally changed how the village sources its electricity. A 225 kW solar array offsets much of the village’s energy needs, which generally ranges between 200kW and a peak of 300kW. LG 405 W NeON 2 Bifacial solar modules were selected for the array.
The microgrid is intelligently designed to operate and supply power in times where diesel generation would be most expensive. Diesel fuel transportation and maintenance costs are particularly high in remote, cold climates in freezing temperatures, and the microgrid can respond and dispatch power at those times of highest cost.
“Thanks to the energy storage system, we can turn the diesels off but keep the lights on in the community. It also gives the local utility the ability to run on 100% clean energy for hours at a time,” said Rob Roys, CIO, Launch Alaska.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/07/enel-adds-2-gw-of-north-america-renewable-capacity-in-2022/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Enel adds 2 GW of North America renewable capacity in 2022,"Enel North America announced it brought online 1.98 GW of utility-scale solar and wind projects in the United States and Canada last year. The buildout included 550 MW of new demand response capacity and 119 MW of distributed energy storage deployed or under contract in 2022. 
The year’s progress was made possible through the development of large projects like Blue Jay solar in Texas (270 MW), 25 Mile Creek wind in Oklahoma (250 MW), and many others. 
Combined, the new projects represent over $200 million in new property tax revenues for local communities and over $210 million in landowner payments over the projects expected lifetimes. 
Also in 2022, Enel signed 12 power purchase agreements (PPA) with high-profile customers like Campbell Soup Company, McDonald’s, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Its PPA business totaled 650 MW for the year. 
The company also attached virtual PPAs to its 25 Mile Creek project, with Verizon signing for 100 MW of capacity, The Clorox Company for 47 MW, and MathWorks for 11 MW. 
In November 2022, Enel announced plans to invest about $5 billion in the North American market, with the aim to develop approximately 5 GW of new utility-scale renewable and battery energy storage capacity through 2025. The company said it intends to add 155 MW of distributed energy storage and 475,000 charging ports by 2025. 
The growth was, “thanks in part to major policy action and high market demand,” said Enrico Viale, head of Enel North America. “We feel a sense of urgency to usher in large-scale clean power plants together with other energy solutions that advance our society toward full decarbonization,” he said.
New business units
Last November, Enel announced it will build a 3 GW solar module production line in the U.S. The bifacial solar module and cell manufacturing facility comes with plans to scale up production at the facility to 6 GW per year.
Construction at the yet undisclosed location is to begin in the first half of 2023, with production anticipated by late 2024. The facility is expected to create up to 1,500 new full-time jobs and supports the domestic solar PV supply chain. The proposed facility will be Enel’s second global PV manufacturing facility. The company previously announced the expansion of its 3Sun gigafactory in Catania, Sicily, increasing production capacity from 200 MW to 3 GW.
The company also introduced several new business lines to meet the evolving needs of the energy transition. It announced Enel X Way, a business focused on the buildout of electric vehicle charging networks and services.
The company will support the rapidly expanding demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure with its portfolio of technologies, including the JuiceBox, winner of the “Best EV Charger Overall for 2022” from CNET and Car and Driver. The company partnered with residential solar provider Sunrun to offer Level 2 EV charging stations. The co-branded EV charger joins Sunrun’s rooftop residential solar and battery energy storage offerings.
The EV charger provider developed the Electric Pan-American Charging Corridor of EV chargers, which enabled actors Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman to ride electric vehicles over 13,000 miles, 16 border crossings and 13 countries, from northern Mexico to the southern tip of Argentina. The journey was documented in an 11-part series called “Long Way Up,” featured on Apple TV+.
Enel also launched Gridspertise last year, a network of digital twins designed to optimize grid and asset operations. Recommendations made by the service have led to 26% savings on trimming for vegetation management, 15% savings for maintenance, and 50% savings for engineering measurement with an overall increase in safety and efficiency of field workers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/07/dronebase-rebrands-as-zeitview-to-scale-aerial-solar-scanning/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MONITORING,O&M,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Dronebase rebrands as Zeitview to scale aerial solar scanning,"In flight to reposition itself as an advanced inspection software company for energy and infrastructure, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and manned aircraft specialist Dronebase rebranded to Zeitview today.
The company is funding its business model pivot from drones and aircraft to an inspection software focus with a $55 million Series D equity round.  Zeitview lined up the equity raise with Valor Equity Partners, Union Square Ventures, Upfront Ventures, Euclidean Capital, Energy Transition Ventures, and Hearst Ventures.  The funding supports the company’s AI-enabled software and global footprint in advanced inspection solutions across a burgeoning utility-scale solar market, among other markets served.
Last year, Dronebase inspected 43 GW of global solar projects.
As Zeitview, the company will continue building advanced inspection software that delivers what it says are fast, accurate insights, lowers costs for asset owners and improves performance and longevity. Along with rotary wing drones, Zeitview inspection professionals use crewed aircraft and smartphone technologies to create flexible solutions for clients.
“We appreciate how important time is to our customers: on the one hand, they need immediate and accurate analysis about the health of their assets; on the other, they are building energy and infrastructure resources to last for decades,” said Dan Burton, founder and chief executive officer at Zeitview. “We are confident that our AI-enabled software solutions can deliver that immediate answer and a long-term home for our customers, while we are increasingly agnostic about what tool we use to capture the most accurate data.”
Zeitview means “time view” and the company says it better captures the nature of the company’s services and mission to accelerate the energy transition. In addition to providing real-time data, the company offers long-term solutions to track changes across a period of time for an asset.
Last year the company launched the North American Solar Scan.  Zeitview’s solar asset rating issues real-time ratings from A to D for operational solar projects of 1 MW and larger. The asset rating system provides data and analytics based on equipment, temperature and operating rating performance metrics. Similar to a project finance or credit ratings agency, solar projects can now carry a triple-letter rating from ‘AAA’ or ‘AAB,’ down to grade ‘D.’
Founded in 2015, the company expects to scale up its aerial data capturing solutions to scan 200 GW of solar assets this year, as its solar rating platform takes flight from 43 GW of solar assets scanned last year.
Solar asset owners such as SMA are finding that aerial inspections using drones and manned aircraft are the optimal way of managing and maintaining large solar installations. SMA has O&M contracts for over 1,000 sites, from small commercial of 30 kW and up to large-scale installations of over 600 MW.
Aerial inspections have great benefits to the solar industry. An unmanned drone can inspect about 20 MW per day per drone operator for on-demand thermal inspections or spot checks, while manned aircraft can capture over 500 MW in a 4-hour period. SMA uses both unmanned drones and airplanes to complete its inspections, finding aerial imaging far superior to “the old way” of doing things, which was manual inspection.
pv magazine will be hosting a webinar at 10:00am PST / 1:00pm EST time today titled, “DroneBase’s North American Solar Scan brings transparency to U.S. solar market.”  Joining us will be Mark Culpepper, General Manager of Global Solar Solutions at Dronebase.

Canadian energy storage specialist Discover Battery has developed a new lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery storage system for residential off-grid solar, home backup power, and microgrids.
The Element system has a nominal voltage of 51.2 V and a capacity of 100 Ah. A single battery module has a capacity of 5.12 kWh, measures 497 mm x 439 mm x 133.5 mm, and weighs in at 44 kg. It comes with a 10-year warranty.
“Element ESS battery modules are manufactured with the highest-grade cobalt-free LiFePO4 cells for reliability and long life,” the manufacturer said. “Discover’s GEN-4, high-current [battery management system (BMS)] delivers superior peak power for demanding loads and lightning-fast 1 C charge and discharge rates.”
The battery discharges in ambient temperatures between -20 C and 55 C, and charges at temperatures between 0 C and 45 C.
“Element ESS battery modules are available with an optional BMS-managed heat mat that allows for operation in cold climates,” Discovery Battery stated on its website.
Up to six battery modules can be stacked to reach 30.72 kWh of capacity. Discovery Battery offers indoor and outdoor enclosures to store the battery modules. Up to four enclosures can be connected in parallel to reach 120 kWh.
The new product is IP20 rated and UL9540A tested. It is awaiting UL1973 and UL9540-BESS certification for the North American market. Discovery Battery is presenting the Element energy storage system at Intersolar North America, taking place in California from Feb. 14 to Feb. 16.

While heat pumps have had a reputation as not providing enough heat in cold climates and being expensive, the technology behind heat pumps has changed and costs have come down. A study conducted by an international research team found that residential solar paired with heat pumps outperforms propane in cold, isolated climates. Heat pumps are already cost-competitive with gas boilers in some mature heating markets, according to the “Future of Heat Pumps” report, which was recently published by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The United States, Canada, Japan, Italy and China are among the countries in which unsubsidized heat pumps are already cost-competitive with gas boilers, according to the IEA.
Valentin Software GmbH specializes in software for the design of photovoltaic, solar thermal and heat pump systems. Long known for its PV*SOL, T*SOL products, the company released GeoT*SOL for planning and designing heat pump systems.
GeoT*SOL offers the choice between different heat sources, operating modes and numerous system configurations for your location. Based on a dynamic minute simulation, electricity consumption, annual performance factors, operating costs and other system data can be calculated, taking into account blocking periods and tariffs. GeoT*SOL offers choices between different heat sources (soil, air and groundwater), operating modes (monovalent, monoenergetic and bivalent) and numerous system configurations for given locations. The program allows for bivalent systems with boiler as heat generator as well as the integration of solar thermal systems and photovoltaic systems. GeoT*SOL results can be incorporated into the project report for the client.
In the newly released program version GeoT*SOL 2023, the trend toward sector coupling is covered with the integration of a photovoltaic system. The annual simulation of the PV system is based on the calculation core of the sister program PV*SOL and provides detailed results on self-consumption and the degree of self-sufficiency. Heat pump, heating rod, source-side pumps and solar circuit pumps can be selected as electrical appliances for the generated energy of the PV system. Self-consumption can be optimized by increasing and decreasing the hot water storage temperatures, Valentin reports.
The simulation of the heat pump and PV system provides dozens of simulation results (data series) on an hourly basis. With GeoT*SOL 2023, these can be displayed and evaluated as dynamic, configurable diagrams. Valentin says the diagrams can be configured extensively: from the display range (1 day to 1 year) and the resolution (hours to months) of the diagram, to the color and shape (bars, lines, points) of the individual data series. The configurations can be saved as a profile and reused for further projects. Selected diagrams can be conveniently integrated into the project report for the client.
GeoT*SOL 2023 includes new features and updates over previous versions including enabling simulation of geothermal plant systems with photovoltaics to determine how much solar energy can be used to cover the electrical loads (heat pump, heating rod, source-side pumps and solar circuit pump). PV energy self-consumption can also be optimized by increasing and/or decreasing the storage temperature. And the user has the ability to create user-defined diagrams in different temporal resolutions. The program’s internal help function has also been changed to an online help to enable faster updating and adaptation to user questions. A free 30-day trial is available on the GeoT*SOL product page.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/07/multi-unit-housing-ev-chargers-participate-in-demand-response-program/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,CANADA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",Multi-unit housing EV chargers participate in demand response program,"As more electric vehicles enter the global market, grid infrastructure and new capacity always becomes a hot topic. For EV chargers not in use, why not allow them to provide grid flexibility by putting power into the grid during peak power consumption times of the day?
This week EV charging network company SWTCH Energy partnered with demand response technology company AutoGrid to integrate 250 EV chargers in a multi-tenant property portfolio into an active demand response program in Canada. This partnership marks the first time that a North American utility will incorporate multi-unit residential building chargers into its demand response programs.
Demand response is a technology-enabled conservation system for electric power involving shifting or shedding electricity during peak demand periods. Demand response works in two ways: price-based programs, which use price signals and tariffs to incentivize consumers to use less electricity, and incentive-based programs that pay consumers directly. As utilities pledge to cut carbon emissions, the global demand response market is expected to hit $1.07 billion by 2025.
AutoGrid’s Flex platform processes data from millions of distributed generation assets simultaneously and forecasts demand patterns, helping utilities automate distributed energy management. With this platform SWTCH Energy’s EV chargers can participate in AutoGrid’s demand response programs, adjusted remotely for brief periods, helping manage demand on the electric grid.
“North American energy infrastructure is coming under tremendous pressure, making the introduction of turnkey, efficiency-boosting measures more important than ever,” said Carter Li, co-founder and chief executive officer of SWTCH Energy. “With AutoGrid’s proven experience as a leading DERMS provider, we look forward to a successful launch in Canada and a rapid expansion across North America.”
While this type of demand response program is gaining traction throughout the single-family home category, multi-tenant building assets remain an untapped resource. The partnership between SWTCH and AutoGrid sets a precedent for DERMS providers and utilities across the continent at a time when the need for energy resilience is more dire than ever.
A similar demand response platform was initiated in mid-2020, with EnergyHub, using Sunrun, Tesla and Vivint Solar PV and batteries. In another, National Grid and its Connected Solutions program deployed a demand response platform providing customers a “bring your own battery” approach. The utility was able to call up to 60 DR “events” over a summer, each lasting up to three hours.
After Winter Storm Uri in early 2021, Texas saw an increase in the number of back-up generator installations precisely to address power insecurity. While wind and solar have been growing with the help of subsidies and ever-evolving power trading arbitrage, there have been an increasing number of demand response dispatches by ERCOT. Some of these dispatches have lasted little more than an hour, some have lasted for around 100 hours (like during winter storm Uri). While they shed power, and while they were offline, 1 MW in some programs paid almost $1.0 million per MW for just that week.
Founded in 2016, SWTCH is a Toronto-based EV charging network company that has raised about $17.5 million in growth funding to date from Aligned Climate Capital, Active Impact Investments, Landmark Management, Silicon Valley Bank, Elemental Energy  and IBI Group.
SWTCH Energy operates a network of 3,000 Level 2 (AC) and DC fast charging stations in the U.S. and Canada.
Founded in 2010, AutoGrid was acquired in mid-2022 by Schneider Electric after raising $161 million in growth funding. The company’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and Distributed Energy Resources Management (DERMS) platform offers a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-fuel dependent backup power plants by managing and deploying additional untapped capacity from batteries, EVs and flexible load.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/07/california-coalition-calls-for-rto-in-the-west/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 7, 2023",California coalition calls for RTO in the West,"The “Lights on California” coalition was launched by well-known names in the clean energy industry as well as environmental advocates. The group is committed to expanding renewable energy cooperation across the West, and it intends to raise awareness of the state’s options for a more affordable, reliable clean energy grid through participation in a regional transmission organization (RTO).
An RTO is an independent, membership-based, non-profit organization that operates multi-state electricity grids, oversees regional wholesale electricity markets, and provides reliability planning for the region.
“The entire Western U.S. continues to grapple with extreme heat, fires, and a diminishing water supply. All of which impact the reliability of our energy system. We simply cannot afford to be left behind as the rest of the West looks for regional solutions that will enhance reliability,” says Brady Van Engelen, policy advocate on energy and climate for the California Chamber of Commerce. “An RTO is clearly one of the best ways to deliver it, providing a framework for tapping into vast wind, solar, and other reliable, low-cost clean energy supplies across the West, while creating more high-paying jobs for Californians.”
The coalition notes that today, 80% of energy customers in the West are served by utilities with net-zero carbon energy mandates. With the shift away from fossil fuels, California has a new opportunity to work with its neighbors to overcome its energy challenges by participating at the RTO level. Five western states have passed laws requiring participation in an RTO or are actively engaged in RTO discussions. Meanwhile, an existing RTO, the Arkansas-based Southwest Power Pool, is asking western states to join. The coalition argues it would rather have California lead a western RTO effort than risk being isolated from one.

While California has led the nation in setting ambitious 100% clean energy targets, the annual threats of summer blackouts and spiking winter heating costs continue to highlight just how much more clean power will be needed to keep the lights on and energy bills affordable. One recent state analysis found California will need to increase by nearly five-fold the amount of renewable energy it brings online each year to achieve 100% clean energy by 2045. Building the necessary amount of wind and solar power to meet this demand, another study found, would require 6,280 square miles—an area bigger than the State of Connecticut, and likely more land than California has available.
The “Lights On California” coalition is concerned about clean energy solutions both within and beyond California, as the west is one of the only regions in the country without shared governance of the regional power grid to help bring clean energy resources online. In other parts of the country, seven RTOs cover about half of U.S. states and meet two-thirds of national energy demand—helping coordinate energy reliability planning, manage wholesale electricity markets, and effectively operate electricity grids across state lines. Out west, 38 different balancing authorities manage the region’s energy grid, according to the coalition.
“An RTO is a critical building block to integrate and coordinate the long-term transmission planning and investments necessary to boost renewable power development and achieve California’s clean energy goals reliably and affordably, said Alex Jackson, director of American Clean Power-California.
California imports nearly a third of its power, and it depends on out-of-state clean energy in times of need. During the September 2022 heatwave, for example, CAISO reported that California kept the lights on by importing 7,500 MW of hydropower from the Pacific Northwest when smoky air from wildfires hampered solar production. The coalition notes, however, that energy margins were thin as market barriers prevented the state from tapping additional clean power from Arizona and New Mexico.
The coalition believes that an RTO can help California avoid future energy emergencies, allowing grid managers to work more closely with neighboring states to plan energy deliveries further ahead, deliver power reliably and at lower cost, invest in new solar, wind, and other resources, and build the interstate transmission lines needed to connect far-flung renewable projects with consumers. A new report from Advanced Energy United concludes an RTO of 11 western states would save Californians up to $563 million in annual energy bill savings, create 138,700 new high-paying jobs (averaging $91,000 in annual compensation), produce $21.7 billion in economic growth, and accelerate 470 MW of new clean energy construction.
To better understand the state’s regional energy options, the California legislature has requested a report in February from CAISO and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on how an RTO can help California achieve its energy and environmental goals. The report is the result of a resolution, ACR 188, which passed unanimously by the Assembly and Senate last year. A draft of the CAISO/NREL report released in January found “California’s goals for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction can be achieved faster and with less cost to Californians through expanded regional cooperation.”
“California can and should develop all of the renewable resources it can within its borders, but that won’t be enough to stay ahead of climate change,” said Victoria Rome, director of California Government Affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.  “An RTO is the structure the West needs to plan and invest in the modern transmission system that can make our clean energy future possible.”
As the legislature considers how best to act on the CAISO/NREL findings, the coalition will be raising awareness on the benefits of an RTO for consumers, businesses, workers, and the environment.
“It was brave when California stood alone in committing to a clean energy future. That time has passed, and we are fortunate to have a lot of company,” said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies.  “Now our shared success depends on finding ways to cooperate to deliver the clean power Californians and our neighbors are going to depend on for years to come.”

These additional units bring the facility to 25 MWh of storage capacity (DC), coupled with a 3 MW solar array.
The group says that it is the largest operational UL 9540-certified energy storage system in the world. A quick online search suggests that the next largest second-life EV battery facilities are in the single digital megawatt-hour range, suggesting this could be the largest second-life EV battery facility.
Image: B2U Energy Storage Solutions
The company has a video showing the power facility, along with the insides – and some light technical data. There are 24 Clarity battery packs per container, totaling about 456 kWh per unit.
The company’s gear can work with any EV battery, and has been tested successfully with Tesla Model 3 and GM Bolt battery packs.
When asked by pv magazine USA what kind of strategies the company uses to source their batteries, B2U said:
“Working directly with auto OEMs, EV fleet operators, dismantling companies and others to source batteries when automotive use is complete. Reuse is complementary to recycling by maximizing the residual value of the battery before all batteries are recycled when second life viability is complete.”
The California solar-plus-storage facility completed 2020 with 4 MWh power capacity, and added 6 MWh in 2021. Gradually, another 15 MWh was added through 2022 and early 2023, bringing the site to its current 25 MWh capacity. There’s an additional 2 MWh of capacity potential at this power plant.
One might begin to be able to project what volume of power grid capacity could come from formerly operational EVs based upon car retirement projections. EV battery capacity is projected to outpace power grid needs, including standalone energy storage.
An analysis by Lazard suggests that by 2030, 90% of lithium batteries might initially be installed in vehicles. Benchmark Materials shows greater than 8 TWh/year of global lithium ion manufacturing capacity announcements by 2031. On average, humans consume approximately 2.4 TWh of electricity every 24 hours.
If the United States’ future vehicle fleet of 300 million units were electrified, at an average 50 kWh per vehicle, that would put 15 TWh of energy storage on the roads. Averaged over the course of a year, the U.S. uses around 11 TWh of electricity every 24 hours.

B2U has two types of car batteries at the facility: some made by Nissan, and the rest by Honda. The Honda Clarity is a plug-in hybrid with a 181 HP motor and 17 kWh battery. This model is no longer being produced.
There is a secondary market for used EV batteries that are in working condition. A search for Nissan Leaf pricing found a Wall Street Journal article stating, “Battery packs from a first-generation Nissan LEAF were sold for an average of $130 per kilowatt hour in 2021—roughly $3,500 for a 24 kilowatt-hour model—according to Circular Energy Storage Research and Consulting.”
This article was amended to change 1300 batteries to 750 from both Honda and Nissan vehicles.
