For example, energy storage is projected to add 59.2 more gigawatts by 2026. Similarly, others are estimating that the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will result in 13 percent of U.S. homes installing solar by 2030. Efficiently and rapidly integrating and operating DERs present many challenges and opportunities. Whether it’s integrated control systems that allow DERs to support grid reliability or providing needed cyber and physical security, the energy industry has much to tackle to fully leverage the decarbonization and grid resilience benefits of grid-edge resources. 
The critical role of independent, data-driven research 
Those topics and more were discussed at the recent Distributech International conference, which brought together thousands of leaders from utilities, equipment manufacturers, regulators, and other stakeholders involved in the clean energy transition. 
During the keynote session of the conference, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced a competition that challenged applicants to produce the most effective probabilistic net-load forecasts for substations with high solar penetration. Probabilistic net-load forecasts have the potential to be an effective tool to integrate large amounts of renewable generation. Submissions to the competition will be evaluated using EPRI’s Solar Forecast Arbiter software tool and top-ranked entrants will receive monetary awards from the DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office.   
In many ways, the Solar Forecast Arbiter tool reflects how Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) approaches its role in facilitating efficient and effective integration and operation of DERs throughout the power system. The open-source software provides a transparent, standardized, research-supported tool to develop repeatable, impartial, and auditable evaluations of DER forecasts that stakeholders can rely on to guide investment and operational decisions. At the same time, EPRI has created a Solar Forecast Arbiter User Group to bring together stakeholders and serve as a forum for shared learnings about forecasting across industry. 
The same independent, data-driven approach guides all EPRI DER-related research, some of which was demonstrated at EPRI’s Distributech booth and discussed on conference panels. For instance, EPRI subject matter experts participated in panels such as “The Role of Grid Forming Inverters in Inverter Dominated Power Systems and Demonstrating Interoperability: Optimizing the Value of Data Across the Distribution Utility”. 
Connecting research and collaboration to the real world 
Collaboration and real-world experience are two important sources of insights EPRI brought to these and other DER-related discussions. For example, EPRI recently facilitated critical industry collaboration in preparation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 2222. That rule directs independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) to develop the rules and procedures needed to enable aggregated DER to participate in wholesale electricity markets. 
EPRI provided a forum for DER aggregators, ISOs, DSOs, state regulators, and others to work together to sort out the methods, tools, and interactions needed to enable DER participation in wholesale markets. That work has continued and has been informed and fortified by additional collaborative research and lessons from the field. The research has been focused on important topics, like data exchanges and the proper valuation of DERs participating in markets. 
Last year EPRI released a report, TSO-DSO Coordination Functions for DER, which is the result of the working group’s years of effort. The report is a comprehensive menu of information, controls and monitoring interactions and functions that can be assembled to create a coordination framework suited to an individual region’s rules and market conditions. The functions outlined provide the knowledge necessary to define the roles and responsibilities each party must embrace to successfully coordinate large numbers of DERs. 
Research, develop, deploy, learn, and repeat 
Coordination that fully leverages the decarbonization benefits of DERs, while also maintaining grid reliability, requires new tools. For example, EPRI has led the development of specifications for distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) software that can be used to manage DERs so that a greater number of assets can be integrated without negatively impacting power quality or requiring expensive grid upgrades.  
EPRI also partnered with the New York energy provider Central Hudson Gas & Electric and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to test the capacity of DERMS to manage DER when grid voltage levels rise too high or when reverse power flows near a transformer’s rated capacity. The project also builds on past EPRI modeling studies showing how DERMS can increase the minimum hosting capacity on the distribution system.  
Among the most important lessons are about the costs and benefits of DERMS, the necessary DERMS logic to manage DERs, and the information that must be shared between DERs and the energy provider’s system operators. These and other lessons are included in an EPRI report about the requirements energy providers may need when implementing a DERMS solution. 
Clearly, there are many capabilities that must be developed and implemented to tap the full potential of grid edge resources. But experience has demonstrated the benefits of moving forward collaboratively and with the guidance of research-based and field-tested insights.

By acquiring substantially all of the assets of Portsmouth, N.H.-based NHSolarGarden.com LLC, Luminia picks up a community solar portfolio totaling more than 218 MW of projects.  The company’s founder Andrew Kellar will join Luminia as vice president, development, as part of the transaction.
“New Hampshire Solar Garden has been an incredible partner and influential leader in establishing successful community solar projects across the Northeast,” said David Field, chief executive officer of Luminia. “As we continue to scale our community solar business, we are thrilled to welcome Andrew to our team to lead our internal origination strategy – directly and in partnership with co-development partners and strategic off-takers in key markets.”
To date the New Hampshire company has installed projects across New England, New York and New Jersey. The developer was the first to offer community solar offtake solutions in New Hampshire at a large scale. Its founder was instrumental in convincing municipalities to serve as offtake backstops for community solar assets, spearheading financing and fostering innovation in the region.
Besides its Northeast project pipeline, the company also has 140 MW of development assets for installation in Puerto Rico, for which this week the Department of Energy announced $1 billion in federal funding to procure new residential, community solar and energy storage projects across the island in the coming years.
“Having been part of the Northeast community solar development since its inception more than a decade ago, I am excited to share my perspective and build credibility with Luminia’s developer partners,” said Kellar. “Having been on the developer side, I know first-hand how Luminia allowed me to spend the majority of my day doing what I love, with the platform and people-support to tackle the financial and legal aspects of deals that occupied so much of my former capacity.”
Community solar is a growing market segment within the solar industry, with support from federal policies including the Biden Administration and the Department of Energy’s community solar pilot programs, and the Inflation Reduction Act’s ten-year, 30% ITC extension.
Luminia’s acquisition of New Hampshire Solar Garden will help support the growing demand for new community solar projects by providing financing and technology solutions for the deployment of community solar projects at a larger scale.
Formed in 2019, Luminia closed 2022 with over $2.5 billion in commercial solar financing requests across the U.S., representing close to 200 MW of commercial solar projects, with a development pipeline of 600 MW of additional projects.
In 2022, Luminia (formerly SD Renewables), offered financing solutions that catered to commercial property owners across 36 states. Its solutions range from multi-family and industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) portfolios to private education institutions and agricultural projects.
The company enables property owners to gain access to a range of sustainability and asset value improvements, such as EV charging infrastructure and water conservation improvements. The projects it supports vary in size and scope to meet state and municipal requirements, with an average project size of 9.5 MW. The five key markets for the company are Massachusetts, New York, Maine, New Hampshire and New Jersey.
“By eliminating the financing barriers that once hindered commercial solar progress, we are experiencing explosive demand from our top rated solar partners, especially in the burgeoning community solar space,” said David Field, chief executive officer and co-founder of Luminia.
Luminia’s solution was recently launched on Energy Toolbase’s  ETB Developer platform, which helps developers to access power purchase agreement quotes and additional financing options that are intended to match their customers’ needs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/22/inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-23-9-efficiency-high-durability/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,CANADA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023","Inverted perovskite solar cell achieves 23.9% efficiency, high durability","From pv magazine global
A U.S.-Canadian research team has fabricated an inverted perovskite solar cell by using Lewis base molecules for surface passivation. Lewis bases are generally used in perovskite solar research to passivate surface defects in the perovskite layer. This has positive effects on energy level alignment, interfacial recombination kinetics, hysteresis behavior, and operational stability.
“Lewis basicity, which is inversely proportional to electronegativity, is expected to determine the binding energy and the stabilization of interfaces and grain boundaries,” the scientists said, noting that the molecules proved to be highly efficient in creating strong bonding between the cell layers at the interface level. “A Lewis base molecule with two electron-donating atoms can potentially bind and bridge interfaces and ground boundaries, offering the potential to enhance the adhesion and strengthen the mechanical toughness of perovskite solar cells.”
The scientists used a diphosphine Lewis base molecule known as 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (DPPP) to passivate one of the most promising halide perovskites – the formamidinium lead iodide known as FAPbI3 – for use in a cell’s absorber layer.

They deposited the perovskite layer on a DPPP-doped hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx). They observed that some DPPP molecules redissolved and segregated at both the perovskite/NiOx interface and the perovskite surface regions, and that the crystallinity of the perovskite film improved. They said this step enhanced the mechanical toughness of the perovskite/NiOx interface.
The researchers built the cell with a substrate made of glass and tin oxide (FTO), the HTL based on NiOx, a layer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer, the perovskite layer, a thin layer of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, and a metal contact made of silver (Ag).
The team compared the performance of the DPPP-doped solar cell with a reference device that didn’t go through the treatment. The doped cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V and a fill factor of 82%. The undoped device reached an efficiency of 22.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.11 V and a fill factor of 79%.
“The improvement on fill factor and open-circuit voltage confirmed the reduction in defect density at the NiOx /perovskite front interface after DPPP treatment,” the scientists said.
The researchers also built a doped cell with an active area of 1.05 cm2 that achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 23.9% and showed no degradation after 1,500 h.
“With DPPP, under ambient conditions – that is, no additional heating – the overall power conversion efficiency of the cell stayed high for approximately 3,500 hours,” said researcher Chongwen Li. “The perovskite solar cells that have been previously published in the literature tend to see a significant drop in their efficiency after 1,500 to 2,000 hours, so this is a big improvement.”
The group, which recently applied for a patent for the DPPP technique, presented the cell tech in “Rational design of Lewis base molecules for stable and efficient inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science. The team includes academics from the University of Toronto in Canada, as well as scientists from the University of Toledo, the University of Washington, and Northwestern University in the United States.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/22/50-states-of-solar-incentives-south-dakota/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH DAKOTA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: South Dakota,"South Dakota, home of the Badlands, Mount Rushmore, roaming buffalo and the Sioux Native American Tribe, could conjure images of supple rolling hills ideal for ground-mounted solar panels. But the land ranks last in the nation for solar development in terms of active capacity. South Dakota has less solar installed than Alaska, which sits at a higher latitude, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The Dakotas are historic coal and natural gas regions, where one of its major utilities, Black Hills, now operates 1.48 GW of generation assets, of which 27% is coal-fired, 51% is oil and gas, and 19% is wind power, compared to a decade ago when its fleet was 63% coal-fired. But Black Hills’ South Dakota and Wyoming Integrated Resource Plan now includes 120 MW of clean energy resources by 2025, which includes 100 MW of wind or solar generation, and 20 MW of energy storage divided equally across the two states.
According to SEIA, South Dakota is projected to add 246 MW of solar resources over the next five years, though that momentum is still may not move the needle compared to other states across the Midwest and Midcontinent region as state has seen just $5 million in aggregate investment in recent years.
South Dakota generated 3.22 GW of renewable energy in 2021, ranking the state 23rd in the country thanks mainly to its abundant wind resources, with 54% of its electricity from renewable energy resources, according to the American Clean Power Association. Solar, however, exists just a few select pockets of the state, with the greatest solar resources in the southwest corner. Just half of its current 2 MW solar generation is from customer-sited and small-scale systems.
Incentives
Like North Dakota and Montana, South Dakota no longer has an active renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Its previous RPS expired in 2015 and has since not been renewed. The former RPS called for just 10% of the state’s retail energy mix to come from renewable energy such as wind, solar or biomass.
Although the state does not have a net metering mechanism, property owners could see some relief when it comes to taxes. South Dakota offers a property tax credit for homeowners who have installed solar panels. The property tax allows for the exemption of real property tax on the first $50,000 or 70% of the assessed value of the solar system, whichever is greater.
Some solar companies have the option of offering net metering, though it is currently not mandated by the state.
Notable project
Located in Hughes County, the Pierre Solar Farm is the state’s lone utility solar project, generating 1 MW of electricity, enough to power over 134 South Dakota homes. Municipal utility cooperative Missouri River Energy Services has purchased power from the solar array built in October 2016 by Geronimo Energy, now a part of National Grid Renewables. The facility utilizes 30-degree fixed tilt solar panels, with 4,284 multi-crystalline 315-Watt panels installed over 8.9 acres using 42 24kW string inverters, according to the local utility’s website.
In September 2022, Greenbacker Renewable Energy raised $186 million in debt facilities for the construction of two solar projects, one of which is Fall River Solar, a proposed 80 MW facility in Fall River County, S.D.  Fall River had been the subject of litigation over the avoided cost of the project related to Black Hills, with litigation between developer Energy of Utah, LLC and Black Hills related to the avoided cost of the project dating back to 2016. Despite the utility’s purchase of the Fall River project, then at 52 MW nameplate capacity, the utility abandoned plans for construction of the facility by mid-2019.
The revamped Fall River Solar project at 80 MW comprises 80% of Black Hills’ multi-year renewable energy portfolio of 100 MW of new projects in South Dakota and Wyoming.  The Greenbacker and Borrego project is anticipated to become operational in early 2023.
Community solar
With six investor owned utilities and more than 24 rural electric cooperatives, community solar represents an option for providing low-cost clean energy to its population of 895,000.
One electric cooperative, Sioux Valley Energy, is planning to a community solar array that will be located at the Colman, SD service center. The array will use 140 panels with a total capacity of 60 kW. Members of the cooperative will be able to purchase the output of one or more panels for $1,000 over a 20-year subscription where the output will be credited to their monthly electric bill.   Sioux Valley Energy services nine towns in southeast South Dakota and seven towns in western Minnesota.
Black Hills Energy currently has its own community solar developments in the works in Colorado, but has not yet stated plans for community solar in its South Dakota service territory. Calls to Black Hills’ media group were not returned as of publication.
The utility provides electric and gas services to 1.3 million customers in eight states, and has plans of reducing electric power emissions by 70% by 2040, thanks to the conversion or retirement of additional coal-fired resources. Through 2021 the utility achieved 33% emissions reductions by retiring 123.3 MW of coal and adding 289 MW of wind power resources.  The utility has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions across its gas infrastructure network by 2035 by replacing its gas pipeline, using carbon capture systems and leak detection.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/22/in-a-saturated-market-energy-storage-emerges-as-a-silver-bullet/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023","In a saturated market, energy storage emerges as a silver bullet","We are expected to see low-carbon energy sources generate a record share of the world’s electricity within the next few years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). But despite increased momentum and recent progress, our nation’s clean energy goals are still an arm’s length out of reach. The question remains: what is needed to reach our clean energy goals? The answer: pairing renewable energy projects with energy storage.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is set to bolster renewable development. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts new solar and wind projects coming online this year will account for 16% of total generation in 2023—which is up from 14% last year.
While the country pushes for a cleaner and greener energy future, it’s important to keep in mind that renewables, like wind and solar, won’t break our nation’s fossil fuel habit on their own. As such, energy storage emerges as a silver bullet to increase the utilization of intermittent renewable resources and is becoming more important as wind and solar generation saturates markets.
Overcoming intermittent challenges
The challenge, of course, is that renewable energy sources are fundamentally intermittent, and their generation output is not consistently available in the same way fossil fuel fired generation is. But energy storage can support renewables like wind, hydro and solar power, enabling them to be reliable and persistent sources of energy. By pairing renewables with storage, the grid and grid operators have more flexibility as intermittent renewable energy can be dispatched on demand.
When coupled together, storage projects boost the overall value of renewable energy projects. For instance, when energy storage is paired with say, solar PV, it increases the average value of solar energy sold to the grid. Energy storage can also play a part in managing curtailment, by reducing energy losses and helping to de-risk a project at the development phase. Rather than the deliberate reduction of energy in order to balance real-time supply and demand, energy can be stored and, thus, provide renewable project owners and operators with a way to retain project profitability by reducing or eliminating curtailments.
Furthermore, pairing energy storage with renewable energy projects can save on permitting, planning and construction costs—when compared to developing the projects separately—which is essential for getting clean energy projects online and ultimately achieving clean energy goals.
Boosting grid reliability
While the intermittent nature of renewables could challenge grid reliability, energy storage provides valuable grid services, such as voltage support and frequency regulation, which are critical to maintaining a safe and reliable grid.
Energy storage is also a backup power source during outages, which have increasingly become more of a problem due to grid instability and extreme climate events. Just consider the Texas electrical grid for example. Since the deep freeze in 2021, which caused wide-scale electricity outages, the search for solutions to assist grid stability during extreme weather remains at the forefront of discussions. During periods of peak demand, energy storage can help boost grid reliability and can take pressure off utilities and system operators.
Curbing electricity costs
Just recently, due to an increase in fuel prices and demand, Americans have experienced higher-than-normal spikes in household energy costs. In fact, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Winter Fuels Outlook, the average U.S. household expenditures are expected to increase by 10% for electricity throughout this winter.
By relying on only fossil fuel supply, utilities and system operators are challenged to meet peak demand in a cost-effective manner. Fossil fuel prices are highly volatile; particularly at times of high demand like during cold snaps. Rather than continuing to rely on this highly volatile and polluting fuel, investment in renewable energy projects coupled with energy storage make it possible for a more environmentally prudent supply of electricity to meet peak power loads, while also keeping costs down.
Additionally, building energy storage facilities can help avoid the cost of expensive transmission and distribution (T&D) build-outs. These non-wire alternatives, which are being supported by utilities and regulators throughout the country, can help avoid spending millions of dollars on development and construction. Storage is just as capable of meeting a few hours of peak demand at a much lower cost to electricity consumers. And when T&D build-outs are swapped in favor of storage facility development, those T&D funds can be reallocated toward projects to help further integrate renewable energy project development.
The bottom line is that with increased energy storage and renewables adoption comes a new industry with the benefits of high-investment segments: job creation, innovations, technologies and more. But first, it’s important to note that energy storage, not just solar or wind farms, will be critical in reaching the nation’s renewable energy goals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/22/ohio-honda-dealership-goes-solar-with-120kw-rooftop-system/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,OHIO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023",Ohio Honda dealership goes solar with 120kW rooftop system,"Freedom Solar Power, a  residential and commercial solar installer, recently completed a 120.3 kW rooftop solar array for Parkway Auto Group’s Dover, Ohio dealership.  The dealership location utilizes a 7,038 square foot solar system consisting of 248 panels, producing 120.3 kW of on-site power, creating $378,000 of energy savings over the next two decades. Each year, Parkway Honda will reduce its carbon footprint by over 91.9 metric tons of CO2, the equivalent of 1,516 trees planted and 20 cars taken off the road.
This solar initiative by Parkway Honda clears the way for future solar installments at Parkway dealerships as the company strives to become 75% sustainable energy powered in the near future with on-site clean energy.
“Parkway Honda’s partnership with Freedom Solar is making waves as one of Ohio’s premier solar installations in the automotive industry,” said Bret Biggart, chief executive officer of Freedom Solar. “We are proud to partner with them in making their business more energy-efficient and helping them become one step closer to their sustainable goals.”
“We are one of the first dealerships in the county to go solar and we are proud to be leading the way within Dover and Tuscarawas County (Ohio),” said Mark C. Mears, partner, Parkway Honda. “By diminishing our carbon footprint, we are achieving advantages never seen before rather than just reducing our electricity bill.”
The decision to go solar impacts a wide range of components beyond electricity bills, the car dealership said. Mears pointed to several factors in the company’s decision to move forward with the conversion to on-site power generation. Some of the factors included:
As a participant in the Honda Green Dealer Program, Parkway Honda strives to implement green initiatives within the dealership network, including battery storage. Parkway Honda is working to reduce its energy usage while upgrading its operations to become more sustainable.
“Installing solar has become a cost-reduction strategy for entrepreneurial automotive dealers and is growing rapidly amongst dealerships nationwide,” said Biggart.
Since 2020, the solar investment tax credit (ITC) has been a major driver for U.S. organization’s decision to go solar.
Freedom Solar’s commercial installation group includes automotive dealerships, providing turn-key solar generation systems for U.S. dealerships.
According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), energy costs can be a dealership’s third-highest overhead operating expense due to long operating hours and energy-intensive showrooms and car lots. With rising energy costs over the last year, many dealerships are turning to solar power to mitigate their high energy expenditures and ensure electricity reliability.
“From a financial standpoint, going solar was an extremely smart investment,” said Mears. “Switching to solar power also demonstrates our commitment to environmental sustainability, which is an integral aspect of our company that we consistently strive towards.”
Ohio currently has over 916 MW of solar installed, ranking 26th in the country, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Solar provides 0.9% of Ohio’s electricity, but that is expected to change, as SEIA’s projection is that nearly 8.8 GW of solar will be installed over the next five years, making Ohio one of the top five solar states in the country.
Founded in 2007, Freedom Solar is an Austin, Texas-based licensed installer of SunPower modules and Tesla Powerwall battery systems, and has installed over 154 MW of assets to date. The company has operations in Texas, Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio. The company has installed solar arrays for auto dealerships including Honda, BMW, Subaru and Toyota.

After recent hurricanes and decades of underinvestment in the island’s electric grid, the new funding will be developed to increase energy resilience and reduce the energy burden on the Caribbean island’s vulnerable residents. The U.S. investment also aligns with Puerto Rico’s public energy policy to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050 as well as the Biden Administration’s commitment to improving the island’s energy system.
After Hurricane Fiona, in October 2022 President Joseph Biden visited the island and committed to leveraging the technical support of Federal agencies to support improvements to Puerto Rico’s electric grid. Then in December, Biden signed the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act into law, which includes $1 billion for the PR-ERF funding to drive key investments in renewable and resilient energy infrastructure in Puerto Rico.
The PR-ERF package will be managed by the Grid Deployment Office in consultation with the Federal Energy Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The agency is requesting information from Puerto Rican stakeholders about both short- and long-term energy solutions including residential rooftop solar deployment, community and critical service energy resilience, non-profit partnerships, and workforce training to sustain the island’s clean energy economy.
The PR-ERF calls for at least two rounds of funding:

“For far too long, Puerto Ricans have endured an unreliable and expensive electric system with frequent blackouts due to catastrophic weather events and aging infrastructure,” said Agustín Carbó, Director of the Puerto Rico Grid Modernization and Recovery Team. “This historic investment will be transformative for many Puerto Rican families, keeping the lights on through power outages, providing peace of mind during hurricane season, and saving them more money and reducing high electric bills with these clean energy solutions.”
Feedback for the PR-ERF process, including identifying priority energy technologies and solutions, eligibility, funding structure, and timing, can be provided to government stakeholders by April 21 at 5 p.m. ET by emailing: PuertoRicoGDO@hq.doe.gov. Initial funding from the program is expected to be administered by the end of 2023.
Earlier this year six U.S. national laboratories described how Puerto Rico could reach 40% renewable energy generation by 2025, as mandated by Puerto Rico’s Act 17. The U.S. territory could reach 36% renewables by 2025 if 3.75 GW of utility-scale solar and 1.5 GW of storage that Puerto Rico has mandated utility authority PREPA to procure were constructed and interconnected by year-end 2025, which would be “very rapid deployment,” the national laboratories said in a report.
Delays at multiple stages have slowed six tranches of planned renewables procurements that the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau mandated PREPA to undertake in an August 2020 order.  While the Energy Bureau ordered requests for proposals for the first five procurements by year-end 2022, only two RFPs have been issued so far to PREPA.
Although Puerto Rico’s Act 17 mandated that PREPA reach 20% renewables by 2022, renewables provided 3% of generation in 2022, said Marisol Bonnet, team lead for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Puerto Rico Energy Recovery Team, during a webinar describing the report by the six national laboratories.
P.J. Wilson, president of the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico, whose group the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico is a participant in the “PR100” initiative that produced the report, said the initiative is a “space for all stakeholders to join minds to define the technical pathways” for Puerto Rico to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2050—the final mandate of Puerto Rico’s Act 17. The PR100 process, he said, also “encourages federal funding to align with Puerto Rico energy policy, local resilience needs and industry best practices.”
