https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/19/as-renewable-ppa-prices-rise-34-relief-from-the-inflation-reduction-act-may-take-time/,"COST AND PRICES,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 19, 2022",Renewable PPA price relief from the Inflation Reduction Act may take time,"Energy costs are on the rise, and this trend applies to renewable energy as well. In its Q3 Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) Price Index Report, LevelTen Energy reported a 9.6% rise in PPA prices in-quarter. LevelTen operates among the world’s largest PPA marketplaces.
LevelTen’s report is based on the average price in major markets at the 25th percentile, called “P25” prices. The P25 price for Q3 2022 was $45.93 per MWh. This represents a 34% increase in P25 PPA prices year-over-year.
The report said following years of price decreases, PPAs have been on a steady climb since 2020. Supply chain problems worsened by the pandemic have upended the broader trend of price decreases.
“The industry has since faced a series of compounding economic, regulatory and permitting challenges that have created an imbalance between PPA supply and demand, and led to an increase in development costs, keeping prices high,” said the report.
This August, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed, which will aid the U.S. market by creating regulatory certainty for the next decade, establishing a long-term Investment Tax Credit. The implementation of the IRA offers possible relief to rising prices, “But it’s too soon to say if and when that will happen,” said Gia Clark, a senior director with LevelTen.
Clark offered three reasons why price relief may take time. First, immediate barriers are not yet removed. While the IRA offers significant incentives, it does not address immediate supply chain constraint issues and interconnection queue congestion problems. Second, development costs are rising. Labor, capital, commodities, and other project inputs continue to increase alongside inflation. Third, demand from corporations and utilities is increasing competition for already limited renewable capacity, pushing up prices.
During Q3, LevelTen reports solar PPA prices rose 7.5% to $42.21 per MWh, while wind increased more sharply by 11.4% at $49.66 per MWh. SEIA reports that shipping and supply chain constraints are a significant pressure on solar projects, causing utility-scale projects to increase 12.7% over last year.
Extreme weather has been a factor in PPA pricing in some U.S. markets. Temperatures exceeding 100 degrees for much of the summer pushed Texas’ ERCOT grid to the limits of its grid and pricing mechanisms by late August. LevelTen said the echoes of 2021’s Winter Storm Uri still lingering, elevated and volatile wholesale prices are likely to continue in the market, putting upward pressure on PPA prices.
Though PPA prices are expected to continue to rise, LevelTen said their value remains compelling. Clark does not recommend waiting for prices to fall to move forward on PPAs.
“Energy buyers who are waiting for prices to drop should know that may not happen in time for them to meet their emissions reduction goals, if it happens at all,” said Clark. “Taking a wait-and-see approach could result in experiencing more competition for PPAs when you’re ready to enter the market. It’s important to remember that PPA prices are only half of the story. As wholesale energy prices continue to rise, so too does PPA value. And the brand value of bringing new clean energy onto the grid has never been higher, as investors, consumers and employees demand climate leadership.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/19/bus-talk-podcast-to-demystify-electric-school-buses/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 19, 2022",Bus Talk podcast to demystify electric school buses,"‘Bus Talk’, inspired by Click & Clack’s Car Talk, intends to be entertaining, informative and educational. The series was launched by Highland Electric Fleets, a provider of school bus fleet electrification-as-a-service in North America, and it features Sean Leach, Director of Technology and Platform Management at Highland, and Tim Shannon, Director of Facilities Planning & Efficiency at Twin Rivers Unified School District in Sacramento, California.
Electrification of the school bus fleet in the United States would be significant in terms of carbon reduction in the atmosphere, as school transportation is the largest mass transit system in the U.S.– a $28 billion industry. With more states following California’s lead and enacting 100% zero-emission transportation mandates, schools face increasing pressure to electrify fleets.
Acknowledging that the process is expensive and can be complex, ‘Bus Talk” plans to provide basic facts and unravels misconceptions about electrification of a school transportation system. With the nation’s fleet of buses currently standing at about a half million, the EPA’s $10 billion Clean School Bus Program (CSBP) and additional incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are not enough to cover full costs of the conversion. So in addition to talking about cost, other topics will include what it really takes to charge a fleet of buses to range anxiety, cost savings, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) use cases.
“If you didn’t care about electric school buses before, you will now,” said Highland Director of Technology and Platform Management Sean Leach. “School buses traditionally have been overlooked, but they can do so much more for your community than just move people around twice a day.”
Highland Electric Fleets provides electrification-as-a-service, which includes managing the planning, bus and charger procurement, infrastructure installation, utility partnerships, electricity, guaranteed performance, and more—all for a fixed annual fee. The company reports that it was the first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) program in Mass. and Vermont, and that it partnered with Montgomery County Public Schools to build the largest electric school bus fleet in North America. Highland currently has over 330 electric school buses under subscription.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/19/proposed-regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-to-compete-for-7-billion-in-doe-funding/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 19, 2022",Proposed regional clean hydrogen hubs to compete for $7 billion in DOE funding,"Teams across the United States plan to compete for $7 billion in U.S Department of Energy funding for up to ten regional clean hydrogen hubs.
Regional hydrogen hubs are a key element of DOE’s draft National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap. DOE’s strategy aims to advance the use of clean hydrogen in industry, heavy-duty transportation, and long-duration energy storage, through regional hubs and by driving innovation, scale and lower costs across the hydrogen supply chain.
In one publicly announced hub project, six Northeastern states and more than 60 clean hydrogen “ecosystem partners,” including EDP Renewables North America, have joined a team led by New York to seek DOE funding. The team aims to build “a robust and connected clean hydrogen market across the Northeast,” said New York Governor Kathy Hochul.
In Texas, the Port of Corpus Christi “has everything we need for a hydrogen hub,” said Jacob Susman, co-founder and CEO of Ambient Fuels. He spoke at September’s RE+ conference on using hydrogen to decarbonize the production of ammonia, chemicals, steel and concrete. The Port of Corpus Christi Authority, Apex Clean Energy, and other parties have been working since February on a green fuels hub.
California’s team promoting a renewable hydrogen hub has grown to a network of more than 100 partners.
Other hydrogen hub proposals, as reported in news stories, are in development for the Great Plains states, in the Midwest, centered in West Virginia, and extending from Oklahoma to Louisiana.
Jigar Shah, director of DOE’s Loan Programs Office, said on Twitter that his office has received “many” hydrogen applications “and looks forward to evaluating all of them. We also need to emphasize that the ecosystem is dominated by growth companies exporting hydrogen. We need to develop more domestic demand for clean hydrogen.”
For regional clean hydrogen hub projects seeking DOE funding, concept papers are due to DOE by November 7.
What is clean?
 Hydrogen can be produced from natural gas, or from water via electrolysis. “Green” hydrogen is produced through electrolysis powered by renewable energy.
 DOE has proposed an initial clean hydrogen production standard of 4 kg CO2-equivalent per kg of hydrogen, “to encourage low-carbon hydrogen production from diverse feedstocks and using state-of-the-art technologies that are expected to be deployable at scale today.”
“For example,” the draft standard says, “a steam methane reformer with ~95% carbon capture and sequestration could achieve ~4.0 kgCO2e/kgH2 lifecycle emissions by using electricity that represents the average U.S. grid mix and ensuring that upstream methane emissions do not exceed 1%. Electrolysis systems that source about 15% of their electricity from the grid and the remainder from clean energy sources could also achieve ~4.0 kgCO2e/kgH2 lifecycle emissions.”
DOE says its proposed clean hydrogen standard of 4.0 kgCO2e/kgH2 may be subject to revision based on stakeholder feedback, with feedback sought by October 20. DOE also noted that “other policies and market forces may incentivize deployments that are cleaner than the targets established.” Once DOE finalizes the standard, it may update the standard within five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/19/salient-energy-zinc-ion-battery-passes-ul-safety-testing/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 19, 2022",Salient Energy zinc-ion battery passes UL safety testing,"Salient Energy successfully completed UL9540A safety testing with Underwriters Laboratories (UL) for its proprietary zinc-ion energy storage battery. The battery is designed as a safer alternative to lithium-ion systems in residential and commercial energy storage applications. Developed by Canadian start-up Salient Energy, the zinc-ion battery has a rated capacity of 60 Ah, a nominal voltage of 1.3 V, and a volumetric energy density of 100 Wh/L. The testing performed by UL showed that zinc-ion cells so not experience thermal runaway nor do they produce toxic or explosive gasses even when subjected to extreme heat, puncture or overcharging.
Salient reports thtat these are the first zinc-ion cells to achieve the UL9540A safety rating, marking a significant step forward in the commercialization of the batteries. UL9540A tests the safety of energy storage systems (ESS) by first determining whether the ESS uses batteries that introduce a risk of fire or explosion. If so, the test then determines whether safety features integrated into the pack and system sufficiently mitigate these risks. As confirmed by the UL9540A results, Salient’s water-based battery is fundamentally incapable of causing the catastrophic failures that occur in lithium-ion based systems. Salient reports that because zinc-ion batteries are the only non-lithium batteries that can match lithium-ion performance with the same compact design, Salient’s technology represents the only drop-in replacement that can remove safety risks in existing ESS designs.
“Solving climate change requires wide-scale deployment of energy storage this decade, but this won’t be possible if energy systems keep erupting in flames and emitting toxic gases,” said Ryan Brown, CEO of Salient Energy. “The industry urgently needs to switch to safe batteries to maintain the public’s enthusiasm for installing batteries in their homes and neighborhoods.”
Zinc-ion batteries achieve this improved safety by using raw materials that are different from those used in lithium-ion batteries. In addition to being safer, zinc-ion materials are far more abundant. Current shortages in key battery materials like lithium have led to rising costs and long delivery times in the ESS industry. Zinc-ion batteries are made primarily from zinc and manganese, which are both produced in abundance in North America.
The main application market that Salient is targeting is stationary energy storage. “Residential yes, but ultimately we want to be in the shipping containers,” Ryan Brown told pv magazine USA. With the main advantage being safety, Brown sees the zinc-ion battery as a viable alternative for batteries that need to be placed indoors, such as in apartment buildings. “A city is not place to put energy storage outdoors, and with California mandating that apartments must have energy storage, zinc-ion is a safe solution.”
Salient’s recently announced a partnership with Horton World Solutions, a sustainable homebuilder that is installing the batteries in 200K homes that it will be constructing in the Dallas Fort Worth area as well as across the Sunbelt. Construction on these homes will be underway by Q4 of 2022.
