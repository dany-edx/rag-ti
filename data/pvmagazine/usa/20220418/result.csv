Rightfully so, overcoming any of these issues will lead to unprecedented improvements in quality of life for those who had no tools to overcome them before, however the full picture of how poverty keeps people trapped in its oppressive cycle goes beyond these core issues.
One such aspect of this issue is energy poverty: a lack of access to electricity for cooking, heating and lighting. Globally, 13% of the population, or approximately one billion people, still do not have reliable access to a modern source of electricity, while roughly 3 billion people live without access to electric-based cooking, cooling, and refrigeration systems.
In both instances, these people must turn to alternatives, often kerosene for lighting and cooking, or a host of other dangerous, inefficient, non-renewable, and downright dangerous sources of fuel, like cow manure, crop waste, or coal. These issues affect Approximately 57% of the population in Africa (600 million people) and 9% of the population in developing Asia (350 million people), and disproportionally affect women and children. According to the World Health Organization, 2.8 million people die prematurely every year, often women and children, from the dangerous effects of pollutive cooking and lighting sources.
In addition to the human tragedy caused by extreme energy poverty, these pollutive cooking and lighting sources amount to 3.6 billion tons of CO2 emissions per year, almost 10% of annual global emissions and 3 ½ times the annual amount produced by the global aviation industry.
In an attempt to bring awareness to the issue of extreme energy poverty and ultimately combat it, Simon Doble, in 2016, founded SolarBuddy, a global impact organization dedicated to illuminating the futures of all children. For the first five years of its existence, SolarBuddy focused on providing clean solar energy solutions for children who do not have access to safe, reliable and carbon-free lighting.
Operating out of Australia, where Doble lives, SolarBuddy is now ready to deliver solar system solutions that transform the lives of families and communities on a larger scale. SolarBuddy is registered as a 501(c) US charity, now looking to emerge from ‘stealth’ mode and maximize the work it can do to end extreme energy poverty.
“We are, in essence, a renewable energy charity, but we provide solar systems to people that need them and align ourselves with a sophisticated, impassioned, and very well developed renewable energies industry in the United States,” said Doble. “It perfectly aligned for us to get into the the industry.”
Children changing lives
Because SolarBuddy has a specific focus on mitigating the effects of extreme energy poverty on children, the organization has designed a two-pronged approach that includes integrated STEM curriculum for schoolchildren in areas of means, Australia thus far, and solar-powered hardware solutions for those living in extreme energy poverty, which all started with a child’s reading light Doble designed himself.
“There’s basically a bedside light for young children, children under the age of 12, who would otherwise be using a kerosene burning wick lantern,” explained Doble. “[We’re] providing them with a little basic solar bedside lamp, one that they can use to study with, they can use to feel safe, one they can turn it on in the middle of the night when they’re scared. Their parents can turn it off when they know they’re safely in bed, all the different things that we provide our children just automatically by living in the house that we live in.”
As SolarBuddy has grown and achieved backing, in some instances from the companies who employ parents of the children who have participated in the organization’s STEM program, so too have Doble’s ambitions of the solutions SolarBuddy can deliver.
“So I sort of started with that, but now we’ve expanded into phone charging devices, into cookstoves, and I’m in the middle of designing a renewable energy refrigeration system,” he continued. “All of it is centered around ending extreme energy poverty, and use of kerosene, dung, firewood, and other forms of fuel that are terribly toxic for the people that are exposed to it, terribly expensive for the people that use it, and ultimately extremely bad for the climate as well.”
One of SolarBuddy’s founding pillars is that education is core to the solution of ending extreme energy poverty. According to the organization’s core mission, education helps to build local awareness and understanding of extreme energy poverty, creates better global citizens, and is the most important factor in creating equitable opportunities for all communities. This is why Doble created the SolarBuddy STEM program as a way to connect children of means with the harsh realities of the world around them, while also showing them the power they have to change that reality.
“I call it social stem,” said Doble. “Where children learn science, technology and engineering around renewable energy, climate change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. They also learned human-centered design and why light is really important, why energy is really important, and why other things are really important, but also what those things mean to other people that don’t have those opportunities and those luxuries in their lives. So there’s a huge empathy element to what we do, and that’s been a real eye opener for me.”
What’s next
According to Doble, while the basic idea of fostering empathy through education has always been at the heart of SolarBuddy, he didn’t anticipate the way that such a sentiment grows when one is actively designing and building a system that will directly help a kid in need, a kid just like them.
“I designed the model without realizing the empathy aspect, because it’s, it’s just part of my nature. But the feedback from the children and the parents and the teachers, etc., is that the children are really becoming so socially aware of their learning about a problem that they never knew anything about. The tools to actually change another child’s life and what that means to them, subsequently, led us into the corporate program, where we had school children going home talking to their moms and dads who are CEOs or company founders, whatever, saying ‘We did this programming in school today. I made a light and it’s gonna go to a child, and that child is going to be able to study in brief in a healthier environment.'”
From there, Doble shares that a number of CEOs and executives in large, difference-making companies have approached him to say “What have you just taught my child? They will not stop talking about SolarBuddy.” Which has led to what he describes as a serendipitous way of growing and engaging. It’s Doble’s hope that this phenomenon will continue as SolarBuddy takes foot in the US, and that the organization will be able to leverage that support into providing more comprehensive energy systems to those in energy poverty both at home and abroad.
While the same levels of extreme energy poverty cited earlier in much of Africa and developing Asia don’t exist so much in the US, insufficient access to reliable, renewable, and affordable energy all plague low- and middle-income families and individuals in the US. It’s Doble’s hope that, in highlighting and working to solve the vast energy inequities that exist abroad, SolarBuddy and its supporters will also be able to solve the ones that still exist in the US, Australia, and throughout the Western world.
“There’s still energy poverty in America, not extreme energy poverty, but there’s still people that can’t afford their bills,” said Doble. “There’s organizations like homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, and low-income schools that need support, and we want to be part of that conversation. We want to tackle this global problem properly and empower enough Americans to put their name to our mission and help us do what we need to do and push us over the line.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/18/headed-to-new-hampshire-on-an-electric-vehicle-demand-charge-holiday/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW HAMPSHIRE",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 18, 2022",Headed to New Hampshire on an electric vehicle demand charge holiday!,"In a bid to motivate the construction of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the state, the Public Utility Commission of New Hampshire has approved a plan from local electric utilities Liberty and Unitil – to offer ‘a temporary demand charge holiday’ for Level 2 & Level 3 electric vehicle charging locations.
The language for the tariffs was found in new legislation from April 7, 2022:
The rate is tailored to serve up to 200 kVA of load, or approximately up to ten Level 2 chargers, each charging at 19.2 kW peak. This rate has three time periods—peak, mid-peak, and off-peak—and has winter and summer rates. All three billing components—distribution, transmission and energy supply—are time varied, and customers must be separately metered. A temporary demand charge holiday is offered for these customers at 75 percent for year 1, 50 percent for year 2, 25 percent for year 3, and ending thereafter.
The language is mostly the same for Level 3 chargers as well, noting that those units range from 50 to 350 kW of peak electrical draw.

State utility Eversource also submitted a more nuanced model that was rejected by the commission as being too complicated. The commission explained that this complex model could potentially backfire, reducing incentives for getting charging infrastructure deployed in the state.
The commission states that there is a challenge in determining how these new assets will affect the system as a whole. The docket shows that the utilities implementing these new rate schedules must report on the costs of new charging stations installed, as well as the impacts those stations will have on ratepayers.
The goal is for the implementation of time of use electricity rates to raise some awareness of peak grid demand periods. If enough people alter their EVs’ charging schedules as a result, the reductions in peak demand may be sufficient to avoid grid upgrade costs, as EV charging broadly expands across the state.
Members of The New England Convenience Store & Energy Marketers Association, Inc. see a great opportunity for their businesses to host these units. However, they point out that “users of publicly accessible charging equipment cannot respond to rate design signals”. The group also states that demand charges, hardware installation, and grid upgrade costs are the primary challenges standing in the way of EV charger implementation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/18/isun-posts-115-revenue-growth-in-full-year-2021-financial-results/,"FINANCE,LOOKING BACK,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,VERMONT",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 18, 2022",iSun posts 115% revenue growth in full year 2021 financial results,"Vermont-based iSun posted its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial results, reporting on what CEO Jeff Peck called a “milestone year.” The solar PV and EV charging engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm works in the residential, commercial, industrial and utility-scale sectors. 
Full year revenue for 2021 came in at $45.3 million, representing growth of 115% over 2020. The fourth quarter was particularly strong for iSun, in which it achieved $27 million in revenues, a growth of 190% over Q4 2020 revenues. 
Peck said the strong fourth quarter was due in part to the newly assembled leadership team at iSun getting the first opportunity to collaborate. 
Total assets increased markedly for iSun in 2020, leaping from $19.6 million to $103.7 million through 2021. The company made four acquisitions through 2021. 
“We successfully built a solar service platform capable of addressing the generational opportunity presented by EV adoption and decarbonization. While doing so, we delivered on our promise to grow revenues by more than doubling our 2020 revenues, exceeding our revenue guidance, and increasing shareholder equity by 650%.” said Peck. 
Gross margins increased slightly, improving from 19.1% to 21% year-over-year. EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021 was a loss of $0.5 million. When adjusted for one-time expenses related to M&A transactions, adjusted EBITDA was a gain of $0.9 million.
One such acquisition was the iSun taking minority interest in Vermont-based solar developer Encore Renewable Energy, which has a history of reclaiming real estate landfills, brownfields, rooftops, and carports for community-scale solar PV and large-scale energy storage systems.
Encore Renewables gained attention for its novel project with London-based Highview Power to develop a long-duration, liquid air energy storage system in northern Vermont.
iSun’s residential division, SunCommon, has $19.2 million in customer orders expected to be completed in the next six months. The commercial division has $9.3 million in project backlog expected to be completed within eight months, and the industrial division has a contracted backlog valued at $73.8 million that is planned to be complete within 18 months. Its utility division has over 550MW in the project pipeline, with projects expected to commence development in Q3 2022. 
Stockholder equity increased to $60 million at the end of 2021, up from $8 million at year end 2020. At the time of writing, iSun stock is down about 5%, has fallen 58% in six months, 66% in a year. The company hit a high of $26 per share in January 2021 and has now fallen 86% to about $3.60 per share. 
This January, the company won a $29 million order for the development of its solar parking canopy/EV charging solution. The company received an order for 1,780 off-grid canopies, and said it expects to deliver 450 in 2022.
“iSun has built a platform capable of addressing the needs of each segment of the solar industry, which includes serving the EV infrastructure demands of our new and current customers,” said Peck.

Energy Dome’s emission-free energy storage method uses carbon dioxide in a closed loop charge/discharge cycle that can store and dispatch renewable energy onto the grid over periods from four to 24 hours. Energy Dome reports that it plans to build energy storage projects at half the cost of lithium-ion battery storage technology globally. Energy Dome’s first commercial CO2 Battery storage facility is under construction in Sardinia, Italy and now offers the CO2 Battery on utility scale, with performance warranties. Energy Dome also recently signed an agreement with Ansaldo Energia that envisions developing as many as 30 energy storage facilities over the next five years in Italy, Germany, the Middle East, and Africa. The facilities will use Energy Dome’s non-flammable, non-toxic carbon dioxide-based energy storage solution to store and dispatch power around the clock.
BNEF Pioneers annually identifies the most promising and impactful technologies that can accelerate global decarbonization and halt climate change. Pioneers such as Energy Dome are innovators in sectors including energy, transport, materials, manufacturing, consumer products, and agriculture.
“To be selected as a BNEF Pioneers 2022 winner is not only a huge honor, but also a strong validation of our technology and product, the CO2 Battery, which we are deploying at commercial scale,” said Claudio Spadacini, Energy Dome founder and CEO . “We are already seeing strong global interest in the CO2 Battery, which uses tried and tested components, costs half of lithium-ion technology, is highly efficient (Round Trip Efficiency 75+%) and has no performance degradation during its 30+ year project lifetime. We believe the CO2 Battery will help significantly accelerate the clean energy transition by replacing baseload fossil fuels with fully dispatchable solar and wind energy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/18/burns-mcdonnell-completes-65mw-texas-solar-project/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 18, 2022",Burns & McDonnell completes 65MW Texas solar project,"Burns & McDonnell announced that it has completed construction of a 65MW solar project at Vistra’s Brightside Solar Facility in Live Oak County, Texas, just south of San Antonio.
The project, which will generate enough clean energy to power more than 25,000 residences, is comprised of First Solar’s 440W Series 6 solar modules mounted on a single-axis tracking system. In all, more than 250 construction professionals contributed to the project, including the construction of the project substation, which is a 34.5-kV to 69-kV interconnection. The interconnecting substation design incorporated a future utility upgrade to the generating voltages, approximately 12 months after commercial operation date, as the existing 69-kV transmission line will upgrade to a 138-kV transmission line.
“This project provided a unique opportunity for us to deploy our integrated EPC execution method by designing and self-performing the construction of both the PV and interconnecting substation,” says Matt Dickey, construction project manager at Burns & McDonnell. “By aligning the critical procurement packages with the construction packages and engineering packages we were able to procure equipment based on when the schedule called for it to be installed. This helped alleviate some of the supply chain issues and better plan the logistics of getting material to the site.”
The project also supports the Vistra Zero Initiative, under which Vistra looks to generate zero-carbon electricity while investing in new technologies. According to Vistra, the company has more than 2,800MW of zero-carbon generation online, with nearly 2,000MW of solar or battery storage under construction or in development and more than 3,000MW of zero-carbon assets in the development pipeline.
Burns & McDonnell, an engineering firm founded in 1898, is 100% employee-owned by over 7,600 engineers, construction professionals, architects, planners, technologists, scientists, and more.

The 90MW portfolio comprises over 40 solar projects, approximately 80% community solar, and 20% commercial and industrial (C&I) power purchase agreements (PPAs).
This is the first portfolio of projects Pivot will build, own, and operate since it was acquired by ECP in June 2021. In addition to C&I PPAs, clients include community solar subscriptions for commercial clients, residents, and nearly 1,200 low- to moderate-income households. The portfolio includes projects located in New York, Illinois, Colorado, Minnesota, California, and New Jersey.
Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) will lead the debt facilities and Foss & Company (Foss) will make the tax equity investment. The debt transaction led by SVB includes a construction loan, tax equity bridge loan, and permanent loan — which, coupled with the tax equity investment from Foss, will enable Pivot to fully construct, operate, and own this portfolio.
“Making solar accessible to more Americans is crucial in efforts to combat climate change, and the community solar subscriptions and PPA opportunities in this portfolio offer households and businesses an easy way to participate in the benefits of solar energy,” said Bret Turner, Head of Project Finance, Business Development, and Innovation for Silicon Valley Bank.
All projects in the portfolio will be managed through SunCentral, Pivot’s proprietary community solar subscriber management and acquisition platform.
