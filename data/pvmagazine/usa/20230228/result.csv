People were shaking hands in the lobby, learning at the educational sessions, enjoying drinks in the Irish pub, and making deals anywhere a free space could be found. Over 150 exhibitors were on the show floor this year. Here’s what we found:
Pest protection
BCA Laser Systems was onsite with their bird control gear. BCA makes a green laser unit that continually, and automatically clears birds from solar systems. After monitoring and learning where birds tend to be located, the unit flashes the birds with an expanded laser beam to scare them off. In our prior coverage, we noted that the manufacturer guarantees 70% fewer birds. Research the company provides suggests that in ideal situations, the device can reduce bird presence by 99%. The units are priced around the $20,000 range, according to a video released by the group.

Impact resistant gloves
Superior Gloves had a booth on the floor with at least fifteen unique gloves on the table. The company has dozens of products, including a list of gloves that are designed to protect against specific hazards. The list of twelve hazards include impact – as shown in the picture above, with a thick rubber backing that is ANSI / ISEA rated against impact, cuts, abrasion, and puncture.

Got trees?
Williams Forestry has placed hundreds of millions of trees across the Central and Eastern United States, and plants eight million new seedlings a year. The company was talking up various strategies being used in the northeast to meet zoning guidelines. For example, one technique is to plant one row of evergreens six or more feet apart, complemented by a second row that has pollinator shrubs offset in between the trees. This achieves multiple goals at once: it adds pollinator friendly shrubs, it creates low level visuals that will compliment the higher height trees, and it lowers the overall average price.

Residential energy storage
Canadian Solar was presenting their very flexible energy storage system, the EP Cube. The EP Cube scales in 3.3 kWh increments, up to 20 kWh in one inverter, with 120 kWh via six inverters the max size via a single gateway unit. The product boasts vehicle-to-grid readiness and easily upgraded software via the internet. The batteries can be coupled to solar inverters using AC or DC, which can be switched by moving a single connection.

Fencing
Wellscroft Solar Perimeter Fencing meets all code requirements with their seven and eight foot fencing. Wellscroft’s representatives note that their eight foot fence costs less than standard seven foot chain link fencing due to lower material volumes. The eight foot height is one foot taller than code requirements, protects against deer, and features wood posts that are aesthetically pleasing.

Portable solar generator
The Bank allows you to move your battery as needed, and plug your solar power system right into it. The unit contains a 12 kW inverter and four batteries, which can deliver 250 amp-hours of power over a ten hour period. The units deliver standard AC power via 120/240 volt plugs – and can deliver greater than 650 watts of electricity for more than 24 hours. A lower power output unit is available that has the same storage capacity. The MSRP for the higher power output unit – highlighted here – is $10,500.

Switchgear
Day Ahead Instrumentation had their low voltage – 480/277 VDC – utility grade protective relay onsite. The small plastic screen to the lower right of the unit is an electricity fault simulator. As it flashed various colors representing various simulated power grid faults, the relay reacted instantly. Following a direct transfer trip, the unit goes into a five-minute waiting period until the power grid returns to normal.

Rooftop solar components
Last but not least, EZ Solar was showing off their junction boxes. They extolled their junction boxes’ flexibility, noting that rooftop installers can easily access the inside of the box by drilling into any of the sides. Their newest product is a larger junction box that provides more space inside of the unit for wiring – the JB-1.XL.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/28/illinois-hospital-network-signs-up-for-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,ILLINOIS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",Illinois hospital network signs up for community solar,"In addition to creating savings for residents across utility markets, community solar can create savings for healthcare providers seeking clean energy access. Hospital owner Southern Illinois Healthcare is expected to save $119,000 per year on electricity following a long-term community solar agreement.
The multi-hospital system in Carbondale, Illinois, signed up to purchase electricity production from three Nexamp projects in the state. In addition to the annual energy savings, the healthcare organization is directly supporting the growth of clean energy on the grid.
The hospital operator is subscribing to the Pope Creek Solar facility in Aledo, Ill., Mound City Solar in Mound City, Ill., and Percy Renewables 1 in Percy, Ill. Consulting group E4 LLC advised the hospital organization on the community solar procurement.
Nexamp spokesman Keith Hevenor told pv magazine USA the three projects are in the development stage right now and are expected to become operational in the second half of 2024, with each project planned to provide about 6.5 MW(DC) of power capacity.
“As a not-for-profit organization, our priority is ensuring each dollar goes as far as possible in achieving our mission to improve the health and well-being of all the people in communities we serve,” said Dan Boeckman, corporate director of facilities at SIH. “Participating in a community solar program enables us to be good stewards of our financial resources while also contributing to the growth of much needed clean energy across Illinois.”
Nexamp’s solar facilities will generate bill credits for every kilowatt-hour of energy produced. These credits will be applied to SIH electricity accounts in the Ameren Illinois service territory, offsetting its costs dollar for dollar. Each credit will be sold at a guaranteed fixed discount for the life of the agreement, providing predictable savings year over year.
“We see how important it is today for healthcare institutions to manage costs, but at the same time we are hearing how important sustainability is in their long-term strategies, said Joe Fiori, director of energy sales, Nexamp.
In June 2022, Nexamp completed the 2.8 MW French Road Solar project in Burlington, Illinois. The project is located 55 miles west of Chicago, and has over 7,000 solar panels. Capable of offsetting the energy needs of approximately 400 average homes, it will also offset nearly 6 million pounds of CO2 annually.
Illinois currently ranks 15th in the U.S. for solar energy, with 1.91 GW of installed capacity through late 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The Illinois Shines program was introduced in 2019, creating richly valued solar renewable energy credits that pay residential and commercial solar asset owners based on their system’s production.
The state has also introduced a community solar offering under Illinois Shines and has a healthy mix of residential, commercial, and community solar installations. SEIA projects Illinois will add just under 5 GW of solar over the next five years, placing it within the top 10 states for solar development.
Nexamp was founded in 2007 and has focused on community solar since before most people knew what it was. Nationwide, the company has community solar projects in seven states and is actively developing in more states that have enabling legislation. In addition to community solar, Nexamp has existing commercial and industrial projects in other states including Calif., Georgia and Rhode Island.

The installation is the largest utility-scale solar project in operation in the Pacific Northwest state.
Lund Hill solar sits on roughly 1,800 acres of mixed-use land leased from private owners and the Washington Department of Natural Resources, the state’s solar power land lease.
The project supplies electricity as part of utility Puget Sound Energy’s (PSE) program called Green Direct, which enables governments and large commercial customers to purchase 100% renewable energy contracts from dedicated local sites.
Governor Jay Inslee celebrated the activation, commenting, “with our efforts this upcoming session, this should be the first of many clean energy projects that bring good-paying jobs and affordable, zero-emission energy to Washingtonians.”
The project will supply electricity for PSE’s second round of the Green Direct program. So far the program has connected more than 40 customers with renewable energy, including six state government agencies, like the Washington Department of Health, Ecology, and Transportation. PSE targets 100% clean energy by 2045, as mandated in Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act.
Avangrid financials
Avangrid, a publicly traded electric and gas utility holding company, is headquartered in Orange, Connecticut. Through its network business, the company operates eight natural gas and electric utilities, serving over 3 million customers in the Northeast U.S. Combined with its renewable energy business, the company has over $41 billion in assets and operations in 24 states.
Reporting on 2022 financial performance, Avangrid noted a U.S. earnings per share increased 15% year-over-year. The company invested $1.9 billion in its networks, driving 8% rate base growth. Avangrid commissioned about 400 MW of solar and onshore wind projects in 2022 and has another 600 MW in construction at the time of financial report.
Consolidated net income for the full year 2022 was $901 million, or $2.33 per share, compared to $780 million, or $2.18 per share, for the full year ended 2021.
Renewables earnings for the full year 2022 were $386 million, or $1.00 per share, and fourth-quarter earnings were $76 million, or $0.20 per share. The company established an outlook of $2.20 to $2.35 earnings per share for 2023, reiterating an annual 7% EPS growth rate through 2025 based on the mid-point 2022 EPS outlook.
Avangrid highlighted the beginning of construction of Vineyard Wind, a 1.8 GW offshore wind project that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2023.
“Our excellent results for 2022 demonstrate our commitment to execution and to the successful implementation of our long-term outlook,” said Pedro Azagra, chief executive officer of Avangrid. “We managed through the challenges in the macro-economic environment, with sharp increases in inflation and interest rates and continued supply chain disruptions, while maintaining focus on operational excellence, improving customer experience, and achieving our strategic growth objectives.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/28/lightyear-bp-expands-first-solar-module-supply-plan-to-8-3-gw/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OHIO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",Lightsource bp expands First Solar module supply plan to 8.3 GW,"Demand for First Solar modules continues to be hot as Lightsource bp has signed on to purchase 4 GW of the U.S.-made thin-film modules. Delivery is expected to take place between 2026 and 2028. The order adds on to a 4.3 GW purchase made in 2021.
The deal includes both Series 6 Plus and Series 7 solar modules. The modules are designed and developed at First Solar’s research centers in Ohio and California.
“We are seizing the opportunity by not just growing our 20 GW development pipeline across the United States, but also creating sizeable demand for our U.S.-based partner First Solar, which, in turn, is investing in innovation and manufacturing, and supporting thousands of direct and indirect American jobs,” said Kevin Smith, chief executive officer, Lightsource bp.
As part of the supply agreement, Lightsource bp has also committed to using First Solar’s module recycling program. The company is a market leader in PV recycling, operating a program that provides closed-loop semiconductor recovery for use in new modules, while also recovering other materials including aluminum, glass, and laminates.
First Solar is also the first PV manufacturer to have its product included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global registry for sustainable electronics.
“This is another sizeable commitment by Lightsource bp and a reflection of their trust in First Solar and our technology,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer, First Solar. “Our relationship with Lightsource bp is a partnership in growth. We enable their growth with certainty through long-term pricing and supply commitments, and advanced technology, while they enable ours by providing the certainty of demand we need to invest in manufacturing.”
First Solar is expanding its manufacturing capacity across the U.S. to meet this demand. The company expects to bring a third factory in Ohio in the first half of 2023, and a fourth factory in Alabama is currently under construction and expected to come online in 2025. Both factories are planned to produce the Series 7 modules.
The module producer’s $1.1 billion Alabama factory and $185 million expansion of its existing facilities in Ohio are expected to bring its total investment in American manufacturing to over $4 billion. The company’s annual U.S. nameplate manufacturing capacity is forecast to expand to 10.6 GW by 2026. It expects to add at least 850 new manufacturing jobs and over 100 new R&D jobs, taking its total number of direct jobs in the US to over 3,000 people in four states by 2025.
The purchase by Lightsource bp came in just days after an announcement that Silicon Ranch, a Nashville-based independent power producer, has procured an additional 1.5 GW of First Solar modules. The deal expands upon the master supply agreement between the two solar businesses that includes a 4 GW transaction announced in April 2022 and, more recently, a 700 MW commitment announced in October 2022.
Over the last year, U.S. module supplier First Solar has procured additional multi-year orders from Intersect Power (7.3 GW), Arevon Energy (2 GW), Swift Current Energy (2 GW) and National Grid Renewables (1.6 GW) and Origis Energy (750 MW).
Last year, First Solar joined the S&P 500 Index of public companies, becoming the third clean energy systems manufacturer to join the index of large-cap companies. Fellow solar technology suppliers Enphase Energy and SolarEdge Technologies are also on the S&P 500 Index.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/28/municipal-franchise-agreements-could-drive-up-to-911-twh-of-renewable-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",Municipal franchise agreements could drive up to 911 TWh of renewable energy,"Research from the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) published in Energy Policy highlights the pivotal role cities can play in negotiating franchise agreements with utilities to further their clean energy and decarbonization goals. In recent years, a growing number of municipalities have developed ambitious clean energy goals and targets for emissions. These local governments can wield significant influence over energy consumption and operations in their jurisdictions. Researchers from the NREL argue that city-utility franchise agreements offer an immense policy opportunity.
A franchise agreement is a contract between a local government and a utility for access to the public right of way to install infrastructure, typically in exchange for a fee.
As seen above, local governments across 30 states can negotiate electric franchise agreements.  Five states are precluded from entering a franchise agreement, two states are majority public power states, where cities may be unlikely to enter into franchise agreements, and the remaining 14 states had insufficient data to make conclusions.
Widespread adoption of franchise agreements across the local governments that can adopt them would potentially result in the development of 164 TWh to 911 TWh of renewable energy by 2030.
Already 467 cities, representing 13% of the data set, were identified as having either adopted franchise agreements or a franchise-related agreement that references one or more energy-related objectives.
These partnerships offer a range of benefits compared to other procurement options. Franchise agreements provide a collaborative approach with the city’s electric service providers that utilize the technical expertise of the utility in a particular local context. These partnerships allow the city to go beyond behind-the-meter generation options to more ambitious, and innovative measures that suit their specific needs and goals. As well, these agreements provide unique and direct policy leverage for municipalities without having to rely on the state legislature or regulatory bodies.
Franchise agreements are not without drawbacks. The municipality does not unilaterally dictate terms, meaning the utility could lower objectives through negotiation. While these agreements are legally binding contracts, clean energy objectives are often incorporated into parallel agreements which have fewer compliance protections, and may make it easier to underdeliver. Also, utilities typically pursue long-term contracts that may be 20 years in length. While there are shorter term partnership agreements possible, this hinders the availability of this option to achieve rapidly evolving clean energy objectives amidst the constantly changing energy sector. On the other hand, this means franchise agreements have the potential for lasting change once locked in.
Examples from cities like Denver, Minneapolis, and Salt Lake City, have shown rising interest in incorporating renewable energy objectives into franchise agreements. In 2006, the city of Denver, Colorado signed a 20-year franchise agreement with Xcel Energy along with a related energy efficiency agreement. As part of the agreement, Xcel Energy agreed to provide $2 million to Denver’s energy efficiency programs over the course of the agreement. From 2010 to 2018, Denver used these funds to support energy efficiency projects for over 7000 low-income households and 135 nonprofits. These residential projects resulted in cumulative energy savings of over 7000 MWh per year, and the nonprofit projects cumulatively saved over 4300 MWh.
In 2014, the City of Minneapolis and Xcel Energy signed a new 10-year franchise agreement and a Clean Energy Partnership to advance the city’s electricity goals. An important part of this was the decoupling of franchise fee rates from the agreement itself, allowing the city more flexibility to adjust rates. Additional revenue generated from this was allocated to the city’s climate, energy, and workforce programs, and totaled over $2.7 million in 2018. $800,000 of this funding went to the Green Cost Share program, run by the Minneapolis Health Department. This program supports investments toward energy efficiency, solar, and emissions reduction in commercial, industrial, and multifamily properties by matching funds, while also leveraging utility rebate programs and incentives.
As seen above, the Minneapolis Green Cost Share program resulted in significant increases to energy savings and renewable generation since 2017 because of the franchise agreement.
In 2016, Salt Lake City, Utah and Rocky Mountain Power signed a new five-year franchise agreement and a Cooperation Statement outlining the two entities’ renewable energy commitments. Joint goals included transitioning to at least net-50% renewable electricity for municipal facility operations by 2020, and net-100% renewable electricity supply community-wide by 2032. This franchise agreement helped push Rocky Mountain Power to request proposals for 205 GWh per year of new renewable energy generation in 2019.
These local examples highlight some of the ways franchise agreements can be used by municipalities as a direct pathway to achieve their renewable energy and decarbonization goals. At the same time, these agreements help utilities achieve greater collaboration and foster innovation in a framework that enables long-lasting and productive engagement toward shared goals. While landmark policy like the Inflation Reduction Act has incited significant clean energy investment, successful implementation will ultimately depend on the action of local governments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/28/net-metered-industrial-solar-developer-receives-equity-investment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",Net-metered industrial solar developer receives equity investment,"Grid demand charges typically represent 30% to 70% of a commercial and industrial operation’s electric bill. Prolonged hot summer months in Texas from June through September create a lot of demand on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid, pushing prices higher. On-site solar represents an opportunity for savings from these high demand charges, and Industrial Solar seeks to meet that opportunity.
“Our utility-scale solar projects help our ERCOT customers save millions of dollars at the facility level without any capital expense required,” said Wade Gungoll, chief executive officer of Industrial Sun.
Industrial Solar’s net-metered solar solutions involve deploying grid-scale solar projects near industrial facilities. The industrial firm will sign a power purchase agreement rather than owning the project outright, avoiding additional capex costs. As behind-the-meter projects, the net-metered industrial solar projects can significantly reduce the 4CP demand charges across Texas industrial operations.
For years C&I businesses across Texas have been charged a monthly coincidental peak fee, called a 4CP charge, based on how much electricity the business consumed during a previous year peak period when demand on the grid was highest. 4CP stands for the average Coincident Peak demand reading set by a C&I facility’s electric load in each four month seasonal interval.
According to a nascent C&I solar developer, a new solution that goes a step further than on-site solar provides net-metered industrial solar from utility-scale projects that can virtually eliminate 4CP demand charges altogether.
This week, EIG Partners and Modern Energy announced an investment totaling $90 million in Modern Energy business Industrial Sun, an industrial solar developer working across Texas. EIG previously committed $100 million to Modern Energy in mid-2020 for a debt facility for the company’s portfolio of other clean energy transition businesses.
“Industrial Sun was a brand new company 15 months ago and now it is capitalized to execute on gigawatts of pipeline opportunities that will further the energy transition,” said Chris Hamilton, chief investment officer at Modern Energy.
Founded in 2021, Industrial Sun’s team has deployed more than 6 GW of cumulative solar projects to date, with Gungoll and Rich Clark, vice president of development, previously working at Savion, 7X Energy (Lightsource bp), SunPower, AP Solar and NRG Energy.
4CP Demand Charges
According to an Industrial Solar white paper blog series, 4CP demand charges can be broken down into three steps for a basic evaluation:
In one 4CP example, a Centerpoint Energy customer paid $56.51 per 4CP kilowatt, which equals $56,510 per MWh during the 4CP time samples. For a 50 MW industrial load application, that becomes $2.83 million in power usage for a single hour of an industrial application, according to the company.
No state has more solar capacity on the way than Texas in the coming years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects as much as 36 GW of solar capacity will be added in the next five years, adding on to the 16 GW installed thus far and leapfrogging the Lone Star State over California in terms of installed capacity.
To date, Texas has enough solar capacity to power the equivalent of nearly 2 million homes. Over 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that over $19 billion has been invested in the technology there through Q3 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/28/where-renewable-energy-policies-are-working-in-2023/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,ILLINOIS,MASSACHUSETTS,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",Where renewable energy policies are working in 2023,"Each year, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) tracks and scores states based on how their policies help or hinder local clean energy action. ILSR gives the states a letter grade of A, B, C, D or F based on whether its energy policies give individuals, cities and communities the choice to build clean energy wealth locally, rather than relying on utilities.
A number score is arrived at based on a compilation of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACORE), DSIRE, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) , PACENation, SolarReviews, and Vote Solar, as well as the data the ILSR tracks on community solar, community choice aggregation and state legislative changes.
In the 2023 Community Power Scorecard, four states excelled, 14 states and the District of Columbia saw above average scores, six were average, 14 were mediocre, and 13 states received failing grades. Progress is being made, however, as seen by the numbers in the 2022 Scorecard in which four states excelled, nine states and the District of Columbia saw above average scores, nine were average, 15 were mediocre, and 13 states received failing grades.
Image: ILSR
Achieving a top score
The four states to receive an A grade are Massachusetts, California, Illinois and New York. To achieve a top score, ILSR’s community power scorecard evaluates state policies as they are written, not on how they have been implemented. Sound policy making that will advance energy democracy requires continued advocacy, vigilance, and effort, ILSR reports. An “A” grade does not mean that the work is done. Even in high-scoring states, like Massachusetts or California, the work continues.

New policies enacted last year in several states impacted their 2023 scores. These include California, Illinois, Maryland, and New Mexico, which each changed their interconnection rules for distributed energy resources. All four states added specific considerations for battery storage, which is something the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) advocates for with its BATRIES interconnection reform package. Out of those states, only Maryland had a less-than-perfect interconnection grade, so Maryland’s Community Power Score increased by one point.
The Washington and New Hampshire legislatures each demonstrated their desire to increase solar access with community solar policies that make specific accommodations for low-income subscribers (Wash. HB1814 and N.H. SB270). California did not receive any additional points for its new community solar policy, even though the policy improves upon the state’s existing Enhanced Community Renewables program. Several other states explored, but did not implement community solar in 2022, including Arizona, Ohio, and West Virginia.
Colorado’s General Assembly passed a law on building energy codes in 2022, which sets the 2021 International Energy Conservation (IEC) code as the minimum requirement, while still allowing communities to set more stringent codes.
Net metering policies lowered the score in several states. For example, Iowa and New York both added fees to self-generating customers. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission allowed the state’s utilities to switch to “instantaneous netting,” which dramatically reduces the value of customer-owned solar generation.
In December 2022 the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) unanimously voted to approve Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM 3.0), slashing payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said the decision is “too abrupt” and will slow rooftop solar deployment in the state. “The failure to adopt a more gradual transition to net billing risks putting solar out of reach for millions of residents across the state,” said SEIA.
