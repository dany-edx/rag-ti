Customers will then be paid the “avoided cost” rate for exported power, a fraction of what was paid in the preceding NEM 2.0 era.
From a return-on-investment standpoint, NEM 3.0 essentially brings an end to solar-only installations, particularly if the homeowner seeks to meet all their energy needs with their rooftop array. The value loss from exporting power now shifts the focus in California to a solar-plus-batteries market. While this may present a challenge for some installers who need to pivot to offering batteries, installation partners of SolarEdge come equipped with a ready-made solution.
“This is not new for SolarEdge,” Amir Cohen, general manager, North America solar business unit, SolarEdge, told pv magazine. “We have seen this around the world. Being a global company and the market leader in Europe, time of use, if you look at Italy, Germany, other markets, it’s something that has been around forever. Battery attachment has been in the 60%, 80%, 90% in some of the countries we operate in.”
SolarEdge offers DC optimizers coupled to a DC battery. In concert, the two offer a high-efficiency system with flexibility in customer choices. The three main choices available to solar customers under a SolarEdge solution are a self-consumption based “rate saver” option that focuses on maximizing savings, and two additional options that add either partial or full home back-up in the event of a power outage. All three solutions will be optimized for NEM 3.0 and self-consumption using the same SolarEdge Home Hub inverter installers use today.
Self-consumption, or storing and using your own photovoltaic production, helps insulate the customer from high utility bill rates. California utilities bill their customers based on a time-of-use based structure, meaning that rates are higher in the evenings when solar production is low and electricity demand is high. SolarEdge’s battery system comes with algorithm-controlled software that adapts to these rates, ensuring that customers avoid drawing power from the utility when rates are the highest.
(Read: “California’s new net metering policy brings batteries into the forefront“)
While SolarEdge is not the only solar technology that can operate in a self-consumption mode, it does come with some important benefits. One, the technology is DC-coupled, which means that the direct current electricity created by solar arrays does not need to be converted, and feeds straight to the battery via a DC wire.
This avoids the issue of clipping, the loss that occurs when a typical AC-coupled system has to convert from DC to AC, AC to DC, and then DC back to AC to feed the battery. Each time a conversion is made, production is lost. Cohen said that clipping losses can lead to as much as 10% in production losses, depending on the system.
Another benefit of the DC solution is that it places less of a burden on main panels in a home. While other solutions may require subpanels or main panel upgrades (MPU), the SolarEdge solution most MPUs can be avoided by directly wiring the battery to the inverter side of the installation. This is meaningful to installers, who often don’t determine an MPU is necessary until after a site visit to the home, which can lead to unexpected additional costs, longer installation times, and the possibility of a customer walking away from the deal.
With the sunset of NEM 2.0 approaching, demand is soaring as applications are flying in to secure a preferable compensation rate. Meghan Nutting executive vice president, regulatory and government affairs of Sunnova told pv magazine that Southern California Edison’s application processing center has received 10 times as many applications as a typical month. This may pose a challenge to some equipment providers, but SolarEdge said it is well-prepared to meet this demand.
The company now operates a multi-gigawatt-hour battery facility in Mexico in 2o22. In 2018 the company acquired Kokam, among the top five largest lithium-ion battery suppliers in South Korea. This supply chain readiness will help SolarEdge meet this sudden spike in demand due to the rulemaking change.
When the NEM 3.0 change happens, SolarEdge will not need to change its business much. Cohen said that the components used in its solution will remain the same. It is now working more closely with installers on the front end, to explain the benefits of its products “across the kitchen table.”
Cohen said that speed-of-installation will be another benefit to this boom in projects that installers will be hustling to complete. He said that as California moves into summer, the easy to install technology will enable one-a-day or even two-a-day project installations.
“This has the potential to be the NEM 3.0 antidote installers are looking for,” said Barry Cinnamon, chief executive officer of Cinnamon Energy Systems, a California solar installer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/14/lazard-lcoe-report-sees-zero-cost-solar-and-wind-due-to-ira/,"BUSINESS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 14, 2023",Lazard LCOE report sees “zero cost” solar and wind due to IRA,"Lazard has released its Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), Storage, & Hydrogen indexes. For the first time in its history, the document has shown pricing increases for solar power’s LCOE. We’re also seeing continued price decreases in hydrogen as that industry scales.
The solar power price increases were noted to be at least partially driven by the increases in cost of capital. The higher the up-front cost of construction, the greater the increase in LCOE an electricity generation source will feel.
For the purpose of this document, LCOE v16.0, Lazard choses 8.0% as the cost of debt. The group’s sliding scale page shows various generation source’s sensitivities to cost of debt combined with cost of equity, and after tax IRR/WACC. For instance, the relatively low up-front costs of gas combined cycle shows a 16% increase in LCOE from 5% cost of debt to 10% cost of debt. While heavy up-front utility-scale solar increases from $45/MWh to $72 – a rise of 60%.
After being at just above 0% since 2019, the base U.S. interest rate has increased to nearly 5%.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) made its way into Lazard’s analysis and showed a potential for some wind and solar power projects to have an effective $0/MWh LCOE price. In the chart, the analysis compares renewable energy versus the marginal cost – essentially the cost of fuel and O&M – of running certain generation technologies.
In this comparison it could be that some new utility-scale wind and solar is cheaper than running all other generation source for instantaneously used generation.

The document suggests that some new wind and solar can potentially be obtained for an LCOE of $0/MWh. pv magazine USA has speculated on the same potential situation arising once the IRA gets going.
Lazard explained this chart anomaly:
Results at this level are driven by Lazard’s approach to calculating the LCOE and selected inputs (see Appendix for further details). Lazard’s Unsubsidized LCOE analysis assumes, for year-over-year reference purposes, 60% debt at an 8% interest rate and 40% equity at a 12% cost (together implying an after-tax IRR/WACC of 7.7%). Implied IRRs at this level for Solar PV—Utility-Scale (PTC) equals 17% (excl. Domestic Content) and 22% (incl. Domestic Content) and implied IRRs at this level for Wind—Onshore (PTC) equals 17% (excl. Domestic Content) and 25% (incl. Domestic Content).
Essentially, with the Production Tax Credit paying investors, and taking into account the Domestic Content 10% tax credit adder, a developer could price their power purchase agreement at $0 and still make all investors and themselves financially happy at standard market rates.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/14/california-grants-3-million-for-solar-photovoltaic-window-coating-production/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 14, 2023",California grants $3 million for solar photovoltaic window coating production,"The California Energy Commission (CEC) awarded Realizing Accelerated Manufacturing Production for Clean Energy Technologies (RAMP) of $3 million to NEXT Energy Technologies. The RAMP grant is expected to help NEXT accelerate the production of its photovoltaic coating that can be applied to commercial windows to turn them into electricity-producing surfaces.
The purpose of RAMP is to provide financial assistance to help clean energy entrepreneurs successfully advance their innovative technologies by reaching initial manufacturing readiness levels. NEXT plans to use the funds to fund the scale-up of a low-rate initial production line for the assembly of solution-processed organic photovoltaics for commercial windows.
“The funding provided is vital to startups like ours that are focusing on manufacturing at the next level. Our goal is to help commercial buildings achieve net-zero energy and reduce their carbon footprint, and we are working with innovative partners to demonstrate how this technology can grow in the future,” said Daniel Emmit, chief executive officer, NEXT Energy Technologies.
The comany’s photovoltaic coatings are applied during the window fabrication process, integrating with established manufacturers without disrupting workflows and supply chains. NEXT said its approach removes costs typically associated with packaging and installation of solar.
NEXT said a typical commercial high-rise office building installed with its first-generation windows could offset as much as 10% to 20% of the building’s power needs. Over a 30-year period, the building could produce 20 million kWh of clean energy, saving an annual average of $170,000 on utility bills, the company said.
“RAMP is really a visionary program. It is providing value, not just for our clean energy goals, but also ultimately for ratepayers because it is helping to drive down the cost of these technologies,” said David Hochschild, chair, CEC.
A team of National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers found that highly glazed skyscrapers can reduce their energy use and associated carbon emissions by 40% with solar windows. Twin brothers Lance and Vincent Wheeler developed a new open-source software, available on GitHub, called PVWindow to model the potential impact of the technology.
“Picture a skyline in, like, New York City where there are these high-rise buildings that are entirely glass,” said Lance Wheeler. “They’re fully glazed. The Freedom Tower has millions of square feet of glass. It could be a power plant in itself.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/14/solar-utility-workers-require-ruggedized-technology/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 14, 2023",Solar utility workers require ruggedized technology,"Industry experts predict that over the next five years, the solar industry will grow 5x larger than it is today, likely reaching a capacity of 700 GW by 2033. However, only 255,500 Americans work in the solar industry. And the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) reports that 89% of solar firms struggle to find qualified applicants to fill positions. The solar workforce will need to more than double in the next 10 years to reach the federal goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035.
To meet this demand, the utility industry must maximize its current workforce for solar deployment and maintenance and open its doors to new talent in a way that is simple, accessible, and financially viable. Providing technology that fits the unique needs of the solar industry, and makes jobs easier for utility workers, is essential to attract new talent.
With the right mobile technology, any utility worker — from a new hire to a seasoned pro — can communicate with their team, troubleshoot and repair infrastructure, and work in any environment to drive growth and meet customer demands.
Remote computing technology
Utility workers and contractors in the solar industry perform tasks in challenging environments every day. Whether adding solar panels to a residential roof or creating a solar farm in a remote location, these workers must do their jobs in varying conditions and situations.
For residential solar projects, utility workers and contractors must assess the home and roof, collect and track permits and documentation, order equipment, install panels, and test system performance before final deployment.
When up on a roof checking for structure requirements or installing panels, utility workers and contractors need a technology solution that can quickly pull up blueprints, contracts or heavy-intensive graphics such as geographic information systems (GIS) or CAD drawings that require advanced GPU and CPU integration. They can’t risk their computing device being unusable when in sunlight, dropped or dirtied. They also don’t have time to remove industrial-grade leather safety gloves to use the touchscreen or stylus or wait for a document or image to load.
When servicing utility-scale solar, workers often find themselves in remote locations with limited connectivity. The average solar farm is over 40 acres (about twice the area of Chicago’s Millennium Park). From one end of the farm to the other, workers need uninterrupted access to critical information and a means of communicating with their team.
Without the right technology, they could find themselves in the middle of the solar farm, unable to view the latest reports or contact another team member about an intricate servicing question. These types of challenges waste time and with a limited workforce, time is already in short supply.
Consider also that utility workers often travel to several different job sites every day — pushing their computing solutions to the max. This means they don’t have time to sit at a desk to charge their devices, review essential documents, or check on how well a recent deployment is running. They must access specialized software and relevant documents in seconds. Technology that grants easy access to information from a utility truck, office, field, or rooftop means workers meet deadlines, order the right parts the first time, and leave a job site confident that the infrastructure will perform as expected.
Ruggedized computing
Consumer-grade technology rarely meets the unique challenges faced by a utility worker in the solar industry. These devices can work fine for personal use and traditional office work. But, for workers in harsh and unpredictable environments, consumer-grade devices seldom get the job done. Imagine sitting at your desk with your laptop.
Now you must take your laptop and drive to a field a few hours away from the closest major city. You’re now in the middle of a field and having trouble viewing the consumer-grade device screen in the sunlight. The hotspot on your phone isn’t working, the device applications are hard to use, and the battery needs to be recharged. Your laptop is overheating, unable to connect to the internet, and you’ve now lost valuable time in your day to get your work done. That’s what it’s like for a utility worker without ruggedized technology solutions.
Rugged solutions provide more than just a sturdy exterior or hard-shell casing. They offer uncompromised connectivity, adaptability with various ports and keyboards, optimized heat management, hot-swappable batteries, and advanced processing power when working in a mobile office environment.
With ruggedized technology, utility workers and contractors can track, monitor, and maintain solar projects from the office and the field. Investing in necessary mobile technology solutions not only gives today’s limited workforce the tools they need to work with speed and efficiency, but it also prepares the industry for what lies ahead: a technology-centered energy infrastructure that depends on workers who can stay constantly connected, adaptable and ready to engage whenever and wherever.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/14/solarcycle-solar-recycling-specialist-raises-30-million-in-new-funding/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 14, 2023",Solarcycle solar recycling specialist raises $30 million in new funding,"Solarcycle, a tech-driven recycling company focused on producing sustainable materials at scale for the solar industry, has raised $30 million in Series A funding, bringing the company’s total funding to $37 million since its inception a year ago.
The company reports that the funds, consisting of both company equity and infrastructure financing, will be used to scale its growth in solar panel recycling capacity and expand materials remanufacturing capabilities. The infrastructure financing provides asset-level equity capital for Solarcycle’s Odessa, Texas factory.
The round is led by Fifth Wall and HG Ventures. The round also included participation from special situations partner Alok Sindher, Prologis Ventures, as well as existing investors Urban Innovation Fund and Closed Loop Partners.
“This Series A funding will allow us to further advance our patented technology, grow partnerships with industry leaders, and rapidly build recycling infrastructure in the United States and beyond to mine old solar panels for making new solar panels,” said Suvi Sharma, CEO and co-founder of Solarcycle.
The announcement follows the initial $6.6M seed round the company raised in May 2022 from leading renewable energy and circular economy investors including SolarCity founders Peter and Lyndon Rive, former CEO/CTO of Sunpower Corporation Systems Tom Dinwoodie, Urban Innovation Fund and Closed Loop Partners.
Solarcycle was founded in 2022 by industry experts from leading corporations and institutions such as Solaria, NEXTracker, Sierra Club, and the University of New South Wales. The company said its recycling solution can recover more than 95% of vital materials that can be re-used. Its technology allows it to extract metals including silver, silicon, copper, and aluminum and to recycle or repurpose 95% of panels currently in use. Sunrun was its first partner, and it has since added Silicon Ranch, DEPCOM Power, SOLV Energy, NovaSource, Greentech Renewables, and Forum Energy Partners.
 
“Fifth Wall looked far and wide, and we believe Solarcycle is the only company within North America aiming to do true, end-to-end solar panel recycling. Their deep solar industry partnerships and ability to extract valuable materials at reasonable cost, with efficient logistics, is what differentiates the company’s position,” said Peter Gajdoš, partner and co-head of The Climate Tech Investment Team at Fifth Wall. “The rapid adoption of customers speaks to the quality of the solution and the growing market demand as solar panel portfolio ages.”
Solarcycle works with residential, commercial and industrial (C&I), and utility companies to recycle solar panels at scale, expecting to install capacity to recycle one million solar panels per year by the end of 2023. The company plans to open a vertically integrated, advanced recycling factory capable of processing millions of panels annually in 2024.
Solarcycle said recent research projects that recyclable materials from solar panels will be worth more than $2.7 billion by 2030, up from $170 million this year.
Update: On April 20, 2023 Solarcycle announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has awarded the company a $1.5M research grant to study the process for recovering higher-quality metals and materials extracted from retired solar panels.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/14/construction-nears-on-srp-large-scale-battery-energy-storage-project-in-arizona/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,ARIZONA",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 14, 2023",Construction nears on SRP large-scale battery energy storage project in Arizona,"Officials from Salt River Project (SRP), Plus Power LLC, and the City of Avondale took part in a ceremonial groundbreaking to kick off construction at Sierra Estrella Energy Storage, what is expected to be the largest standalone battery facility in Arizona once online.
The facility will store up to 250 MW / 1 GWh and will SRP customers during times of peak electricity demand.
“This facility will have enough stored energy to power more than 56,000 average size homes for a four-hour period,” said Grant Smedley, director of resource planning at SRP. “Battery storage can help provide energy to the grid when other resources may not be available and is part of SRP’s overarching strategy to meet rising energy demand while reducing carbon emissions.”
The Sierra Estrella facility is one of two battery storage projects SRP announced in fall of 2022 with Plus Power, with both projects scheduled to come online by summer of 2024. The other, a 90 MW / 360 MWh project is called Superstition Energy Storage, which is planned for Gilbert, Ariz. When these projects are complete, SRP expects to surpass  1.1 GW of battery storage by 2024.
The storage facilities are being designed and built by Houston-based Plus Power, a battery energy storage systems provider with a pipeline of over 100 GW across 28 states. Plus Power has designed the Sierra Estrella Facility to use Tesla lithium-ion batteries, a technology that have caught fire in the past. In September 2022, fire broke out at a PG&E facility in Monterey County, Calif. where at least one of the Tesla Megapack systems caught fire.  In 2021 a Tesla Megapack also caught fire in the Victorian Big Battery in Moorabool, Australia. Plus Power reports that it will design the Arizona projects to updated national codes and standards for battery energy storage systems, which incorporate lessons learned from incidents at other battery facilities. Plus Power has also engaged with both the Gilbert and Avondale Fire Departments to prepare a thorough emergency response plan. In the coming months the two organizations will conduct onsite training to provide safety planning to local first responders throughout construction and operation.
“Avondale is proud to partner with SRP and Plus Power to welcome the Sierra Estrella Energy Storage facility which will be a valuable asset to our community for decades to come,” said Veronica Malone, Avondale councilmember. “The project will provide necessary power to the region with no onsite air polluting emissions, will incorporate the latest safety standards, and has been designed with thorough planning and preparation.”
Sierra Estrella Energy Storage is expected to generate 30 to 40 construction jobs throughout its development and to expand the Avondale district property tax base.
SRP is a community-based, not-for-profit public power utility that was founded in 1903 as the Salt River Valley Water Users’ Association. Made up of local ranchers and farmers, the association’s mission was to see the Valley flourish, and together, they offered up their land as collateral for federal funds to build Roosevelt Dam. Today SRP reports that it supplies around 750,000 acre-feet of water every year and delivers power to more than 1 million customers. In 2017 SRP adopted its 2035 Sustainability Goals, which commit to reducing carbon (from 2005 levels) by more than 65% by 2035 and 90% by 2050. SRP has also closed the largest coal plant in the Western U.S. and will have retired approximately 2.6 GW of coal-fired generation by 2032. The company anticipates that by 2025, nearly half of all retail energy delivered to SRP customers will come from carbon-free resources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/14/federal-grants-of-4-6-billion-available-to-states-aiming-to-model-a-clean-energy-grid/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 14, 2023",Federal grants of $4.6 billion available to states aiming to model a clean energy grid,"Forty-six states have told the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency they intend to request a non-competitive $3 million grant to plan how to reduce climate pollution. The planning grants will be followed by $4.6 billion of implementation grants.
To aid states planning to reduce pollution from the electric generating sector, the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA) has published a high-level overview of energy modeling, also known as integrated resource planning.
“Many states will be turning to modeling to evaluate future scenarios” for their electric generating resources, said Bentham Paulos, senior research associate for CESA, on a webinar. “So we thought a report like this was timely to get everyone up to speed about how modeling works.”
EPA’s grant program allows planning grants to be used for modeling and analytical costs, among other purposes.
Modeling software can be complicated and expensive, Paulos said. Even so, simply understanding resource models and how to interpret the results “can be just as important or maybe even more so than doing your own modeling,” he said. “Modeling can give us insight, but also modeling can be abused,” he added, as “people who have a commercial interest to protect will use modeling to validate their positions, in hopes that no one will know better.”
CESA’s report walks through the inputs and outputs of resource models. The report highlights the work of the nonprofit RMI to develop an independent resource plan for Louisville Gas & Electric/Kentucky Utilities, using the open-source model GenX.
The report also describes existing modeling results available from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) Cambium data sets. These data sets allow a user to excerpt, for a single geographic area, the results from national model runs reflecting a range of possible futures for the U.S. electricity sector through 2050.
Speaking on the webinar, Elaine Hale, NREL senior research engineer, said the “standard scenarios” in Cambium help stakeholders understand what the future grid might look like, based on current policy and mid-point projections of technology costs, and also “how things might be different if costs come down faster than expected or new policies are enacted.”
Hale described an upgrade to the data inputs used for NREL’s free ReEDS model—a model that the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists used to validate 100% renewables by 2035 for 24 states. NREL is establishing standardized data sources for three types of inputs used by the ReEDS model, Hale said: information on the existing power system, load projections, and location-specific renewable generation profiles. These standard data sources for ReEDS, along with new features for modeling grid investments, will streamline NREL’s ability to conduct planning analysis at the national, regional and community scale. Hale said she is “most excited” about the idea of automating those processes to enable state-level standard scenarios, and invited webinar participants to contact her to discuss the idea.
Beyond the $3 million planning grants that EPA is making available to states, the nation’s 67 largest metropolitan areas are also each eligible for a $1 million planning grant, while $25 million is reserved for tribes.
The CESA report on modeling was developed by the organization’s 100% Clean Energy Collaborative, which now counts 22 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as having 100% clean energy goals.
