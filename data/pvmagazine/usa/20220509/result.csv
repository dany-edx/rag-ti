The CanDuit clamp secures and supports conduit for wire management and fastens home runs – meaning the electrical cable that carries power from the main circuit breaker panel to the first electrical box, plug, or switch in the circuit, rather than a baseball – to metal roofs for solar PV systems, in combination with any S-5! clamp or bracket.

The CanDuit is made of electro-zinc coated steel, guarding the clamp from potential corrosion, and is available in 14 different sizes across residential and commercial applications. It is designed with two halves that clamp around a pipe or conduit with an EPDM liner pad that protects against abrasion and a threaded M8 stud that allows for attachment to S-5! products—providing easy, organized securement without scratching, corrosion or other damage to the roof.
According to S-5! CEO and Founder, Rob Haddock, the product was developed as a response to customer needs, as S-5! was apparently approached multiple times about solutions for attaching tube-shaped objects to metal roofs. The relationship between pv systems and metal roofs is one that S-5! knows well, and, according to Haddock, the company jumped at the opportunity to fill an industry need in its area of expertise.
Solar PV mounting systems for standing seam roof installations must be mechanically attached to the panel seams only via seam clamps in order to preserve the roof’s design features and warranties. Additionally, metal roofs will outlast the service life of a solar PV system, so it is critical that the mounting system and all attachments protect and maintain the durability of the roof. The CanDuit fits this mold for both of these needs, attaching directly and securely to roof seams, preventing any damage that would be caused by movement over time.

The project will add 750 kW of Trina Solar modules and roughly 4 MWh of battery energy storage supplied by Tesla Powerpack batteries.
In total, the site will expand by 1.7 acres, boosting capacity by about 30% and expanding the total footprint of the array to about 7.1 acres. Once complete, the system will be a 1.6 MW solar facility with up to 8 MWh of battery energy storage. The battery energy storage is expected to help with intermittent generation cycles of solar PV and to provide ancillary services like peak demand shaving for SpaceX.
The Tesla Powerpack
Tesla has been building integrated battery systems for over fifteen years, and the Powerpack is the large-scale counterpart to the Tesla PowerWall home battery. The batteries are modular and scalable from smaller commercial to the largest utility-scale projects. Each unit contains 16 individual battery pods, each with an isolated DC-DC converter. The architecture of the pods makes for easy swapping, said Tesla.
Powerpacks have been deployed worldwide, operating in over 2 GWh of deployments. An internal liquid cooling and heating temperature allows for precise temperature control. A dual coolant and refrigerant loop system adapted from the Tesla Model S provides improved efficiency when compared with air cooling, said the company.
The Powerpack has 380 to 480 V, and three phases. Up to 232 kWh of AC capacity lies in each battery, and it can supply up to 130 kW AC per battery. The scalable inverter power spans from 70 kVA to 700 kVA at 480V. The company reports 88% round-trip efficiency for two-hour applications, and 89.5% efficiency in four-hour applications.

The battery is rated to perform between –22 F to 122 F, has an enclosure rated for a wide range of environments, and has nationally accredited certifications to international safety, EMC, utility and environmental legislation. Each Powerpack measures 50.9” x 38.1” x 86.1” and weighs 4,847 lbs. The inverter measures in at 41.1” x 54.9” x 86.2” and weighs 2,470 lbs.
One customer of the Tesla Powerpack, Advanced Microgrid Services (AMS), installed 16 Powerpacks on-site on its building for peak shaving and capacity reserve purposes. The project totaled 1.5 MWh / 250 kW.
“At AMS, we need the most advanced energy storage to harness more than a million square feet of building load to power the electric grid. Tesla Energy consistently delivers outstanding reliability and technology innovation to our projects,” said AMS.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/09/pge-11-million-pilot-programs-to-accelerate-vehicle-to-everything-technologies/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 9, 2022",PG&E $11 million pilot programs to accelerate vehicle-to-everything technologies,"The California utility Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) plans to test bidirectional charging technology in homes, businesses, and with local microgrids in select high fire-threat districts (HFTDs). The purpose of the pilots is to test the ability of electric vehicles (EVs) to send power back to the grid and to provide power to customers in the event of an outage.
Bidirectional charging technology allows EVs to draw power from the grid (or owner’s solar installation) for charging, or they can send it back to the grid. PG&E estimates that there are 400,000 EVs registered in its service area, which represents a valuable grid resource. Potentially, using the power stored in EV batteries could reduce the need to build new standalone energy storage systems.
Last month, PG&E announced collaborations with GM and Ford PG&E and GM to test vehicle-to-home capable electric vehicles and chargers. The pilot includes the use of bidirectional hardware coupled with software-defined communications protocols that will enable power to flow from a charged EV into a customer’s home, automatically coordinating between the EV, home, and PG&E’s electric supply. Ford has teamed up with Sunrun to enhance home energy management by making use of the onboard battery capability of the Lightning with Ford Intelligent Backup Power.
The three pilots, which are in addition to the collaborations with GM and Ford, will help to inform the Department of Energy Memorandum of Understanding that PG&E and a collaboration of industry, government, and labor leaders signed in April focused on accelerating “vehicle-to-everything” technologies.
“As electric vehicle adoption continues to grow, bidirectional charging technology has huge potential for supporting our customers and the electric grid broadly. We’re excited to launch these new pilots, which will add to our existing work testing and demonstrating the possibility of this technology,” said Jason Glickman, PG&E’s Executive Vice President, Engineering, Planning & Strategy.
PG&E estimates that the pilot programs will cost the utility approximately $11,700,000. Participants in the new pilot programs will be offered financial incentives for their participation, with additional benefits for those in disadvantaged communities, according to the utility. All three are expected to be available to customers in 2022 and 2023 and continue until incentives run out. PG&E will make more information available on its website, with pilots expected to begin in late summer 2022.
PG&E’s Bidirectional Charging Pilot Programs
Residential: In the pilot with residential customers, PG&E will work with automakers and EV charging suppliers to explore how light-duty, passenger EVs at single-family homes can help customers and the electric grid in various ways. These include providing backup power to the home if the power is out, optimizing EV charging and discharging to help the grid integrate more renewable resources, and aligning EV charging and discharging with the real-time cost of energy procurement. This pilot will be open to up to 1,000 residential customers who will receive at least $2,500 for enrolling, and up to an additional $2,175 depending on their participation.
Business: For business customers the pilot aims to explore how medium- and heavy-duty and possibly light-duty EVs at commercial facilities could help customers and the electric grid in various ways. These include providing backup power to the building if the power is out, optimizing EV charging and discharging to support the deferral of distribution grid upgrades, and aligning EV charging and discharging with the real-time cost of energy procurement. This pilot will be open to approximately 200 business customers who will receive at least $2,500 for enrolling, and up to an additional $3,625 depending on their participation.
Microgrid: Through the microgrid pilot, PG&E hopes to learn more about how EVs, plugged into community microgrids, can support community resiliency during Public Safety Power Shutoff events. Customers will be able to discharge their EVs to the community microgrid to support temporary power or charge from the microgrid if there is excess power. Following initial lab testing, this pilot will be open to up to 200 customers with EVs who are located in HFTD locations that contain compatible microgrids used during Public Safety Power Shutoff events. Customers will receive at least $2,500 for enrolling, and up to an additional $3,750 depending on their participation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/09/consumers-energy-seeks-landowners-for-siting-utility-scale-solar-in-michigan/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MICHIGAN",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 9, 2022",Consumers Energy seeks landowners for siting utility scale solar in Michigan,"Michigan utility Consumers Energy has issued a request for landowners to identify locations for utility scale solar facilities in locations around the state. Central to the utility’s clean energy plan is the buildout of 8 GW of solar facilities, half of which will be owned and operated by the utility, the other half by solar developers.
Currently, Consumers Energy is gathering information on ideal sites for solar projects. These sites include farm fields, brownfield sites, and publicly owned properties ranging from 500 to 900 acres, often comprised of multiple neighboring landowners, said the utility. A good solar site is characterized as flat, open, and treeless with direct access to sun and proximity to existing transmission infrastructure.
Participating landowners may sell the property or create an ongoing revenue source by entering into long-term easement agreements.
Consumers Energy targets utility scale projects around 100 MW in capacity, and that its projects will likely require between five to ten acres per megawatt of electricity. Each utility scale project creates hundreds of local construction jobs and can increase a community’s revenue, said the utility.
“We need support throughout Michigan, especially in rural and agricultural areas, and we want to work with landowners and local leaders interested in siting solar power plants to deliver environmental and economic benefits for their communities,” said Dennis Dobbs, vice president of Enterprise Project Management and Environmental Services. “Harnessing the sun is Michigan’s moonshot — and we won’t achieve this historic goal without help.”
Consumers Energy serves 6.8 million residential customers in all of Michigan’s 68 Lower Peninsula counties.
“Our goal is to meet Michigan’s property owners and communities where they are to start a conversation about mutually beneficial solar solutions,” said Dobbs.
If Consumers Energy achieves its goal of 8 GW of solar capacity by 2040, it will power roughly 60% of its operations with carbon-free electricity. This would equate to the removal of 63 million tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to removing 12.4 million gas-burning passenger vehicles from the road for one year. Currently, the utility has added 1.1 GW of solar capacity to come online by 2024.

TurningPoint Energy developed the project under the State of Maryland’s Community Solar Pilot Program, of which Summit Ridge Energy owns the market share, with 90 MW currently in operation. The array was built on Cedar Ridge Community Church’s (CRCC) property and will provide hundreds of subscribed households with lower monthly energy costs.
“This community solar project is the culmination of an excellent partnership between the community and County” Councilmember Tom Hucker said. “In 2018, I spearheaded ZTA 18-01 that allowed for larger solar projects like this one so we can better position ourselves to fight climate change and collectively reduce our carbon footprint.”
ZTA 18-01 was a zoning amendment, passed in 2018, which revised the county’s existing Solar Collection System use standards to allow larger facilities in Rural Residential, Residential, Commercial/Residential, Employment, and Industrial zones.
While the CRCC project is the county’s only ground-mount community solar project thus far, it won’t be for long. In 2021, Ameresco and Neighborhood Sun announced plans to construct a 6 MW project on the capped Oaks Landfill in Gaithersburg, just northwest of Washington, D.C. The 6 MW project will be divided into three 2 MW arrays, with Array 1 set to provide the county government with power. The remaining two arrays compose the community solar project with all of the generated electricity provided to low-to-moderate income residents.
Montgomery County has a local goal of eliminating greenhouse emissions in its operations by 2035, on top of the state of Maryland’s goal to generate 50% of its electricity from renewables by 2030.
In September 2021 regulators in Maryland unanimously voted to expand the capacity of the state’s community solar program as well as improve access for low- and moderate-income (LMI) customer participation in the state’s Community Solar Pilot Program.
According to the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the expansion of the program will allow community solar to power the equivalent of an additional 6,840 Maryland homes, annually. The expansion also changed development regulations, allowing community solar projects to be built on clean-fill construction sites, transforming previously unusable industrial locations into clean solar energy generation sites.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/09/50-states-of-solar-incentives-rhode-island/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,RHODE ISLAND",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 9, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Rhode Island,"Two years ago, Rhode Island was the first state in the nation to set a goal to meet 100% of its electricity demand with renewable energy by 2030. The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources conducted an economic and energy market analysis, and developed policy and plant to meet this goal. Going a step further, last year Governor Dan McKee signed into law the 2021 Act on Climate, which sets mandatory, enforceable climate emissions reduction goals needed for the state to achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050.
With 555.4 MW currently installed, Rhode Island is ranked 29th in country for solar. According to the EIA, Rhode Island residents consume less energy on a per capita basis than any other state and, perhaps as testament to residents’ low electricity use, solar is covering nearly 9% of their electricity needs. The growth projection, according to SEIA, is an additional 438 MW of solar over the next five years.
High electric bills are the impetus for many New Englanders to go solar, as these six northeast states have some of the highest electric rates in the country. Rhode Island has the second highest rates in New England, at 23.56 cents per kWh, an increase of .6% in the past year. This is just behind the Massachusetts rate of 25.28 cents per kWh, due to jump a whopping 13.3%. The EIA reports that In 2020, natural gas fueled 89% of Rhode Island’s electricity net generation, the largest share of any state.
Tax credits and exemptions
For those who seize the opportunity to go solar in United States, the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is currently 26% of system costs. Rhode Island goes a bit further. In 2016 the state passed a bill that exempts qualifying renewable energy systems and associated equipment from property taxes. Qualifying systems include direct solar radiation, wind, ocean, geothermal, small hydro, eligible biomass fuels and fuels cells using renewable resources.
The state also has a feed-in tariff program that could arguably be a model for the nation. The Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth (REGrowth) program offers a 20-year feed-in tariff for non-residential renewable energy projects sized between 25 kW and 5 MW. The program is designed to optimize the price of electricity paid by electricity users. Project owners bid their project price per kilowatt-hour up to a ceiling amount that is designed to be lowered each year. Each solar project must be a standalone system, meaning that it has to have its own electricity meter and sell 100% of its power directly to the electric utility.
An upside to the program is that it allows the owner/occupants to produce as much solar as the roof can support, with 100% of the energy sold to the power grid. But there are a few challenges that have to do with timing and risk, as discussed in “A look inside Rhode Island’s Most successful solar incentive program.”

Net metering
Net metering rules in Rhode Island allow customers to receive credit on electric bills for all power generated up to 125% of the on-site consumption during a billing period. Public entities (municipal, state, quasi-state) are allowed to enter into virtual net metering arrangements with renewable energy developers for up to 10 MW per project site.
Low income
Zero Energy for the Ocean State (ZEOS) is a program that incentivizes zero energy designs that bring cost savings to lower income residents. In a public-sector partnership between OER (DEFINE) and RIHousing have committee $750,000 in funding to three developers to produce a range of building types that ensure replicability of their zero energy designs. One of the projects, Brookside Terrace II, built by Dakota Partners, is a 48-unit rental development in East Greenwich available to households earning less than 60% Area Median Income (AMI). Another project is Bourne Mills III, built by The Armory Revival Company, a 59-unit apartment building in Tiverton. 47 of the units are restricted to households earning 120% or less AMI.
Community solar
Rhode Island also allows Community Choice Aggregation (CEA),  a program that allows a town to buy electricity in bulk with the goal of increasing the renewable content of that electricity. Barrington, Central Falls, Providence and South Kingstown have received approval from the Public Utilities Commission for the program as of May 2021
The state also allows community solar, which is a solar installation shared by more than one household. Its primary purpose is to allow members of a community the opportunity to share the benefits of solar power even if they cannot install solar panels on their property. There are currently 17 community solar projects in the state with 6,240 households signed up for them. Five are virtual net metering and twelve Community Remote Distributed Generation community solar projects.
Clean energy goals
Rhode Island’s Renewable Energy Standard (RES) was established in June 2004 and requires retail electricity probers to supply 38.5% of their retail electricity sales from renewables by 2035. The requirement increases each year—right now the rate of increase is 1.5% through 2025.  One caveat is that the PUC can delay the planned increase if it determines that there’s an inadequate of supply of renewable energy to meet the increase requirement.
Rhode Island’s nickname is the Ocean State, so it’s not surprising that harnessing wind energy is part of its clean energy plan. As of September 31, 2021, the state had installed approximately 1,017 MW of clean energy generation capacity, of which 430 MW was offshore wind, 399 MW solar, 144 MW onshore wind, 35 MW is landfill gas/anaerobic digestion, and 9 MW is small hydroelectric power. The Revolution Wind project, which will be located 15 miles off the Rhode Island coast and expected to be operational in 2025, will supply 400 MW of clean energy to the state. With this addition, wind – both onshore and off—will be the predominant source of renewable energy for the state.
Solar installations, however, in the tiny state of Rhode Island are not insignificant. Many of the solar farms in the state have been relatively small, for example: old Meadow Farms, 16.2 MW; Brown University Dry Bridge Solar, 10 MW; and Alton Road Solar, 13.9 MW. By far the largest portfolio to date is the University Solar project with CS Energy, which was contracted to engineer, procure, and construct a 50.7 MW portfolio of co-located ground mounted solar arrays on a former sand and gravel pit in North Kingstown.
With strong solar policies and an aggressive goal of 100% renewable by 2030, Rhode Island is on pace to meet SEIA’s projection for the growth of solar in Rhode Island, which anticipates an additional 438 MW over the next five years.
Last time on the 50 states of solar incentives tour, pv magazine reviewed Rhode Island’s neighbor of Massachusetts. Next, we will travel to Vermont, concluding the tour of the New England region.

Solar and batteries are beginning to dominate the nation’s energy future.
The US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Electricity Markets and Policy group (EMP) has released their annual power grid queue update. The nation’s queue holds over 1 TWac of generation capacity. The new capacity added to the queue this year exceeds 600 GWac and comes from more than 3,000 unique projects.

Solar photovoltaics in the queue totals 676 GWac/~845 GWdc of capacity at the end of 2021. 85% of the new capacity came from solar plus energy storage facilities. Solar coupled with energy storage now totals more than 285 GWac of capacity in the queue.
Essentially, the utility scale California solar power market is now a solar-plus-storage market. In total, there is more than 400 GW of energy storage capacity in the queue.
 

The EMP team notes that the number of hours of energy storage is not available. This author estimates that the average battery has at least two and a half hours of storage capacity, which would put the total hours of capacity beyond one terawatt hour.
80% of the total solar capacity is scheduled to come online before the end of 2024; however, only 13% of all solar projects have a signed interconnection agreement. The report points out that in some markets, interconnection is secured before a project finds an off taker. In these markets, some projects that get approved for interconnection do not get built.
This point is brought home when the full sample is shared and we see that almost three times as many projects are withdrawn than are operational:
The completion rate of solar, across all regions, is 16% — lower than the national average.
And if we’re doing analogies, the proof is in PJM’s pudding — the grid management group states that they are overwhelmed with solar power and wind applications, and that they propose to shut down all new interconnection applications for the next two years as they reassess their processes.
From 2015 through 2021, the report sees that the time it takes to get from from submission, to interconnection, to approval for interconnecting has increased sharply to greater then 3 years — except in Texas’ ERCOT territory.

Among all of these challenges, one statistic shines a light. Last year, pv magazine USA reported that the current queue already meets 85% of the estimated 1.1 TWac of capacity needed to clean our power grid. EMP’s report, released this year, confirms that number.
Additionally, the volume of capacity covered in this document only includes utility scale projects from 85% of national utilities. For instance, the hundreds of megawatts of capacity being deployed in Hawaii, the gigawatts of New York Community distributed solar, and the Massachusetts’ behind the meter market, are not counted.
At a minimum, 6.6 GW of the capacity deployed in 2021 would not have made the list.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/09/western-and-southeastern-utilities-progress-in-advancing-194-gw-of-solar-projects-is-a-mystery/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,FLORIDA,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 9, 2022",Western and Southeastern utilities’ progress in advancing 194 GW of solar projects is a mystery,"To build a utility scale solar project, a developer must get in line and wait for a facilities study from the transmission provider. That study specifies the infrastructure needed to connect the planned project to the grid, and its cost. The project developer can then pay that cost and sign an interconnection agreement that obligates the transmission provider to build the infrastructure. The project can then be built. A simplified process diagram prepared by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab is shown in the nearby image.

Yet for all the publicity about the vast amounts of solar and storage projects in the interconnection waiting lists, or queues, data are sparse regarding the pace at which transmission providers complete facilities studies, so that the projects may be built.
Solar project developers have recently highlighted the problem of delays by transmission providers and high cost quotes for interconnection facilities.  Solar-focused trade associations have said that interconnection studies could be completed in months, not years, and have asked federal energy regulators to speed the process by establishing enforceable timelines and competition. And a law professor has suggested public control of regional grid operators, also known as RTOs and ISOs.
Because regional grid operators are the transmission providers in most of the U.S., much of the attention so far has focused on them.
But in the Southeast and much of the West, there is no RTO or ISO, and utilities are the transmission providers. Solar projects totaling 136 GW are waiting in the interconnection queues of utilities in the West, as shown in the featured image above, and 58 GW are in the queues of utilities in the Southeast, as shown in a Berkeley Lab report.
So we reached out to 10 utilities in each region that have the largest amounts of solar in their queues, to ask about the facilities studies for solar projects they completed last year.
Only one, Los Angeles municipal utility LADWP, provided the requested information, reporting that it completed facilities studies for 835 MW of third-party solar projects last year, and for 530 MW of third-party storage, with both values including solar-plus-storage projects.
Berkeley Lab studies
Berkeley Lab reported last month on power plants seeking transmission interconnection as of year-end 2021, based on publicly reported data on interconnection queues and non-public information. Their study sampled 30 projects that entered interconnection agreements with Western “non-ISO” utilities in 2021, and found those projects had been in the queue for a median of about 32 months; in other words, half had been waiting longer. The study reported that interconnection requests have soared nationwide in recent years, with requests totaling over 600 GW added in 2021, which suggests that wait times could increase unless transmission providers have increased their capacity to complete studies.
Berkeley Lab analysts noted in a February study that although the federal energy regulator FERC requires transmission providers to provide data on their pace of completing interconnection studies, under FERC Order 845, “trends are not yet apparent” for the RTOs and ISOs they studied, because those data only became available beginning in January 2020, for a total of 21 months at the time of that study, while the time from an interconnection request to an interconnection agreement is typically longer than 21 months. They said they did not collect data that are available for some “non-ISO” transmission providers, that is, utilities in the West and Southeast.
Some utilities in the West and Southeast operate in a single state, suggesting that FERC’s Order 845, as a federal regulation, may not apply to them. Jeff Dennis, managing director and general counsel of trade group Advanced Energy Economy, said that while “some utilities in the West and Southeast are not subject to full FERC regulation, nonetheless, FERC rules can still influence their practices.”
Berkeley Lab is now preparing an interconnection cost analysis for six RTOs and ISOs, which will use a random subsampling analysis because “data collection is labor intensive (i.e., manual PDF scraping).”
Related data
Several utilities provided related data in response to our inquiry. PacifiCorp said that it completed a cluster study last November for projects totaling 7.7 GW of third-party solar and 49 MW of third-party storage at nine cluster locations. The study shows the costs of interconnection facilities in each cluster location, which would be allocated across projects in that location. Facilities studies for those projects are under way, said a company spokesperson, while restudies on many cluster locations are needed, due to the “significant” number of projects withdrawing.
PacifiCorp would require about 72 months, or six years, to complete the interconnection facilities after execution of interconnection agreements, the cluster study says. The utility serves customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho.
Duke Energy provided information on feasibility studies and system impact studies, but not on final facilities studies, for its three operating companies in the Southeast.
A spokesperson for Tampa Electric in Florida said that the data we requested was “not public information.”
Utility PNM, which serves New Mexico, provided a response but did not provide a requested clarification.
