Researchers in Australia have looked at how rooftop PV generation used to run air conditioners (AC) to pre-cool residential and commercial buildings may improve cost savings for households, while mitigating the so-called duck curve.
The proposed solar pre-cooling concept, which the scientists developed in previous research, considers the thermal mass of buildings as a virtual battery that could be used to shift or shave peak demand caused by AC systems. It can be implemented in all kinds of buildings that have an AC unit and can be more beneficial if the surplus PV generation during the day is used to pre-cool the building instead of importing electricity from the grid. The AC unit is switched on before peak demand hours with lower thermostat setpoints to pre-cool a household’s thermal mass and indoor air.
“In our previous study, we only simulated pre-cooling,” the report’s lead author, Shayan Naderi, told pv magazine. “The novelty of our new work consists of using measured AC demand, PV generation, and household load profile, and clustering households based on their load shape. We also calculated the benefits of solar pre-cooling for different groups of households and building types.”
The analysis considered the feed-in tariffs (FITs) that are currently paid in Australia for residential rooftop PV generation, three different categories of residential building types dubbed 2-, 6-, and 8-star homes representing old, new, or renovated houses, respectively, and their net demand profiles. For each star rating, three different construction weights were simulated for Adelaide, Melbourne, Sidney, and Brisbane.
The analysis also considered maximum demand reduction, minimum demand mitigation, peak import reduction, self-consumption improvement, and cost savings. It was carried out with a dataset provided by monitoring and energy management services provider Australia-based Solar Analytics Pty. Ltd, which includes hourly data for net demand, AC demand, and PV generation of 349 households during the period from December 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019.
“The temporal pattern of PV generation and household demand are contributing factors to solar pre-cooling potential,” the researches emphasized. “There is a significant difference between the overall magnitude of average hourly AC excluded net demand profiles across the houses.”
They identified four dominant clusters of AC excluded net demand profiles across the 349 households and said only one of the clusters, representing only 3% of the households, does not provide solar pre-cooling technical and economic potential. “The other three clusters, representing 97% of the solar homes analyzed, have a duck shaped AC excluded net demand and offer demand profile improvement through solar pre-cooling,” they said, noting that these results are achieved regardless of the building’s energy efficiency.
The improvement of ‘flattening’ demand profile is mainly due to minimum demand mitigation, with a maximum PV system capacity of 4 kW. The action of solar pre-cooling, meanwhile, was found to be mainly limited by AC size and surplus PV generation, and not by the thermal comfort of occupants.
The research’s findings were revealed in the paper “Clustering-based analysis of residential duck curve mitigation through solar pre-cooling: A case study of Australian housing stock,” published in Renewable Energy. The research group comprises scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of New South Wales (UNSW).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/14/u-s-startup-to-produce-perovskite-glass-for-tandem-modules/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 14, 2023",U.S. startup to produce perovskite glass for tandem modules,"Perovskite technology startup Caelux announced it has secured a series A funding of $12 million, bringing total funding to $24 million to develop and commercialize its perovskite glass for tandem use. The company will open a 100 MW perovskite-glass manufacturing facility outside of Los Angeles, California.
Caelux said tandem cells using its technology can push efficiencies past 30%, while retaining the same cost per Watt.
Perovskites are under focus for many global research teams as an abundant, highly efficient photovoltaic material, but they suffer from resilience and lifecycle limitations. New records of efficiency and stability are continually being demonstrated in laboratories, moving the technology closer to commercialization.
Caelux is among first movers on this road to commercialization as it netted the new Series A fund in a round led by Temasek with participation Reliance New Energy, Khosla Ventures, Mitsui Fudosan and Fine Structure Ventures.
The company has developed a method for depositing a perovskite layer in glass, enabling it to be readily integrated with existing solar cell manufacturing lines for a boost in module output. Caelux said its solar glass alone offers greater than 17% efficiency, and when deposited in tandem with other cell technologies, it can boost the overall conversion efficiency rating by six percentage points.
Caelux said its perovskite glass layer can be deposited in existing manufacturing processes with minimal changes to the facility. It is technology-agnostic, allowing for integration with all conventional cell technologies, including PERC, HJT and TOPCon.
“This investment will support our mission to usher in the next generation of solar innovation, including our production of full-size perovskite sub-modules,” said Scott Graybeal, chief executive officer, Caelux. “We are excited to have attracted visionary, global investors to help us on our journey to multi-gigawatt scale.”
The company said its U.S.-made perovskite-glass sub-module, called Caelux One, qualifies as a solar cell under Treasury Department analysis, making it eligible for manufacturing tax credits as well as contributing to a project’s domestic content percentage.
“Companies should be incentivized to scoop us up into part of their manufacturing value chain, because now they have a solar cell that was produced right here in the United States,” said Leslie Chang, director of strategy and policy, Caelux in an interview with Solar Power World. “By incorporating Caelux, not only are you able to increase the overall power conversion efficiency of your module, but also you better qualify for these domestic content regulations.”
The company said it targets a commercial launch of Caelux One in 2024, with aims to secure Series B funding and reach gigawatt-scale production after launch.
In June, another U.S. manufacturer, CubicPV, secured equity commitments in excess of $100 million to scale a U.S. solar wafer production facility. Formed in 2021 in a merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, the company has a history with perovskite development, and said it will continue its research and development of tandem modules as part of the funding led by SCG Cleanergy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/14/top-five-solar-inverter-vendors-accounted-for-71-of-shipments-in-2022/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 14, 2023",Top five solar inverter vendors accounted for 71% of shipments in 2022,"The top 10 global solar inverter vendors accounted for 86% of market share in 2022, increasing by 4% year-over-year since 2021, according to a recent study by Wood Mackenzie.
The market grew 48% year-over-year, attributed to the ease in supply chain challenges, coupled by strong government support, as seen in the U.S. with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Wood Mackenzie noted that the top five vendors shipped more than 200 GWac and accounted for 71% of total global PV inverter shipments in 2022, up 8% from 2021. The report notes that 2022 top vendor Huawei shipment increased 83%. Ginlong Solis posted growth of 86%.

For the eighth consecutive year, the top two vendors were Huawei and Sungrow. Huawei held the first position with a 29% market share in 2022. Sungrow, winner of the pv magazine award in 2021 and in the “highly recommended” category in 2022, increased its market share two percentage points, from 21% in 2021 to 23% in 2022. Ginlong Solis moved up to third place in 2022, driven by the company’s shipments in China.
The top eight vendors of 2021 were very similar to the lineup in 2022, with only Ginlong Solis and Growatt swapping third and fourth positions from 2021. Aiswei and Sofar jumped up three ranks to enter the top 10 ranking, holding the ninth and tenth positions respectively in 2022. In the APAC region, China led the market with 78% of inverter shipments as solar experienced unprecedented growth. India retained its position as the second largest inverter market in APAC in 2022, but Wood Mackenzie estimates that it had a 25% decrease in shipments year-over-year. Japan had 7 GWac of inverters enter the country, overtaking Australia as the third strongest market with growth of 23% year-over-year growth.
The European region experienced the highest shipment growth with an 82% increase in 2022, following its 44% year-over-year growth in 2021. Wood Mackenzie attributes this to the move toward carbon neutrality by 2050, as part of the European Green Deal plan. Europe accounted for 28% of the global market with 92 GWac shipped.
While the U.S. market is beginning a strong growth trajectory, it accounted for only 13% of the global market with 42 GWac shipped to the country. Solar-plus-storage hybrid inverters made up 10% of the regional shipments as the curtailment of net metering in some markets are leading to a strong energy storage market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/14/over-155-gw-of-u-s-solar-manufacturing-announced-in-one-year/,"LOOKING BACK,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 14, 2023",Over 155 GW of U.S. solar manufacturing announced in one year,"One year ago this week, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law, marking the largest climate and energy spending package in U.S. history. Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is dedicated to supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience.
The IRA mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. It also targeted a return to domestic manufacturing in the United States, bringing jobs and supply chains back onshore. About $60 billion within IRA is directed towards U.S. manufacturing.
One year later, over $100 billion in private investment has been announced, leading to the establishment of 51 new facilities or significant expansions, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
“The unprecedented surge in demand for American-made clean energy is a clear sign that the clean energy incentives enacted last year by Congress are working,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.
SEIA shared that over 155 GW of solar supply chain capacity expansions have already been announced, leading to an estimated $20 billion investment in U.S. communities. The production additions include:
By 2026, it is forecast that the U.S. will have over 17 times its current capacity across modules, cells, wafers, ingots, and inverters once these facilities reach operations. Over 20,000 U.S. jobs are expected too be created by these facilities, and the U.S. solar manufacturing workforce is set to triple to over 100,000 over the next decade.
Additionally, over 65 GWh of energy storage manufacturing capacity has been announced across 14 new or expanded facilities. Since the IRA was passed, over 3 GW of large-scale energy storage projects have been deployed, and an estimated 100,000 customers have installed a residential solar system paired with battery storage.
“We’ve often dealt with the buy side, through continued tax credits for projects. That really helps installers and developers and end-users,” said George Hershman, SEIA board director and SOLV Energy chief executive officer in an interview with pv magazine USA.
“But we really never dealt with how we are going to get product, the supply side. I think the IRA did a great job with supporting the supply side to ensure we build the manufacturing supply chain in the U.S. that we all want to be able to deploy,” Hershman said.
As for political threats to IRA, there have been attempts to overturn it or strip core provisions, but Hershman said that early and continued success will de-fang any attempts to throw out the landmark industrial policy.
“We want to win the win,” he said. “We all want to be in a position where we can cut ribbons and put shovels in the ground and say the IRA brought this project to your community. A lot of these projects are in Red counties and Red districts. It’s much harder to fight against a bill that’s bringing jobs and property tax revenues to your district.”
E2 reported that Republican districts accounted for 60% of the jobs estimated to be created and 63% of the new investment under IRA. Over 74,000 direct jobs have been created by these manufacturing announcements, according to an E2 report.
SEIA forecasts that the solar industry will generate over $565 billion in private sector investment over the next decade. By 2033, cumulative solar capacity will reach 668 GW, enough to power every home east of the Mississippi River. This is also equivalent to offsetting 459 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year, representing about one-third of all power sector emissions based on 2021 levels.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/14/amogy-eyes-commercialization-of-zero-emission-ammonia-powered-semi-truck/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 14, 2023","Amogy eyes commercialization of zero-emission, ammonia-powered semi-truck","Amogy Inc. has successfully tested a first-of-its-kind zero-emission semi-truck that is powered by ammonia, and soon plans to launch commercialization efforts by beginning to produce the product at scale, Seonghoon Woo, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told pv magazine USA. 
Amogy tested its 300 kW semi-truck in early 2023 and its team is now focused on retrofitting a tugboat, which was originally powered with diesel and electric motor, to be the world’s first ammonia-powered vessel, according to Woo. After completing this demonstration, it will launch commercialization efforts and has already started accepting pre-orders from some customers, to be commercially deployed in 2024.
“We are looking at larger production from 2025 or 2026,” said Woo. 
The heavy-duty trucking industry represents 23% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and is particularly difficult to decarbonize, since battery power doesn’t necessarily have the energy density to replace fossil fuels for larger vehicles over long distances. Amogy said its ammonia-to-power technology could present a solution for the sector. 
The company has developed a compact, high-efficiency chemical reactor to split ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen, and the hydrogen is then sent to a fuel cell to generate power. The technology is easier to integrate into existing infrastructure, according to Woo, and using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier also makes it easier to store and distribute.
“Our technology leverages the superior physical characteristics of liquid ammonia with the performance advantages of hydrogen,” said Woo. 
Amogy started off by integrating its technology into a 5 kW drone in mid-2021, and then a 100 kW tractor in May 2022. With the semi-truck, it has now scaled up to 300 kW and the latest work on the tugboat will use a 1 MW version of its ammonia-to-power system. 
Amogy was founded in 2020 and its investors include Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund and Saudi Aramco. In May, the company announced a memorandum of understanding with LSB Industries that will focus on encouraging the adoption of ammonia as a marine fuel, beginning with inland waterways transportation in the U.S. The companies plan to roll out a pilot program that combines LSB’s low-carbon ammonia and Amogy’s technology.
Public policy and private investment are shaping the path for ammonia to emerge as a viable clean energy source, and a stable and predictable business and political environment is key to continued investment in the area, Woo said. Many parts of the world – like the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, Australia and the Middle East – are increasing green ammonia production efforts, and Norway has established regulatory frameworks for safe and rational ammonia usage guidelines.  
“Though there will be challenges, the advancement of ammonia-to-power technology must grow alongside the scale of green ammonia production and both must be encouraged by public policy,” Woo said.
