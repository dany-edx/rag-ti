The projects will generate 30 MW of clean energy, equivalent to the power used by one-third of the county’s municipal buildings, including government facilities. The installations will be located on the closed Hernwood and Parkton landfills, and will be the first large-scale solar energy projects in the county.
Construction is expected to begin in 2022 and the two will enter service by 2023.
Under power purchase agreements (PPAs), the county will pay no upfront costs; SunPower and its financiers will cover the cost of developing and constructing the arrays. Over the 25-year PPA timeline, Baltimore County will pay a flat, fixed rate per kilowatt-hour. Through Maryland’s aggregate net metering rule, Baltimore Gas & Electric will credit the solar generated at the landfills against electric loads at other county buildings.
The two installations will provide a big first step towards helping the county reach its sustainability goals, which were announced April 21. County Executive Johnny Olszewski signed an Executive Order setting a goal to complete future renewable energy projects to meet 100% of Baltimore County’s electricity demand by 2026 and 125% by 2030.
In 2016, the prior administration announced a goal to generate or displace at least 20% of the county’s electric demand from renewable energy sources by 2022. With the announcement of the two landfill projects, that goal is expected to be achieved.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/21/5-state-policy-actions-that-are-shaping-distributed-solars-future/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 21, 2021",5 state policy actions that are shaping distributed solar’s future,"During the first quarter of 2021, 42 states plus D.C. took a total of 155 actions related to distributed solar policy and rate design. That’s according to the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center’s (NCCETC)  Q1 2021 edition of The 50 States of Solar. The quarterly series provides insights on state regulatory and legislative discussions and actions on distributed solar policy.
Of the 155 actions, the most common were related to distributed generation compensation rules (51 actions across 27 states), followed by community solar (33 actions, 19 states), and residential fixed charge and minimum bill increases (23 actions, 15 states plus D.C.).
The report found that activity related to fees based on distributed generation system capacity continued to rise during the first quarter. Many states also have begun to revisit net metering successor tariffs, and also are looking at ways to expand the availability of net metering by increasing system size or aggregate capacity limits.
The report also highlights five policy developments from the quarter that the authors deemed to be especially impactful or relevant.
In February, Connecticut regulators issued a decision approving two net metering successor tariff options. One is a buy-all, sell-all tariff with a fixed compensation rate. The other is a netting tariff using a monthly netting interval and an export credit rate set at the applicable retail rate. Both tariffs include a 20-year term, and utilities are to file proposals for non-bypassable charge designs by January 2022.
Next up is New Mexico’s SB 84, a bill recently passed into law that sets the groundwork for a statewide community solar program in 2022. The program includes a 30% capacity carveout for low-income people and service organizations.
The report also highlighted the flurry of proposed tariff designs for California’s Net Metering 3.0 initiative. It has become a hot topic since utilities Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and Southern California Edison filed their joint proposal in late March.
And although Kansas may not be a state that you would typically think of as at the forefront of distributed generation legislative action, the report reviews a regulatory rejection of Evergy’s proposal to replace its distributed generation customer demand charge with a grid access charge, arguing that the new charge discriminated against solar. THe utility also proposed a Minimum Bill, an amount that all electric customers would have to pay, regardless of usage, though this was rejected due to the negative impact on low income customers it would have.
The last state focus included action in West Virginia’s House that passed legislation in March authorizing the use of third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs) for solar systems that are designed to meet the electrical needs of different customer levels. The news is significant, as West Virginia is one of seven states where third-party PPAs are disallowed. The state Senate passed the bill in April, and the legislation is awaiting action by the governor.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/21/americas-set-to-lead-global-energy-storage-deployments-wood-mac-says/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 21, 2021","Americas set to lead global energy storage deployments, Wood Mac says","New research from Wood Mackenzie says that the Americas region will overtake Asia Pacific by 2025 to lead the global energy storage market, with a total capacity of 371 GWh in 2030.
Most of this growth is expected to come from the U.S. The firm said that China will place second (150 GWh), and Japan will take third place (25 GWh) by the end of the decade.
The expected slowdown in Asia Pacific is partly due to challenges from market incentives and business cases. Although Asia Pacific led the global storage market in 2020, with deployments reaching 13 GWh, growth has mainly relied on pilots, government subsidies, and grid interconnection requirements over the past decade. Without strong policy support, the report said, it will be difficult to scale up the front-of-the-meter (FTM) segment across the region.
Meanwhile, the U.S. tripled storage installations in 2020, accounting for 38% of new capacity. China, Germany, and the UK recorded double-digit growth during the pandemic, and Australia’s installations fell in year-on-year numbers.
Steady growth in a number of key countries during the coronavirus pandemic and strong recovery in 2021 will accelerate global energy storage adoption in the long term, said Wood Mackenzie.
The firm said that 2020 was a record year for global energy storage. The market exceeded 15 GW/27 GWh, increasing 51% in gigawatt-hour terms. The market and is expected to add 70 GWh of storage capacity each year to surpass 729 GWh in 2030.
The firm said that around $5.4 billion of new investment was committed to storage projects across the world last year, increasing the total cumulative investment to an estimated $22 billion. By 2025, the overall investment will reach $86 billion, with a 24% cumulative annual growth rate despite the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19.
As noted in Wood Mackenzie’s report, the global market began to move from small-scale short-duration batteries to four-hour batteries last year due to coronavirus impacts. The pandemic caused power demand to fall in 2020, putting downward pressure on wholesale power prices and reducing the need for peaking units. Long-duration batteries helped to strengthen grid reliability and reduce the risks of power outages during. By 2030, the average lithium-ion project size will increase from 100 MWh scale to 1 GWh scale.
The Wood Mackenzie report said that Europe’s market development has been slower than its U.S. and Chinese counterparts. However, development will accelerate as European member states are required to comply with the Renewable Energy Directive, current over-capacities in electricity markets are reduced with nuclear, and coal exits take place.
According to Wood Mackenzie, Europe will deploy around 3 GWh of energy storage capacity in 2021, a 55% increase from 2020, and will see cumulative capacity hit 9 GWh by the end of the year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/21/add-electric-vehicles-not-bulk-transmission-for-a-low-cost-clean-grid-uc-berkeley-study/,"EV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 21, 2021","Add electric vehicles, not bulk transmission, for a low-cost, clean grid: UC Berkeley study","Transitioning new vehicle sales to electric vehicles (EVs) would support greater deployment of low-cost solar and battery storage, reducing wholesale power costs below current levels, said a report from UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy. Consumers would also save on vehicle purchase and operating costs.
To meet the increased electricity demand from an EV transition in the early 2030s, additions of solar capacity would double, and storage additions would triple. Those additions were in comparison to a scenario without vehicle electrification that a UC Berkeley-led team analyzed in a report last year.

Transmission investment needed in either scenario would mainly be short transmission spurs connecting new renewable generation to existing transmission “rather than new investments in bulk transmission,” said the study, which was based on computer modeling. The authors said that recent studies that account for low renewable energy and battery storage costs indicate similar findings.
Vehicle owners would also save with an EV transition, as purchase prices for electric vehicles were projected to dip below those for internal combustion vehicles in the early 2030s. That drop is due in part to expected battery pack cost declines to $61 per kWh capacity by 2030. EVs were projected to have lower operating costs as well.
To power the electric vehicle scenario with clean energy would require adding an average of 73 GW of solar and 30 GW of wind capacity per year through 2035, plus 28 GW of battery storage per year.
The “ambitious target” for renewable and storage additions under the electric vehicle scenario would require policy support, the authors said. A companion report offered policy recommendations.
The electric vehicle scenario would reach 88% clean power by 2035, including existing hydropower and nuclear power. Existing gas units would provide the remaining power and help ensure power reliability at all times.
The study used the same modeling tools and renewable energy cost assumptions as in last year’s “90% clean” analysis from UC Berkeley. The study’s co-lead authors, Amol Phadke and Nikit Abhyankar of UC Berkeley, were joined by 12 co-authors from UC Berkeley, GridLab, Energy Innovation and UCLA. The study was funded by ClimateWorks Foundation, GridLab and others.

Once complete, the solar facility is expected to deliver nearly 600,000 MWh annually of renewable energy for local Amazon operations.
Earlier, Amazon announced nine new utility-scale solar and wind energy projects in the U.S., Canada, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Amazon said it aims to power 100% of its activities with renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of its original goal of 2030.
The Ohio solar project will be located in Auglaize and Allen counties and will represent an estimated $314-364 million of investment by Lightsource bp and project backers.
Oklahoma Gas and Electric said it will expand its Choctaw Nation/OG&E Solar Energy Center in southern Oklahoma by 5 MW bringing the total solar capacity to 10 MW. OG&E will build, own, and operate the expansion, which is expected to come online by the end of 2021.
OG&E is also building a 5 MW solar facility in western Arkansas which should be completed in the second half of 2021. That project will be the company’s first universal solar offering to Arkansas customers.
Universal solar offers the opportunity for customers to add solar energy to their personal energy portfolios. Part of the new solar expansion in Durant, Oklahoma, will be available for all of the utility’s Oklahoma-based customers.
Montana-based NorthWestern Energy plans to use a 50 MW lithium-ion battery storage system as one of several resources to deliver 325 MW of new dispatchable capacity resources.
The utility also agreed to acquire energy from a 175 MW natural gas plant and 100 MW of predominantly hydroelectric resources from BC Hydro. State regulators now need to approve the new resources.
The contracts were entered into as part of the utility’s competitive solicitation process for long-term capacity resources issued in January 2020. The new capacity is expected to address more than half of NorthWestern Energy’s expected deficit in its Montana supply portfolio. It said the shortfall is becoming more critical as some coal plants and other capacity resources are being shut down.
The battery energy storage system is expected to be available by the end of 2023, and will enable the utility to store excess wind energy.
Sungrow said it supplied 34 inverters for a 127.5 MW solar facility in Wapello, Iowa, in the state’s far eastern part. The Wapello Solar project was developed by Clēnera and constructed by RES.
One of the largest solar projects in Iowa, Wapello Solar entered service in early March. The project includes 318,000 Risen Energy bifacial solar panels, which are fixed to FTC Solar’s Voyager single-axis trackers.
Sunnova Energy International said it will begin offering services in Ohio and North Carolina. Both states will have access to Sunnova’s SunSafe solar + battery storage service, and +SunSafe add-on battery service. Sunnova said it will be one of the first national residential solar and energy storage service providers to enter the Ohio market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/21/texas-is-poised-for-major-growth-in-solar-energy-eia-says/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 21, 2021","Texas is poised for major growth in solar energy, EIA says","Solar is on track to make up the largest share of new capacity additions in Texas between 2020 and 2022. Almost 50% of the additions during this time period will be solar, surpassing wind (35%) and natural gas (13%) additions, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA).
EIA said that California currently has the most installed utility-scale solar capacity of any state. But Texas is expected to add 10 GW of utility-scale solar capacity by the end of 2022, compared with 3.2 GW in California. One-third of the utility-scale solar capacity planned to come online in the United States in the next two years (30 GW) will be in the Lone Star State.

EIA said that the installation of 2.5 GW of solar capacity in 2020 marked the beginning of the Texas solar boom. The state is expected to add another 4.6 GW of solar capacity this year and 5.4 GW in 2022, which will bring total installed solar capacity in Texas to 14.9 GW.
Utility-scale solar projects that start construction in 2021 or 2022 are eligible for a 26% tax credit. The tax credit drops to 22% for projects that start in 2023 and to 10% for projects that start in 2024 or later.
Other factors driving solar investment in Texas include lower solar technology costs and plentiful sunlight, particularly in West Texas’s Permian Basin, where about 30% of the state’s planned solar capacity will be built.
In addition, because solar generation is greatest in the middle of the day, when wind generation is typically lower, available transmission lines that already handle the large amount of wind power in the state will help solar capacity additions.
Despite recent solar capacity growth in Texas, utility-scale solar only made up 4% of the state’s generating capacity in 2020 and 2% of in-state electricity generation. In comparison, natural gas made up 53% of Texas’s capacity in 2020 and 52% of in-state generation; wind made up 23% of capacity and 20% of in-state generation.
