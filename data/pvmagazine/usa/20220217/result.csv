NREL’s base case for its computer modeling will reflect the renewable generation milestones set by Puerto Rico’s Act 17: 20% renewable generation by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
Within six months, NREL aims to achieve “a highly involved stakeholder group” to help identify initial scenarios that may be evaluated “to achieve Puerto Rico’s goals,” said the study’s co-principal investigator Murali Baggu.
The study process will aim for “equitable access to the planning process and benefit,” said Baggu. Modeling of generation options will include distributed generation, he said.
Both of Puerto Rico’s utilities, generation utility PREPA and transmission and distribution utility Luma Energy, are represented on the study’s steering committee. NREL will work closely with the utilities to ensure that study results may be used in their planning processes, including PREPA’s next resource plan, said an NREL spokesperson. A PREPA engineer said the utility looked forward to the study’s guidance on how PREPA may make electrical system investments in the most efficient sequence.
The Solar + Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA) and the utilities are represented on an advisory committee that includes academics, municipal officials and civic group representatives.
NREL reported that Puerto Rico has 20GW of utility-scale solar potential, mostly along the coasts, and 20GW of distributed solar potential. Just 10GW of solar could meet Puerto Rico’s needs, as estimated by SESA President PJ Wilson.
NREL will also examine the potential for onshore and offshore wind, storage, and hydropower.
SESA’s Chief Policy Officer Javier Rúa said the study “represents the commitment that we’ve seen by the Biden administration and the agencies to help Puerto Rico fulfill its self-legislated goal to 100 percent renewables.” Wilson expects the study will be “a big step towards every Puerto Rican having solar and storage and completely resilient power during the next hurricane.”
In opening remarks, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the study represents “the latest effort in our administration’s partnership with Puerto Rico to seize the enormous opportunity of clean energy. It’s not just about making the air cleaner, it’s also about creating jobs, installing renewables across the island, and lowering energy costs for Puerto Ricans.”
An analysis last year from nonprofit groups Cambio and IEEFA concluded that distributed solar and storage could provide 75% of Puerto Rico’s power.
Earlier this month, PREPA submitted 18 solar projects totaling 845MW to the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau. The bureau approved those projects, and they are now awaiting approval from Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight and Management Board.
NREL said that its webinar on the 100% study drew 550 participants. Five other national laboratories are assisting in the study. NREL previously completed a 100% renewables study for Los Angeles.

The company’s PEAK IQ uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to ensure energy is stored and dispatched at the most strategic times.
With Convergent’s energy storage systems providing resource adequacy, or the ability of a utilities’ supply to meet customer demand, they are also designed to improve grid reliability and renewables integration.  The battery storage systems are shortening the distance between where most of the energy is produced versus where it is consumed, which in this case, the Los Angeles basin. The LA Basin is in other news today, as Southern California Gas Company is submitting an application to build the “Angeles Link“, or what is being called the nation’s largest “hydrogen energy infrastructure system” to deliver renewable energy generated hydrogen to the area.
Energy storage is essential to reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and Convergent is proud to continue demonstrating its value to customers and communities through innovative partners like SCE in strategic California locations at the forefront of change,” said Johannes Rittershausen, Convergent CEO.
New York-based Convergent was launched as a startup in 2011 to develop, owns and operates large-scale storage for industrial customers and utilities. It initially self-funded its projects, raising $70 million to do so. Acquired by Energy Capital Partners in 2019, the company now has over $400 million invested in or committed to projects in operation or under development in 40 states and the Province of Ontario.

Eligible projects must be at least 50MW in capacity, with the option to include a battery-energy storage system.
The RFP was issued as part of provisions set by West Virginia Senate Bill 583, a 2020 law focused on boosting renewable energy in the state. Project bids that are located on eligible sites as defined by Bill 583 will be given preference, said Appalachian Power. The sites include previous electrical generation facilities, industrial, manufacturing, or mining sites, brownfields, closed landfills, or hazardous waste sites.
Proposals are due by March 31st, 2022. The projects must be interconnected with the PJM regional transmission organization and operational by no later than December 15, 2025, to qualify for the federal investment tax credit.
This is the second large-scale procurement of solar onset by Bill 583, with the first resulting in a 50MW solar project in Berkeley County. “We are ready and eager to build on that success,” said Chris Beam, Appalachian Power president and COO. 
Appalachian Power operates 5.9GW of renewable energy capacity. It has 1 million customers spanning Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee.
As part of its long-range plan to meet the renewable energy targets established by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), the utility also intends to add approximately 3,300 MW of solar, 2,600 MW of energy storage and nearly 3,000 MW of onshore wind to its current portfolio by 2040. The VCEA requires all utilities operating within the commonwealth to file an annual plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) outlining how it will meet key mandates as it reaches 100% carbon-free status by 2050.
Earlier this year, Appalachian Power acquired the Firefly Energy solar project in Virginia, a 150MW project, and the utility’s largest to date. The project was developed by Recurrent Energy. Pending local and state permits and other regulatory approvals, construction of the project is expected to start in early 2023 and reach commercial operation in 2024.

The investment was made through the companies’ previously-announced $250 million partnership to fund solar and other clean energy infrastructure assets to be developed by Soltage.
This time, the two companies have invested $52 million in a 31MW portfolio of five solar projects set to be constructed in South Carolina and Illinois. The portfolio consists of one project in Illinois and four projects in South Carolina, and the electricity generated from these projects will be sold to municipal, commercial and residential community solar customers, as well as local utilities.
“We are proud to announce this investment, building on our 15-year track record of developing and investing in renewable energy assets to serve our diverse base of electricity consumers,” said Soltage Co-Founder and CEO, Jesse Grossman.
Soltage and Harrison Street first announced their $250 million partnership in March 2021, and under it, the two plan to deploy 450 MW of distributed solar and storage projects across the U.S. All assets developed will be owned by the partnership and operated by Soltage.
The first was in a 14.5MW portfolio of solar assets representing $30 million of project costs. The projects entered service in 2021 across five sites in Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
In August 2021, the two announced a joint investment in a 20MW project portfolio of community solar assets and Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) solar projects located in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Maine.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/17/community-solar-project-in-virginia-launch-25-renewable-energy-option-for-a-small-premium/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022",Community solar project in Virginia launches 25% renewable energy option for a small premium,"Harrisonburg Electric Commission (HEC) will vote in March on a community solar plan, which–if approved–will go live in July, making HEC the first municipal utility in the state of Virginia offering its customers the community solar option.
The 1.4MW Acorn Solar installation is being developed by Dominion Energy on a 10-acre plot of land that Harrisonburg purchased for $550,000. According to HEC, the installation is projected to generate about 3 million kilowatt hours of electricity, or enough to power about 250 homes. The solar plant is being constructed by Charlottesville-based Sun Tribe Solar. HEC is contracted to purchase power through from Dominion until 2031.
If approved, HEC plans to launch its community solar program, dubbed “HEC’s Friendly City Solar Program,” in the summer of 2022. Residential customers will be able to purchase renewable energy in 50kWh blocks, up to 25% of their average monthly usage. The cost of each 50 kWh block will be $5.75, which is about $1.50 more than the current cost 50kWh of electricity through HEC, and pricing will be fixed for the customer for 25 years. Customers who subscribe at the maximum level will pay on average an additional $90/year to be 25% renewable (based on an average usage of 1,000 kWh/month).
 
 

Back in 2017 Virginia was lagging behind other states in solar energy adoption, then Virginia Senate Bill SB 1393 was signed into law and the tide turned. It was that bill, for example, that motivated Dominion Energy to launch its Community Solar Pilot Program in May of 2017. Today Virginia generates 3.25% of its electricity from solar and it’s ranked ninth in the nation for installed solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/17/solar-cells-used-for-high-speed-underwater-wireless-data-transmission/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022",Solar cells used for high-speed underwater wireless data transmission,"Solar cells may have found a surprising new use case beyond electricity production; they are now being tested as underwater wireless data transmitters. Researchers are connecting arrays of series-connected solar cells to operate lens-free detectors that benefit from larger detection areas than prevailing lensed devices.
A research team at Zhejiang University in China recently published the development in Optics Letters. Lead researcher Jing Xu commented, “There is a critical need for efficient underwater data exchange in worldwide ocean protection activities.”
In ocean preservation efforts like coral reef protection, it is necessary to create data links and transmit data quickly from divers, submarines, underwater sensors and unmanned autonomous underwater vehicles back up to the surface ships analyzing their work. The cells may offer a way to send that data more efficiently.
“To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrated the highest bandwidth ever achieved for a commercial silicon solar panel-based optical communication system with a large detection area,” said Xu. Xu said that the system could even allow for data exchange and power generation in one device.
Light-based underwater wireless communications are preferable to radio or acoustic waves, as it offers higher speed, low latency and draws less power. Long distances create challenges for these light-based devices, however, as they require precise alignment between the transmitter and receiver. Solar cells’ ability to detect light from larger areas and convert it to an electrical signal lessens the amount of tight precision needed for the transmitter-receiver alignment, said the paper.
Through their research, Xu’s team was able to develop and optimize a peripheral circuit on the solar cells, minimizing the power draw of the data processing feature.
A prototype was tested, with a small 3×3 solar array with a detection area of 3.4 x 3.4 centimeters. It was able to demonstrate a bandwidth of 150Mbps across 35 meters with low power draw and high stability.
Xu said because solar cells are produced at a wide scale, the proposed scheme could be cost-effective. He said he also sees this type of detector used in visible light communication, a type of wireless communication that uses LEDs and other sources to transmit data across long distances.
The next stage of research will bring the solar cells into harsher real-world like conditions, testing movement, muddy water, and weakened optical signals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/17/rfp-alert-duke-requests-1-1gw-of-new-renewables-in-indiana/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022",RFP Alert: Duke requests 1.1GW of new renewables in Indiana,"As outlined under the integrated resource plan that Duke Energy filed with Indiana regulators in December, the utility has released a request for proposals (RFP) looking to bring to the Hoosier state multiple GW of generation and storage capacity.
Specifically, Duke is looking to construct or acquire up to 1.1GW of intermittent generation, specifically renewable energy generation like solar, wind, hydrogen or other commercially viable renewable energy technologies. All of this requested generation is also open to be paired with energy storage technologies.
Duke is also looking to construct or acquire up to up to 1.3GW of non-intermittent generation, which the utility defines as electric generation that is dispatchable on demand, specifically natural gas combustion turbines, combined-cycle units and stand-alone battery storage.
All proposals submitted under the RFP should be from resources that are deliverable to Midcontinent Independent System Operator Zone 6, though there is an exception for out-of-state wind. Proposals can include existing generating resources or proposed resources with an in-service date no later than June 1, 2027 and can be in the form of purchase power agreements, projects that are built by a developer and then transferred to Duke Energy, or purchases of existing facilities.
According to its Sustainability Report, as of year-end 2020, Duke Energy owned, operated or had under contract almost 8,800MW of wind, solar and biomass. The plan is to own, operate or contract 16,000MW of wind, solar and biomass by 2025.  And as stated in last week’s financial earnings report, 80% of Duke’s 5-year, $63 billion capital plan includes zero carbon generation, which includes investments in nuclear, renewables (wind and solar), hydro and battery storage.
It also listed the goal of achieving net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution business by 2030 in its sustainability report, so don’t expect the company to toss gas generation by the wayside any time soon. The above 1.3GW of non-intermittent generation will likely be a mix of gas and storage, rather than a full commitment to either resource.
“We are continuing a transition to cleaner energy and are focused on reducing carbon emissions from our Indiana power plants,” said Duke Energy Indiana President Stan Pinegar.
The request for proposal will be formally issued Feb. 21, and more details will be available at www.DEIRFP.com. Questions can be submitted through the webpage. Selected projects will ultimately be presented to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for approval.
Duke Energy will use an independent third-party administrator, Charles River Associates, to facilitate the request for proposal process and ensure it is conducted in a fair and unbiased manner. Proposals for intermittent generation are due by April 18; the deadline for proposals for non-intermittent generation is May 2.

Southern California Gas will submit the first phase of its plans to the California Public Utilities Commission today.
While the technical details describing the proposed facility are scant, the company teased us with a few of their broader, auspicious goals:
The green hydrogen is to be produced by electrolyzers, which are powered with renewable energy. Each of the company’s social media pages posted about green hydrogen yesterday. The company also tweeted an article containing the following schematic, which describes what the system might look like:

At the moment, the largest hydrogen electrolyzer in the world is Baofeng Energy’s 150 MW facility in China. But larger facilities are already under construction, and there has been a bevy of newly announced hydrogen electrolyzers recently, especially from Australia.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that electrolyzer installations in 2022 will quadruple those of last year.
The gas company, along with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Mitsubishi Power, and others, is part of an organization that seeks to deliver green hydrogen to the Los Angeles basin at $1.50/kilogram by 2030.

Southern California Gas launched the first power to gas hydrogen demonstration project in the US in 2015. The company currently has 10 hydrogen pilot projects ‘in motion’.
Perhaps by coincidence, (or not), the U.S. Department of Energy announced two Requests for Information yesterday, for the planning, design, and implementation of the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Regional Hydrogen Hub” and the “Electrolysis and Clean Hydrogen Manufacturing and Recycling Programs.” The goals of these programs include ramping up technology in the sector to assist the industry in reaching a cost of $1/kilogram for hydrogen by 2032.

The company seeks to make use of 25-35GW of curtailed and new wind and solar power, plus two gigawatts of energy storage. The electrolyzer facility will range from 10 to 20GW of capacity and will require 200 to 750 miles of hydrogen infrastructure.
