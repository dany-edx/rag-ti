https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/19/ev-battery-gigafactory-with-54-gwh-output-planned-for-southern-california/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 19, 2022",EV battery gigafactory with 54 GWh output planned for southern California,"A new company called Statevolt has been launched with the goal of creating a southern California EV battery gigafactory with an output of 54 GWh, equivalent to about 650,000 electric vehicles supplied annually. The project is expected to require a $4 billion capital expenditure. 
This was announced by Lars Carlstrom, founder and CEO of Italvolt, which plans to launch a similar 45 GWh facility in northern Italy, to be designed and engineered by ABB. 
In launching the Imperial Valley, California-based Statevolt, Carlstrom signed a letter of intent with Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR). In addition to lithium output, CTR will also develop geothermal power facilities. Statevolt is currently undergoing due diligence to determine the location of the gigafactory. 
The partnership with CTR is expected to enable Statevolt operate a ‘hyper-local’ business model, sourcing the key feedstock of lithium from local resources. The company said this model leads to a more sustainable and secure supply chain, creating a local micro-industry and creating 2,500 jobs in the Imperial Valley region. 
“The development of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for the U.S. to meet its goals to transition to Net Zero. Statevolt is proud to begin its journey to develop U.S. expertise and production of lithium-ion batteries, as we look to serve this critical market. Today, we face a significant shortage in the amount of lithium that is required to meet the demand for electric vehicles. We are pioneering a new, hyper-local business model, which prioritizes sustainability and resilience in the supply chain to solve this issue.” Lars Carlstrom, founder and CEO of Statevolt. 
Lithium beneath the Salton Sea? 
Global lithium demand may reach 383,000 metric tons by 2030, and the Biden administration has called for 50% of all automotive sales to be electric vehicles by 2030. Accordingly, gigafactories such as the Statevolt facility will be needed to support rapid development, foster supply chain resilience, and meet consumer demand in the near-to-medium term.

California’s Imperial Valley is home to the Salton Sea, where Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is conducting a research project to profile the concentration of lithium in a geothermal fields beneath the man-made body of water. Brine from the geothermal field is already pumped to the surface to generate geothermal power and recirculated back underground. Lithium could be extracted from brine before it is pumped underground. Eleven geothermal plants are now operating in the Salton Sea, which Berkeley Lab describes as “pilot” operations. 
The project’s lead researcher Michael McKibben estimates there may be between 1 to 6 million metric tons of lithium under the Salton Sea.
Local geothermal experts
CTR has constructed and managed geothermal operations in Imperial Valley for over 30 years and was selected for its regional experience and technical knowledge to optimize Statevolt’s sustainability initiatives, said the new company in a press release. 
“We applaud Lars and his team for taking a proactive approach to ensure the company’s future lithium supply, while also consciously seeking out the cleanest lithium and power available for Statevolt’s first U.S. Gigafactory. The extraordinary growth in electric vehicle adoption and the emerging demand for energy storage systems to provide clean power, highlights the urgent need to develop a strong and secure battery supply chain in the United States.” Rod Colwell, CEO of Controlled Thermal Resources. 
Similar efforts are underway by KORE Power, which recently partnered with Novonix to support the buildout of a 12 GWh manufacturing facility in Buckeye, Arizona. The facility will be designed with a concept called the “sustainable valley” which supports a local supply chain from lithium sourcing to EV end-use.

This is the eighth survey of solar energy in the largest cities in the United States, and one encouraging finding is that the amount of solar power currently installed in just nine US cities exceeds the amount installed in the entire United States 10 years ago.
Solar Cities report
Cities with 100 or more watts of solar capacity installed per capita are called the “Solar Superstars” in the report. Honolulu leads the United States for solar power per person among cities surveyed, followed by Las Vegas, San Diego, Albuquerque, and San Jose. All of the “Solar Superstars” have experienced strong and sustained growth in solar energy and are setting the pace nationally for solar energy development.

The “Solar Stars” are the second level, where there are 50 watts per person. The top five Solar Star cities are Austin, TX, Buffalo, NY, Minneapolis, MN, Virginia Beach, VA, and Providence, RI. Eight years ago, when the first Shining Cities report was released only eight of the cities surveyed had enough solar PV per capita to be ranked as “Solar Stars,” but now 34 cities have earned the title.
The third tier are the “Solar Builders,” with between 25 and 50 watts of solar PV installed per person.  The top five on this list are Boise, ID, Seattle, WA, Richmond, VA, New York, NY and St. Louis, MO.
And then there are the “Solar Beginners,” which are cities that have installed under 25 watts of solar PV capacity per person. The top five include Oklahoma City, OK, Charlotte, NC, Columbus, OH, Chicago, IL, and Jackson, MS.
Strong policies make solar cities
The report findings suggest that to continue the solar progress made in US cities, strong policies are needed at the local, state, and federal level to make solar easy and affordable. The report advises that local governments should establish 100% renewable energy goals and create roadmaps and programs to meet those goals; adopt the Department of Energy’s SolarAPP+ to streamline permitting; offer virtual net metering, community solar, and third-party financing to expand access to solar; and implement policies for energy storage, EV smart charging and microgrids.
Solar Cities report
State governments are encouraged to adopt and preserve strong interconnection and net metering policies that support, not punish, solar adoption; set a state target for 100% renewable energy; and offer such as rebate programs, green bonds, Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) financing, tax credits and financing programs such as low- or zero-interest loans.
The federal government should continue and expand financing support for solar energy, particularly the Solar Investment Tax Credit. The tax credit is currently 26% but the report advises that it should be restored to 30% and extended to apply to energy storage systems, such as stand-alone batteries. Additionally, the US government should continue to support research to drive solar power innovations.
The good news is that of the 56 cities surveyed in the eight years of this study, 52 of them more than doubled their total installed solar capacity. There were 15 cities that increased their capacities tenfold. Ten cities have more solar PV capacity installed than the top city, Los Angeles, did back in 2014. In total, the cities in this report added 1,545 MW of solar capacity over just the past two years. While progress is being made, the study concludes that “even the nation’s leading solar cities have immense untapped solar energy potential”.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/19/canadian-university-to-be-equipped-with-a-stealthy-solar-facade-microgrid/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 19, 2022",Canadian university to be equipped with a stealthy solar façade/microgrid,"Mitrex, based in Toronto, is a manufacturer of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). One of the company’s BIPV products is a solar façade, essentially an exterior wall with productive photovoltaics stealthily integrated into a building.
Mitrex said it is now planning the tallest solar façade in North America, a 6,000 square foot BIPV system that will power a student residence building at St. Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The decentralized energy source supplies local energy and is connected with the traditional grid to export excess production. It is also a microgrid, capable of functioning autonomously from the electric grid, and able to operate during power outages.
The microgrid application not only can be used for power resilience during outages but can also be intelligently operated to adapt to economic conditions, potentially providing the university with savings during times of high energy prices and peak demand.
Mitrex will work with DSRA Architects, Dillon Consulting, BMR Structural Engineering, to install the project, with construction overseen by EllisDon Corporation and Markland Construction. Construction is expected to be complete in early 2023.
Mitrex said the façade will consist of solar cladding, accented by vertical, semi-opaque solar glass integrated into the windows. The design of the cladding panels is planned to be a delicate combination of school colors with a subtle reveal of solar technology, said the company.
The BIPV maker integrates photovoltaics with a myriad of locations, including roofs, railings, façades, windows and more. “Mitrex aims for a future where every sun-touched surface generates energy with visually appealing solar products,” said the company in a press release.
“The building community needs to think of micro-grids as a must and not an option and rethink their contributions to carbon emissions on every level from carbon used to make the products to powering the structure post-construction,” said Danial Hadizadeh, CEO of Mitrex.
Today, construction operations and building materials fabrication cause as much as 40% of annual carbon emissions. Hadizadeh said that he believes BIPV will replace “outdated solutions” to improve the carbon footprint of buildings. The company provides a high level of transparency in the total carbon lifecycle of its products.
Mitrex’s solar façade panels come in a variety of colors and designs to match the buildings they are integrated with and have a variety of structural designs that can either let the BIPV lay vertical on the wall or be tilted for increased production.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/19/neil-a-second-grader-from-minnesota-is-concerned-about-solar-panel-recycling/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 19, 2022",Neil – a second grader from Minnesota – is concerned about solar panel recycling,"Hi Neil,
Thank you for writing me a letter. I think it’s cool that kids in 2nd grade are thinking about solar panels. I didn’t think about solar panels until I was in the 12th grade.
I also like getting letters written to me by other people; it’s very nice.
The picture above is of a solar panel system my company recently installed.  The building is over 100 years old, and the business that owns the building has now built five solar power systems.
I like your questions, and I like that it upsets you a little bit that not enough is being done yet! For some of us, it will be our jobs for our whole lives to make sure we take care of the world’s problems. It’s part of being a human being, part of being an adult.
Your first question is about recycling solar panels, and some of the parts that could be toxic to our environment. Right now, there is a lot of work being done on recycling solar panels — but since the industry is still very small, very spread out, and young — it’s hard to do.
But we are learning!
For instance, scientists in Germany made new solar cells from old solar cells – and the new solar cells were just as good as the old ones. This picture below shows a little bit of the process.
Image: Fraunhofer ISC
Recycling is hard to do though. It takes a lot of time to learn how to do it, and to find enough old solar panels to recycle.
Another set of scientists in Colorado did research, and came up with the idea that if we supported a solar panel recycling company with a little bit of money from everyone, we could make a good business out of old solar panels in just over ten years.
Here’s an article I wrote on that paper, where I did some research and math, and found out that if all new solar panels paid about $1 each to the solar panel recycling factory, we could responsibly make it so no solar panels would ever go into landfills.

Did you know? California has already put a law in place that no one is allowed to throw away solar panels? Some people do care a lot!
Also, about lead — lead is very bad for us — and that’s why recycling is important. But do understand, solar panels are made in a way that it’s very, very hard for what’s inside the solar panel to get outside.
That’s why they can last so long.
In fact, a tornado once hit a solar power plant – and broke up some solar panels — but, nothing bad for the environment got out. This is because of how solar panels are made.
So, now I’m going to answer the rest of your questions:
Do you believe solar panels are worth it?
Can solar panels really be recycled?
Is there a way to reuse/repurpose solar panels?
Do solar panels hurt animals?
Do you have a pet?
What is your favorite food?
What country would you like to move to?
Thank you for writing to me Neil. I like that you care about this, and am happy that kids in school are learning about electricity and the environment.
John
Editor’s note: Neil – from a second grade class in Minnesota – mailed our author a letter at his home. Since Neil’s teacher hasn’t responded to our communications, we’re going to respond here first, but also going to print out and mail near a copy of this to Neil.

The new solution replaces the 20,000 pounds of toxic lead-acid batteries formerly housed at the center with a safer, environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternative, and more than doubling the available battery backup electricity.

Urban Electric shares that there are 5,200 individual alkaline cells in SDSC’s initial installation, which stores 1 MWh worth of electricity and replaces an array of lead-acid batteries now being recycled. An additional 5,200 cells are on the way for Phase 2 of the installation, which is expected to be commissioned this summer at the San Diego site.
According to Urban Electric, the goal of the project was not just to update the chemistry of the battery backup system onsite, but increase the amount of energy being stored, as the growth of the center made its initial battery backup system less effective in the event of an outage.
“Our computing capacity outgrew the size of our generator and we couldn’t expand it further,” said Christine Kirkpatrick, division director of research data services at SDSC and secretary general of the International Science Council’s Committee on Data. “A big portion of our racks have only traditional lead-acid UPS coverage that in an outage would last 27 minutes. Some portion of our data center is only on street power, and goes out immediately when the grid fails. The Urban Electric Power technology is a game changer. We can now offer hours instead of minutes of power to our UPS customers, and with our next installation phase, expand battery backup to those on street power. SDSC is the world’s first enterprise application of this innovative rechargeable battery technology, and our partnership with Urban Electric Power has made our computing footprint greener.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/19/sunstyle-brings-its-solar-shingles-to-the-us-market/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 19, 2022",SunStyle brings its solar shingles to the US market,"SunStyle, based in Switzerland, has been manufacturing its diamond-shaped solar roofing tiles since 2007, with hundreds of installations around the world. The company expanded its European operations and project pipeline with new offices in Switzerland and France, and now it is entering the US market by establishing an office in Chicago, Illinois
SunStyle provides an edge-to-edge, full-coverage solar roof that integrates well with any architectural style. TheUL/IEC-certified solar roof shingles are made with monocrystalline PERC solar cells, and the company reports that are more durable than most standard roofing materials, even in harsh weather conditions. The solar tiles meet both the industry standards for solar modules and achieve the highest possible ratings for hail (FM 4473 Class 4), fire (UL 790 Class A), and wind resistance (ASTM D3161 Class F), according to SunStyle.
The solar cells are embedded into a polyvinyl acetate layer. Six millimeters of hardened solar glass protects the face of the panels; the back is protected by a layer of fire resistant Tedlar (polyvinyl fluoride). Because the edges of the tiles are sealed to keep out moisture — much like a glass-glass solar panel — aluminum framing on the panel is not necessary. The polyvinyl layer is a highly textured “prismatic” surface, which traps photons within the solar panel that would normally escape from traditional flat solar panels. The result is an increase in the solar panel’s generation.

The company has already completed a few installations in the US, the most notable being a 7MW system on four rooftops on the Google campus in Mountainview, California, where 90,000 individual solar shingles generate enough electricity to cover around 40% of the electricity use in the buildings, known as Bay View and Charleston East. 
“As Americans continue to embrace solar at a rapid rate, we believe it is the perfect time to make our solar roof available to the U.S. market,”  said Gene Rosendale, CEO of SunStyle.
Despite uncertainty in the US solar market, strong forecasts are enticing companies like SunStyle to enter the market. Wood Mackenzie, for example,  forecast that the solar industry will continue to break annual installation records every year for the next three years before the investment tax credit (ITC) fully phases down under current law.
