Next it heads to the state’s house of representatives and must pass by March 18, 2022 at noon, the end of the year’s legislative session. 
The bill, sponsored by Senator Carrie Hamblen, would set rules for a more equitable distribution of the value and benefits of on-site solar for low-income residents. 
The bill seeks to expand onsite net metering for qualifying low-income housing projects. It also expands the state’s property tax exemptions to all rooftop solar installations. It also regulates the fees that electric utilities can assess on low-income multifamily housing for operating an on-site solar array. 
“Should this bill pass, that gives us access to that money so that those folks who are in affordable housing — designated affordable housing — can have the opportunity to reduce their utility costs,” said bill sponsor Senator Carrie Hamblen. 
The state’s Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department described the low-income multifamily solar rules as “community solar on a smaller scale.” The bill has met support from the Solar Energy Industries Association, the Sierra Club, Sunrun, Vote Solar, and more. 
“Distributed solar is growing in lower- and middle-income neighborhoods. Accelerating this trend means more of New Mexico’s low-income communities and renters benefit from the savings, reliability, resilience, health and workforce benefits of local clean energy,” said Chris Worley, director of public policy, Sunrun. 
Analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that many census tracts in New Mexico—predominantly in rural areas—experience a high energy burden, spending 6% or more of household income to meet energy needs, with one census tract’s energy burden as high as 16%. 
New Mexico ranks third in the U.S. for solar potential and is among a handful of states that have enacted a 100% clean energy target. However, New Mexico cannot reach the target equitably without addressing these rural communities with outsized energy burden and higher levels of harm from fossil fuels production.
“In 2021, the passage of the Community Solar Act opened the solar market and advanced clean energy accessibility for New Mexicans. The community solar program mandated that 30% of each project be reserved for low-income subscribers, creating economic benefits for New Mexicans. While this program’s implementation was a huge accomplishment, the demand for low-income access to solar energy is overwhelming. SB432 is complimentary to the community solar bill,” said Mayane Chavez Barudin, deputy program director, Interior West at Vote Solar.

Zhejiang-based solar panel maker Hounen Solar says it will invest $33 million through its U.S. subsidiary to acquire a factory building in Orangeburg, in South Carolina.
The governor’s office of South Carolina has confirmed Hounen’s plans. The company says the building will host 1 GW of solar module production lines.
“Our new solar panel production plant will enable us to produce monocrystalline silicon PV panels for the U.S. market.” said Hounen CEO Jufang Ly. “We are grateful for the help and support of the South Carolina team and look forward to additional business opportunities in the state.”
Hounen Solar says the new factory will create 200 new jobs. It is the third Chinese manufacturer to announce a new solar module factory in the United States since the introduction of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Earlier this week, Longi Solar and US solar project developer Invenergy agreed to jointly construct a 5 GW solar panel factory in Pataskala, Ohio, via a newly founded company, Illuminate USA. A press release from Illuminate USA says the plan will cost $220 million. Invenergy said it has invested $600 million in the facility.
In January, Chinese panel maker JA Solar unveiled a plan to build a 2 GW PV panel factory in the U.S. state of Arizona. The solar cell and module maker said in a statement that it has already leased land for the manufacturing facility at an unspecified location in Phoenix, Arizona. The factory is expected to start commercial operations in the fourth quarter of this year, it said, adding that it will lead to the creation of 600 new jobs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/17/organizations-show-support-for-california-solar-carport-and-highway-incentives/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 17, 2023",Organizations show support for California solar carport and highway incentives,"Senate Bill 49, introduced by Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo), aims to support the buildout of solar above parking lots and along highways throughout California. A coalition of 64 organizations, including Environment California, Environmental working Group, the CALPIRG, and many others, signed a letter of support for the bill.
The bill would create tax incentives for the construction of solar canopies over large parking lots. The legislation states that buildout would, “boost the local generation of clean electricity in urban and suburban areas while reducing the need for dedicated land in rural areas and transmission to deliver the clean energy into population centers.”
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reports that pavement makes up 35% to 50% of total surface area in cities, and 40% of that pavement is parking lots. Placing a solar canopy over an existing parking lot is a more efficient use of space than acquiring land for a ground mount system.
Los Angeles County alone has 101 square miles of parking lots, and about 25% of the state’s population. A press release by Senator Becker extrapolates these numbers by population, inferring that there should be approximately 400 square miles of parking lots in the state, equivalent to 26 GW of solar canopies.
Analysis from Yale University found that more than one-third of the state’s electricity could come from solar-covered parking lots. The authors found that the final 8,416 sites across the state could generate 9,042 GWh of electricity within their first year of operation. The total capacity of these sites was 7,021 MWdc of solar power. Priced at $3.00 per Watt to install, the solar canopies would generate approximately $21 billion in construction activity.
In addition to covering parking lots, the legislation would make tax incentives available for building highway-side solar. California has over 52,000 lane miles in its state highway system and over 23,000 lane miles of federal interstate highways, freeways, and expressways, reports Caltrans.
“These groups agree that it’s time to use the state’s plentiful parking lots and highway rights-of-way to produce more clean energy now and help California reach its 100% clean energy goals,” wrote the coalition in its letter of support.
The bill, which can be read in its entirety here, is light on details, but the opportunity to save land by integrating solar with the built environment is clear. Watch the video below for Senator Becker’s legislative briefing on the proposed SB 49.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/17/potential-savings-from-new-electric-transmission-reached-decade-peak-in-2022/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"MARCH 17, 2023",Potential savings from new electric transmission reached decade peak in 2022,"A recent study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found significant potential savings from congestion relief new transmission infrastructure.
Across the United States, high transmission values were observed in 2022.  The map below shows the value of a hypothetical 1000 MW transmission link based on hourly energy price arbitrage.
By looking at the difference in wholesale electricity prices between two locations, it is possible to estimate the cost of congestion, and the potential value for new transmission that would resolve this.
While it is challenging to assess the full benefits of new grid infrastructure, the stark interregional differences underscore the need for new transmission amidst a year defined by uncertainties in severe weather, and wholesale electricity price volatility.
The left graph above shows transmission values reached a peak in 2022 compared to the past decade. Based on the set of 64 interconnection links the mean value was $220 million per 1000 MW, or $25 per MWH. At the same time, this transmission value is increasingly concentrated into a smaller fraction of total hours.
As seen in the right graph above, 50% of total value was derived from only the top 10% of hours, and 37% of total value was derived from only 5% of the hours. In comparison, the typical link derived 50% of value from only 5% of hours from 2012 to 2021. This is consistent with the higher wholesale electricity prices leading to higher values across all hours. As well, the typical link derived 7% of its annual value from Dec. 22 to Dec. 31 when winter storm Elliot gripped most of the country with record cold temperatures.
As seen above, winter storm Elliot caused this transmission value to expand east with the cold temperatures. In MISO, PJM, and the Northeast the storm resulted in these interconnection links providing 10% to 22% of total annual value in under two weeks. As climate change continues to exacerbate the frequency and severity of these severe weather events, the potential savings from increased transmission will only expand.
It should be noted that this study does not include additional benefits of reliability, resiliency, and reduced emissions.  Achieving net zero emissions will require electricity from renewables to be moved from where it is generated to where it is used. This requires an unprecedented expansion of infrastructure across the country. For example, every net zero scenario in Princeton University’s Net Zero America project in 2021 estimated anywhere from two to five times current transmission. With that in mind, existing transmission planning approaches need to stop understating the rising economic value of new infrastructure, and the rising cost of uncertainty driven by weather.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/17/electriq-power-secures-financing-to-support-sustainable-community-networks-in-california/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 17, 2023",Electriq Power secures financing to support Sustainable Community Networks in California,"Electriq Power, a provider of intelligent energy storage and management for homes and small businesses, has entered into a multi-year agreement with a U.S.-based clean-energy company that designs, proposes and finances solar-plus-storage projects nationwide.
The financing, estimated to be greater than $300 million over 30 months, reportedly will support the implementation of Sustainable Community Networks (SCNs) throughout California.
The way the SCNs work is basically that Electriq Power offers turnkey energy solutions that include solar panels, batteries, software, project development, financing, installation and grid services, all with zero upfront costs. These networks are up and running in Santa Barbara and Parlier, California, and are aimed at bringing energy independence to low-income residents. In these models, Electriq or another financial party own the battery, and they get the federal tax credit. The benefit to the resident is that they can sign up to receive the power from the solar installation through a power purchase agreement, at rates lower than what the utility would charge. The benefit to Electriq, or other third-party, is that they can use the battery at specified times to send power to the grid.
Electriq Power sees its SCNs as a hedge against rising utility rates and power, especially in post-NEM 3.0 California. In December 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decided to pass NEM 3.0, cutting payments for exported solar energy by about 75%, adopting a utility-developed avoided cost calculator to set rates. The decision was justified based on an analysis that suggested non-rooftop solar customers were subsidizing their neighbors that decided to invest in the clean energy transition. In the post-NEM 3.0 world, potential solar shoppers are expecting a lower return on investment, thus turning some away from a clean energy future. Electriq Power sees the SCN model as helping low-income California residents embrace clean energy, with no up-front cost.
Electriq Power is the provider of the lithium ferro-phosphate PowerPod 2 battery, which the company says can provide backup power during blackouts as well as smart time-of-use charging and discharging cycles that insulate homeowners from expensive peak demand charges. Home storage also alleviates pressure on the grid, making it more reliable and prices more stable for the surrounding community.
By joining forces with the clean energy provider, Frank Magnotti, CEO of Electriq Power said that by bringing their finance and technology, Electriq hopes to launch additional SCNs across California.
“Our provider’s expertise in the energy sector and their software platform will enable us to jointly provide potential grid services and expand access to more communities. This agreement is a win for cities and municipalities throughout California and, most importantly, for their residents,” said Magnotti.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/17/the-four-main-bottlenecks-of-developing-small-scale-utility-solar-in-california/,"EMPLOYMENT,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",,"MARCH 17, 2023",The four main bottlenecks of developing small-scale utility solar in California ,"Think of a wine bottle and how it gets narrower at the spout, slowing down the flow. That narrow area is called the bottleneck, which is also a common engineering expression for project obstacles. A wine bottleneck is a great visualization of what’s happening to small-scale utility and community solar developers in California.  
While California still leads the nation in solar deployment, project developers face unique bottlenecks that are slowing the flow of meeting the state’s ambitious goal of achieving net zero carbon pollution by 2045.  
Before we get into our four main bottlenecks, let’s define small-scale utility projects as being between 1 MW (AC) and 20 MW (AC) and located near the communities that they serve. These types of projects can serve California’s Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs), investor-owned utilities (IOUs), as well as future community solar customers. 
 More recently, California passed the Community Renewable Energy Act, finally setting the stage for a viable community solar and energy storage market in the state. Now, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has the challenge of designing the program in a way that attracts both community solar developers and subscribers. 
But even with a well-designed community solar program, the local solar bottlenecks will remain. In our experience developing over 250MW across 35 small-scale local utility solar projects in California, the following four bottlenecks are slowing down the clean energy flow. 
Bottleneck #1: Interconnection backlogs 
Connecting projects to the grid is one of the biggest challenges across the United States. Renewable energy and storage projects can get stalled in long interconnection queues for years, which results in about 75% of them dropping out. Many projects are never even considered because of these issues. 
Projects in California face additional interconnection obstacles. Because the state has high renewables penetration, it can be challenging to find locations on the grid that have enough capacity for additional solar generation.  
For this reason, a utility may require that developers provide upgrades to a substation, distribution line, or transmission line before connecting a project to the grid. The cost and timeline for construction of these required upgrades in many instances make projects infeasible, and then they die. Delays at this stage can be compounded by constrained supply chains and long lead times for major equipment needed to make the upgrades.  
An experienced solar developer can identify locations that already have enough capacity and don’t require upgrades, but the process doesn’t stop there. Once you have identified a viable location for your project, you still need to navigate the complex utility interconnection process. In California, that includes going through several interconnection studies that can be cumbersome and tough to navigate efficiently. 
Projects over 1 MWac in California face an extra interconnection step. As part of the California Independent System Operator’s (CAISO’s) New Resource Implementation (NRI) process, developers need to design a Remote Intelligent Gateway (RIG) and implement it on the site. This lengthy, multistep process can be especially challenging for inexperienced developers and takes specialized engineering resources to complete. Missing any one of the many required submissions can delay your project significantly.  
This bottleneck tends to slow projects even further due to utility workforce issues – the utilities haven’t staffed up to meet the continued demand of renewables trying to connect to the grid. Because interconnection is so complex in California, utilities need experienced staff that thoroughly understand the process. Unfortunately, many California utilities are understaffed and experience can only happen over time. Consequently, even with all our interconnection t’s crossed and i’s dotted, utilities can be slow to move our distributed projects through their queue.  
The solution for us has been to maintain strong utility relationships and attention to detail, carefully providing all the requirements and avoiding further questions or changes. You have to actively manage up to push things through.  
Bottleneck #2: Permitting 
Efforts are being made across the U.S. to streamline and standardize solar permitting. But California remains one of the most challenging states in this regard.   
Permitting processes vary throughout California. Developers have to adhere to different requirements for each local jurisdiction, whether a city or county. That complicates the process for any developer working in more than one city or county. 
That said, what all the jurisdictions have in common is a requirement to follow the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process for reviewing projects and determining their potential environmental impact.  
The lengthy CEQA process can require many subject matter experts and consultants, which often presents another bottleneck for developers. While some items assessed in this standardized process are straightforward and clear, CEQA also considers factors like visual and agricultural impacts that are somewhat subjective. 
The only true solution here would be to pass legislation that streamlined permitting for renewables and mandated statewide permitting standards that would apply to all authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs), cities, and counties. 
Bottleneck #3: Land use considerations 
Impacts to agricultural land are a common concern. As community solar and local utility solar projects gain popularity around the country, concerns like these are making it more challenging to find appropriate sites for them.  
This issue is especially significant in California, which is home to some of the most productive agricultural land in the U.S. For this reason, the state has taken steps to preserve farmland through both CEQA and the Williamson Act, a program that allows specific parcels of land to be restricted to agricultural use in exchange for reduced property taxes. 
As a result, California solar developers aim to either avoid building on prime agricultural lands or mitigate the potential impacts of projects on these lands. These restrictions mean that California has significantly fewer viable sites for local solar development.  
To open this bottleneck, California or other AHJs could recognize that solar is a temporary, low-impact use and that at its core, solar is preserving land, not permanently impacting it. Unlike building an industrial building on site or paving a large parking lot, solar developers have a decommissioning plan that removes the system and restores the ground to its original condition. To codify this difference, the State should create a decommissioning standard of care for solar built on prime agricultural lands, enabling more sites to open up throughout California. 
Another solution for land use concerns would be the State providing incentives for agrivoltaics. This dual use of farmland can increase production for crops that do better with some shade and can decrease water use, a key benefit in California. Agrivoltaics also compensates farmers for the use of their land, providing an additional income stream. Solar panels can also be sited on unproductive parts of a farm, increasing the farm’s income without disrupting their operations.   
Another land use approach that Renewable Properties has implemented at many sites is planting pollinator vegetation alongside solar panels, increasing yields for farms throughout a region. Additionally, the grazing of small livestock is another alternative that enables farmers to continue their operations alongside a solar project.  
In the end, we’ve found that AHJs that prioritize renewables will find ways to solve land use bottlenecks with solutions that satisfy all stakeholders involved. 
Bottleneck #4: Workforce constraints 
With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the limited supply of skilled workers has become a huge bottleneck for all solar developers, large and small. California could solve all of its current supply chain, permitting, interconnection, and financing bottlenecks, but without increasing the local skilled workforce, projects cannot be built and will face delays. 
The IRA requires that for solar projects larger than 1 MW to receive the full Investment Tax Credit or Production Tax Credit, developers must pay prevailing wages. This requirement supports small construction businesses and allows them to operate as part of a union or right-to-work entity. However, there aren’t enough classes and experienced trainers in California to take advantage of these provisions. 
One answer is for California and local communities to incentivize attracting solar energy workforce development in their community colleges, labor unions, and trade organizations. Of course, even with incentives, those worker training programs require skilled and experienced teachers who are needed and working out in the field.  
The good news is that if you’re looking for a job, the renewable energy industry is actively hiring and in need of skilled labor across a variety of trades – construction, electrical, civil, engineering, legal, accounting, finance, permitting and land. If you’re talented and have a conviction for fighting climate change, the renewable energy industry is open for business and welcomes you! 
Opening up the bottlenecks 
These four bottlenecks in California can be frustrating, and Renewable Properties is doing everything we can to advocate for better policies and to open up the solar development flow before California’s new community solar program goes into effect. But we can’t do it alone.  
We urge the CPUC, California legislators, and local AHJs to review these four bottlenecks and to rapidly apply changes that will streamline local solar development throughout California. If they don’t act this year, then the bottlenecks will become even more severe, constraining jobs, CO2 mitigation, and clean energy deployment.  
Climate change is a global problem that requires local solutions. Solving these bottlenecks is California’s opportunity to continue leading and to be part of the solution!
