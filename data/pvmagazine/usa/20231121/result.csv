The scientists said they grew the cell on detachable germanium (Ge) films, which allows the reuse of Ge in other applications, thus reducing production costs. “By ingeniously creating a weak layer between epitaxial layers and a germanium substrate, we unlock the potential for reusing germanium, leading to a significant reduction in both environmental impact and production costs for optoelectronic devices,” Sherbrooke Professor, Maxime Darnon, told pv magazine.
In the paper “High-efficiency GaAs solar cells grown on porous germanium substrate with PEELER technology,” published in RRL Solar, the research team explained that, in order to create this weak layer, it used the so-called PEELER technique, a novel electrochemical porosification technique originally used for silicon wafers.
“The versatility of the PEELER process extends far beyond the realm of traditional solar cell technology,” Darnon said. “From its foundational application in producing high-efficiency solar cells that redefine industry standards to the creation of lightweight and adaptable solar solutions, PEELER opens doors to a myriad of possibilities. Demonstrated with a single-junction solar cell, the concept is applicable to multijunction solar cells. It is perfectly fit for spatial applications where weight and efficiency are paramount. Additionally, the process finds its stride in concentrator photovoltaics, optimizing energy capture in concentrated sunlight environments.”
Utilizing metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), the researchers fabricated a 1 mm2 front-contacted GaAs PV device based on a Ge substrate, the weak Ge layer, an epitaxial Ge layer, the GaAs absorber, a top contact made of nickel (Ni), Ge, and gold (Au), and a contact layer. 
The champion device built with this architecture achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.012 V, a short-circuit current density of 26.28 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 81.98%.
“The demonstrated performance of single-junction GaAs photovoltaic cells on porosified 100 mm Ge wafers not only matches but surpasses state-of-the-art GaAs solar cells fabricated on detachable substrate, showcasing the transformative potential of growing high-efficiency optoelectronic devices on detachable Ge films,” Darnon stated.
The academics said their experiment also showed the compatibility of the porous structure with the MOCVD growth technique, which they claimed confirmed the industrial potential of the proposed approach.
The research group was formed by scientists from Canada’s Université de Sherbrooke, Canadian energy project developer Saint-Augustin Canada Electric Inc., and Belgian Germanium materials provider Umicore Electro-Optic Materials.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/21/defining-domestic-content-in-solar-projects/,"GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Defining domestic content in solar projects,"It’s been over a year since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark piece of legislation designed to bolster U.S. clean energy infrastructure, manufacturing and adoption. The bill includes numerous incentives for U.S. solar production. These products are more attractive and cost-efficient than ever and we’ve seen new solar projects and manufacturing capacity announced at record rates over the past year as a result.
However, for some IRA tax credits and benefits, the qualifying factors remain unclear, opening up industry debate on how U.S. cleantech products and projects will be assessed throughout the rest of the decade and beyond. This includes the IRS’s proposed guidance on which renewable energy projects will qualify for an additional 10% domestic content tax credit.
In the solar industry in particular, this guidance gives an advantage to companies that have already committed to U.S. parts and labor for manufacturing and installation but there are also challenges and discrepancies that should be addressed before the guidance is finalized.
Potential challenges
The new guidance states that manufactured products qualifying for the added tax credit must be produced in the U.S. This means all manufacturing processes must be U.S.-based and furthermore, that all of such product components must be of U.S. origin. This guidance contradicts the Made in America Act, which calls for U.S.-based manufactured products to have a 55% of such product’s total cost to come from U.S. made components. This discrepancy should be addressed prior to the new guidance. It’s particularly important to have clear qualifications for solar products, where varied components and materials are necessary to manufacture and install modules.
On a similar note, solar glass and cells – two essential components for building modules – are currently not being manufactured anywhere in the U.S. Some domestic manufacturers work closely with a Canadian company that is planning to manufacture solar glass rather than turning to overseas manufacturers once they are up and running. However, that means their products would not currently qualify for the price to be used on the domestic adder but only the portion of the costs attributable to domestic components. This new guidance and the IRA overall is expected to attract more domestic manufacturing. It will be important that companies offering cells, glass and other underrepresented items are prioritized and encouraged to set up operations in the U.S. to help manufacturers achieve entirely U.S.-made modules that qualify for the 10% adder.
What’s Next
Regardless of what political shifts may be headed our way, U.S. solar manufacturing and installation won’t be slowing down any time soon. The business case for solar in this country is based on its strong and rewarding return on investment, meaning the industry will continue to grow and mature.
To support this continued growth, all U.S.-based clean energy manufacturing and development should be incentivized to use more domestic materials. Refining guidance found in the IRA, like the domestic content adders, should make U.S. manufacturing and sourcing easier and more lucrative over time as well. We can also expect the domestic incentive aspect of the IRA to help attract more solar component manufacturers to the U.S., particularly to fill the gap in domestic glass and cell manufacturing we currently see. In the meantime, solar manufacturers who are currently using a mix of U.S. and foreign-made components will need to disclose their entire cost breakdown for their customers to qualify for these credits. While this may be an unfamiliar requirement for some, it is ultimately a good thing – more transparent costing and hence pricing will encourage market competition.
Looking beyond manufacturing guidelines, companies expanding their U.S. solar operations need to also keep a close eye on wage requirements; many may need to pay workers the prevailing wage to qualify for funding.
All incentives included in the IRA will be beneficial to bolster adoption and awareness for clean energy technologies among consumers, manufacturers and local governments. One year after its passage is a perfect time to examine guidance like the domestic content adders to ensure it prioritizes strengthening U.S. manufacturing and supply chains for years to come.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/21/rollercoaster-year-for-u-s-residential-solar-segment/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Rollercoaster year for U.S. residential solar segment,"From pv magazine 11-2023
pv magazine: How would you describe the residential solar market segment in 2023?
Ethan Miller: I have been in this business for a couple of decades and this has been one of the most dynamic years that I have seen. There is a confluence of factors, such as the [Californian net-metering regime] NEM 2.0 sunset leading to a surge in installation and then the introduction of NEM 3.0, combined with climbing interest rates causing a slowdown. In addition, as the industry evolves nationwide, the value proposition of solar is changing throughout the country and is requiring a lot of adaptation throughout the entire value chain. At the same time, there is a long-term positive outlook with the Inflation Reduction Act providing the industry with strong tailwinds.
What can you tell me about the installation surge?
There was a big run-up in California that saw more contracts closed in the first four months of the year than would typically be completed in an entire year. But now there is a big reset period to get engagement, articulate the new value proposition, and to ensure equipment, technology, and software can support that. It was positive that we had the run-up in the first four months. Now it is important that companies can adapt so that they have the momentum to carry them through this transition.
Can you provide expectations for volume in the United States distributed market segment?
As the entire residential market has experienced, there has been a downturn in the second half of the year and almost every company has revised their outlook, and not upwards. That has the potential to sit with us for the first quarter or two of next year, and then the market could see a reset and start growing significantly again.
What about for Powur? What has been the trend for your business?
We are on a similar trajectory. We were successful in building up the Californian pipeline. In other markets we continue to see great business success, especially where there have been no major changes to net metering.
This rollercoaster of California, Texas, and Florida – which are the country’s largest markets – affects the success of the entire industry, including us. Luckily, our platform model is very elastic and allows us to get through this with a lot more grace than other companies.
With NEM 3.0, and in light of California having an outsized impact on the national market, there could be an uptick of residential energy storage. Is that your expectation?
These expectations are predominantly appropriate. The long view of what NEM 3.0 is doing is that it is pushing installations towards being 80% completed with storage attached – which is up from sub-20%, historically, in California.
At the end of the day that is prompting more investment in energy storage technology. There used to be just a couple of options available and now we have a lot more. This will exert downward pressure on prices. That shift is a great thing for the bigger picture. Every homeowner will ultimately want a battery – it is just a case of whether they can afford it.
Powur is playing what I feel is an interesting role, which is the professionalization of the distributed market segment – one that was populated by small, often family-run companies. There are a few models emerging, solar leasing itself is well established but some other companies that are acquiring smaller installers are trying to build them into a portfolio. Why is it that you think Powur’s model – as a service provider to support distributed solar companies – is an attractive one?
Solar has to achieve scale in all 50 states, all of which are very different solar markets. It is one of the most complex trades – dealing with rooftop work, electrical work – you are in someone’s home. I can’t think of one vertically integrated contractor that has been successful in solar on a national level.
Because of this complexity, it is going to take a partnership model that combines local knowledge backed by national expertise. It is too difficult to service all 50 states and every county with a vertically integrated approach and model. That’s because some services need to be customized to meet the local and individual needs while other aspects need to be standardized and scalable to ensure quality and speed.
That’s where Powur comes in. We try to bring to the table consistent design, quality, proposal tools that estimate production accurately while also staying agile at the local level. Our quality assurance and project management programs ensure that our local installation partners are doing it right every time.
Ideally this model will professionalize the industry in an elastic way that can flex up and down. This becomes even more important because we are nowhere close to a nice, stable market with national energy policies. There are going to be markets that pop up, go away, and if we can bring that professionalism to the table in a flexible way, then that is a good thing.

This development was brought to light in recent filings that show the Indiana-Michigan Power Company (I&M) is seeking a 23% hike in electricity rates. The Citizens Action Coalition Indiana (CAC Indiana) indicates that distributed solar collapsed after the state eliminated net metering in favor of “excess distributed generation” (EDG) tariff on July 1, 2022, the day that Indiana rooftop solar died.
As this has occurred, electricity utilities are now seeking to massively increase the cost of electricity.

According to CAC Inidana’s filing, “The amount of solar installed has decreased dramatically. As shown in Figure 16, in the last one-year period in which net metering was offered (July 2021 through June 2022), I&M customers installed about 7.4 MW of solar. In the one-year period after the EDG tariff replaced net metering (July 2022 through June 2023), solar installations fell to 2.4 MW, a 67% year-over-year decrease in capacity additions.”
The last net metering solar power system in Indiana was installed in the summer of 2023. Featuring bifacial solar panels and ballasted racking, this project is expected to yield $140,000 in operational savings in the first year.
Furthermore, the filing indicated that the average monthly residential electricity bill has more than doubled since 2004, escalating from $70 to almost $150. I&M is now proposing a massive 23% increase, which would push the average bill to $176/month. Accounting for inflation, rates have increased roughly 54% since 2004.

 
Concurrently with the phase-out of net metering, construction began on the large-scale Mammoth Solar project. SOLV Energy is developing the first 400 MW phase of the 1.3 GWac / 1.65 FW dc facility. The project has secured multiple power purchase agreements, including 80 MW with PNC Bank and portions of the subsequent 360 MW phase with AEP Energy and Doral Renewables.
 
On November 16, just as the State of California was making drastic cuts to the amount of electricity that apartment complexes were allowed to sell to their renters, the utility PG&E received approval for a 13% rate increase.

The Invesco Solar ETF fell 11% for September and declined 29% year to date, while the S&P 500 fell 5% for September and rose 12% year to date. The DJIA decreased 4% during the month of September and increased 1% year to date.
Within the United States markets, the top three performing solar stocks for September were Emeren Group Ltd. (up 6%), Enphase Energy Inc. (7%), and Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Inc. (8%). Meanwhile, the three most under-performing solar stocks for the month were Maxeon Solar Technologies Ltd. (down 28%), Sunnova Energy International Inc. (-25%), and Sunrun Inc. (-21%).
Residential solar stocks fell 18% overall in September and decreased 50% year to date. It is important to note that the residential stocks have declined further in October, due to poor market conditions.
The companies included are SolarEdge Technologies Inc., Sunnova Energy International Inc., and Sunrun Inc. Elevated interest rates, insufficient working capital, and surplus inventory are contributory factors adversely impacting the sector.
Our recent checks suggest that there is massive oversupply in the United States residential solar market and there are fears it will continue into the fourth quarter with available stock from both manufacturers and distribution channels.
Some manufacturers are liquidating their inventory, even at prices below cost structure. The disparity of more than $0.10/Wp between residential and utility solar panel prices is pushing commercial & industrial solar developers, as well as PV engineering, procurement, and construction companies, to reconsider and revise projects. Revised projects are aiming to incorporate smaller-footprint modules whenever feasible.
Despite recent customs detentions, pricing for Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act-compliant modules has decreased significantly. Our checks suggest that there are indications that demand for utility-scale solar projects might be showing signs of a slight decline.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/21/vpps-get-the-vip-treatment/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",VPPs get the VIP treatment,"From pv magazine 11-2023
pv magazine: What are the benefits of VPPs and why are you pushing them at the DOE?
Jigar Shah: There are two pieces to this. One is that we have been doing demand response and remote control, and virtual power plant-like things for over 30 years. What’s new is that many people have an app on their phone now, to control their EV [electric vehicle] charging, to control their battery system with their solar system, [and] to control their thermostat or water heater. Once you have that level of connectivity, you can actually start to shift loads every day.
How do you envisage this VPP rollout?
What I would say is that I don’t know how this is going to roll out. The appliances are going be purchased, that we all know – because people are going to have to replace old water heaters and HVAC [heating, ventilation and air conditioning] systems on a regular basis. In general, the other piece of this is that utilities need this to happen. They are adding megawatts every week of new load onto their grid and a lot of these loads just can’t be added willy-nilly – allowing people to just turn these loads on when they want to. If they did, it would have far higher costs through adding to the transmission and distribution wires. Utilities are asking for managed [EV or battery] charging and for these types of things. This is much different than 10 years ago, when they were not sure whether it was needed.
Then the question becomes, “how can you best deliver that to them?” You can have aggregators, appliance manufacturers that might decide to have a native app – clearly Tesla has that for their Powerwall services, and others that decide that they want to create an app that serves them all. This third group could have a system that controls not only their equipment but also a smart panel, a water heater and so on. We will see how all of this plays out. We are private sector-led and government enabled.
Taking the smart-home concept, systems are not always open in terms of communication protocols. What can be done to break down that barrier for people looking to provide VPPs?
The DOE has invested heavily in open architecture but in saying that, not everyone has to use it. In general, I think that all of the parties are going to be better served if everyone opts into a similar architecture so that customers can move from provider to provider seamlessly. But also, so that the appliance manufacturers and others can opt into an energy hub more seamlessly. The goal for the DOE is for there to be this open architecture but we’ll see where the marketplace takes us.

Where will the money come from to roll out these VPPs?
Today we already spend $10 billion more a year, on balance, with gas-fired peaker plants. That money is already being spent on variable supply, which we can separately decide to spend on variable demand. It is a simple shift where you are moving away from natural gas peaker plants to demand flexibility. I think that it is important to note that it’s not new money being added to the system but it is money that is being spent inefficiently in one place that we want to spend more efficiently somewhere else. Once that occurs, then you can save additionally on the build out of distribution grids.
One of the biggest cost benefits of rooftop solar is reducing the amount of transmission. Does that also apply here? Can it be distributed throughout the network?
In years past when we’ve had load growth, we have always built more power plants, more distribution, more transmission to meet that growth. That is what we did when air-conditioning came on the scene in the late 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. Today, with all of this new load growth [from electrification and EVs], we are saying that we can add many gigawatts of new generating capacity closer to the load – on people’s rooftops, in the distribution circuits. That then allows us to use our transmission and distribution system more efficiently as we continue to figure out how to decarbonize and meet the [United States] president’s goals by 2035.
How is the DOE’s Loans Programs Office helping to facilitate this?
We’ve staffed our outreach and business development group with some seriously smart people. They’re helping to mentor and help people think all of this stuff through. We have a diversity of applicants from companies that are solar-plus-storage and also others that are building EV charging stations or fleets and so on. We’re helping people to understand the standards required. We want to give people a loan in order to get this decarbonization technology out into the marketplace but we also want to get paid back. We want these companies to be meeting best practice standards and ensuring they can meet the requirements of utilities and others – so they can get the payments and be able to pay us back. Ultimately, our value is to provide up to $100 billion of loan authority to this sector. We are helping them improve their business models, their standards compliance, and to deliver the quality we are seeing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/21/glass-manufacturer-pairs-its-operations-with-rooftop-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,NEW JERSEY",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Glass manufacturer pairs its operations with rooftop solar,"Specialty glass manufacturer Astraglass announced it has installed a 203.3 kW rooftop solar installation on its Vineland, New Jersey factory rooftop. Astraglass produced scientific and laboratory glassware, precision glass and glass to metal components for OEM applications.
The 484-module system is expected to generate about 40% of the facility’s energy consumption.
The project takes advantage of New Jersey’s Successor Solar Incentive Program (SuSI), which makes Astraglass qualitied to receive $100 per MWh of energy produced by the system for the next 15 years. The system is expected to produce 266 MWh in its first year of operations.
”Manufacturing glass products requires a significant amount of electric consumption on site and solar power is one of the only levers to truly offset that consumption while simultaneously creating a new revenue source for the business,” said Kyle Shroufe, co-founder of Opal Energy Group. “Combined with tax credits and bonus depreciation, Astraglass is forecast to achieve a ROI in just three years.”
Opal Energy installed the project, which made use of bifacial solar modules and SolarEdge power optimizers. SolarEdge’s power optimizers enable each solar module connected in a string to the inverter to operate independently. This means that if one module in the string is shaded and produces less power, other modules on the string will not be negatively impacted. Power optimizers also allow for performance monitoring of each individual module, helping to streamline operations and maintenance.
Opal Energy secured funding for the project from Sunstone Credit, which specializes in helping small-to-medium sized companies finance solar installations.
”Our foremost objective is to make quality investments that ultimately help businesses access the financial and environmental benefits of solar,” says Sunstone Credit co-founder Duncan Hinkle. “Our loans can have terms up to 20 years, and so we put a lot of thought into evaluating the partners and technology we work with.”
Sunstone Credit said the SolarEdge components used in the project helped ensure a reliable investment with Opal Energy.
“The advanced features in this installation give us the confidence that our investment, and that of our customer, is in safe hands,” said Hinkle.
