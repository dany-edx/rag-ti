https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/26/corporations-bought-record-total-of-clean-energy-despite-devastating-year/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 26, 2021",Corporations bought record total of clean energy despite devastating year,"Corporations purchased a record 23.7 GW of clean energy globally in 2020, with the U.S. market maintaining its lead and new markets propelling growth, according to a new report from BloombergNEF (BNEF).
The 2020 figure is up slightly from 20.1 GW in 2019 and more than 10 GW above the 13.6 GW seen in 2018. In the report, BNEF noted the 2020 increase came despite a year devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic, a global recession, and uncertainty about U.S. energy policy ahead of the presidential election.
“To not only maintain, but grow, the clean energy procurement market under these conditions is a testament to how high sustainability is on many corporations’ agendas,” said Kyle Harrison, BNEF senior associate and lead author of the report.
BNEF found in its 1H 2021 Corporate Energy Market Outlook that clean energy contracts were signed by more than 130 companies in sectors ranging from oil and gas to big tech.
Although the U.S. was once again the largest market, it was less dominant than in previous years. Companies announced 11.9 GW of corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the U.S. in 2020, down from 14.1 GW in 2019. According to BNEF, this represented the first year-over-year drop since 2016. The first half of 2020, coinciding with the start of the pandemic, was particularly subdued, with companies announcing just 4.3 GW of corporate PPAs in the U.S. during that period.
Latin America also had a down year, with corporate PPA volumes dropping from 2 GW in 2019 to 1.5 GW in 2020. The region was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic downturn. However, BNEF said companies in Brazil signed a record of nearly 1.06 GW of PPAs in 2020, as many continued to migrate to the country’s free market, where they can sign bilateral clean energy contracts directly with developers.
Once the main draw for corporate procurement in the Latin American region, Mexico saw deal volumes all but dissipate. BNEF claimed this is because the current administration continues to undermine the country’s clean energy sector.

While the U.S. and Latin America slipped back, other corporate procurement markets stepped up.
Corporate PPA volumes in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region nearly tripled, from 2.6 GW in 2019 to a record 7.2 GW in 2020. In Spain, companies announced contracts to purchase no less than 4.2 GW of clean energy, up from 300 MW the previous year.
BNEF said solar and wind projects in Spain yield some of the cheapest and most competitive prices in Europe, thanks to strong natural resources and a large pool of experienced developers. Companies like Total and Anheuser Busch are orchestrating “cross-border virtual PPAs” in Spain, buying clean energy in the country to offset their load elsewhere in Europe.
Corporations also purchased record clean energy volumes in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, announcing contracts for 2.9 GW of solar and wind. Taiwan established itself as a major corporate clean energy market in 2020, with companies signing PPAs totaling 1.25 GW. BNEF said Taiwan’s market should be supported by a new policy that requires companies with an annual load above 5 MW to buy clean power. Also, the island has a high concentration of large manufacturers, many of which are feeling pressure from their customers to decarbonize.
South Korea is expected to be the next major corporate procurement market in Asia. Policymakers revised the country’s Electric Utility Act in the beginning of 2021, creating a PPA mechanism and a green tariff program with Korea Electric Power Corp. The revision will also allow companies to purchase unbundled certificates and retire them against sustainability commitments. According to BNEF, South Korean companies face similar supply-chain pressures to those in Taiwan.
Jonas Rooze, lead sustainability analyst at BNEF, said, “More than ever before, corporations have access to affordable clean energy at a global scale. Companies no longer have an excuse for falling behind on setting and working towards a clean energy target.”
BNEF found that Amazon was the leading buyer of clean energy in 2020, announcing 35 separate clean energy PPAs in 2020, totaling 5.1 GW. The company has now purchased over 7.5 GW of clean energy to date, vaulting it ahead of Google (6.6 GW) and Facebook (5.9 GW) as the world’s largest clean energy buyer. French oil major Total (3 GW), TSMC (1.2 GW) and U.S. telecom Verizon (1 GW) were the next largest corporate buyers of clean energy in 2020.

BNEF said the flow of new companies making clean energy commitments is another indicator of how much more the market can grow. 65 new companies joined the RE100 in 2020, pledging to offset 100% of their electricity consumption with clean energy. BNEF forecast that the 285 RE100 members will collectively need to purchase an additional 269 TWh of clean electricity in 2030 to meet their RE100 goals. Should this shortfall be met exclusively with offsite PPAs, it would catalyze an estimated 93 GW of new, incremental solar and wind build.
“Investor interest in sustainability is sky high, with inflows to sustainability-focused funds growing 300% between 2019 and 2020,” explained Harrison. “Companies in all sectors, including hard-to-abate ones like oil and gas and mining, are feeling the pressure to purchase clean energy and decarbonize. This group is only just scratching the surface on the amount of clean energy build it can catalyze.”

NovaSource, a Texas-based portfolio company of Canadian private equity firm Clairvest Group, was founded in 2020 amid Clairvest’s acquisition of SunPower’s O&M business. NovaSource later bought First Solar’s North American O&M unit. The company said it currently manages more than 3.5 GW of commercial, industrial, and utility-scale projects.
California-based SunSystem Technology has been a leading U.S. distributed generation O&M provider, servicing residential portfolios, commercial system owners and asset managers, and EV charging station networks.
Through this merger, the combined group will operate as NovaSource and have a joint global workforce in nine different countries. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.
NovaSource said the merger means its field technicians will now be within a one-hour drive of 95% of the U.S. solar infrastructure, helping cut time, save money, and increase services nationwide.
“The combined scale, coverage, and experience will bring tremendous value and capabilities to our existing and future customers,” said SunSystem CEO Derek Chase, who will lead NovaSource’s distributed generation O&M unit.
Jack Bennett, CEO of NovaSource, said that the merger will help asset owners meet their rapidly evolving needs.
Earlier this month, Consolidated Asset Management Services acquired the U.S. solar O&M unit of Belectric Inc., which oversees 141 operating sites in 11 states.

The utility also reached settlements with around 1,000 plaintiffs in litigation arising from the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, which include the Woolsey Fire, the 2017 Thomas and Koenigstein fires, and the 2018 Montecito Mudslides.
The utility offered no admission of wrongdoing or liability in reaching the settlements.
In 2019, the utility said that it may have been responsible for starting the Woolsey Fire. That statement followed an investigation by fire officials.
The fire destroyed more than 1,600 structures, injured three firefighters, and killed three people as it burned near Malibu. It became one of the most destructive fires in the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
SCE estimates that potential losses for remaining claims could reach $4.6 billion and does not include any potential fines and penalties. The amount will be reduced by the $2.2 billion paid under terms of the insurance settlement.
SCE’s parent company, Edison International, said last year that it anticipates issuing around $1 billion of equity to invest in SCE to enable the utility to debt-finance claims payments and maintain investment-grade credit ratings.
The utility also will seek to recover uninsured costs resulting from the disasters through electric rates. Recovery is subject to regulatory approval.

The company also hinted that it will have more deals to announce in the near future.
The debt will be used to finance a broad range of commercial and industrial projects and distributed generation assets, according to the company, and will accommodate multiple tax equity partnerships and structures.
With financing secured, DSD now has the flexibility to support projects that will be developed in 2021 and 2022, as well as to support the company’s anticipated growth.
“Our team’s ability to map out projects is among the best in the industry,” said Erik Schiemann, DSD CEO. He said that the project pipeline is a clear indication of how renewable energy is driving business and environmental responsibility.
Since acquiring the company’s first solar portfolio in July (a four-project, 7.9 MW community solar portfolio from Oak Leaf Energy Partners), DSD has acquired another four-project, 3.9 MW community solar portfolio; announced three projects to be built on Cape Cod; acquired a three-project, 17 MW community solar portfolio from Source Renewables; and acquired a two-project, 10 MW community solar portfolio in Lenox, New York.

Intersect also closed on a $482 million debt facility with Generate Capital and CarVal Investors.
The San Francisco-based company has developed 3.7 GW of solar assets with a portfolio value of more than $8 billion. The investments are expected to give it the ability to more quickly scale its core business of solar and energy storage, while expanding further into emerging classes of clean infrastructure, like green hydrogen.
Founded in 2016, Intersect Power is involved in all phases of development, design, engineering, finance, and operations. Intersect Power has a pipeline of 3.2 GW of late-stage solar and storage projects that will be in operation by 2023. The company has also developed and sold more than 1.7 GW of contracted solar projects across California and Texas.
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe provided legal counsel to Intersect Power. Latham & Watkins acted as legal counsel for the equity providers and Kirkland & Ellis and Foley & Lardner for debt.
One of Intersect Power’s largest projects is the 425 MW Juno solar facility in Borden County, Texas. The project has two long-term power purchase agreements, one for a portion of the project output with the Lower Colorado River Authority and the other with an undisclosed off-taker. SoftBank Energy is the long-term investor.
The Juno project is expected to reach completion by this coming fall and will produce about 890 GWh per year. Equipment for the project will be provided by First Solar and NEXTracker.

Under terms of the agreement, LONGi will supply Strata with 500 MW of bifacial monocrystalline module capacity over the next two years. An additional understanding commits the companies to agreeing by the end of this year on additional volume commitments for 2023.
Strata CEO Markus Wilhelm said that the deal “will allow Strata to continue its commitment to high-efficiency, high-reliability, and high-quality solar products to support the growth and sustainability of our business over the next three years.”
The deal did not come about by chance. Strata studied the impact of LONGi bifacial technology on the performance of a solar installation on the East Coast. The study, conducted at a Strata facility, used LONGi bifacial modules to evaluate the backside gain of the technology. As part of the test,  Strata replaced a string of monofacial modules with LONGi bifacial modules.
Positive results gave Strata the confidence to predict the additional gain in energy production captured by bifacial panels and to move forward with a supply deal.

That’s why the 30-plus major corporations that released a call for the Biden Administration to implement national policies that will position the country to transition to a zero-carbon power sector emphasized the need for increased funding for federal energy research, development, and demonstration of clean energy technologies.

Thus far, much of the work that has been done to fund cleantech innovation has come from the private sector and venture capital firms. One firm, Clean Energy Ventures, thinks 2021 will be a landmark year for technologies coming out of the lab and toward commercialization.
pv magazine USA sat down virtually with Daniel Goldman, Clean Energy Ventures’ co-founder and managing director, to discuss three startups that he expects to make significant waves in the market.
Based in Rochester, New York, Sundensity has developed photonic smart coatings for utility solar power producers. It says that its technology can improve solar output by 20% more than other panel coatings.
“The thing we really love about this company is that it’s a very simple approach to radically increasing efficiency,” Goldman said. “Going from 20% efficiency to like 23-to-25%, people are looking for a quarter- to half-point increase in efficiency to drive costs down.” He said such an improvement would be a “game-changer in disrupting that space.”
The solution is a multilayered coating applied on top of a glass substrate via process known as “magnetron sputtering.” This is done by creating a plasma to shoot the materials (mainly metals and oxides) onto the glass using a physical vapor deposition chamber, creating layers that interact with light. The full application contains multiple layers that shift ultraviolet light photons into the infrared, using localized surface plasmon resonance.
Goldman also said he thinks the technology can get to market quickly, and he’s not alone. In September, Sundensity won $1 million from the innovative Luminate NY competition. It then  buttoned up $2.5 million in funding in a Series A round led by Clean Energy Ventures.
Founder Nish Sonwalkar told the Rochester Beacon that with the funding, the company is looking to come up with a manufacturing process and design of its nano-optical coating equipment. Sundensity is working with a number of university labs to do just that. The startup is also looking to partner with companies to speed commercialization and pilot a manufacturing plan.
Turning to distributed energy resources (DERs), Goldman was excited to discuss ConnectDER, a startup that has developed a meter collar at the residential level that allows DERs to be directly routed to the meter.
A rooftop solar system typically requires wiring through a panel in the house, then through the panel to the mains and next to the utility meter, said Goldman. “We’re talking about $500 to $2,000 of savings in terms of the whole solar installation.”
The equipment, Goldman continued, is not just for the benefit of the homeowners and their wallets. The collar also provides information to the utility to help it better understand and visualize how the grid edge is performing and the impact on distribution systems.
UL-listed, the collar connects to PV systems via a junction box with no wiring into the adapter required. The meter collar also includes a circuit breaker on the DER circuit, which is rated for the output of the DE, up to 15 kW at 240 V.
Utilities historically have resisted the proliferation of DERs, especially residential solar+storage, in part because they are resources the utility doesn’t own. With ConnectDER, the utility incentive is expected to be two-fold: Not only is the utility being sent real-time grid edge data, but it also owns the collar.
In the company’s next generation, ConnectDER is looking to add the ability for homes to island from the grid in the event of outages, scheduled or otherwise. Goldman said that this technology was developed specifically with the California market in mind.
A transmission line-monitoring startup, LineVision grabbed the attention of Goldman and others at Clean Energy Ventures due to a belief that its technology could have an immediate and material impact on greenhouse gas emissions at a large scale.
“It’s been estimated that up to 40% of renewables aren’t getting onto the grid because utilities don’t understand what their line ratings are,” Goldman said. “What LineVision does is provide dynamic line ratings, as well as line health and awareness of what’s near your lines, like vegetation, by putting a non-contact sensor on the poles.”
The V3 monitor uses thermal sensing and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to “look out” at the span of the line, predict the dynamic line rating, and determine sway, temperature, and other variables that impact the safety and performance of the line. Each V3 monitor contains an electromagnetic field radiation sensor for collecting real-time data on the line’s electrical properties, while the optical sensor tracks each conductor’s position.
The non-contact element is crucial, as it means the technology doesn’t touch the actual power lines. That means utilities don’t have to shut down lines to install and manage the system. Goldman sees LineVision, like ConnectDER, as potentially having a big impact in California.
The bet that LineVision is making is that, with the dynamic line ratings in hand, utilities will up-rate their lines, allowing for more current to pass over them and ultimately deliver more electricity. The sensors are currently being used by a few utilities, like National Grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/26/sunrise-brief-20-mw-cummins-electrolyzer-is-producing-green-hydrogen/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,HYDROGEN,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 26, 2021",Sunrise brief: 20 MW Cummins electrolyzer is producing green hydrogen,"Cummins said it has provided a 20 MW PEM electrolyzer system to generate green hydrogen, making it one of the largest in operation in the world.
The electrolyzer system is installed at an Air Liquide hydrogen production facility in Bécancour, Quebec, and began commercial operation in late 2020. The electrolyzer is designed to produce more than 3,000 tons of hydrogen annually using hydropower.
The HyLYZER PEM electrolyzer technology was developed by Hydrogenics, a Canadian company acquired by Cummins in September 2019. The installation in Quebec features four compact pressurized electrolyzer skids placed inside an existing building. The company said this modular and scalable electrolyzer platform is designed to address utility-scale hydrogen production.
Cummins said its PEM electrolyzers enable making use of excess energy that would typically be sold off to the market at a financial loss, or not harnessed at all. It said its elecrolyzers can also be used to decarbonize multiple sectors including zero-emission transportation, industrial processes, and the green chemicals sector.
In addition to acquiring Hydrogenics, Cummins formed a joint venture with NPROXX to produce hydrogen storage tanks, and has invested in solid oxide fuel cell development.
Zinc-ion battery developer Salient Energy received a $1.58 million grant from the California Energy Commission to support the design and assembly of the company’s residential energy storage systems.
Salient will utilize the funding to open an office and engineering facility in Oakland, California, in the second quarter. The funding will also allow Salient to hire a team of engineers to design and assemble zinc-ion residential energy storage systems that the company says offers an alternative to lithium-ion.
At the new facility, Salient will develop, field test, and validate its battery prototype applications for residential storage systems. The company’s goal is to advance the technology from a pre-commercial stage to the technology demonstration stage where it can then be validated and scaled.
Ingeteam said it supplied and commissioned 53 of its solar PV power stations for the 160 MW Rancho Seco II solar plant in California. The fixed-tilt PV facility is in Sacramento County and was built by Rosendin Electric for DE Shaw Renewable Investments.
Ingeteam’s power station includes a 3.38 MW PV inverter, an LV panel, an auxiliary services transformer, and a MV pad-mounted transformer, all of which are supplied mounted on top of the same skid platform.
Energy generated at the Rancho Seco solar PV is being sold to a utility offtaker through a long-term power purchase agreement. The plant occupies the site of the decommissioned Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, which stopped its operations in 1989.
The inverters include 1500 Vdc technology, DC string monitoring, and an AC pre-charge system for injecting up to 100% reactive power at night.
Ingeteam is an international technology group that is based in Spain and that specializes in energy conversion technology.
The Energy for Growth Hub, a non-profit global network of researchers, advocates and policymakers, and its partner The Rockefeller Foundation, released a report calling on the adoption of a new “Modern Energy Minimum” they say will end energy poverty and avert a potential “energy apartheid.”
In the report, The Modern Energy Minimum: The case for a new global electricity consumption threshold, 14 co-authors propose a new metric to measure progress on addressing energy poverty. They say that every person should have access to at least 1,000 kWh per capita per year, measured both within the home and throughout the wider economy.

The current standard metric is 100 kWh of annual residential power consumption, a level that the report says falls to 50 kWh in rural areas. The authors say that is only enough energy to power a couple of lightbulbs and charge a mobile phone.
“This target is too low in comparison to modern living standards and does not account for the majority of electricity used outside the home,” the report says.
The report says that every high-income country consumes more than 3,000 kWh per capita annually and median consumption is 6,720 kWh. And, about 70% of electricity consumption is used in industry, commerce, agriculture, transportation, or public services.
Set at 1,000 kWh of consumption, the modern energy minimum would match the World Bank’s midpoint for lower-middle income status of around $2,500 per capita/year or about $6.85 per capita/day. Requiring consumption of at least 300 kWh at home plus at least 700 kWh in the wider economy “raises the bar to enable everybody to not only run basic appliances but to access a higher standard of public services such as electrified schools and health clinics,” the report says.
The authors say that central to achieving the goal will be accelerating efforts to bring reliable electricity via environmentally-friendly technologies to over a billion energy-poor people by 2030.
