Researchers at the Imperial College London have developed a new photovoltaic leaf (PV-leaf) concept that is able to produce electricity, thermal energy, and water.
In the study “High-efficiency bio-inspired hybrid multi-generation photovoltaic leaf,” published in nature communications, the research team described the system as a hybrid multi-generation PV-leaf based on a biomimetic transpiration structure made of bamboo fibers and stacked hydrogel cells.
The 1 mm thick biomimetic transpiration (BT) layer moves water passively from a separate water tank onto a 10 cm × 10 cm solar cell placed on top of the structure. The water flowing onto the cell is able to reduce its operating temperature, thus increasing its efficiency, and excess heat is used to produce water and thermal energy. The PV leaf is protected only by a 0.7-mm thick high-transmittance glass layer.
The structure utilizes vascular hydrophilic fiber bundles that uniformly distribute water through the PV-leaf. Hydrogel cells are used to mimic the vascular bundles and sponge cells. “In the BT layer, around 30 branches of bamboo fiber bundles are homogeneously embedded into the potassium polyacrylate (PAAK) superabsorbent polymer (SAP) hydrogel cells, distributing water over the entire area covered by the BT layer,” the scientists explained, adding that the edges of the fiber branches are gathered together and soaked in water.
The scientists measured the performance of the system under standard illumination conditions and compared it to a reference standalone PV cell cooled by natural air convection. They found that the PV-leaf reached a temperature of 43.2 C, while that of the reference cell reached 68.8 C. “The temperature of the non-insulated water tank is close to the ambient temperature and has a slight influence on the cooling performance,” they stated.
The PV-leaf achieved a power conversion efficiency of 15.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.63 V, and a fill factor of 0.77. The reference cell, by contrast, achieved an efficiency of 13.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.58 V, and a fill factor of 0.75.
The academics also said the capital cost of the additional components required by the PV-leaf, is approximately 1.1 $/m2, which represents around 2% of the cost of conventional solar panels. The payback time of the additional components is estimated at less than half a year. “The PV-leaf concept can be upscaled to larger-scale collectors, beyond which even larger solar plants of a commercial size can be divided into several small areas allocated to separate, interconnected PV-leaves,” they added referring to their possible applications in real projects.
“Compared to previous studies on transpiration cooling, the solution in this work does not require pump, control unit, expensive porous materials, and is able to cool the target surface to a significantly lower temperature, which is suitable for multi-generation applications, as well as applications of thermal management for PV cells,” the UK group said, noting that the system may also use seawater instead of freshwater. “Simulation results show that PV-leaf has better transpiration performance in hot and dry climates.”
The academics also claim that the device may be able to generate an additional 1.1 L/h/m2 of freshwater under a solar irradiance of 1000 W/m. They also believe that the system may also use seawater instead of freshwater. “Simulation results show that PV-leaf has better transpiration performance in hot and dry climates,” they emphasized.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/21/california-solar-generation-grew-twentyfold-in-a-decade/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 21, 2023",California solar generation grew twentyfold in a decade,"With solar jumping from 2,609 GWh to 48,950 GWh in the past decade, and coal nearly completely phased out, data from the California Energy Commission shows that the state is on the path to achieving its goal of being carbon neutral by 2045.
Senate Bill 100, which was passed in 2018, requires 100% of California’s electric retail sales be supplied by renewable and zero-carbon energy sources by 2045. Last year Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 1020, establishing interim targets of 90% clean electricity by 2035 and 95% by 2040.
According to the state’s Total System Electric Generation report, renewables including solar and wind are on an upward trajectory, while fossils are losing share. In the past year, solar generation increased just over 24% from 39,458 GWh in 2021 to 48,950 GWh in 2022, an increase of 9,492 GWh.
The state monitors progress through its Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which tracks the power mix of retail sales. The latest data show that in 2021 more than 37% of the state’s electricity came from RPS-eligible sources such as solar and wind, an increase of 2.7% over the prior year. Combined with other carbon-free sources, such as large hydroelectric generation and nuclear, California receives nearly 59% of its retail electricity sales came from non-fossil fuel sources.
California energy mix:
In addition to total utility generation, rooftop solar increased 10 times, generating 24,309 GWh of clean power in 2022. This may change, however, with NEM 3.0, the recent highly controversial change to the state’s net metering policy. ROTH Capital Partners projected that residential solar demand may fall 30% in 2023, following the adoption of NEM 3.0 in California. NEM 3.0 moves from the current retail time-of-use based rates to a far lower rate based on the “avoided cost calculator”.
Adding energy storage to rooftop solar systems was once a costly undertaking, but under the new net metering rule, systems paired with batteries are expected to have the same payback period as standalone systems. As such, California’s solar installers will look to add battery energy storage to their offerings to remain competitive. 
“This latest report card showing how solar energy boomed as natural gas powered electricity experienced a steady 20 percent decline over the last decade is encouraging,” said Siva Gunda, vice chair, California Energy Commission. “Even as climate impacts become increasingly severe, California remains committed to transitioning away from polluting fossil fuels and delivering on the promise to build a future power grid that is clean, reliable and affordable.”
As weather disasters increase in the state, such as unprecedented heatwaves and tropical storm Hilary, the California power grid is repeatedly challenged. In response, Governor Newsom signed legislation in 2022 to create the Strategic Reliability Reserve to try to shore up the grid in the event of emergencies. The reserve consists of demand response programs and other power resources that can be deployed in the event of an energy emergency.
Preparing for the clean grid of the future, the California Public Utilities Commission has ordered 18.8 GW of new clean resources to come on-line by 2028, and efforts are underway to increase deployment of long-duration energy storage and offshore wind energy projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/21/commerce-finds-solar-antidumping-violations-an-industry-reacts/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 21, 2023",Commerce finds solar antidumping violations: An industry reacts,"The U.S. Department of Commerce has ruled that business units of BYD, Longi Green Energy, Canadian Solar, Trina Solar and New East Solar are in violation of anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) laws.
The five companies were found to be circumventing Chinese solar goods through Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia, which are responsible for as much as 80% of the U.S. supply of solar panels. The ruling means that these companies must pay tariffs on the dumped goods to enter the U.S. market.
Past records of solar AD/CVD tariffs have shown that the fee can be as high as 50% to 250% of the cost of shipped goods. However, the tariffs will not apply until June 2024, when President Biden’s two-year pause lifts. 
The looming threat of tariffs led to a freeze in the utility-scale solar industry in 2022, pulling back by deployments by about 16% on a year that was expected to bring booming growth.
The solar industry reacted to this ruling which is expected to have a considerable impact on solar panel supply in the U.S.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association:
“The U.S. Department of Commerce is out of step with the administration’s clean energy goals, and we fundamentally disagree with their decision. The United States is experiencing a $20 billion solar manufacturing renaissance because of policies in the Inflation Reduction Act that incentivize private investment in this country. However, it will take at least 3-5 years to ramp-up domestic solar manufacturing capacity and the global supply chain will be vital in the short-term. This case will just make it harder for American businesses to keep deploying, financing, and installing solar power.”
Steven Zhu, president, Trina Solar U.S.:
“We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in cell and module production in Thailand and Vietnam and most recently another large-scale wafer production facility in Vietnam. In our view, characterizing this production as only minor processing is not an accurate assessment of the facts and against common sense. Commerce’s decision that cell production is minor processing increases the risk that all current and future U.S. cell production will face similar attacks. By undermining the significance of cell production and cutting off supplies and disrupting U.S. demand for solar as it is ramping up, Commerce has made it much harder for companies to predict how the U.S. market will function going forward.”
Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer, American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE):
“Like most sectors of the American economy, the solar industry has a global supply chain and needs continued access to imported components until U.S. manufacturing capabilities are fully ramped up. So over the past week, we’ve gone from toasting the anniversary of the IRA and its positive impacts on America’s energy transition to lamenting the imposition of harmful solar tariffs that will severely constrict solar availability in the U.S. While ACORE will continue working with its members and sector allies to build a domestic solar manufacturing base that supports high-quality jobs, the policy whiplash now being inflicted on the U.S. solar industry is incredibly disruptive and will only delay our nation’s clean energy progress.” 
Congressman Dan Kildee (MI-08):
“American workers can compete with anyone if they are given a level playing field. But right now, Chinese solar companies are benefitting from unfair trade practices, including state subsidies and forced labor practices. The Commerce Department’s own independent report shows that Chinese solar companies are violating existing trade laws and evading U.S. tariffs, hurting Michigan workers. Considering these findings, the administration should immediately reinstate tariffs to hold bad actors accountable.”
George Hershman, chief executive officer, SOLV Energy:
“This decision rests on shaky analysis and its impact jeopardizes the momentum of solar energy in the U.S., especially as the industry continues to recover from pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions. It will cause business uncertainty and potentially delay clean energy projects, costing American jobs and hindering the Biden Administration’s clean energy goals. Our collective focus should be on fostering smart policies that accelerate clean energy deployment nationwide, generating quality American jobs and bringing reliable and affordable power to more communities. Detrimental trade barriers like this one run counter to our efforts to meet deployment goals while the industry capitalizes on the incentives provided in the Inflation Reduction Act to boost domestic manufacturing and grow our national supply chain.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/21/multi-day-energy-storage-increases-grid-capacity-by-factor-of-ten/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,INSTALLATIONS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESEARCH,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 21, 2023",Multi-day energy storage increases grid capacity by factor of ten,"Boston-based startup Form Energy recently announced it has been awarded a $12 million grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to deploy a 10 MW/1000 MWh pilot battery project in New York by 2026. This will be Form Energy’s first grid-scale project in the state following similar announcements in Colorado and Minnesota.
Form Energy’s iron-air battery technology can deliver 100 hours of discharge at system costs competitive with conventional power plants. The multi-day duration positions it well to help New York meet its ambitious clean energy targets – a clean grid by 2040.
NYSERDA awarded the grant as part of its $17 million long-duration energy storage program, intended to accelerate commercialization of promising long-duration technologies. New York has set a goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and will need technologies like multi-day storage to ensure reliability during extended lulls in wind and solar generation.
“Our analysis indicates that multi-day storage has significant potential to help New York meet its decarbonization and grid reliability goals,” said Mateo Jaramillo, CEO of Form Energy. “This grant allows us to accelerate deployment of our first multi-day battery system in New York and sets the path for us to deliver further multi-day storage projects in the State in the future.”
An analysis recently released by Form Energy provides further evidence that multi-day energy storage like its iron-air technology can substantially reduce the costs for New York to achieve its ambitious decarbonization targets.
The analysis used advanced modeling techniques to compare multiple scenarios with varying availability of energy storage durations. It found that including both long-duration (10 to 24 hour) and multi-day (>24 hour) storage in the mix of resources available to meet New York’s goals reduces total system costs in 2040 by 29% compared to relying solely on short-duration lithium-ion batteries.
In the models with only short-duration lithium-ion batteries available, over 60 GW of battery capacity is built by 2040 to shift renewable generation and meet peak demand. However, this capacity only provides 538 GWh of energy storage.
Whereas when long-duration and multi-day storage are available, total storage capacity needs drop to around 40 GW. But critically, total energy storage capacity grows nearly 10x to over 5,000 GWh. These large energy reserves allow the grid to smooth multi-day variability in renewable generation. The emphasis on iron-air storage also avoids the potential fire-hazard of lithium batteries. According to Julian Spector at Canary Media, three separate fires at lithium battery facilities in New York owned by Nextera and Convergent Energy have left the state’s Governor Hochul scrambling to assure local residents that the transition to a clean grid is safe and healthy.
Models show 35 GW of multi-day storage capacity is optimal by 2040. This includes 19 GW of iron-air batteries (or equivalent) plus 16 GW of hydrogen storage. In tandem with 4 GW of lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydro storage, this diverse portfolio of storage durations provides the flexibility to shift renewable energy across multiple timescales.
Multi-day storage charges during periods of excess renewable generation and then discharges steadily for days or weeks during extended lulls, effectively firming the variable output. For example, during one modeled offshore wind lull, wind generation was only 33% of average for a full week. Multi-day storage supplied 16% of total demand that week by drawing from its vast energy reserves.
This ability to firm renewable generation translates into major cost savings. With multi-day storage available, models show New York’s 2040 electric system can be decarbonized with 22% less lithium-ion storage capacity, 36% less nuclear generation, and 6% less solar capacity. The 29% cumulative cost reduction underscores the value provided by long-duration and multi-day storage.
Source: Form Energy
Additionally, the avoided build-out of solar, nuclear and short-duration batteries reduces land use needs and transmission investments. So multi-day storage confers environmental benefits as well as direct economic savings.
The analysis shows long-duration storage begins providing significant value as early as 2030. Including 4.8 GW of multi-day storage in 2030 resource plans reduces costs by 6% annually, while avoiding the need for 5 GW of <10 hour batteries and 5 GW of solar generation. This demonstrates near-term policy support will be crucial to accelerate deployment of emerging long-duration storage technologies in the next 5-7 years.
Overall, the white paper provides compelling evidence that long-duration and multi-day energy storage can cost-effectively firm New York’s growing renewable generation, ensuring a reliable grid during the transition to 100% carbon-free electricity. Form Energy’s iron-air battery is well-suited for this application and the NYSERDA grant will facilitate demonstration of a pilot system by 2026.
Looking ahead, Form Energy projects New York will require at least 3 GW per year of new multi-day storage capacity between 2030 and 2040. Near term policy action to establish incentives, market mechanisms and contract structures will give the private sector needed market signals to invest in manufacturing and project development for emerging technologies like iron-air batteries. Then these resources can be deployed at scale to maximize cost savings and grid reliability as New York pursues its ambitious decarbonization timeline.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/21/biden-harris-administration-launches-interagency-task-force-to-build-clean-hydrogen-economy/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 21, 2023",Biden-Harris Administration launches interagency task force to build clean hydrogen economy,"The Biden-Harris Administration has launched an inter-agency hydrogen task force designed to advance the administration’s “whole of government” approach to clean hydrogen, Mary Frances Repko, White House deputy national climate advisor, announced during a webinar. 
The task force will be co-chaired by Repko and David Turk, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and will “ensure that we fully leverage the strengths and capabilities of the U.S. government to develop technologies, implement policy, and overcome barriers to building the clean hydrogen economy,” Repko said. 
Clean hydrogen is expected to play an integral role in achieving a decarbonized energy system. It can be produced in nearly every corner of the country and across a wide range of sectors, and can be a useful tool to decarbonize “hard-to-decarbonize” sectors, like industrial and chemical processes and heavy transportation. It also provides a form of long-duration energy storage. 
In June, the Biden-Harris Administration released a national clean hydrogen strategy and roadmap, which includes strategic opportunities to domestically produce 10 million metric tonnes (MMT) of clean hydrogen annually by the end of the decade, 20 MMT annually by 2040, and 50 MMT annually by 2050. 
The administration is also looking to invest $8 billion in building regional hydrogen hubs, and implement a “game-changing” hydrogen production tax credit, Repko said. 
“The vast opportunities of the clean hydrogen economy extend beyond a few programs – it touches a wide segment of our society and cuts across many of the administration’s priorities,” Repko said.
Under the new task force, federal agencies will coordinate efforts related to hydrogen across multiple areas, Repko said. This includes ramping up outreach with tribal communities and other historically underserved communities. In addition, it will work closely with a spectrum of stakeholders from industry, academia and labor unions, she said. 
Multiple federal agencies are working on clean hydrogen-related initiatives. The DOE leads this area with research and development work on hydrogen delivery, storage and applications in transportation, energy storage, power generation and other sectors; The Department of Defense (DOD) has also conducted hydrogen-related research and development on things like underwater and aerial vehicles, and microgrids. And the Department of Agriculture  implements the Renewable Energy for America Program, which can include hydrogen, and provides loan financing and grants to implement renewable energy systems. 
The U.S. currently produces about 10 MMT of hydrogen annually, but the vast majority of that comes from fossil fuel sources without carbon capture technologies, Turk said. By 2030, the administration wants to produce that same amount of hydrogen, but entirely from clean resources. 
“Just to give you a sense of scale of what we’re talking about, 10 million metric tons of clean hydrogen [is] equivalent to the amount of energy used by every bus and every train in the United States combined,” Turk said.

Five major solar panel suppliers found in violation of antidumping laws  Units of BYD, Longi, Canadian Solar, Trina Solar and New East Solar were found in violation of trade laws and now face heavy tariffs. Three major suppliers were found to not be in violation.
Clean energy jobs seeing growth across the U.S.  Jobs in clean energy outpaced the overall workforce, adding nearly 4% from 2021 to 2022. That number is expected to rise as projects come to fruition as a result of passage of important clean energy legislation.
U.S. awards $34 million to 19 hydrogen projects  As the U.S. and British government press ahead with their hydrogen support projects, a team from Korea and the U..S has developed an iridium nanostructure catalyst, which decreased the amount of the chemical element. Meanwhile, hydrogen projects are proceeding in West Virginia, Denmark, Finland, and Japan.
