However, their practical implementation is held back by low rate capability.
Now, a group of researchers led by Albuquerque-based Sandia National Laboratories have demonstrated a lithium-sulfur redox mediated flow battery that utilizes a high surface area lithium scaffold to enable even 10 times faster cycling.
In their previous research, the group had designed a redox mediated lithium-sulfur hybrid flow battery containing a lithium metal anode and sulfur in the catholyte reservoir. However, they had observed that the charge rate was limited by dendrite growth on the lithium anode.
This issue, which is common to many lithium-metal-based redox flow batteries, imposes considerable design constraints. Namely, the limited charge rate increases the minimum required electrochemical cell size for a given power output and drives system costs upwards.
To address these limitations, the researchers have replaced the planar lithium anode in redox mediated lithium sulfur redox flow batteries with a high surface area scaffold, which enabled 10 times faster cycling, up to 10 mA cm−2, compared to the same systems with planar anodes, without short circuit or voltage instability.
In their latest study, the researchers first tested the high surface area nickel foam in lithium/lithium symmetric cells and then in a full prelithiated redox flow battery.
They have further improved the cell performance with the addition of zinc oxide to the nickel foam, which promotes better lithium wetting, improving the Coulombic efficiency of the cells.
Finally, they demonstrated that the use of the zinc oxide-nickel foam scaffold also allows the redox flow batteries to be built in an “anode-less” configuration, improving the safety and decreasing the cost to assemble and ship a battery.
Importantly, these improved cells have also shown scalability. Namely, when the sulfur loading is increased from 2.4 to 5 mg cm−2 the capacity is also increased. In fact, with loadings at 5 mgS cm−2 the power density of their redox flow battery was over 20 Wh L−1, making it comparable to vanadium redox flow batteries.
“Having addressed the limitations of the Li anode, there is now further room for improvement of the system by investigating kinetic limitations of the Li-S reaction and capacity fade caused by polysulfide shuttling,” the researchers write. “The fast cycle rate and scalability of the system shows that it is viable for grid scale energy storage in the future.”
Their findings are discussed in “Fast cycling of ‘anode-less’ redox-mediated Li-S flow batteries,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage.

In March Silfab announced plans to invest $125 million investment to expand its facilities and launch a third cell and module fabrication facility in the United States. The company anticipates 1 GW cell production and 1.2 GW module production, which it expects to reach operations in 2024. 
NorSun recently raised $8.5 million in new equity to further develop clean energy manufacturing projects in the United States, including a 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility.
Both companies will benefit from the support of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is stimulating a manufacturing renaissance. However, while much module manufacturing is expected in the U.S., ingot wafer and cell production do not align.  
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the current domestic solar module capacity is 8 GW. However, more than 155 GW of solar supply chain capacity expansions have been announced since the passing of the IRA. This has resulted in an estimated $20 billion investment across domestic communities, leading to various production additions, including: 
According to Paolo Maccario, CEO of Silfab, the agreement between NorSun and Silfab “adds strategic value to Silfab’s unwavering commitment to supply North America with domestically produced, high-performing solar panels”.
Meanwhile, Norsun temporarily suspended wafer production in Norway, as module oversupply in Europe is affecting pricing across the solar value chain, resulting in employee layoffs through the end of this year. The company reports that it will continue to concentrate on its short-term and long-term expansion plans, including plans to upgrade its production line in Årdal.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/11/regulatory-gaps-in-solar-inverters-the-pressing-need-for-oversight/,"MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UTAH",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2023",Regulatory gaps in solar inverters: The pressing need for oversight,"On the morning of April 10, 2023, a fault in a 345 kV transmission circuit led to a sudden drop of 921 MW in output from nine solar power facilities in Utah. The power grid rectified the fault within 3.5 cycles, or approximately six hundredths of a second. While most plants returned to their initial output within minutes, one remained offline and several took up to five minutes to recover.

Any power loss exceeding 10 MW requires reporting to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The organization categorized the 921 MW loss as a Category 1i event under its event analysis process.
According to NERC’s 2023 Southwest Utah Disturbance analysis, many of the affected plants began commercial operations around 2016. This suggests that similar latent issues could plague a significant portion of Utah’s solar power infrastructure. A variety of factors contributed to these failures. One facility tripped due to inverter instantaneous AC overcurrent protection, suggesting inner current control issues. Two other facilities went offline for unknown reasons, later attributed to “poor data retention and/or quality.” Additionally, several plants experienced faults due to multiple inverter issues, including phase lock loop loss of synchronism, instantaneous AC overvoltage, and DC reverse current protection.
Disturbingly, these issues are not new. NERC had previously identified similar performance abnormalities in Texas and California, but generation operators (GOs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have not taken decisive action to mitigate these known risks.

Of the nine affected inverters, seven were manufactured by TMEIC, one by Advanced Energy and one by Sungrow. The Sungrow facility went offline due to anti-islanding protections, which NERC advises should not be enabled on utility-scale solar facilities.
NERC has long advocated for a performance-based ride-through standard to ensure generators remain connected to the bulk power system during disturbances. However, its Project 2020-027, aimed at replacing the outdated PRC-024-3 standard, remains a “work in progress”.
According to NERC, one alarming issue is the discrepancy between what GOs report and what OEMs document. For example, the protections one facility reported were different from those recorded by the OEM during the commissioning process. This means the GOs did not actually implement the interconnection requirements they are obligated to report on.

NERC notes that most required changes involve simple adjustments to existing inverter settings or can be updated easily via firmware.
As the energy grid grows more reliant on inverter-based resources like solar and wind, the industry can’t afford to ignore these latent performance issues. For example, Australia’s ambitious move toward renewables is leading the shift to “grid-forming” inverters, which are poised to become the new backbone of the power grid. These electronic devices are set to replace the mechanical spinning masses that have stabilized our power grids for over a century.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/11/ira-springs-into-action/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2023",How the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy programs benefit U.S. communities and business,"From pv magazine
The IRA is not just about tax credits and incentives. It is providing billions of dollars in grants and loans for clean energy and climate action, with an emphasis on energy justice and meeting the needs of residents in disadvantaged communities, tribes, and rural areas. The act also advances the Justice40 Initiative, which aims to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of IRA and infrastructure investments to people in disadvantaged communities.
The money is on the table. Here we examine some of the places funding is making a difference.
Disadvantaged communities
The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of State and Community Energy Programs has a $27 million Energy Future Grants (EFG) program to encourage local, tribal, and state governments to work with community organizations, academia, utility companies, and non-profits on projects to benefit disadvantaged communities.
The goal of the EFG funding is to address barriers preventing low-to-moderate income (LMI) and disadvantaged communities from realizing the benefits of clean energy for power, transportation, and building. The program expects to make around 50 awards, with recipients each eligible for around $500,000. Applicants submit a community benefits plan outlining how projects will support community and labor engagement, invest in the American workforce, promote diversity and inclusion, and contribute to the Justice40 goal.
Additional IRA funding is available for native communities, supplementing investment from the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Specifically, the IRA provides $75 million to help guarantee up to $20 billion in loans to support tribal investment in energy-related projects, and $150 million to bring clean electricity to tribal homes. It appropriates $225 million for tribal climate resilience, which can also support tribes that need to relocate due to impacts of climate change. Tribes also benefit from the Justice40 Initiative.
Job creation
The IRA is expected to create millions of quality jobs as many of the clean energy tax provisions offer bonus credits to projects paying prevailing wages or using registered apprentices. U.S. manufacturing is also ramping up as a result of the IRA’s domestic content requirements, which offer bonus credits for projects featuring US steel, iron, and other manufactured products. Thus, more manufacturing workers are needed.
The DOE is investing $13.5 million in a training partnership program to expand the solar workforce in under-served and under-represented communities. The DOE estimates as many as 1.5 million workers will be needed by 2035 to achieve the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration’s decarbonization goals. Trade body the Solar Energy Industries Association estimates the solar and storage industries will need 800,000 new workers for a million-plus workforce by 2030.
Local solar
Starting in 2024, community solar is expected to begin an upward path, growing at an annual clip of 8% with nearly 14 GW of cumulative capacity set to be installed by 2028, according to a recent study by analyst Wood Mackenzie and business, non-profit membership body the Coalition for Community Solar Access.
Community solar cuts upfront investment and makes clean energy possible for non-homeowners and those whose roofs are not solar-friendly. The Community Power Accelerator program intends to unite investors, philanthropic organizations, developers, community-based organizations, and technical experts to deploy more equitable community solar projects.
The DOE has launched the 2023 Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar, offering $200,000 in prizes for community solar projects and programs that increase equitable access and ensure benefits go to subscribers and their communities. The energy department also announced a $3 billion conditional loan commitment to residential solar company Sunnova Energy’s Project Hestia, which aims to expand access to solar in disadvantaged communities.
“[The] DOE is providing an exciting new set of tools and important assistance to support solar deployment across the nation so that all communities can enjoy the economic and critical public health benefits that come with deploying renewable energy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm
Energy loans
The IRA provides substantial resources to guarantee clean energy project loans. With $40 billion in loan authority supported by $3.6 billion in credit subsidy for loan guarantees, the DOE intends to encourage development of technology that advances renewable energy systems, carbon capture, nuclear energy, and critical minerals processing, manufacturing, and recycling.
The DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office understands it will need a decommissioning plan after incentivizing vast amounts of solar. The $20 million Materials, Operation, and Recycling of Photovoltaics funding opportunity is intended to support research, development, demonstration, and commercialization projects that minimize material use in solar energy systems, improve the installation quality and resilience of PV systems, and improve the reuse and recyclability of solar panels. The funding opportunity asks teams to identify ways to optimize solar systems throughout their lifecycle, to lower costs, thus facilitating rapid deployment of solar energy.
“Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, we are creating a robust PV recycling industry that will help us achieve a clean energy future through rapid deployment of solar energy,” says Granholm. “This announcement will enhance PV systems throughout their lifecycle to lower costs and reduce impacts on the environment while ensuring that we have a plan for taking solar panels offline in an efficient and economical manner that boosts the domestic supply chain.”
Through proper recycling and reuse initiatives, solar deployment will become less dependent on the supply chain and better able to sustain the expected growth in clean energy.
Clean outcome
With the passage of the IRA, in combination with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other legislation, the DOE says that the United States will achieve a 40% reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions, from 2005 levels, by 2030, positioning the United States to realize the president’s goal with additional executive-branch, state, local, and private sector action. The government department estimates that the clean energy provisions of the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, together, could reduce emissions by more than a billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2030, equivalent to the combined annual emissions released from every home in the United States.
Energy communities
The 10% investment tax credit adder allocated for energy communities under IRA extends eligibility in a few different ways. In addition to focusing on low-income communities, the designation considers the energy legacy of a region. Communities that sit above the national average for unemployment and have disproportionately relied on the fossil fuel industry for economic wellbeing are designated as energy communities.
This designation is important for these communities as the nation seeks to bring jobs to areas that would be hurt by the transition away from fossil fuels. One prime example of this work is an 800 MW solar project in Kentucky which will be built on the former Starfire coal mine.
The BrightNight-developed project, built directly on former mine lands, represents more than $1 billion in infrastructure investment and will produce enough power for the equivalent of more than 170,000 Kentucky households each year. Projects of this size can bring up to 1,000 construction jobs, or more, which is much needed in Appalachia, an area which will suffer the wounds of a dying coal industry.
Electric vehicle truck provider Rivian signed on for the first 100 MW of the project in a long-term power purchase agreement. The site will be built in phases, starting in 2025. Environmental group The Nature Conservancy will also sign for a 2.5 MW power purchase agreement.
“Significant investments in infrastructure will be critical to solving the climate crisis but how we invest is just as important as how much we invest: We need to ensure both people and the planet are central to these decisions, especially in communities like the Appalachians that have powered America for centuries and have tremendous natural resources,” stated Jennifer Morris, CEO of The Nature Conservancy.
PV leaders
The Department of Energy awards five organizations a grand prize of $10,000 each for exemplifying the full potential of community solar and its benefits for residents. This year’s winners of the Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar, between them, accounted for $4.3 million in annual savings for their subscribers.
The Shungnak-Kobuk Community Solar Independent Power Producer Project is a solar-plus-battery microgrid owned and operated by two Alaskan tribes which insulates the communities from volatile diesel gas prices. The 223 kW array stabilizes the local grid and excess funds from the project will be used to finance home energy-efficiency upgrades.
Washington D.C. Solar for All is a no-cost LMI program saving customers an average $520 per year. It currently operates more than 160 community solar projects that serve more than 6,000 households in the US capital, Washington DC. The program has a goal of reducing electricity bills by 50% for 100,000 households by 2032.
Brooklyn N.Y. Community Power is a 1.2 MW project delivering guaranteed 20% bill savings to 500 LMI households. The project provided workforce training, led by Solar One and Green City Force, that led to full-time jobs with solar installers for several public housing residents. All the subscribers to this project also become members of the NYC Community Energy Co-op, giving them a controlling stake in future energy projects and the opportunity to become member-owners of the solar array that serves their community.
Faribault Community Solar, in Minnesota, was developed by member-owned energy democracy body Cooperative Energy Futures, under the Rewards Community program run by utility Xcel Energy. The Faribault project provides bill savings to 77 subscribers, half of which are LMI households. The program foregoes credit or income verification and backs its program with a unique subscriber model in which a large local organization acts as “anchor tenant” to mitigate risk.
JOE-4-SUN Ashland is a 6 MW project in Ashland, Massachusetts, which leverages the commonwealth government’s Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program. It serves more than 500 LMI households, guaranteeing 50% bill savings, which amounts to more than $400 of annual savings per household. The project used entirely union labor, supporting well-paid jobs with livable wages and benefits. The facility is on the former Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump, designated a “superfund” site in need of remediation, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/11/creating-a-new-tech-standard-for-solar-panels/,"SPONSORED POST,ITALY,OKLAHOMA,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2023",Creating a new tech standard for solar panels,"Solar power accounted for the highest portion of new generating capacity additions to the United States’ electricity grid each of the last four years, a trend that has continued into 2023. Historically, solar capacity was increased by installing more panels, but this approach is unsustainable as land availability decreases and costs rise.
Instead, bringing more solar energy online will rely on improving generation efficiency. This is a challenge the industry has been slow to solve. Despite their generation limitations, single-junction solar cells are still commonly used in solar panels. However, US domestic solar production has a new contender.
3SUN USA announced its intention to build one of the largest solar PV module and cell manufacturing facilities in Inola, Oklahoma, earlier this year. This will be 3SUN’s second facility. Its first, in Catania, Italy – the birthplace of CORE-H technology – has produced solar cells and modules since 2011. The facility is expanding and increasing production from 200 to 3,000 MW annually to become Europe’s largest photovoltaic cell and module factory. Now the trusted solar manufacturer is bringing its decade-plus of global experience and its bifacial hetero-junction technology (HJT) to utility, commercial, and residential customers in the US.
HJT is a solar panel manufacturing technique that produces panels by overlapping layers of material with different characteristics. For example, one layer of crystalline silicon overlaps one of amorphous silicon, a combination 3SUN calls CORE-H.
The CORE-H arrangement of crystalline and amorphous silicon layers elevates solar energy production beyond the limits of more commonly used arrangements, like passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT), or tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells. Once constructed, 3SUN bifacial HJT CORE-H solar cells capture sunlight on two sides, ensuring a high performance that broke the world record for efficiency in 2020, converting 24.63%.
In addition to increased efficiency, 3SUN’s solar cells offer users lower degradation of performance over time and increased stability in wet environments and at high temperatures. These benefits will be particularly important as climate change spurs increasingly extreme weather across the country.
“Decarbonizing the energy sector is incredibly important to securing the future of our planet,” Giovanni Bertolino, Head of 3SUN USA said. “By producing efficient, reliable photovoltaic modules for both utility-scale and distributed generation installations, we enable a more sustainable solution to the decarbonization challenge. And we’re doing it with 100% renewable electricity in our 3SUN USA facility.”
3SUN’s technology is uniquely informed by its affiliation with Enel, the world’s largest private player in the renewable energy sector. Built with insight into the most pressing challenges facing renewable generation facilities, 3SUN has developed and finessed cutting-edge technology to drive innovation in the growing domestic solar industry. Panels produced in the Catania facility will be available to support the US market in early 2024 while the US facility is under construction.
“A more innovative, efficient solar industry benefits everyone,” Bertolino said. “I look forward to seeing its growth and opportunity as advancements like bifacial hetero-junction technology become the standard.”
