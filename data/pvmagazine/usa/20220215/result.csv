In the first entry of this series, the two explored the advantages metal roofs inherently have in housing solar systems, from the perspective of asset lifespans and overall system lifetime costs, while the second entry focused on common types of mounting systems for metal roofs, and the associated risks, pros, and cons of each.
In the final entry S-5! and MCA bring together the previous conversations to take a comprehensive look at the critical technical factors for solar PV systems specific to mounting on metal roofs. authors from the two organizations illustrates how long-term performance of roof-mounted solar PV systems can only be achieved through careful planning, design, procurement, installation and quality control.
Of course, as was outlined in the first entry, the first consideration for installing a pv system on a metal roof should be to verify that the existing metal roof has a remaining roof life of at least 30 years. After that, calculations must be done to ensure that the roof and all components of the system can withstand and contribute to overall resilience in the face of wind, snow, seismic and collateral dead loads. Once those two steps have been completed, the hardware chosen for the installation must be thoroughly vetted for quality assurance and potential defects.
Hardware considerations and service life compatibility
First things first, all mounting system components for PV installations on metal roofs of all kinds must be certified to UL 2703, the UL Standard for Safety Mounting Systems, Mounting Devices, Clamping/Retention Devices, and Ground Lugs for Use with Flat-Plate Photovoltaic Modules and Panels.
According to the authors, metal roof mounting system components should be fabricated from corrosion-resistant metals with a service life expectancy at least equivalent to the roof itself.
For copper roofs mounting system components should be brass or stainless-steel alloys, though anodized structural aluminum alloys may be used when brass alloys are not commercially available. Stainless steel fasteners or caps should be used when portions of those fasteners are exposed to the elements. For coated steel, aluminum, zinc, or stainless roofs, structural aluminum alloys and/or 300-series stainless steel should be used.
The most common and highest-recommended (by the authors, at least) style of metal roofs are standing seam metal roofs. Since these systems have few, if any, penetrative components, the same should apply for the solar installation. Solar PV mounting systems for standing seam roof installations must be mechanically attached to the panel seams only via seam clamps in order to preserve the roof’s design features and warranties. 
Another metal roof style is the face-fastened metal roof, where the roof attaches directly to the structure by design vial long-life fasteners using coatings and/or metal alloys compatible with the roof material in terms of metallurgy and life expectancy. This type of system is protected from moisture intrusion by high-quality synthetic rubber seals and protected from UV exposure by the fastener head design. While fastening penetration in these roof types is unavoidable, the waterproofing diligence of mounting system components should be of equal or better quality than the roof construction itself. 
The attachment style for these roofs also brings in the need for additional testing of the attachment components, which should be validated to ASTM E 2140, Standard Test Method for Water Penetration of Metal Roof Panel Systems by Static Water Pressure Head.
Additionally, the authors attest that stainless steel screws or caps should be used when portions of the fasteners are exposed to the elements. 
For additional structural confidence, chosen systems and components must be proven by engineering calculations to withstand design loads mandated by the local building code. Proof of engineering by a duly registered design professional must be furnished to the client and the relevant authority having jurisdiction.
Mounting system attachments must be thoroughly tested for holding capacity by ISO 17025-certified independent labs and to industry-accepted protocols. Testing must be specific to the roof material, profile and brand of manufacture of the roof used on the project and be furnished to the client. This proof is ideally in the form of an accepted third-party listing or engineering evaluation, but the authors outline that it may also be a written report.
Assuring quality 
For even greater peace of mind when selecting components, the report outlines a series of questions that installers and customers should consider.
The report recommends that, at minimum, the building and PV system owner should obtain a letter from the vendor stating that testing, manufacturing and product designs are in compliance with all provisions of this document along with obtaining the applicable lab load-test reports and job-specific structural engineering calculations that prove proper resistance of the PV mounting system to design loads.
Installation specifics
While the components used and style of roof can be drastically different from metal roofs to other common materials, the report outlines that many of the best practices are the same as installing solar PV on any roof type, because every project must be engineered and designed to withstand the design forces and environmental conditions with certified components, regardless of roof.
However, metal roofs are unique enough to have their own installation considerations. Metal roofs will outlast the service life of a solar PV system, so it is critical that the mounting system and all attachments protect and maintain the durability of the roof. Equally important is the use of materials and assemblies that are thoroughly tested and certified, especially components in direct contact with the roof, so that the attachments do not compromise the integrity of the metal roof.
Regardless of the mounting system, the metal roof attachment should be mechanically compatible with the mounting system. Substituting, adding, or stacking components not tested as an assembly is generally a very bad idea. Of course, the attachment system must be the best fit for the specific metal roof regardless of roof style. 
Finally, for an exposed fastened roof, the critical element is the integrity of the seal, since the attachment is designed to penetrate the roof. 
Sealants and gaskets are necessary at both the bracket surface touching the roof and at the heads of all fasteners. A butyl sealant captured in a reservoir is generally the best way to seal brackets attaching to the pan of the roof panel, while a durable sealant strip is appropriate for brackets attaching above the pan, such as in the rib area. Ideally, these sealants and gaskets are integral to the component design and pre-installed by the manufacturer. This practice assures that inferior sealants are not locally sourced by the installer.

The RFP comes as part of the second phase of PECO’s solar credit procurement plan. 
The first phase of RFPs allocates 4,000 annual credit purchases to statewide solar providers, and the second phase targets solar providers located in PECO’s service territory of southeastern Pennsylvania. Eligible contracts are for 10 years of credit sales, with a minimum of 200 credits delivered each year. PECO said the average winning bid price for the second phase is $34.07 per AEC. 
Phase one applications will be accepted starting March 7. A solar credit overview conference will be held by PECO via Zoom on February 23rd to review application requirements, overview key program dates, and field questions related to the RFP. 
Through the ten-year program, 160,000 renewable energy credits will be purchased by the utility, representing the production of about 2,400 average Pennsylvania solar homes. This will effectively double PECO’s investment in credits, said the company.  
At an average bid price of $34.07 per credit, this would represent nearly $5.5 million in solar credit investment over ten years by a company that reports an “annual economic impact” of $4.5 billion in Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania sources about 0.39% of its power from solar, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA reports 855MW installed statewide, enough power for roughly 112,000 homes.
While the overall trend for solar installations is rising, 2020 was a significantly higher year for solar deployment than 2021. SEIA projects 1.79GW in deployment over the next five years, ranking Pennsylvania 21st in the nation for growth prospects.

The Golden Fields Solar project, located in Kern County, will provide enough power for an estimated 52,000 homes each year.
The Golden Fields Solar project was selected after MCE’s annual solicitation for renewable energy and storage projects. With unanimous support by MCE’s Technical Committee of the Board, this new large-scale solar-plus-storage facility will generate 100MW of solar energy with a co-located 75MW lithium-ion battery.
The project is expected to come online in March 2025 for a 15-year term. Golden Fields Solar will be constructed with union labor using a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) and will include pollinator-friendly habitat throughout the project site. In addition, the project developer has pledged $100,000 and 100 hours of employee time toward community benefit initiatives that directly benefit MCE’s service area and communities adjacent to the project location.

The Golden Fields Solar project will help MCE meet the California Public Utilities Commission’s mid-term reliability mandate, which requires MCE to procure an additional 72MW of solar plus 5-hour dispatch storage capacity by 2025.
MCE is a load-serving entity supporting a 1,200MW peak load, and it is dedicated to offering renewable energy at stable rates. It currently provides electricity service and programs to more than 540,000 customer accounts and more than one million residents and businesses in 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, and Solano.

The 39 projects outlined in the acquisition are spread across 91 total sites, ranging from 0.2 MW to 6.5 MW in size. The portfolio includes a number of projects providing solar energy to schools, including 20 carport assets serving California’s Stockton Unified School District and 16 sites serving the Hawaii Department of Education. The portfolio also includes 11.5 MW of Minnesota community solar projects with various C&I off-takers.
According to CleanCapital, the acquisition came to be partly due to an ongoing trend towards consolidation in the clean energy industry, specifically among the market share of the top commercial solar asset owners. As CleanCapital outlines in the acquisition announcement, the annual market share of the top commercial solar asset owners has increased from 26% in 2019 to 34% in 2021 through Q3, according to Wood Mackenzie.
This acquisition is the sixth in a series of investments made since CleanCapital announced a $300 million commitment from Manulife in April 2021. The company has successfully acquired and managed 200 projects in 24 states totaling more than 300 MW. Its cumulative acquisitions total more than $800 million.
“In this relatively fragmented segment of the industry, only a handful of commercial solar asset owners have total portfolios over 100 MW,” said Principal Analyst at Wood Mackenzie, Michelle Davis. “In general, the commercial solar industry—including community solar—is slowly consolidating. We would expect this trend to continue as sophisticated long-term asset owners continue to build and expand their financing platforms.”
In June 2021, CleanCapital partnered with CI Renewables to provide financing for 11 projects, totaling 29 MW, which are scheduled to achieve commercial operations throughout 2022. Under the agreement, CI will supervise construction of the projects which are in Howard County, Maryland, between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.
In April 2020 Howard County signed a power purchase agreement for the energy, which is expected to account for around 30% of the county government’s total annual electricity use. The agreement provides a total anticipated cost benefit of $1.2 million for the 25-year life of the contract.

Oregon-based Powin Energy announced major supply deals covering a 5.8GWh pipeline of energy storage projects in the US and Taiwan. The company will supply its fully integrated battery storage systems to four, undisclosed developers out to 2024.
Under the framework agreement, Powin will provide fully integrated battery energy storage facilities including cells, stacks, enclosures, cabling, transformers, inverters, battery management, and all software and controls systems.
As an up-and-coming player in the battery market, Powin develops products and software including battery modules, packs, and turnkey systems, as well as battery and energy management systems and cloud-based monitoring and control set-ups.
The company uses its proprietary software controls and ancillary equipment to hook up battery cells sourced from China. Its scalable storage systems use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells mainly from CATL and EVE.
Powin’s manufacturing capacity is based in multiple locations including China and Taiwan. In 2020, the company announced plans to expand Taiwanese production from 700MWh to 2.5GWh, and it recently publicized a near-shoring deal to establish manufacturing nearer its US end users and to reduce exposure to logistical problems.
In an announcement last month, Powin said it would be near-shoring fabrication of its modular Centipede lithium-ion battery systems to Monterrey, Mexico, in partnership with manufacturing and supply chain business Celestica. As confirmed last week, the majority of the new 5.8GWh supply agreements will use Powin’s Centipede product from that site.
Launched in November, the Centipede consists of pre-integrated modular units containing batteries, thermal management equipment, and other safety features. According to Powin, Centipede requires half the time to procure and deploy – and uses 30% less space – than rival modular storage systems, while also reducing lifecycle costs.
The product integrates multiple Powin Stack750E BESS (battery energy storage system) units, which are designed for two-to-four-hour applications, and supports more than 200MWh of energy storage capacity per acre. The third-generation battery module was updated with new thermal controls, a change Powin said will create an anticipated 80% reduction in service times.
Order book
Prior to the newly-announced supply deal, Powin said it had already secured more than 2GWh of contracts for the Centipede from multinational independent power producers and utilities. Under the new orders, the company will be responsible for commissioning the battery systems and for long-term services including on site operations and maintenance, battery augmentation, and 20-year extended warranties.
“With the significant strides that Powin has made as a company in the previous 12 months, these agreements signify that we have built a superior level of trust within the energy storage industry,” said Powin CEO Geoff Brown. “These agreements are with some of the industry’s most well-respected developers, with healthy pipelines of projects located near some of the largest power hubs throughout the American West and Northeast, as well as Asia.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/15/interconnection-studies-could-be-completed-in-months-say-seia-aee-and-acp-in-comments-to-ferc/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022","“Interconnection studies could be completed in months,” say SEIA, AEE and ACP in comments to FERC","Calling on federal energy regulators to “make interconnection reform a top priority,” three trade groups yesterday raised concerns over interconnection queue “logjams” and “exploding” network upgrade costs faced by large-scale solar, wind and storage projects awaiting approval in interconnection queues.
Those queues are managed by grid operators known as RTOs and ISOs, and by utilities not served by a grid operator.
The groups asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to resolve the logjams and prioritize remedial action through “an accelerated, stand-alone interconnection rulemaking.”
The three groups are the solar association SEIA, the clean energy trade group Advanced Energy Economy, and the renewables and transmission trade group American Clean Power Association.
To improve interconnection studies, where study timeframes approach four to five years in the PJM grid region, the groups said that with standardization and automation, these studies “could be completed in months instead of years.” They provided FERC with 14 near-term and six long-term reforms to get there, and said that some transmission providers “have already implemented the reforms identified.” Interconnection delays were also flagged as a major barrier by renewables developers in a November survey.
Regarding costs, the groups said affected system operators in most RTO/ISO regions are “perversely incentivized to identify disproportionate network upgrades” in affected system studies, “because these upgrades are fully funded by one or more interconnection customers.” They offered seven reforms to address such issues.
To fix clogged queues, where many areas “continue to use the serial first-come, first-served” interconnection approach, the groups called for use of industry best practices. They recommended a cluster study approach that considers multiple interconnection requests jointly, in conjunction with milestone-based “first-ready, first-served” processes.
The groups said that the common practice of requiring generators to pay 100% of network upgrade costs “is not legally durable,” because those upgrades are integrated with the regional transmission system and benefit all system users. The solution, the groups said, may be found among “several creative participant funding reform proposals” already submitted in an ongoing FERC docket, and could potentially use formulas based on voltage level or electrical location of upgrades.
The three groups called on FERC to initiate a rulemaking “aimed at requiring transmission providers to adopt the set of reforms” that the groups proposed. The resulting “nationwide rule” should apply to all utilities subject to FERC jurisdiction, as well as to RTOs and ISOs, the groups said.

Financing battery storage: Navigating a maturing market At a recent power finance conference in New York, experts discussed the growing opportunities for installing storage projects, as well as considerations for where the storage markets need to mature to make them more financeable.
Hydrogen under $3/kg may ensure affordable seasonal energy storage in the US Researchers from the United States have investigated how fuel cells and electrolyzers may be able to operate under intermittent availability provided by both wind and solar and have found that an affordable hydrogen-based system for seasonal energy storage could be achieved at a hydrogen price lower than $3, produced from inexpensive renewable electricity at $0.02/kWh.
Interconnection delays and costs are the biggest barrier for utility-scale renewables, say developers LevelTen and Advanced Energy Economy point to delays in the PJM grid region, in particular. Construction of the 300GW of renewables and storage projects in PJM’s interconnection queue would support 1.7 million jobs, says AEE.
California lifts renewable energy target to 73% by 2032 The California Public Utilities Commission raised renewable energy procurement targets, plans for a more aggressive decarbonization plan, and includes increased reliability provisions.
New app helps manage solar inverter connectivity for impending 3G shutdown With 3G set to be shut down at the end of this month, some solar inverters will lose connectivity and stop reporting data. The free Sunvoy app developed by Ipsun Tech addresses this upcoming obstacle by mapping locations of affected inverters, so that installers may swap out equipment at those sites.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/15/lessons-learned-from-texas-storm-uri/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",Lessons learned from Texas storm Uri,"One year ago this week, winter storm Uri unleashed a deep freeze over Texas, causing widespread power outages that affected more than 4.5 million people for up to four days. The outages are considered the cause of most of the 200+ deaths as well as storm damage estimated at approximately $195 billion.
What happened in a state that rarely sees below freezing temperatures was that unusually frigid temperatures, coupled with ice and snow, crippled generating units, reduced natural gas production, and froze wind turbines. A preliminary report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) called on Texas to–again–winterize its energy infrastructure. “This is a wake-up call for all of us. There was a similar inquiry after Texas experienced extreme cold weather in 2011, but those recommendations were not acted on,” said Rich Glick, FERC Chairman.
The final report by FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation said that issues with the natural gas supply caused 87% of the outages as wells and pipelines froze and uninsulated gas plants failed to function. An additional challenge is the unique Texas electrical grid, which stands alone. The grids that supply electricity to most of the country are controlled by FERC, whereas the Texas grid is regulated by Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a non-profit corporation regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Texas Legislature. Had Texas been interconnected to grids in other states, it may have been possible to bring power to the storm-stricken areas. According to a Grid Strategies report, an additional 1GW of transmission ties between the ERCOT grid and that governed by FERC in Southeastern US could have saved nearly $1 billion, while keeping the heat on for hundreds of thousands of Texans.
Following the devastation caused by the storm and subsequent analysis, in June of last year Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bills 2 and 3 into law. The laws are intended to change how the grid must be prepared for extreme weather and how ERCOT is governed. Senate Bill 3 had had provisions in it that would have required solar assets on the grid to help pay for some of the costs of ancillary services and shoring up the grid, but SEIA helped defeat those provisions.
The Benefit of Solar-plus-storage in TX
In 2020 Texas ranked number two for solar installations in the country, and at the time of the storm a total of 6,349MW of solar capacity was installed on Texas rooftops or in utility-scale installations across the state.
According to a white paper “Rooftop solar and the 2021 Texas power crisis”, recently released by the Environment America Research & Policy Center, Environment Texas Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group, if Texas’s full rooftop solar potential had been tapped, devastation from the February 2021 freeze would have been lessened.

The research estimates that the technical potential for rooftop solar generation in Texas is 97,800MW – more than 15 times the total installed capacity at the time of the 2021 power crisis. The report notes that power production fell short of forecast demand on 13 days last February and it estimates that on 11 of those days, rooftop solar could have supplied more than enough power to meet the daily shortfall gap.
In addition to the need for rooftop solar, Uri pointed out the need for adding storage to the mix. Sean Gallagher, SEIA vice president of state and regulatory said that solar and storage “will be a big part of the solution” in Texas. Vibrant Clean Energy, released a white paper on the storm impacts on the ERCOT electricity grid, and it studied a hypothetical ERCOT grid with a high penetration of renewables. It concludes that the variability of wind and solar would still persist in the future, but the modeling added 40,000MW of storage to the grid, which was found to be enough to cover all of the blackout requirements with room to spare.

The company recently announced additional steps it is taking to help reduce carbon including decreasing use of coal to less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal by 2035 as part of what it says is the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry.
Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke Energy provides electric services to 7.2 million customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, including retail natural gas service to over 500,000 customers in Ohio and Kentucky. In 2017, 33% of its porfolio was made up of coal/oil; 28% natural gas; 34% nuclear and only 5% hyro/wind/solar. The plan is for that balance to change by 2030 to 16% coal/oil; 42% natural gas; 32% nuclear; and 10% hydro/wind/solar.
According to its Sustainability Report, as of year-end 2020, Duke Energy owned, operated or had under contract almost 8,800MW of wind, solar and biomass. The plan is to own, operate or contract
16,000MW of wind, solar and biomass by 2025.  And as stated in last week’s financial earnings report, 80% of Duke’s 5-year, $63 billion capital plan includes zero carbon generation, which includes investments in nuclear, renewables (wind and solar), hydro and battery storage.
A spokesperson for Duke Energy told pv magazine that combining both regulated and nonregulated renewables business, Duke has a total of 7,400 megawatts of solar that it owns, operate or purchase – in operation. This does not include solar projects under construction.

“As one of America’s largest electric and gas utilities, we and many of our stakeholders share the view that we can take a leadership role in tackling the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our business and value chain,” said Duke Energy Chief Sustainability Officer Katherine Neebe. “Policy changes and technological innovation are expected to play a key role in meeting these enhanced goals.”
From the perspective of the Sierra Club, Duke’s move away from coal is too little, too late. “While we applaud Duke making a commitment to end their use of coal, 2025 is still too late, and what they replace it with matters,” said Dave Rogers, Southeast deputy regional campaign director for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. Rogers added that, “If Duke wants to protect the communities they serve, they need to get rid of coal by 2030, and replace those plants with clean, renewable energy, not fracked gas plants that will only continue to make the climate crisis worse.”
