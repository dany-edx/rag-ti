https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/29/us-grid-scale-energy-storage-usage-profiles-innovation-and-growth-outlook/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 29, 2022","US grid-scale energy storage usage profiles, innovation, and growth outlook","The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports the United States had a 4.5GW total capacity of energy storage by the end of 2021. The wellspring of storage development has come in response to a variety of beneficial grid services storage can provide, especially when paired with renewable energy. In fact, EIA reports more than 60% of upcoming battery capacity will be co-located with solar PV systems.
Energy storage duration refers to the amount of time a battery or other energy storage system can dispatch energy from a full charge until it is depleted. Most batteries on the grid today range from an hour or less to four-plus hours, and there are some outliers that can provide continuous power for 12 hours or more.
Duration has largely been found to be tied to the function the storage system provides, according to EIA. EIA categorizes battery functions in two main buckets: grid services and electrical load shifting. Grid services, which entail dispatching power for brief periods, sometimes for minutes or even a few seconds, help maintain grid stability and reliability. Electrical load shifting involves shifting electricity from times of low demand to times of high demand. This service is particularly important when paired with the diurnal generation of solar energy.
The grid services-only segment averages 1.15 hours in duration. Hybrid, dual-service storage averages 2.95 hours, and electric load shifting-only batteries average 4.15 hours.
More than 40% of US battery energy storage can perform both grid services and load shifting activities. About 40% performed load shifting activities, and the remaining 20% performed only short-duration grid dispatch services.
In the late 2010s, the bulk of the energy storage added to the grid was focused on short-duration services, but as solar energy becomes an increasing feature of the grid, longer-duration load shifting services are coming under focus. Most co-located solar and energy storage systems feature a battery with durations of four hours or more.
Innovation and growth outlook
EIA forecasts that by the end of 2023, energy storage deployment across the nation will have more than doubled from current levels to about 10GW. With this growth comes a host of innovative opportunities.
In the US, lithium-ion batteries are the dominant source of both short and long duration storage, but other chemistries and designs are being actively considered, especially in the long duration use case. pv magazine has covered developments in lithium-ferro-phosphate batteries, sodium-ion batteries, flow batteries, and other atypical designs like compressed air energy storage, iron-air energy storage systems that rely on oxidation, and gravity-based energy storage towers.
At last November’s COP26 climate summit, a long-duration energy storage consortium was formed. The consortium estimates between 85 and 140 terawatt-hours of LDES deployment will be required to achieve a net-zero grid by 2040. The council also estimates a need of 1 TWh of LDES deployment by 2025 to pace for decarbonization by 2040.
These deployment projections would entail a $1.5 to $3 trillion investment. The council said renewable energy stored in these technologies could eliminate 1.5 to 2.3 Gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, or about 10-15% of global power emissions.
If these emissions reduction targets are to be achieved, there must be carbon-free energy charging the batteries. The world will need 5.2TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14TW by mid-century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The world will have to install 450GW of new solar capacity each year – most of it utility scale – for the rest of this decade, with China and India to lead Asia to a roughly half share of the world’s installed PV capacity in 2030, the report’s authors estimated.
Based on current deployment levels, IRENA director-general Francesco La Camera, recently wrote, “Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate.”

Greenskies Clean Focus recently completed the second of nine off-site solar systems planned for the CSCU. The 6.1MW ground-mounted solar system is expected to help the CSCU save an estimated $9.4 million in energy savings in the first 20 years.
Using virtual net metering, the solar farm will allocate power to five CSCU campuses across the state, using virtual net metering.  Those campuses include: Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Manchester Community College in Manchester and Tunxis Community College in Farmington.
“In addition to the financial benefits, this project is expected to generate upwards of 8.8 million kWh of clean, renewable energy every year,” said Stanley Chin, president and CEO of Greenskies.
The installation is expected to offset 125,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the next twenty years– the equivalent of taking more than 27,000 cars off the road or preserving over 153,000 acres of US forests.
The solar farm consists of nearly 14,000 solar panels across about 27 acres of land.
The 6.1MW installation moves Connecticut forward in its solar penetration. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Connecticut is one of the fastest growing of the smaller states in the solar industry, and currently gets 2.63% of its electricity from solar. Its  success is due in part from the state’s Connecticut Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) program that offers property assessed clean energy financing and program services to municipalities and commercial property owners throughout Connecticut.

Already, experts are drastically cutting down their predictions on the capacity of new, utility-scale solar that the US will be able to develop and how quickly the US will be able to meet it’s emission reduction goals, as well as increasing project cost predictions. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has predicted that  the implementation of AD/CV tariffs would result in the loss of 14GW of new solar installations, a figure which represents more than half of what was installed in the US last year.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA), a solar and storage technical advisory firm, is anticipating that the investigation alone may lead suppliers to stop shipments from the named countries to the United States at least until the Commerce Department issues a final ruling, which could be as late as April 1, 2023. In the short term, CEA expects module and cell buyers with orders booked before the investigation began and with delivery periods during or after the investigation could face delayed shipments and manufacturer attempts to renegotiate terms. Producers from non-named countries may look to raise prices and cut back on their domestic focus, in order to cash in on the starved US market, but their ability to do so will be limited, as many of these manufacturers operate in the distributed generation space, according to CEA.
In our previous coverage, we included commentary from SEIA and Auxin solar, however the conversation does not end with those two entities. pv magazine has collected a series of responses from other players across the political, regulatory, and industry spaces, and will continue to update this column with additional commentary points as they come out.
8minute Solar Energy
The following statement comes from Founder and CEO of 8minute Solar Energy, Dr. Tom Buttgenbach:
“As one of the country’s leading solar developers, we understand firsthand how damaging the Biden Administration’s decision today will be for the solar industry. This unfair and unwarranted complaint undercuts us at a time when we are working hard to navigate unprecedented uncertainty in the global supply chain, hire U.S.-based workers and build out the solar infrastructure necessary to meet the country’s urgent clean energy goals.
At this moment of sky-rocketing fossil fuel prices driving inflation and causing real pain for Americans at the pump, we should be doubling down on investing in a clean energy future, which will not only fight climate change, but drive down costs for U.S. consumers. Instead, this case is already slowing investment in our country’s clean energy future, including the loss of thousands of domestic jobs, while threatening our technological leadership and independence from volatile global oil prices.”
ACORE
The following statement comes from President and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), Gregory Wetstone:
“Today’s decision by the Department of Commerce will upend the renewable energy industry at the worst possible time. Congress has yet to enact a long-term, full-value clean energy tax package, and the agency’s trade investigation creates uncertainty that will chill new investment and cause layoffs in the nation’s solar energy sector. At a time when the renewable energy industry is working incredibly hard to accelerate deployment to meet the Biden Administration’s climate goals and avert the worst impacts of climate change, we need the federal government working in partnership with an all-hands-on-deck effort. Unfortunately, this investigation will needlessly slow economic growth, raise energy costs for American families, and put our climate at greater risk. ACORE urges the Department of Commerce to quickly end the investigation and reject the dramatic expansion of solar tariffs.”
ACP
The American Clean Power Association (ACP), as a group, expressed profound disappointment in the decision, with ACP CEO, Heather Zichal, publishing a statement expanding on that disappointment:
“The Department of Commerce’s decision today signals that the Biden Administration’s talk of supporting solar energy is empty rhetoric. If its commitment to a clean energy future is real, the Administration will reverse this decision immediately. America’s solar workers and the clean energy community are watching and will remember. Overnight, the Commerce Department ignored precedent and subsequently drove a stake through the heart of planned solar projects and choked off up to 80% of the solar panel supply to the U.S. It must fix this now.
American workers will bear the pain of the decision to allow one rogue antagonist to abuse and manipulate trade laws for their own gain. The 230,000 proud Americans who work in the solar industry are calling on President Biden and Secretary Raimondo to reverse their decision and bring this matter to a speedy conclusion. Every day this investigation hangs over the solar community is a day of lost jobs and postponed solar projects critical to the Administration’s climate agenda.
Late last year, Commerce decided not to initiate a similar case. We’re confident that the facts will demonstrate that this case also has no merit, and that Commerce will uphold the decade-long precedent regarding the origin of solar cells and modules that the petitioner is desperately and repeatedly attempting to upend. Without a reliable supply of solar modules while this investigation proceeds, project construction will grind to a halt, American workers risk being laid-off or furloughed, and we will miss our emissions targets – all so that another litigious manipulator can be proven unfounded yet again.
The domestic solar industry calls on President Biden to reverse this decision and put American solar back on the right track. Solar workers and the communities they live in are watching and those who fought and believed in the promises of this Administration to a clean energy future will not forget.”
NextEra
The following statement comes from NextEra Energy President and CEO and NextEra Energy Partners CEO, John Ketchum:
“We are disappointed with the Commerce Department’s decision to grant Auxin’s request to investigate as we believe it has no merit. However, we are optimistic that the investigation will be resolved favorably and that no additional Antidumping and Countervailing Duties tariffs will be put in place.
While some of NextEra Energy’s solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by the disruption this decision is expected to cause, we will work closely with our suppliers and customers to assess the potential impacts of this investigation and remain confident in our ability to arrive at acceptable mitigation measures.
Notwithstanding yesterday’s decision by the Department of Commerce, we are confirming that NextEra Energy’s long-term financial expectations remain unchanged, subject to the usual caveats. For 2022, we continue to expect NextEra Energy’s adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share. For 2023 through 2025, this translates to adjusted earnings per share ranges for NextEra Energy of $2.93 to $3.08, $3.13 to $3.33, and $3.35 to $3.60, respectively. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025.
Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners’ long-term distribution per unit growth rate expectations remain unchanged. From a base of its fourth-quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83 per common unit, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect 12% to 15% per year growth in limited partner distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024, subject to the usual caveats.”
Support for the investigation
While the following statements came out prior to the announcement of the investigation, U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urging her to accept the anti-circumvention petition, providing a rare perspective into the pro-investigation side of the discourse. Below is their letter, in full:
Dear Secretary Raimondo:
We write to encourage you to accept the recently filed petition from a minority-and-woman-owned business related to solar cells and modules imported in circumvention of the existing antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders on Chinese solar cells and modules. A strong commitment to American manufacturing must be paired with proper trade enforcement so that investments in American production, workers, and innovation are not undermined by unfair trade practices. That is why the Department of Commerce must fully and fairly examine these allegations of illegal and unfair circumvention of our trade remedy laws.
In trade remedy cases, the length—on average 14 months from first filing to relief—makes clear that justice delayed is justice denied. Yet, even timely justice can be thwarted by circumvention, which has been a consistent strategy of anticompetitive global actors seeking to escape the requirements imposed by U.S. law. Therefore, after the International Trade Commission (ITC) finds that there is evidence of unfair trade, the Department of Commerce must ensure that the decision by the ITC stands. When duties have been imposed on specific products from specific countries, unfairly traded imports should not then be able escape our AD/CVD orders by being routed through additional third countries. Congress provided anti-circumvention authority to Commerce in 1988 to ensure that injured domestic industries obtained the full relief of the trade remedy laws and not just half loaf.
In this instance, a U.S. manufacturer alleges that after imposition of AD/CVD orders against Chinese-made solar cells and modules, Chinese companies established new operations in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia to escape the strictures of U.S. trade remedy law and maintain control over the global solar supply chain. As we understand it, these operations use raw materials, labor, capital investment, and research and development from China. Moving to a third country to assemble a product with inputs from the country subject to the original AD/CVD order is textbook circumvention. As you know, if legitimate circumvention allegations go unaddressed, entire domestic industries and thousands of American manufacturing jobs are at risk.
Strong enforcement of our trade laws to level the playing field on which American companies and workers can compete lays the foundation to rebuilding a robust solar industrial base in the United States. Thank you for your consideration of our request, and we thank you for your diligence in this circumvention inquiry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/29/what-we-have-here-is-a-failure-to-communicate-solar-generation-data/,"COMMUNITY,COST AND PRICES,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 29, 2022",What we have here is a failure to communicate solar generation data,"The Attorney General of Washington DC has filed a complaint against local electricity utility, Exelon owned PEPCO, for failing to “provide promised solar credits to low-income households & undermin[ing] the District’s efforts to meet Clean Energy Goals.”
AG Racine’s press release lists five general complaints:
In the complaint, there are recurring references to PEPCO’s requirements for extra hardware – in the form of an electricity meter and its supporting gear. Even with this extra meter, PEPCO routinely under-credited (and occasionally over-credited) project owners and electricity buyers.
The filing states that in June and July of 2020 alone, 1,683 subscribers were under-credited by $50,640.99, and 160 accounts were over-credited by $2,322.20. The chart below references at least 4,934 of these instances, with a minimum dollar amount of $138,376.51 over a 16 month period.

Not only did the utility incorrectly credit buyers of the electricity, they also underpaid solar asset owners.
The wound was salted by the fact that not only did PEPCO miff the billing, they did after they’d hardware taxed the solar contractor by requiring a completely unnecessary utility controller meter to run in concert with the community solar program’s required revenue-grade meter.
This meter takes additional time to install for the contractor and then later the utility, (sometimes several months, due to the slow and steady monopoly industry model), it’s also thousands of dollars in supporting hardware and labor to install said additional meter.

The complaint notes that the revenue grade electricity meter, per the Public Utility Commission’s direction, is supposed to drive billing. In other words, PEPCO’s meter is not needed for the community solar program. If PEPCO has improperly used their utility owned meters to drive billing, that is in violation of law.
Per annual filings, in 2019, the Washington DC’s Solar For All Community Solar Program added 7MW of capacity and signed 8,600 accounts. In 2020, 10MW of additional capacity was installed, to serve over 4,000 community solar sign ups. The group projected that 12MW of capacity would be installed in 2021, benefitting 3,400 newly signed customers.
SEIA suggests 174MW of capacity has been installed in the district.
In related news, Exelon settled a federal bribery case for $200M USD after it was found that bribes, jobs, contracts, and other financial benefits were given to former staffers of State of Illinois politicians.
Recently, Exelon’s Illinois nuclear power plants received $694 million to keep its four reactor sites online for five more years, while the state has moved forward on an initially successful successor solar program as part of its recent clean energy legislation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/29/enphase-launches-pilot-to-pay-solar-customers-for-leasing-batteries-and-sharing-energy/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 29, 2022",Green Mountain Power selects Enphase batteries for pilot lease discount program,"The new era of the power grid may be characterized not by large power plants and sprawling transmission lines, but by local, flexible energy sources. Such is the vision explained in venture capitalist Bill Nussey’s Freeing Energy, which envisions billion-dollar opportunities for innovators that can reconceive how energy is created, stored, and delivered. This new concept of the grid is already underway, and the latest example is the collaboration between Vermont utility Green Mountain Power, and microinverter and energy storage provider Enphase.
The two announced that Green Mountain Power will offer Enphase batteries at a significant discount in a pilot lease program. In the pilot, Enphase will provide 100 eligible customers with two Enphase IQ Battery 10 units for $65 per month for ten years, or for a single payment of $6,500. That cost does not include installation. Enrolled homeowners benefit from reliable backup power, while also sharing stored energy during times of high demand to help reduce overall costs for all GMP customers.
“This new battery backup leasing program makes getting an Enphase Energy System with its exceptional IQ Batteries an even easier decision for Vermont homeowners. With the new IQ8 microinverters, our customers will be able to easily expand their home battery system over time, giving them even more peace of mind about their energy future. This partnership allows the homeowners, local contractors, and utilities to use Enphase’s state of the art technology to help create a more reliable, affordable, and cleaner grid for all of Vermont.” Liam Madden, director of solar energy at HB Energy Solutions.
The Enphase batteries are lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistry batteries, which the company said provide a long life cycle and improved safety through thermal stability. They are equipped with a feature to seamlessly power up air conditioners and well pumps in the event of a grid power loss. The batteries come with a ten-year limited warranty with the ability to extend by an additional five years.
Green Mountain Power has another existing virtual power plant offering, the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program. Under BYOD, upfront payments of up to $9,500 are offered depending on the capacity of the systems enrolled. Green Mountain Power said homeowners that retrofit an existing solar system in one of the areas of the state where battery power is needed most may be eligible to receive an extra $100 per kilowatt. Program participants will be enrolled for a term of a minimum of ten years.
Enphase is also launching its Grid Services Manager, a distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) that Green Mountain Power will use to manage the virtual power plants. Enphase said it plans to offer this software for utility grid managers and distributed energy resource aggregators in the future, playing a role in the new decentralized grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/29/world-will-need-5-2tw-of-solar-this-decade-to-avoid-climate-breakdown/,"SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 29, 2022",World will need 5.2TW of solar this decade to avoid climate breakdown,"The world will need 5.2TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14TW by mid century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) said today.
The Abu Dhabi-based international body launched the latest edition of its World Energy Transitions Outlook report at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue event and director-general Francesco La Camera, writing the foreword, spelled out: “Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate.”
The world will have to install 450GW of new solar capacity each year – most of it utility scale – for the rest of this decade, with China and India to lead Asia to a roughly half share of the world’s installed PV capacity in 2030, the report’s authors estimated.
What is needed
Elsewhere, North America will need to install 90GW per year of solar to claim a 14% share of the world’s operating panels at the end of the decade, and Europe’s 19% slice of the pie will require 55GW of annual solar capacity additions.
European funding will also help North Africa make its contribution to the 70GW of annual solar capacity additions which will be required across the Middle East and Africa with European energy demand ensuring grid connections with North Africa flourish.
To have a hope of avoiding the worst effects of climate change, Latin America will need 20GW of new solar annually this decade and a further “more than 2GW” will be needed each year across the Oceania and Pacific region, the Irena report estimated.
Of course, it is not just solar that the world needs and, with the 348-page report calling for massive electrification and energy efficiency efforts, enabled by the full suite of clean energy sources, hydrogen, and biomass, we will have to start devoting $5.7 trillion per year to the energy transition for the rest of the decade, according to Irena.
That can be feasible if the $700 billion per year channeled into fossil fuels is immediately diverted to the transition, the publication stated. Public investment in the transition will have to immediately double, too, said Irena, to attract the remaining money needed from the private sector, which would bear most of the financial burden.
Jobs
In return for the investment sought – including to ensure there are 147 million electric vehicles (EVs) per year hitting the roads in 2050, that $131 billion is invested annually in EV charging by that point, and that 350GW of green hydrogen electrolyzers are operating as early as 2030 – the world can anticipate a jobs dividend.
Irena has estimated the 12 million job losses it anticipates in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries will be comfortably outweighed by “close to” 85 million new energy-transition roles this decade, including 26.5 million in clean energy.
It is all a matter of political will, Irena pointed out, with policymakers also needing to usher in sufficient international grid connections and flexibility; training; utility scale batteries; electricity demand-side management; digital tools; peer-to-peer power trading; community ownership of renewables; time-of-use energy tariffs; and net billing systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/29/new-orleans-launches-community-solar-program/,"COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,LOUISIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 29, 2022",New Orleans launches community solar program,"The City of New Orleans has officially launched its citywide community solar program, in partnership with Madison Energy Investments. a firm which develops, constructs, owns and operates distributed generation assets and Solar Alternatives, under which the city will construct a series of solar gardens, which interested residents can purchase a “share” of, and receive a credit on their electricity bills for their share of the power produced.
The program, its rules, and the policies and procedures outlining its deployment throughout the city were all developed by the city council, and the council will also take an active role in project development, holding approval rights over solar garden locations to make sure they align with the city’s underserved neighborhoods. The city is also exploring city-owned sites such as rooftops and vacant land for developing the projects.
Participation is open to all electric customers within the city, even those who participate in other utility-sponsored renewable programs, like net metering. Customers may not subscribe to project shares that would exceed 100% of their annual energy usage, nor can a single customer subscribe to more than a 40% interest in a single project.
On the project side, installations are capped at 2MW in capacity, significantly smaller than the 5MW cap that is common nationwide for community solar programs, but not unheard of. Projects must have a minimum of three, 1kW subscribers. Multiple projects under 100kW with one owner may be located on the same property, but projects over 100kW must be on their own. multiple projects up to the 2MW cap can be located on the same property, so long as each has a different owner.
New projects may be built until each utility’s program capacity equal is equal to five percent of said utility’s annual peak in MW for the first three years of the Community Solar Program.
While utility service area-based community solar programs have sprung up in the south, specifically in Florida and Georgia, and municipal community solar program exist across the northern and northeast US, this is the first municipal community solar program known to pv magazine in the south.
“Our Community Solar program continues to highlight New Orleans’s role in leading the climate fight in our region and our commitment to Green Infrastructure throughout the City,” said Mayor LaToya Cantrell.
While the community solar program is all but certain to boost the city’s adoption of renewable resources, the claim that New Orleans and/or Louisiana are “leading the climate fight” is a bit tricker.
In 2019, the City Council has approved Entergy’s plan to add 90 MW of solar power to the city via three projects, a move that effectively looked to double the state’s entire installed solar capacity to that point. Since that point, the state of Louisiana has upped its total installed solar capacity to just over 200 MW, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, with the majority of capacity that has come online since 2019 coming from utility-scale installations in 2020.
Over the next five years, Louisiana is expected by the SEIA and Wood Mackenzie to add 1,170MW of new solar capacity which, while only good for 27th in the nation over that time, is exponential growth relative to the state’s history.
“We couldn’t be more excited to be a part of this monumental program for New Orleans,” said Richard Walsh, managing partner of Madison Energy Investments. “Madison has projects like this across the country and as a southerner who grew up frequenting New Orleans, this project makes me particularly proud.”

This is a significant accomplishment considering the challenges faced last year including volatile supply chains, rising system prices, labor shortages, policy uncertainty, and more.
Wood Mackenzie reports that Freedom Forever, a California-based solar installer, secured nearly 4% of the US residential solar market share last year, overtaking Tesla in the top three spot for the first time.
For the fifth consecutive year, Sunrun holds onto its number one top residential installer position, with 13% of the total market. However, Sunrun’s market share declined–down nearly a point since the previous year. Sunrun’s direct and indirect installation volumes continued to grow, but COVID was to blame for flat Q4 volumes due to labor shortages.
“While Sunrun still maintains a comfortable lead, the rising pressure on the company’s growth rate is a testament to the unyielding momentum of other top players,” said Wood Mackenzie research associate Caitlin Connelly. “An example is Freedom Forever, who made the most notable shift in rankings as it secured 3.9% of the total US residential solar market and squeezed Tesla out of a top three spot for the first time. ”
Freedom Forever’s installation volumes grew a massive 80% in 2021, and the company entered 12 new state markets. Simultaneously, Tesla has become increasingly dependent on subcontractors for solar installations as the company shifts its business model more towards that of a full-suite technology supplier. Given these two factors, we expect to see Tesla continue to decline in the installer rankings over the next several quarters.
If Freedom Forever maintains its momentum, it could edge Titan Solar Power out of its number two position (4.8% market share) going into 2022. Titan grew installation volumes and market share in 2021, but its growth was smaller compared to previous years. Both Freedom Forever and Titan are  large regional installers with expansive networks, and they have similar business models that rely solely on third-party sales. Their operations overlap in 15 state markets. Sunrun also has a similar model of outsourcing sales to third-party companies, which is a popular tactic for top installers looking to create efficiencies as they expand their geographic footprints.
Interestingly, early in 2021 Freedom Forever selected Sunrun as its primary solar-plus-storage as-a-service provider for the next three years. The company planned to leverage Sunrun’s home solar and battery service offering, as well as its favorably branding among consumers.
Together, Sunrun, Titan Solar Power, and Freedom Forever command over 20% of the US solar residential market, and the competition among the rest is intensifying. In October 2021 SunPower acquired residential solar provider Blue Raven Solar, a move intended to help SunPower expand in the Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. With this acquisition, SunPower now holds 2.7% of the market. Momentum has 2.2% in the number 6 spot, and Trinity Solar is number 7 with a 2% share.

“The acquisition of Blue Raven strengthens SunPower’s direct installation business, expanding their geographic footprint for direct installs from eight to 19 states. SunPower has noted that direct installs are central to expanding service options and revenue streams,” Connelly said.
Residential finance
The top five in the residential finance market accounted for 70% of the financing of the residential market in 2021, up from 60% the previous year. This market is consolidating, which drives up competition and drives down interest rates and dealer fees.
Top financier position again goes to GoodLeap with 26% of the total market. Sunrun leads the third-party owned (TPO) market, capturing 15%. While TPO capacity volumes grew in 2021, loan volumes continue to dominate new growth and now represent over 60% of the market. Wood Mackenzie analysts expect this trend to become the norm over the next couple of years before the investment tax credit expires for customer-owned systems in 2023.
 Commercial solar
The US commercial solar market continues to consolidate for both development and asset ownership. Borrego leads the pack with 10% of total market share for the second year in a row.
The top 75 national installers accounted for over 60% of the market for the first time since 2013, when Leaderboard data begins. The top asset owners now command almost 40% of the annual market, up from 32% last year. While commercial solar remains a difficult business to scale, many top developers and asset owners have grown their businesses faster through this route, according to WoodMac.
