The move comes as a positive surprise for Democrats, who expected to have to negotiate the climate and energy provisions in a separate bill, but now will have such measures passed alongside deficit and healthcare spending in a larger reconciliation package.
In total, the bill would make investments of more than $600 billion over 10 years, fully paid for by closing tax loopholes on corporations and the wealthiest individuals, said Schumer and Manchin in a joint statement.
Manchin has been impeding Democrat climate and energy goals since last December when he blocked the Build Back Better Act by withholding his must-have vote for the 50-50 split needed to pass a reconciliation package. Now, Manchin has found an agreement with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after negotiating behind the scenes for the last several weeks.
“Rather than risking more inflation with trillions in new spending, this bill will cut the inflation taxes Americans are paying, lower the cost of health insurance and prescription drugs, and ensure our country invests in the energy security and climate change solutions we need,” wrote Manchin.
A significant portion of the spending will be focused on supporting a US manufacturing supply chain and contains similar provisions to the ones laid out in an earlier draft of Build Back Better.
“The increased risk of geopolitical uncertainty demands that we turn our focus to increasing U.S. energy production and bringing good paying energy and manufacturing jobs back to America,” wrote Manchin.
The agreement also comes with a plan to streamline the development and permitting process for critical infrastructure like transmission and export facilities.
“President Biden, Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi have committed to advancing a suite of commonsense permitting reforms this fall that will ensure all energy infrastructure, from transmission to pipelines and export facilities, can be efficiently and responsibly built to deliver energy safely around the country and to our allies,” he wrote.
“I support the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 because it provides a responsible path forward that is laser focused on solving our nation’s major economic, energy and climate problems,” he said.
The agreement comes as a potentially massive boon for the energy transition at large, and for the US solar manufacturing and development industries. It also calls for reducing carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. The full text of the bill is not yet available.

Arizona-based solar module provider Universal Solar announced it will build a 600 MW PV panel manufacturing facility at the Colón Logistics Park located in the Colón Container Terminal CCT in Colón, Panama.
“Universal Solar is taking orders now, with delivery expected in the fourth quarter 2022,” the company said in a statement released. “The company has signed Master Service Agreements for more than 400 MW of modules, and is negotiating an additional 175 MW, which would account for nearly all of the factory’s 600 MW first-line capacity.”
The factory has a surface of around 18,500 m2 and will rely on production equipment that Universal Solar is currently purchasing from undisclosed industry-leading original equipment manufacturers.
The company will initially produce monocrystalline PERC panels with a power output ranging from 350 to 545 W and a power conversion efficiency between 20.04% and 21.46%. “Universal Solar will offer 25- to 30-year linear power output warranties and 12- to 15-year material and workmanship warranties,” the manufacturer further explained. “Universal Solar’s modules will be 100 percent compliant with the US Commerce Department’s Withhold and Release Order on Hoshine silicon.”
The factory will mainly serve the US market. “The US has a long-standing Free Trade Agreement with Panama, and Panama is an example of “near-shoring” in which US businesses locate operations in countries close to home,” the company stated.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/27/white-house-announces-solar-initiatives-to-reduce-electricity-bills-create-clean-energy-jobs/,"COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 27, 2022","White House announces solar initiatives to reduce electricity bills, create clean energy jobs","The Department of Energy (DOE) announced new initiatives to lower electricity bills for low-income residents and create good-paying jobs in the domestic solar industry. In collaboration with the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS),  a pilot of the Community Solar Subscription Platform will be launched in Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C.  The goal is to lower electricity bills through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and other low-income assistance programs.
DOE also announced $10 million from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to jump-start solar energy careers in underserved communities, which also supports the President’s goal of reaching a carbon-free electricity sector by 2035.
“Every American community, especially those that face disproportionately higher energy burdens, deserves the economic and health benefits that come with increased access to affordable clean energy,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “This is why DOE is working across the federal government to open up community solar that will rapidly lower electricity bills for households that need it most and create good paying jobs in every pocket of America.”
Community solar enables multiple customers to benefit from a shared solar energy system, and can reduce electricity costs. The DOE’s community solar target is to power 5 million homes and provide 20% savings on a subscriber’s energy bills, up from 10% on average today.
“The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has recommended that both the US Department of Energy (DOE) and state governments relax LMI eligibility requirements and streamline the community solar subscription process for LMI customers,” said Sean Gallaher,  vice president of state and regulatory affairs at SEIA. “DOE’s new pilot program will connect families to community solar through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and other low-income assistance programs, which will undoubtedly help more LMI communities get the benefits of clean and reliable solar energy.”
The Community Solar Subscription Platform is designed to connect community solar projects with verified cost savings to households participating in government-run assistance programs like LIHEAP. DOE has prioritized working with states that have existing programs that support low-income community solar development so that, if successful, participants will see significant electricity bill savings of approximately 20% in Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and New Mexico and 50% in Washington, D.C. and Colorado.
“This innovative and exciting project helps lower electricity bills, save people money through expanded and streamlined access to affordable community solar subscriptions. This initiative will save Coloradans millions on electricity bills every year, reducing energy burdens across the state,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis said. “That’s money better spent on groceries, on rent, or on taking the family out for fun. We are so thrilled to support this effort to save people money and accelerate Colorado’s pathway to 100% renewable energy.”
DOE’s National Community Solar Partnership, HHS, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, National Energy Assistance Directors Association, and the National Association of State Energy Officials are collaborating on the Community Solar Subscription Platform. DOE also issued a Request for Information to obtain feedback on the structure of the platform from community-based organizations, community solar subscription managers and developers, state and local governments, researchers, LIHEAP implementation organizations, and others. Responses are due by August 31 at 5 p.m. ET.
Solar jobs in underserved communities 

Through the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Biden-Harris administration has invested $10 million to ensure that the future solar workforce is equitable, inclusive, and benefits people in underserved communities. According to estimates in DOE’s Solar Futures Study, the industry will need to create hundreds of thousands of good-quality jobs to achieve decarbonization goals. The DOE’s Advancing Equity through Workforce Partnerships program plans to fund projects that support new workforce programs that recruit, train, and retain an inclusive workforce.
DOE is also launching the Sunny Awards for Equitable Community Solar, a new awards program that will recognize best practices in community solar that increase equitable access and ensure benefits go to subscribers and their communities. Up to five finalists can win a Sunny Award and prizes of $10,000 per team.
“Deploying community solar is a vital move to protect both our climate and the millions of households most vulnerable to utility shutoffs and dirty energy price spikes,” said Jean Su, Energy Justice program director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “As deadly heatwaves shatter records, this move signals that Biden is taking the climate emergency seriously, but he must go further, and fast. By declaring a climate emergency, Biden can unleash his full suite of executive powers, draw down deadly fossil fuels, and show the world he’s ready to fight the climate catastrophe head-on.”
The Center for Biological Diversity tracks the utility shutoffs crisis resulting from economic and climate pressures. The Center’s recent report with Bailout Watch reveals that over 3.5 million households in only 33 states were shut off from power from 2020-2021 due to the inability to pay and urges community and rooftop solar as solutions to the shutoffs crisis.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/27/energysage-adds-solar-financing-for-businesses/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 27, 2022",EnergySage adds solar financing for businesses,"EnergySage, an informational site and marketplace for residential and commercial solar customers, announced it reached a partnership agreement with Sunstone Credit, a technology-enabled solar loan finance provider for businesses. The partnership will enable businesses and nonprofits to understand options for financing a solar project, and to apply for a loan through the two partners’ platform.
As utility rates and inflation persist and investors, lenders, and customers increasingly desire sustainable solutions, businesses nationwide are exploring solar as a way to cut costs and reduce carbon emissions. EnergySage has been providing transparent solar marketplace information for over a decade, with a mission to help people make smarter energy decisions.
Currently, Sunstone offers flexible tenors of 5 to 20 years, with scalable loan sizes ranging from $50,000 to $5 million. The loan provider’s platform is fully digital and it requires no personal guarantees for the borrower.
“Historically, getting a loan for a solar energy system has been a major barrier for most businesses and nonprofits. Small and medium-sized businesses have been overlooked and underserved for too long by our industry despite their enormous impact on the economy, their potential to help combat climate-change, and the many benefits of switching to solar as a business. By teaming up with Sunstone, EnergySage is able to quote any business interested in going solar through our Marketplace, a financing solution that’ll cover 100% of the cost. It’s a real game-changer for a relatively untapped segment of the market.” Charlie Hadlow, VP of Marketplace Growth at EnergySage 
EnergySage said the market for commercial solar in the United States is estimated at over $1 trillion, but so far has only reached 2% penetration. Access to ownership is a main reason for this low penetration thus far,” said EnergySage, and solar loans represent a way for businesses to access solar while taking advantage of tax credits.
Loans offer a good option for businesses that are unable to pay cash for a system or that prefer not to navigate the complexities of government sponsored lending programs and third party owned arrangements. The partnership will connect borrowers with EnergySage’s industry partners, hundreds of verified installers and developers across the United States.
“Having a partner as well-regarded and mission-aligned in this pursuit as EnergySage will accelerate our ability to bring low cost, efficient financing to business borrowers and grow the commercial solar market for years to come,” said Duncan Hinkle, co-founder and head of business development at Sunstone.

The Q2 2021 profit increase was due in part to the $1.8 billion settlement with SK Innovation in a trade secret dispute over EV batteries. Looking forward, LG sees a bright future, driven by scaling up manufacturing of EV batteries. The company intends to triple revenue in five years and achieve a double-digit operating profit margin, setting an annual revenue target to $16.74 billion.
“This quarter’s profitability has shown moderate drop, mainly due the impacts from lock-down measures in China, global supply chain disruptions, and the time gap between the actual increase in material costs and applying them to selling prices,” said Chang Sil Lee, CFO of LG Energy Solution at the conference call. “Nevertheless, steady growth in revenue was possible thanks to the strong sales of cylindrical cells for EV, as well as successfully passing through major metal price hikes to the battery prices.”
LG also aims to achieve double-digit operating profit margin through strategic partnerships and focusing on the growing North American market. Earlier this year LG Energy Solution announced a commitment to construct a $2.1 billion battery manufacturing plant in Lansing, Michigan with General Motors to mass produce 50 GWh of EV batteries under the Ultium Cell brand. Ultium devices are unique due to their large-format, pouch-style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside a battery pack, enabling engineers to optimize energy storage and layout for each vehicle design.
“With a shared vision, GM and LG Energy Solution pioneered the EV sector by seizing new opportunities in the market well before anyone else did,” LG Energy Solution chief executive Young-Soo Kwon said. “Our third battery manufacturing plant, fittingly located in America’s automotive heartland, will serve as a gateway to charge thousands, and later, millions of EVs in the future.”
The US Energy Department intends to loan Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution, $2.5 billion to help finance construction of new lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan.
LG plans to expands its joint venture partnerships with major partners in developing both cylindrical and pouch-type batteries, supplying existing customers as well as EV startups. The company plans to add a new production footprint for cylindrical batteries in Europe to cope with increasing demand, and also secure a new production site in Asia, in addition to the existing production facilities in Korea and China.
“The current production capacity is more heavily invested in Asia (59%) and Europe (34%), compared to North America (7%),” explained LG Energy Solution. “We aim to increase the production capacity in North America to 45% by 2025, thereby enabling a balanced global operation portfolio of 45% in North America, 35% in Asia, and 20% in Europe.”
LG said it intends to focus on quality in its design and manufacturing processes, establishing a full in-line inspection system and upgrading the safety diagnostic algorithm in its Battery Management System. It is also dedicated to establishing smart factories, which it expects will increase yield, stabilize product quality, improve manufacturing processes, boost productivity, and enhance workforce efficiency. The company is also working to establish a stable supply chain by investing in upstream suppliers and expanding long term supply contracts. It is also focused on establishing a battery recycling program through partnerships with material recycling companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/27/enphase-delivers-robust-q2-revenues-backed-by-its-iq8-solar-microinverter/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WESTERN EUROPE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 27, 2022",Enphase delivers robust Q2 revenues backed by its IQ8 solar microinverter,"Enphase Energy, a leading provider of solar microinverters and battery energy storage, announced record revenues in Q2 2022, beating expectations and quickly sending the company’s stock up 10% in after-hours trading.
The consensus for Enphase was $508 million in revenues and 85 cents per share. The Fremont, California-based company beat these numbers handily, posting 102% earnings per share growth at $1.07, and revenue growth of 67% with $530 million in revenues posted.
The growth was heavily influenced by rapid expansion in the European market, with second quarter growth of 69%. It was also supported by strong performance in the US market and the success of its IQ8 microinverter, which ROTH Capital Partners said has a 15% premium over the previous IQ7 model.
As of the end of 2021, Enphase has shipped 43.4 TWh of microinverters, representing over 42 million microinverter units, deployed across nearly 2 million solar projects. That number continues to grow, supported by strong interest in the IQ8 inverter, which can form a microgrid with a home solar array and no energy storage.
The IQ8 is a novel technology for its ability to keep the power running during a grid blackout without the need for energy storage or a generator. The device can react to real-time usage in the home and adjust accordingly. The system will feed as much electricity as it has access to based upon sunlight available and solar power capacity, and it will adjust on the fly. When too much energy from the house is being pulled – more than sunlight and installed capacity could provide – the whole system shuts down, only to instantly restart when the excess load is removed. This feature may be increasingly popular as power outages continue to rise, particularly across the western United States.
Looking ahead, the company issued very upbeat guidance for Q3 revenues, expecting between $590 million to $630 million. Enphase’s microinverter sales are expected to continue to bring the lion’s share of revenues in the near term.
Its energy storage segment lags some expectations as it said it estimates it will ship 130 to 145 MWh of battery energy storage in Q3 2022, slightly lower than ROTH’s previous estimate of 156 MWh. The company also operates in the EV charging segment and shipped 8,250 ClipperCreek/Enphase chargers to US customers. It said it expects healthy growth in this segment.
ROTH reissued its buy rating on the stock following the quarterly call and raised its 12-month price target from $270 to $310.
ROTH said factors that may slow Enphase on the progress towards its price target include lower than expected PV demand, unexpected decrease in inverter pricing or gross margins, a lack of available project financing for residential and commercial PV projects, or the accelerated adoption of competitive technologies like DC power optimizers.
The firm said Enphase trades at an elevated valuation due to its unique position as the globally dominant microinverter provider, with close to 100% market share of microinverters.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/27/doe-aims-for-wide-adoption-of-the-latest-energy-efficiency-codes-for-new-buildings/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 27, 2022",DOE aims for wide adoption of the latest energy efficiency codes for new buildings,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) will provide $225 million in grants to cross-sectoral partnerships pursuing innovative approaches to advance state and local adoption of the most recent building energy codes for residential and commercial buildings, DOE has announced.
Building energy codes set requirements for air sealing, insulation and other measures that keep buildings warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. Model code requirements, which states can choose to adopt, have become more stringent over time, such that buildings meeting the 2021 code requirements use about 50% less energy than buildings that met the 1975 requirements, as shown in the nearby graph.

The extra efficiency measures specified in more recent codes typically cost builders more during the construction phase, while lowering utility bills and improving comfort over the long run for occupants and owners.
DOE projects that state and local implementation of the latest building energy codes could achieve savings of up to $138 billion over 30 years. That’s based on energy savings of 9.4% for new residential buildings and 4.7% for new commercial buildings built to the latest code, compared to energy usage if built to a previous edition of the model energy code.
Because few states have adopted the latest building efficiency codes, most states could achieve efficiency gains for new buildings by adopting the latest standards, ranging up to 20% or even more, as shown in the nearby map prepared by DOE.
 
NREL study
In a 100% renewables grid, energy efficiency is valuable, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory study has found, as the cost-optimal strategy would involve energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings of about 60%, along with oversized renewable generation and long-term storage.
The DOE program is funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

In fact, the division chief at the California Air Resources Board was quoted as saying, ‘We [California] expect that ozone-contributing pollutants from small off-road engines [SOREs] will exceed those same emissions from cars around the 2020 time frame’.
Recently, California passed a law banning the sale of new gas-powered leaf blowers and lawn mowers (and most new SOREs) by 2024. And while corded electric lawn mowers and other plug-in landscaping equipment has been available for decades, it’s only in the past couple of years that battery technology became affordable and commercially available.
A story by the Press Herald highlighted a zero-emissions lawn care business run by two high school brothers – ‘Solar Mow’ – doing (nearly) emissions free work. The family that owns the units also owns a solar contracting company with 350 employees serving New England – ReVision Energy.
Here’s a video reporting on the teenagers who run the company.
The unit used by Solar Mow is the Rival, manufactured by Mean Green Mowers of Ohio. The Press Herald article notes that the teens paid back a $24,000 loan for the mower to their farther, which operates for 6-7 hours on a single charge.
Buyers of the Rival can choose from a 52” or 60” cutting deck, as well as a 14.5 kWh or 22 kWh battery. The Rival accelerates from 0 to its top speed of 11.5 mph in a blistering 1.3 seconds. Default options include a comfort suspension seat and a cup holder.
On the accessories page of the unit they list a 200 watt solar panel that doubles as a shade canopy. There are no specification details on the module, but they claim that it can add up to 20 minutes of operating time per day.
 
Sunforge
The charge controller between the solar panel and the mower battery is a Genasun GVB-8-WP, manufactured by Sunforge.
From California’s perspective, SOREs consist of off-road spark-ignition engines that produce less than 19 kilowatts (25 horsepower) of gross power. This class includes lawn and garden, industrial, logging, airport ground support, and commercial utility equipment, golf carts, and specialty vehicles.

By 2028, California seeks to implement its second phase of the SORE emission reduction plan, by applying standards for generators and large pressure washers.
Remaining SOREs on store shelves at the end of 2023 and going into 2024 may still be sold, and owners of older equipment are permitted to continue operating, and polluting, with their small engines.
