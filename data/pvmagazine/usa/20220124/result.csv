https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/24/microgrid-and-net-zero-as-a-service-providers-form-partnership/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 24, 2022",Microgrid and net zero as-a-service providers form partnership,"A partnership was announced between InfraPrime, a provider of net zero as-a-service for datacenters, and Instant ON, a microgrid designer, builder, and aggregator, announced a partnership in which the two will co-develop a net-zero microgrid service for datacenters named PowerShell. 
Following a lifecycle sustainability assessment, InfraPrime designs an on-premises microgrid, often featuring solar and energy storage. Designed for reliable electric supply and resiliency, InfraPrime said the PowerShell allows for no more than five minutes of downtime per year, meeting 99.999% uptime expectations.  
“The path to carbon negative … will take ambition and action. By teaming up with industry innovators and experts, we can take the steps in the right direction.” said AJ Perkins, President of Instant ON. 
Microgrids promote remote preparedness, said Instant ON, meaning that they can be operated independently of the larger utility grid. For California data operators, this is particularly important for datacenters in a landscape of increased wildfires, planned public safety grid shutoffs, and the increased risk of further extreme weather due to climate change. 
The microgrid works with the utility, interconnecting with the larger grid to support resiliency initiatives and lower solar curtailment levels. 
InfraPrime’s net zero as-a-service is flexible across scales, from large campuses with 200-400 MW loads, to a 180 kW custom data rack. The service is billed based on the customer’s IT energy usage on a monthly lease payment, preventing the cost from being capital expenditure.

The funding comes from a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy and $1 million in angel investment, which the startup will use to further develop its copper-based paste technology, called CuBert. The company plans to use the new funding to further de-risk the technology for the manufacturers. The DOE grant, received in late 2021, is part of a federal program meant to help integrate clean energy sources into the US electrical grid.
“Silver is a huge issue for the industry because the price volatility and there may not be enough to produce the amount of solar panels needed,” said Thad Druffel, theme leader for solar manufacturing R&D at UofL’s Conn Center for Renewable Energy Research. “We can solve it by changing one simple ingredient.”
The paste, which was invented and patented at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, can replace silver components currently used in solar panels, making them less expensive to manufacture. The paste is can replace the silver paste directly into the existing manufacturing process and equipment in use today by solar panel makers, according to the company. Druffel invented the technology with former post-doctoral research associate, Ruvini Dharmadasa, and now is CEO of Bert Thin Films.  He believes that by replacing silver components with CuBert paste, manufacturers can reduce their production costs significantly, which would reduce the cost to consumers.
With reduced costs, Druffel said, solar panels could become a more accessible and economical choice for consumers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/24/solar-decathlon-celebrates-20-years-of-training-tomorrows-clean-energy-workforce/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 24, 2022",Solar Decathlon celebrates 20 years of training tomorrow’s clean energy workforce,"This year marks the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon, an international collegiate competition that has challenged more than 25,000 students to create efficient, affordable buildings powered by renewable energy, while promoting student innovation, cross-disciplinary education, and real-world training for a variety of careers.
The first Solar Decathlon competition was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 2002. Fourteen teams designed, built, transported, and showcased zero energy houses powered entirely by renewable energy—a feat relatively unheard of at the time. During the 21-day inaugural event, more than 100,000 people visited the first-ever Solar Decathlon.
Since those first 14 houses, the Solar Decathlon has supported 790 teams, grown to include both residential and commercial buildings through Design and Build Challenges. After the initial US events, the Solar Decathlon expanded to  Europe, China, Latin America, Africa, India, and the Middle East.
“As a collegiate competition, the Solar Decathlon is now as old as many of its participants!” said Kelly Speakes-Backman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). “This is a testament to the Department of Energy’s longstanding commitment to American innovation and achieving a clean energy future.”
The Solar Decathlon’s university teams are disciplinary by necessity. For example, the Solar Decathlon’s Build Competition includes ten different competitions: architecture, engineering, market analysis, durability and resilience, embodied environmental impact, integrated performance, occupant experience, comfort and environmental quality, energy performance, and presentation. Teams that make the final cut must also fundraise and find sponsors to cover the costs of construction, travel, paying the leadership and more.
Many aspects of the competition fit in with a variety of college curricula, but they go beyond the classroom to provide training for the real world. Many Solar Decathlon alumni have gone on to careers that are related to some aspect of the competition, many working to address climate change. Follow the Solar Decathlon social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn) throughout 2022 to learn where Solar Decathlon alumni are now and how they are making a difference.
The “eleventh” competition is the People’s Choice Award, where the general public can vote for their favorite home in that year’s competition. In honor of the 20th anniversary, the 20th Anniversary People’s Choice Award will let the public cast their vote for any of the People’s Choice winners from the past 20 years. Voting for the 20th Anniversary People’s Choice Award is open. The most successful buildings from each competition are highlighted on Solar Decathlon social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn) through the voting deadline on April 23, 2022.
“We are honored to celebrate the 20th anniversary with the students, faculty, visitors, volunteers, sponsors, and partners who have built the Solar Decathlon,” said Holly Jamesen Carr, Director of Solar Decathlon in the Building Technologies Office. “In the 20 years since the first competition, the Solar Decathlon has inspired tens of thousands of students to push boundaries in their education and their careers. Today, Solar Decathlon alumni are contributing to the evolution of zero energy buildings from curiosities we marveled at on the National Mall to imperatives for the future of construction around the world.”

The projects are both being developed in Humboldt County, Nevada, right on the state’s northern border with Oregon.
The Iron Point Solar Project will be a 250MW solar system paired with 200MW of battery storage and is expected to be commissioned in December 2023. The Hot Pot Solar Project is 350MW solar system paired with 280MW of battery storage and is expected to be in-service by December 2024. Collectively, these projects will have the capacity to power 127,000 homes in Nevada.
While the chemistries and duration of the storage assets have not yet been shared, lithium-ion batteries with a four-hour duration have historically been the standard at this scale, meaning these projects should have a combined power in the ballpark of 1.92GWh.
Construction for the projects is expected to create approximately 800 job opportunities for the local Nevadan communities during peak periods and is scheduled to begin in the second half of this year. The bulk of these jobs will be performed by the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers.
Primergy and NV Energy entered into Build Transfer Agreements for the sale and purchase of the projects, which NV Energy filed for approval with the PUC on July 1, 2021.
Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners launched Primergy in May of 2020, in part to manage the development of the massive 690MW Gemini solar project with its 380MW/1,400 MWh lithium-ion battery, currently being constructed on on Bureau of Land Management land outside of Las Vegas.
Unlike the Build Transfer Agreement of the Hot Pot and Iron Point projects, Primergy has a 25-year PPA signed with NV Energy for the electricity generated by Gemini.

“The new AXE LV battery system covers a wide range of capacities extending from 5kWh to 400kWh, which caters to differentiated needs from daily households to large business and industrial scenarios,” said Lisa Zhang, marketing director for Growatt. “It supports power output of storage and off-grid systems, ranging from 3kW to 30kW.”
Each 5kWh module measures 650 mm x 350 mm x 165 mm and weighs in at 40 kg. The nominal voltage is 51.2V and the operating voltage range is between 48V and 57.6V. The battery also features IP20-rated protection and internal plus connection.
“The modularity of AXE LV battery system makes it easy to be installed with internal plugs, requiring no extra cable connections, while with all the external cables integrated onto one plug, its connection to the inverter is much more simplified,” the manufacturer said. “As a cobalt-free LFP battery, it stands out for its high-temperature resistance, strong safety and stability as well as better performance of up to 5,000 charge cycles.”
The company said the device has a lifespan of more than 10 years, and that it offers more advantages in terms of total cost of ownership than lead-acid batteries. It also comes with a five-year warranty.
“With regard to compatibility, AXE LV battery system can be used with all Growatt’s SPF off-grid series inverters. Moreover, it also works perfectly along with the SPH and SPA series storage inverters,” the company said.
Zhang noted that the company is now selling the batteries in the Americas and Asia, with additional plans to soon launch sales in other parts of the world, including the Middle East and Africa.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/24/zinc-air-battery-chp-and-solar-to-power-apartment-complex-in-new-york/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,NEW YORK",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 24, 2022","Zinc-air battery, CHP and solar to power apartment complex in New York","Canadian battery developer Zinc8 Energy Solutions is set to deploy its proprietary zinc-air battery technology at a New York apartment complex with a goal to demonstrate its long-duration energy storage capability. The project is developed in partnership with Digital Energy Corp, a New York-based private sector developer of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, solar systems and microgrids.
The 100kW/1.5MWh zinc-air energy storage system (ZESS) will be installed at Fresh Meadows Community Apartments in Queens, New York, to support and enhance the economics of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system currently under construction, along with an existing photovoltaic system.
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has developed a proprietary flow battery technology that it claims is able to deliver power in the range from 20kW to 50MW with a minimum storage of eight hours of capacity.
The modular battery can be configured to support a wide array of long-duration applications for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects. Unlike lithium-ion technology, which requires new stacks to scale, Zinc8 says it has completely decoupled the linkage between energy and power. This means that scaling Zinc8’s technology can be accomplished by simply increasing the size of the fuel tank and quantity of recharged zinc fuel.
The technology promises zero capacity fade over an extensive lifetime. According to the manufacturer, tt is non-flammable, non-toxic and sustainable with stable supply chains for mass production. It is also touted as a potentially hugely cost-effective solution, aiming for an installation cost of $45/kWh.
Zinc8’s system uses power from the grid or renewable energy sources to generate zinc particles in a zinc regenerator, thereby releasing oxygen as a by-product. The zinc particles flow then to the storage tank and are maintained there in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. When power is needed, the zinc particles are delivered to the power stack and recombined with oxygen to generate electricity. The zinc oxide by-product is returned to the storage tank for later regeneration.
Zinc8 claims to have solved the dendrite issue, which leads to the clogging of the membranes used in flow batteries. The battery has a roundtrip efficiency ranging from 65% to 70%.
For its latest project at Fresh Meadows Apartments, Zinc8 tech has won financing from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). In this project, Zinc8 will be focused on advancing, developing and field testing its storage technology as it seeks to address cost, performance, and integration challenges in New York State. “This is an opportunity for Zinc8 to further develop a pipeline of projects and establish a foothold in the New York City market.” said Ron MacDonald, president and CEO of Zinc8 Energy Solutions.
Previously, Zinc8 signed an agreement with the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to deploy a 100 kW/1 MWh demonstration ZESS behind-the-meter at the University at Buffalo campus. The project was designed to provide peak shaving capability and improve campus resiliency, as well as explore alternative uses such as emergency backup for campus building. In addition, the Buffalo project aims to validate the system’s performance reliability and help to determine O&M and life-cycle costs.
