Behind-the-meter capacity will grow 3.7 times more over this period than it did in the previous five years, according to the report. But perhaps the most significant market change is that the electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is responsible for much of that growth.

The distributed energy resources (DER) covered in the report include EV chargers; distributed storage, solar and fuel-based generation; and residential and non-residential demand flexibility.
For this report, Wood Mackenzie defines DERs as:
Wood Mackenzie analysis shows that 262 GW of new DER and demand flexibility capacity will be installed from 2023 to 2027, nearly matching the 272 GW of utility-scale resource installations also expected during that period.
For the first time, EV charger annual installed capacity will overtake distributed solar and will reach 3.5x solar annual additions by 2027. This market is expected to reach $20 billion by 2027, led by the residential Level 2 ($6.5 billion) and public DC fast chargers ($5.6 billion) segments. Residential charging capacity still holds the majority but will decrease due to infrastructure for buses and trucks reaching 18% of total charging capacity by 2027.
Policies that are driving the growth are federal incentives, not the least of which are the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits along with the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Grant program, expected to drive public charger growth along highway corridors. Also driving the growth is grid insecurity of homeowners and businesses owners, which the report says will cause the distributed fuel-based generation market to grow 240% from 2022 to 2027 and the distributed storage market to grow 460%, with storage reaching nearly $10 billion per year.
“Federal incentives, headlined by the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits and National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure grant program, represent the greatest catalysts for growth in the US DER market. Continued failure of system operators to reduce the time and cost of interconnection would be a tailwind, forcing utilities and corporates to look to distributed resources to achieve reliability and clean energy goals,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, lead author of the report and global head of Grid Edge at Wood Mackenzie.
Another driver is the California NEM 3.0, which initially will cause an estimate 38% contraction of the market in 2024, but then will significantly increase storage attachment rates going forward.
Despite a price decline of 13% over the next five years, distributed solar will still represent 46% of DER capital expenditure through 2027.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/20/the-top-causes-of-solar-performance-issues/,"MARKETS & POLICY,QUALITY,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 20, 2023",The top causes of solar performance issues,"Each year solar technical advisory and inspection servicer Heliovolta releases a report on solar performance and safety called the SolarGrade PV Health Report.
The report assesses PV health using over 60,000 data points, ranging from projects from 100 kW to 350 MW in size. About 73% of the assessed projects in this year’s report are located on commercial rooftops, 25% are ground-mounted, and 2% are solar carports. All projects are located in the United States.
Heliovolta found some important problem areas for the performance and safety of these solar assets. A staggering 62% of inspected projects were identified to have critical or major issues. Of this share of projects with critical risks, 91% of the major issues were found to be in DC distribution components.
“Issues can be fixed before they become hazardous. Periodic inspections and proactive O&M — especially in the DC distribution section of PV systems — are critical to safe and reliable operations,” said the report.
Heliovolta noted that inverters often appear to be the cause of PV system problems due to the fact they are typically the primary device of energy yield data and error messages. However, on-the-ground data reveals that inverters are rarely the root cause of downtime. In most cases, inverters trip because they detect underlying issues located within the DC Distribution section, said the report.
The report shared that 74% of issues were in the DC distribution section, 9% in racking, 7% in modules, and 7% in inverters.
Within this critical DC distribution system failure are a few specific components driving most of the problems. Over 33% of failures in this system were due to field-made PV connectors. Wire management issues were the second cause of failures and safety issues, about 26% of reported problems. Other problems with conduits, raceways, improper installation, combiner boxes, grounding, and wire terminations were listed as significant risks.
(Read: “Solar assets are underperforming expectations by 8%, what is the root cause?”)
“The most frequently observed issues are related to field-made connectors and wire management. Installer error is typically the root cause for these categories of issue — not defective equipment,” said Heliovolta.
The company said that 79% of all field-made connector issues are caused by improper installation or cross-mating of incompatible parts. Identifying and remediating compromised field-made connectors is critical to safety as they can trigger PV system fires by overheating and by creating arc and ground fault conditions. Heliovolta offers a safety guide to solar connectors.
Interestingly, the report found that 37% of all inverter issues were sourced from one inverter provider. This brand was kept anonymous by Heliovolta in the report.
As for solar module performance, about 30% of problems were related to microcracking. These small cracks restrict the flow of current, reducing energy yield and potentially creating hotspots over time. The report recommends using electroluminescent (EL) imagining tests to detect microcracking.
Heliovolta operates a cloud-based software platform called SolarGrade to help manage the performance and safety inspection process. The company’s report recommended five best practices to ensure a more reliable, productive, and safe solar facility:
1) Require robust installer training
DC distribution issues related to connectors and wire management are the most common problems at project sites. With better training protocols, the vast majority of these issues could be avoided.
2) Conduct QA/WC inspections at commissioning
Assessing EPC workmanship through QA/QC inspections early in a project’s lifecycle helps ensure that latent issues are corrected before catastrophic failures occur.
3) Require inspections during operations and maintenance visits twice a year
Periodically walking project sites to assess PV system health ensures that signs of latent component failure and accelerated degradation are identified early.
4) Standardize inspection processes
Make sure inspectors know what to look for in PV system health assessments by providing standardized, accessible, and easy-to-use guidelines. The SolarGrade platform comes with pre-written templates and issue descriptions.
5) Track issue resolution
Do not allow issues to get lost in the shuffle of PDF reports, spreadsheets, and clunky manual checklists. The SolarGrade platform allows field technicians to quickly find problems on the ground, and asset managers can dynamically track issue resolution in the cloud.

1) U.S. Solar Manufacturing Update: Expectations versus Reality
Clean Energy Associates
The IRA represents a sea change in U.S. energy policy, providing dedicated production-level incentives to offset the higher cost of making solar in the United States. But despite a host of announcements promising new manufacturing investments, it remains a long way from press releases to power plants and progress to date is highly uneven along the value chain.
This presentation explored the disparity between module assembly and other stages of production. Currently, ingot, wafer, and cell production plans have not kept pace, and no plans for greenfield polysilicon plants have materialized.
While IRA incentives are generous, the United States may need further policy development to achieve a full domestic PV supply chain. This presentation will explore potential evolutionary actions including select expansion of the Section 45x incentives and use of the Defense Production Act. And it will look at how the IRA could to serve as the start of a more comprehensive industrial policy similar to that in other global economies.
2) Solar Farming: Opportunities and Challenges of Integrating Solar & Regenerative Agriculture
Stephen Brown, PE, PMP, MEng – Duke Energy
The report explores challenges to agrivoltaics: community pushback against large-scale solar, more efficient land-use, preservation of farming community culture.  The presentation discussed a major challenge for farming communities today – loss of fertile topsoil – which is driving higher input costs and placing risk on future food supply. The report offered a high-level overview on regenerative agriculture principles of no-till, cover-cropping, crop diversity and grazing.
Cover cropping has been shown to provide a cooling effect (1% annual energy production increase found in one study), as well as more favorable albedo gains for bifacial modules (25% backside gains in another study). Through each practice (no-till, cover cropping, crop diversity and grazing) the presentation highlighted research studies or real-world examples that show the opportunity to integrate these practices.
3) Field Characterization and Performance Evaluation of Bifacial Photovoltaic Solar Panels at Louisiana Solar Energy Laboratory
University of Louisiana – Lafayette
Bifacial PV offers several advantages, including increased energy output and installation flexibility. Bifacial cells generate from both sides of the panel, allowing more sunlight to be captured than monofacial panels. According to the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic 2019, bifacial cells are expected to triple their current value in 2030 with market share increasing to 60% by 2027.
University of Louisiana’s research results show that bifacial modules can generate 18% more than their monofacial counterparts. To improve bifacial system performance, challenges in non-uniform rear-side irradiance, shading, and racking systems should be considered, said the report.
4) Optimizing Solar and Storage Projects for Clean Peak Standards
Nehal Y. Divekar, Customized Energy Solutions Ltd
Energy storage is adept at integrating and shifting solar energy to times of desired use or avoiding grid consumption during peak demand on the system. The Massachusetts Clean Peak Standard has established incentives in the form of monetizable Clean Peak Energy Certificates for resources having that capability. There are also other incentive programs like MA SMART that interface and have a bearing on a project participating in the CPS program. By purpose, these incentives have the potential to fill the ‘revenue gap’, between project costs and market revenues.
However, discretional choices with project design, ratings, location, or changes to externalities like policy futures or utility rates have the potential to significantly change the revenue gaps. Using representative sites, this presentation shed light on how such choices alter the overall project economics and identify the big value and cost drivers.
5) Anticipating Construction Compliance Wildlife Monitoring Issues at PV Solar Projects in the Southwestern U.S.
Cyrus Moqtaderi, Western EcoSystems Technology, Inc. (WEST)
Developing solar in the range of sensitive wildlife species can introduce complexities in project permitting and construction. State and federal wildlife agencies often advise on project requirements throughout the permitting process, and generally recommend measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts to sensitive species. This process generally results in issuance of one or more permits requiring compliance monitoring throughout project construction and operation.
However, permit conditions, as written, are often sparsely detailed and not written with a holistic understanding of project timelines and logistics. As such, developers often rely on consultants to interpret time and cost implications and translate permit requirements into actions that simultaneously fulfill mitigation and project timeline goals.
In the Southwestern US, where PV solar energy development is expanding rapidly, the presence of federally endangered Mojave desert tortoise and state sensitive burrowing owl at a PV solar site will likely result in permit conditions requiring mitigation, clearance surveys, construction timing constraints, and no-disturbance buffers. Developers and consultants without a nuanced understanding of how permit requirements interplay with construction schedules often face unanticipated delays and costs.

In Pennsylvania, Lehigh University is adding a 2.61 MW solar facility on its campus as a component of its 2040 carbon neutral strategy.
Standard Solar, a Brookfield Renewable-owned community solar developer, has announced the acquisition of the Lehigh solar facility from developer EDF Renewables, solidifying the company’s commitment to advancing solar energy in Pennsylvania and expanding into the education market.
“This transaction adds to Standard Solar’s impressive track record of successfully bringing solar solutions to schools, empowering them with clean and sustainable energy sources,” said Eric Partyka, director of business development, Standard Solar. “We’re thrilled to continue our successful development and construction partnership with EDF Renewables North America with this newest project – delivering clean energy to Pennsylvania’s Lehigh University community.”
Upon completion, the project is anticipated to fully power the Murray H. Goodman Campus, where the majority of the university’s athletic facilities are located. The solar installation is expected to meet 100% of Lehigh University’s electricity demands while offsetting 8% of the university’s grid power consumption.
The project will use a single-axis tracker system estimated to generate 5.22 GWh of clean energy each year, enough to power about 285 houses for one year and offset the carbon dioxide equivalent of burning more than 1,250 tons of coal in one year.
The Lehigh project is part of the developer’s expanding portfolio in the education sector. The company currently owns and operates more than 35 MW of solar projects serving educational institutions, encompassing both K-12 schools and collegiate institutions.
“Lehigh University has a bold, comprehensive plan to become a carbon-neutral institution, one driven by university and Lehigh Valley stakeholders” said Audrey McSain, sustainability director at Lehigh University. “This project will play a key role in our strategy, delivering rapid emissions reductions to help meet our ambitious goals. We thank EDF Renewables and Standard Solar for their partnership and look forward to producing clean energy onsite for our community and environment.”
Lehigh University recently released an ambitious 2040 carbon neutral strategy which includes:
The university’s Climate Action Strategy aligns Lehigh with the City of Bethlehem’s Climate Action Plan, which establishes a net-zero by 2040 community-wide target. The strategy deepens Lehigh’s commitments to climate action and puts Lehigh in line with peer and aspirant peer institutions that have developed pathways to net-zero emissions.
Standard Solar, based in Rockville, Maryland, owns and operates more than 300 MW of community solar and small distributed solar projects across the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/20/the-benefits-of-local-ownership-of-clean-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 20, 2023",The benefits of local ownership of clean energy,"The Institute for Local Self Reliance (ILSR) released a new report titled Advantage Local: Why Local Energy Ownership Matters that finds many advantages to local ownership of clean energy from addressing the climate crisis to economic inequality to corporate exploitation.
The report defines local clean energy ownership as clean energy projects for which local residents, groups, or other community-based entities have meaningful decision-making power. This includes rooftop solar panels on a resident’s home as well as shared projects like community solar.
Today, locally owned solar energy systems make up a modest percentage of clean energy capacity in the United States. In the case of community solar, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reports that customer-owned projects make up less than 1% of capacity installed through 2020, and projects owned by electric cooperatives, municipal utilities, and their suppliers account for another 10%. Rooftop and other on-site solar has a higher rate of local ownership; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory data shows that host-owned systems made up about 65% of residential capacity installed through the same time period and that this percentage is growing.
The report distinguishes between local ownership and local siting, emphasizing that local ownership can garner public support, can boost economic impacts of clean energy and can put power back in the hands of people instead of those of utility monopolies.

For residential solar, the report highlights the difference in earnings between owning and leasing. Owners of rooftop solar panels or part-owners in a community solar cooperative can see up to $12,000 to $14,000 more earnings over the life of the projects, compared to outside ownership.
Systemic inequalities can also be overcome with locally owned energy, but state policies are needed that address upfront costs through improved incentives and funding. While the tax credits offered in the Inflation Reduction Act are generous, they do not address up-front costs, which are often a deterrent to low- to middle-income residents investing in clean energy.
According to a study conducted by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, higher income people tend to be solar owners. The median household income of all 2021 solar adopters was $110,000 compared to a national median of $63,000. Furthermore, Black and Hispanic households are underrepresented among solar adopters and residents of disadvantaged communities are only 11% of adopters nationally.
The ILSR report points to the barriers to low- to middle-income clean energy adoption as racial and socioeconomic gaps in homeownership, wealth, and financing, as well as energy system-specific barriers, like high upfront costs, inadequate government incentives and policies, and utility interference.
The benefits of clean energy are many: Its electricity generation is carbon emissions free, it is the cheapest source of new power, provides lower and stable energy costs, and more. The benefits to the local community are also great: It creates jobs and income, reduces pollution, creates resilience and puts control into the hands of the people.
The report lays out policy changes that will stimulate increasing adoption of locally owned clean energy:
