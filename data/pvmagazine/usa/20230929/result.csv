The funds will support loans originated by Sunnova under its new “Project Hestia.”
The partial guarantee from the DOE LPO is expected to support over $5 billion in Sunnova solar loan originations, reduce the company’s weighted average cost of capital, and generate interest savings.
Project Hestia is designed to increase access to solar and virtual power plant (VPP) services for disadvantaged communities who otherwise may not be able to secure loans for residential solar projects. The company will receive indirect and partially guaranteed cash flows for the loans associated with these customer accounts.
A VPP is a virtual aggregation of small-scale, distributed energy resources (DERs) including PV, energy storage, electric vehicle chargers, and demand-responsive devices such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances.
(Read: “Virtual power plants roll out across the U.S.”)
To be eligible for Project Hestia, each installation must be outfit with Sunnova’s energy management system, which customers can access via smartphone or other electronic devices. The system will make recommendations for demand response behaviors, offering customers opportunities to save on energy costs while helping balance the grid during times of peak demand.
Sunnova was advised by ATLAS SP Partners and Citi on the transaction. Baker Botts acted as legal advisor to Sunnova and Kramer Levin acted as legal advisor to the financial advisors.
“Today marks the beginning of an exciting chapter in our pursuit of a cleaner and more equitable energy landscape. With our collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy, we are embarking on a journey that expands clean energy access and delivers economic benefit to Americans in disadvantaged communities,” said William J. (John) Berger, chief executive officer, Sunnova Energy.
Sunnova has agreed to provide monthly servicing reports, and hardware and software deployment information to DOE. It will also measure the reduction in greenhouse gases associated with the project. As part of the conditional loan, Sunnova will be required to deliver collateral pools that realize agreed criteria related to FICO distributions for disadvantaged communities.
The company said it anticipates utilizing the loan guarantee in connection with its first Project Hestia asset backed securitization, Hestia I, in the fourth quarter of 2023.
“We expect the Hestia I issuance to generate spreads commensurate with the expected credit uplift and introduce new, investment-grade investors to Sunnova’s long-term strategy,” said Robert Lane, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Sunnova.
DOE has set a goal for the U.S. to deploy VPPs encompassing 80-160 GW of distributed energy resources by 2030, tripling the current scale of VPPs, to “support rapid electrification while redirecting grid spending from peaker plants to VPP participants and reducing overall grid costs.”
DOE’s report on the VPP target is titled “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Virtual Power Plants.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/29/solar-wafer-prices-fall-for-first-time-in-three-months/,"COST AND PRICES,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Solar wafer prices fall for first time in three months,"From pv magazine Global
Solar wafer prices declined this week. This is the first time this quarter that wafer prices have decreased across the board.
The price of Mono M10 wafers dropped by 7.79% to $0.379 per piece (pc), while the price of Mono G12 wafers fell by 5.43% to $0.505/pc when compared to the previous week.
Wafer prices have decreased earlier than anticipated, multiple industry sources claimed. The increase in wafer output has outpaced demand to an excessive degree, which is the primary reason that has pushed wafer prices downwards, they concurred.

After the two leading wafer producers, Longi and TCL Zhonghuan dropped their list pricing for Mono M10 wafers to CNY3.1/pc in succession on September 25 and 26, an influential Tier-2 specialized wafer manufacturer reportedly offered Mono M10 wafers for CNY3.05/pc, according to a source.
This source stated that the market price will probably approach the price of this producer, adding that “this manufacturer has a certain market pricing power due to the expansion of production capacity; its newly expanded 40 GW wafer production capacity is currently being installed with manufacturing equipment on site.”
For another source, wafer inventory levels right now are still under control. However, because wafer prices are declining, wafer producers are concerned that, as they create more wafers, future wafer price declines may cause them to lose more money, the source said.
“However, this loss seems inevitable given that cell manufacturers have curtailed their wafer orders out of concern that wafer prices would continue to fall. Wafer stockpiles would build up as a result,” the source continued.
Looking ahead, the degree of the drop in wafer pricing may largely depend on the manufacturing strategies of cell makers and their enthusiasm for buying wafers, a source stated.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/29/october-14-eclipse-to-cost-u-s-states-up-to-17-of-daily-solar-generation/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",October 14 eclipse to cost U.S. states up to 17% of daily solar generation,"From pv magazine Global
On October 14, North and South America are set to experience an annular eclipse.
Some states could lose up to 17% of their daily solar energy production, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API. The path of the eclipse tracks across the southwestern United States, from Oregon to Texas, before continuing through Mexico, Central America and ending in Brazil, though impacts will be seen across all of the contiguous US and the top of South America.
This eclipse is an annular eclipse, meaning that the moon will not appear big enough to completely block the sun, as it does in a total eclipse. This means irradiance will not drop to 0%, and the sky will not darken completely. As the ‘eye’ of the eclipse passes over an area, the total clearsky irradiance will drop to 9.5% of normal clearsky levels. The total duration of the eclipse effect will be 3 hours in some locations, though the peak will only last for seconds.
This image shows the total loss in clearsky irradiance across the day, where blue represents the areas that will see the greatest losses on October 14th.

At the time of writing, the eclipse is 14 days away, which is too far for accurate cloud predictions. However, it is possible to calculate the maximum irradiance losses, i.e. the impact in the absence of clouds.
As can be seen in this image the path of the eclipse peak impact will hit Oregon first, at 0920 local time, before passing over Northern California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and reaching Texas at 1150 local time. Texas will be hit hardest by the eclipse. The event occurs in the middle of the day when solar energy production is at its peak. As a result, some areas in Texas will experience losses of up to
17% in solar energy production.
The eclipse could significantly impact power grids like CAISO and ERCOT in the U.S. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the most affected states had 40.756 GW of operational large-scale solar assets as of August 2023. This includes 13.046 GW in Texas, and represents a significant proportion of the 80.368 GW total nameplate capacity of large scale Solar PV in the US.

The total difference can be seen in the above comparison, contrasting total daily irradiance with and without the effects of the eclipse. The largest net impacts are over Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, Central America and Columbia. Whilst Texas will suffer losses up to 17%, the peak loss will reach 20% in Central America.
In South America, the eclipse will make its way in the afternoon and evening. It will track over the Yucatan Peninsula and Central America before reaching Colombia and finally ending in western Brazil at 1620 local time. As the eclipse will pass at or near the middle of the day, when irradiance peaks, losses will be greatest from Texas to Columbia, and proportional daily losses will be lower in Oregon at the start of their day, and Brazil at the end of theirs.
Solcast will continue to track the impacts of the eclipse, including calculating solar impacts once accurate cloud forecasting is possible.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/29/teeing-up-the-solar-decade/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Teeing up the “Solar + Decade”,"From pv magazine Special Edition
George Hershman began his four-year tenure as executive chair of the board of directors at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in early 2020 and has served through the sudden onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the creation of a “Solar + Decade” target, and the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 
 Despite a suddenly changed world, the industry persisted through the pandemic, and by 2021 set the “Solar + Decade” target of solar contributing 30% of U.S. electricity generation. A year later, the IRA was passed, carrying a record $369 billion in spending for energy and climate, and creating a path for SEIA’s vision to become reality. Hershman offered his perspective a year following this passage in a conversation with pv magazine USA, and why IRA is unique.  
“We’ve often dealt with the buy side, through continued tax credits for projects. That really helps installers and developers and end users,” said Hershman. “But we really never dealt with how we are going to get product, the supply side. I think the IRA did a great job with supporting the supply side to ensure we build the manufacturing supply chain in the U.S. that we all want to be able to deploy.”  
Direct Pay  
pv magazine USA asked Hershman about adjustments or clarifications he would like to see made to IRA, the Direct Pay provision came to mind.  
“I think Direct Pay applicability should have been much broader. The fact that Direct Pay went forward to municipalities and nontaxpaying entities was great,” he said.  
However, Hershman warns that commercial tax appetite will limit the efficacy of this provision. He said that larger projects may gobble up tax equity, squeezing out smaller projects from accessing the benefit. This is largely due to the fact that it is more appealing for a tax credit investor to write a few large checks rather than many small ones.  
Hershman said that there is room for revisiting this problem, but by-and-large, he is pleased with many of the outcomes of the IRA and its outlook for solar. 
 As for political threats to IRA, there have been attempts to overturn it or strip core provisions, but Hershman said that early and continued success will de-fang any attempts to throw out the landmark industrial policy.  
“We want to win the win,” he said. “We all want to be in a position where we can cut ribbons and put shovels in the ground and say the IRA brought this project to your community. A lot of these projects are in Red counties and Red districts. It’s much harder to fight against a bill that’s bringing jobs and property tax revenues to your district.”  
Supply  
While there is much to celebrate about IRA, there are bubbling concerns about the nation having a steady supply of solar components to meet deployment demand. Enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and the looming temporary pause of antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws, which will lift in summer 2024, have cast doubts on the U.S. having enough supply.  
While the IRA’s manufacturing provisions are making significant additions to the nation’s solar supply chain, Hershman recognizes that we can’t build a complete domestic supply chain overnight.  
As for the AD/CVD waiver, Hershman said he is hoping the U.S. will take a more strategic view of trade laws. He sees it as highly unlikely that a blanket, long-term extension of the tariff pause will occur. 
 As for AD/CVD enforcement, Hershman pointed to an opportunity to reward the many foreign businesses which are now meaningfully investing in U.S. manufacturing sites, and how this investment could be further encouraged in tariff law structuring.  
“It seems like we’re not appropriately acknowledging the investments and rewarding the good players. If you don’t invest here, you don’t get a waiver, there is no free ride into this market without significant AD/CVD penalties. But, if you do choose to invest, there should be some sort of reward there.”  
Foreign companies investing in a U.S. manufacturing footprint are investing hundreds of millions of dollars. In the first eight months alone post-IRA, over $150 billion in manufacturing investments were announced across over 46 sites. Many of the largest announcements came from companies like Qcells, Canadian Solar, and other foreign companies.  
Hershman said we all stand to benefit to see these businesses succeed. Hershman said this kind of approach would be a strong incentive for driving even more investment on U.S. shores.  
“If I knew that I could continue to supply the U.S., but the only way I could is if I invested and opened a facility here, that would seem to be a good incentive.”  
As we take the first steps into the Solar + Decade, Hershman reflected on the unique couple of years behind us, which presented unprecedented challenges.  
“We weathered it very well, and we are coming out of Covid stronger as an association, stronger as an industry, and got a lot of really good work done during a really difficult time,” he concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/29/payne-institute-report-assesses-supply-chain-variables-for-critical-minerals/,"SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Payne Institute report assesses supply chain variables for critical minerals,"The Payne Institute for Public Policy at Colorado School of Mines released The State of Critical Minerals Report 2023. The analysis examines how the increasing demand for the critical minerals necessary to power a green economy will impact global communities, markets, national security, and geopolitics. 
Multi-disciplinary experts from the Colorado School of Mines worked together to assess the social economic and policy implications of the race to secure an ethical and reliable domestic supply chain. 
The United States Geological Survey suggests that lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite are the metals needed to power electric vehicles. Alternatively, arsenic, gallium, germanium, indium, and tellurium are essential to constructing solar panels. 
Many of these minerals, however, are mined and processed in foreign adversary’s. Australia produces over 40% of lithium, with Chile following close behind. Over 50% of the world’s cobalt and nickel production happens in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia. China leads the world’s Rare Earth Elements (REE) production – materials primarily used to build solar panels – it also produces the world’s graphite. South Africa accounts for more than half of the world’s Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) production, also used to construct solar panels. 
Regarding downstream processing, China leads the global mineral value chain. It processes and refines 100% of the world’s natural graphite 80% of the world’s manganese and 70% of worldwide cobalt and lithium. Moreover, the country controls 80% of the world’s lithium-ion battery production, 77% of the world’s battery cell capacity and 60% of the world’s battery component manufacturing. 
The report states that domestic mining capabilities must increase exponentially to establish a reliable domestic supply chain. Projections indicate that by 2030, the demand for lithium could triple. EV and battery storage technologies have surpassed consumer electronics in becoming the most significant users of lithium. The report states they will exceed stainless steel to become the primary end users of nickel by 2040. 
This leaves many environmental and social implications to consider. The report suggests reimagining a domestic mining sector that produces some of the raw materials needed for clean energy infrastructure under scrutiny, “The sector should be subject to the most protective standards in the world and above all – with strong public support,” said Morgan Bazilian, Director of the Payne Institute for Public Policy. 
The report suggests coupling the recycling of critical materials and sustainable mining practices to reduce the land degradation air pollution and water contamination that results from extraction. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, extracting one ton of REEs produces about 2,000 tons of toxic waste and greenhouse gasses like sulfur hexafluoride. This scenario’s global warming potential is 23,900 times more than carbon dioxide. The report suggests investing in carbon capture and storage to lessen the carbon footprint of mining operations.
Permitting reforms like re-assessing the General Mining Law of 1872 to establish a clear direction for allowing hard rock mines are recommended. The report also asks that stakeholders continue to invest in education programs that can help generate the necessary human expertise to develop socially economically and environmentally conscious domestic mining practices.  
According to the report, research is ongoing on whether we can safely and ethically mine asteroids and the deep sea bed of international waters. This is because minerals including iron, nickel, iridium, palladium, platinum, gold and magnesium have been found in asteroids. Moreover, researchers have spotted two metal-rich asteroids near the earth with 85% iron nickel and cobalt, which exceed global reserves. 
Along with needing the right technology, there are dangerous ramifications from altering celestial bodies and creating space debris. Moreover, research shows deep-sea mining could severely harm marine biodiversity and ecosystems, the report states. Even so, the International Seabed Authority has issued 31 contracts to explore deep-sea mineral deposits, and mining in international waters could start as early as 2026.
The report was released after a two-day Critical Minerals Symposium hosted by Payne Institute last week. The report and symposium are part of a broader effort by the Colorado School of Mines to connect the technical and scientific expertise of the university with global conversations related to energy issues.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/29/california-ends-summer-with-5-gw-energy-storage-record/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",California ends summer with 5 GW energy storage record,"On Sept. 24, 2023, between 6:40 and 6:45 PM local time, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) registered a power input of 5.223 GW into the grid from utility-scale, grid-connected batteries, as reported by the record tracking tools at Gridstatus.io.
Additionally, beginning at 5:40 PM on that Sunday, CAISO recorded that the battery output exceeded 2 GW, maintaining that value until 8:40 PM, a solid three-hour window.

 
This output represents approximately 83% of the 6.278 GW of battery-based energy storage connected to the CAISO grid as reported in the Department of Energy’s September EIA 860-M report. The report highlighted that over July and August, ten projects totalling 854 MW of capacity were activated. According to CASIO records, at least two additional facilities have since come online – one at 137 MW and another at 12.5 MW – bringing the summer’s total to just over 1 GW of added energy storage.
The battery record on Sunday evening was paired with a near-record solar power output of more than 15.5 GW of utility-scale capacity. This achievement was followed by a true solar output record on Monday, with 16.05 GW of instantaneous output at 11:32 AM on Sept. 26th. This utility-scale solar output is augmented by approximately 10 GW of behind-the-meter solar generation not included in CAISO’s primary charts.

What makes these records notable is their timing. Generally, solar records are set in late spring, while energy storage records, still a new and developing metric, have typically been established during record heat waves. These records, however, followed significant growth in capacity outside the usual summer months. 
California’s energy storage record showcases the state’s success in meeting ambitious deployment goals. Initial forecasts in summer 2019 had anticipated potential shortfalls of up to 4.7 GW in capacity during the summer of 2022.

The analysis indicated a potential capacity shortfall of 4.7 GW during the peak demand hour in the summer months, historically in September, projected for 2022. However, as we step into the summer of 2023, California has defied these expectations. The state has now deployed ample energy storage capacity, mostly backed by four hours of storage, completely covering the anticipated shortfall.

P-type solar products may be phased out by 2026 as n-type tech ‘rapidly’ expands The rise of cost-effective TOPCon cell technology last year led to a ‘surge’ in production demand for solar n-type cell technology, with leading industry analysts TrendForce prophesying PERC cell capacities ‘may’ be phased out in two to three years.

The win-win of agrivoltaics The process of pairing solar with agriculture has proven to be mutually beneficial for farmers and solar developers.
Shifting state policies reshape distributed solar in the U.S. Major distributed solar markets policy changes essentially necessitate battery energy storage attachment, while other policies are launching community solar markets.
Critical roles emerging for long-duration energy storage As more renewable energy comes online each year, the added flexibility and resiliency that energy storage provides has never been more critical—because our grid is not as stable as it needs to be.
