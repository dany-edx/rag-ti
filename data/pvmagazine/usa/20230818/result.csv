That scheme includes the construction of a green transmission grid, which requires safe and affordable energy storage systems that can power vast residential and commercial electric needs.
Last month, Governor Hochul announced the creation of a new Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group. The organization comprises state emergency environmental and public service institutions that will research energy storage facility fires and safety standards. It will also collaborate with national experts and laboratories to stay current on fire causes appropriate responses and approaches to building green grid infrastructure that can accommodate vast amounts of electricity while decreasing the risk of fires. 
The state is also heavily investing in affordable long-duration renewable energy storage solutions. Four demonstration projects have received financial awards in line with this goal. 
Climate science company Ecolectro, Inc. received $1.08 million to scale their approach to reducing the cost of sustainably produced hydrogen. Clean hydrogen is made through electrolysis, or the separation of water to generate hydrogen and oxygen. The element is excellent for storing vast quantities of green energy over a long period. These reserves can give consumers backup power during peak hours or weather storms. However, current hydrogen production methods are pricey. According to a 2018 study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, and Innovation the Future Progress and Neutrality (ISE and IPA) using the proton exchange membrane (PEM) approach, generating one standard cubic meter of hydrogen in 60 minutes costs between $4900 and $6000. Ecolectro Inc. will deploy its 10 kW electrolysis unit in a pilot demonstration in partnership with Liberty Utilities. 
Form Energy, a Somerville, Massachusetts-based grid-scale energy storage developer, that was founded in 2017 by energy storage veterans who shared a unified mission to reshape the global electric system by creating a new class of low-cost multi-day energy storage systems. Form Energy’s New York proposal is a commercial-scale low-cost 10 MW iron-air battery demonstration system, which stores energy by converting iron into rust and rust back into iron; this cycle holds an electric current. Form Energy was awarded $1.2 million by New York State. Form Energy recently announced plans to set up a manufacturing facility in West Virginia.
Energy storage company PolyJoule Inc. received $1.03 million to install a 2 MW/h, 167 kW PolyJoule battery energy storage system (BESS) at its Astoria Generating Station in Queens, New York. This demonstration will also use inexpensive and widely available materials, primarily plastic, in its battery electrodes. Aside from being cheap to make, the company reports that plastic can handle the swelling and contracting of a battery during charging well. “PolyJoule’s systems don’t require any active temperature control to make sure they don’t overheat or catch fire,” PolyJoule CEO Eli Paster said in an interview. The company is working toward charging $65/kWh of storage for its system. 
Lastly, Urban Electric Power (UEP) was awarded $703,965 to install a 100 kW, 1 MW/h BESS made from UEP’s patented rechargeable zinc alkaline battery technology. UEP expects the BESS to level out peaks in electricity use by proactively accommodating them. “The proposed BESS is designed for long-duration energy storage applications (10 to 24 hours) at commercial and industrial facilities,” the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) reports. 
NYSERDA’s Renewable Optimization and Energy Storage Innovation Program provides funding for these awards. NYSERDA’s initiatives are financed through the state’s ten-year, $6 billion Clean Energy Fund. An additional $8.15 million has been announced to support more applicable long-duration energy storage solutions and other complementary technologies yet to be commercialized.
“Project submissions should advance develop or field-test hydrogen, electric, chemical, mechanical, or thermal-electric storage technologies that will address renewable integration challenges,” NYSERDA reports. These include grid congestion hosting capacity constraints and siting in New York. The last day to submit a proposal is October 17 by 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/18/pv-wafer-formats-continue-to-evolve/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 18, 2023",PV wafer formats continue to evolve,"From pv magazine 07-08/23
Cost reduction and efficiency improvement are the shared pursuits of the PV industry, with the former of vital importance in the wafer sector. Manufacturers strive to seek the best wafer thickness and format, leading to the current technology roadmaps for fabricating thinner and larger wafers.
With tier-1 manufacturers taking the lead, the mainstream thickness of positively-doped, p-type wafers now sits at 150 microns and the typical thickness of n-type wafers is 130 microns.
While wafer thickness appears to be gradually unifying, wafer size and shape is a different story. Between 2013 and 2017, 156 mm “M0” and 156.75 mm “M2” wafers dominated the market upon the emergence of aluminum back surface field solar cell technology.
Module makers kept the width at 1,134 mm to stack two arrays of pallets in a 40 ft shipping container without exceeding the door opening height. In addition to the original spec of 2,278 mm for modules with a higher cell count, manufacturers also innovated while keeping the length within 2,386 mm, in order to house 20 pallets in a 40-foot cube container. Considering EU structural design standards the “Eurocodes,” some tried to keep the length of modules with smaller cell counts within 2 m.
The resulting myriad of wafer formats brings chaos and inconvenience to the PV industry. Non-vertically integrated companies selling or buying customized wafers are having a hard time. Wafer makers have to negotiate orders for rectangular wafers in each format, while cell and module makers struggle to sell leftover customized products. Adjusting fixers or encapsulant, glass, and other components pushes up costs, testing the supply chain management ability of manufacturers.
End users must track the changes of module specs because such diversification complicates system design and management. Once module specs change, customers have to adjust their BOS equipment accordingly, including the distance between mounting holes, the tracking systems, and inverters. Dispatching solar module supply also becomes more difficult for them.
Despite the heterogeneity, and the absence of an official announcement from any module maker, this year’s SNEC and Intersolar Europe trade shows featured modules from leading manufacturers comprised of rectangular wafers that displayed a smaller disparity in specs.
The length of 45-cell and 48-cell modules still varied between 1,722 mm, 1,762 mm, and 1,780 mm, however. As for 66-cell and 72-cell modules, in addition to the regular 2,278 mm by 1,134 mm, there was also a gain in popularity for 2,380-something mm by 1,134 mm devices. In mid-June, nine manufacturers were reportedly on board for unified module specs, paving the way for the future standardization of modules.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/18/the-hydrogen-stream-us-awards-34-million-to-19-hydrogen-projects/,"HYDROGEN,UNITED STATES,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"AUGUST 18, 2023",The Hydrogen Stream: U.S. awards $34 million to 19 hydrogen projects,"From pv magazine Global
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the award of nearly $34 million to 19 industry- and university-led research projects to make clean hydrogen a more available and affordable fuel for electricity generation, industrial decarbonization, and transportation. With the recent selections, DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) has announced investments of more than $122 million in 72 projects since January 2021. “These projects support DOE’s Hydrogen Shot initiative, which seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in one decade to grow new, clean hydrogen pathways in the United States,” said the DOE.
A research team from Korea and US, led by Chanho Pak from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea, has developed a novel mesoporous tantalum oxide (Ta2O5)-supported iridium nanostructure catalyst via a modified formic acid reduction method that reportedly achieves efficient PEM water electrolysis.“The electron-rich Ir nanostructure was uniformly dispersed on the stable mesoporous Ta2O5 support prepared via a soft-template method combined with an ethylenediamine encircling process, which effectively decreased the amount of Ir in a single PEMWE cell to 0.3 mg cm–2,” said Pak.
The Ir/Ta2O5 catalyst design improved the utilization of Ir, while facilitating higher electrical conductivity and a large electrochemically active surface area. “X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectroscopies are used to demonstrate the strong metal-support interaction between Ir and Ta. The charge transfer from Ta to Ir has confirmed through density functional theory, which leads to enhanced OER activity of Ir/Ta2O5 (ɳ = 0.385 V) over IrO2 (ɳ = 0.48 V). Ir/Ta2O5 presents a higher activity with an overpotential of 288 ± 3.9 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and mass activity of 876.1 ± 125.1 A gIr−1 at 1.55 VRHE,” the researchers wrote in the paper “Electron-rich Ir nanostructure supported on mesoporous Ta2O5 for enhanced activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction,” which was published in the Journal of Power Sources.
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced that Fidelis New Energy has selected Mason County as the site for a lifecycle carbon-neutral hydrogen production facility called The Mountaineer GigaSystem. “Mountaineer will be implementing the proprietary FidelisH2 technology that enables the production of hydrogen with zero lifecycle carbon emissions from a combination of natural gas, carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) and renewable energy,” said the West Virginia Governor. The project should be built in four phases, each producing over 500 metric tons per day (MTPD) of net-zero carbon hydrogen at an approximate capital cost of $2 billion per phase. The first FidelisH2 train of the Mountaineer GigaSystem should commence operations in 2028. Fidelis New Energy is also working on an onshore CO2 storage facility in Aalborg, Denmark. 
Denmark‘s Minister of Industry Morten Bødskov visited HySynergy to discuss green fuels and the next big export adventure, hydrogen. “On- and offshore renewable energy combined with Power-to-X and the production of green fuels can become the next big export adventure supporting finance Denmark’s welfare society for generations to come, says Everfuel and Crossbridge Energy,” said Everfuel, underling that the facility already displays a small hydrogen pipe that can deliver more than 8 tons of hydrogen per day from the producer Everfuel to the customer Crossbridge Energy. 
Wärtsilä will provide the front-end engineering design (FEED) for the liquefaction and storage of liquefied synthetic methane (LSM) at the plant to be built in Kristinestad, Finland, by Koppö Energia, a joint venture between Germany’s Prime Green Energy Infrastructure Fund and CPC Finland. “The FEED will be booked by Wärtsilä in Q3, 2023. The Power-to-X plant … will have a capacity of 200 MW and will convert green electricity into hydrogen and sustainable LSM. Up to 500 MW of wind and 100 MW of photovoltaic power will be developed under the Koppö Energy Cluster to supply the plant with completely emission-free renewable energy,” said the Finnish technology company. 
The British government announced that 262 MW of electrolyzer capacity had made it to the penultimate step of the Hydrogen Business Model allocation round. The government shortlisted 17 projects to negotiations. “Government is working at pace to ensure that the first electrolytic allocation round (HAR1) concludes before the end of 2023. We expect to award contracts totaling up to 250MW of capacity from HAR1, subject to affordability and value for money. We aim for contracts to be awarded in Q4 2023, with first projects becoming operational in 2025,” said the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero. 
Toppan announced it plans to enter the hydrogen market, leveraging its base sheet transfer technology and uniform coating process for large surfaces. The Japan-based company installed production equipment for Catalyst Coated Membrane (CCM)/Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEA) at its Kochi Plant in Kochi Prefecture. “Aiming to enter the hydrogen energy market, Toppan is using a first-of-its-kind proprietary manufacturing method to enable mass production of high-performance, high-quality CCM/MEAs and is launching sales in August,” said the Japanese company. CCM/MEAs are core components of water electrolysis equipment for hydrogen production.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/18/clean-energy-jobs-seeing-growth-across-the-u-s/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 18, 2023",Clean energy jobs seeing growth across the U.S.,"Recent legislation has launched a clean energy revolution in the United States, beginning in 2021 with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and followed one year ago by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Last year also saw the passage of the $67 billion CHIPS and Science Act to support production of semiconductors. Together these laws will strengthen America’s technology leadership, develop clean energy and more, not the least of which is the creation of quality jobs.
The Department of Energy’s recently released jobs report, 2023 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER), shows that the energy workforce grew nearly 4% with nearly 300,000 jobs added from 2021 to 2022, outpacing the growth rate of the overall U.S. workforce. According to the report, clean energy jobs increased from 7.8 million in 2021 to more than 8.1 million in 2022. The strongest growth was seen in battery electric vehicles, which grew nearly 30%, or 17 times faster than the job growth seen in the gasoline and diesel vehicle sector.
Solar fallw into the category of clean energy technologies in the report, which overall accounted for over 20,000 new jobs or more than 84% of net new electric power generation jobs, adding 21,664 overall. Both solar and wind had strong employment growth, with solar adding 12,256 workers, up nearly 4%. Wind had a strong growth rate, but added fewer workers overall.
Demographics and diversity
Women and minorities have been underrepresented in the U.S. energy sector, however, that is slowly changing. In October 2021, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) launched a program to encourage the hiring of a diverse workforce. SEIA’s annual report on the program notes its positive impact in its first year. The DOE report also indicates that a change is afoot, with women now making up more than half the new workers in energy jobs in 2022. However, women have along way to go, as they made up only 26% of the energy workforce, compared to 47% of the U.S. workforce overall. The report notes that the representation of women was highest in electric power generation sectors, where they made up 32% of the workforce.
In terms of race, the energy workforce also has some work to do. The percentage of non-white workers in energy is slightly higher (24%) than the general workforce, however, the energy workforce has a lower number of Black workers. The proportion of Hispanic or Latino workers in energy (18%) was just below the national average of 19%, and Asian workers make up the same percentage in energy (7%) as the national workforce. American Indian or Alaska Native workers made up 2% of the energy workforce, which was more than twice as high as the average in the U.S. workforce.
The report found that the energy workforce is generally younger than the U.S. workforce as a whole, with 83% under 55.
State growth
With the clean energy boom taking place across all fifty states, it’s not surprising that clean energy jobs grew across the country. The strongest growth in clean energy jobs in general was seen in the strong solar states of Texas and California, as well as Pennsylvania. The strongest growth in electric power generation was seen in Delaware, which was up 14%, followed by Idaho (12%), Washington DC (11%), and Montana (9.6%).
Overall the data is encouraging, as energy employment continues to outpace economy-wide employment and clean energy jobs outpacing energy jobs in general. The growth in clean energy jobs is expected to continue on a upward trajectory as projects that resulted from the Investing in America agenda come to fruition. As U.S. Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm noted, “We’re transforming local economies and delivering healthier and more prosperous communities along the way.” With the goal of carbon-free electrical grid by 2035 and a net zero economy by 2050, energy workers will play a pivotal role in every county and state in the country.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/18/five-major-solar-panel-suppliers-found-in-violation-of-antidumping-laws/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 18, 2023",Five major solar panel suppliers found in violation of antidumping laws,"The U.S. Department of Commerce has ruled that business units of BYD, Longi Green Energy, Canadian Solar, Trina Solar and New East Solar are in violation of anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) laws.
The five companies were found to be moving tariff-dodging Chinese solar goods through Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia, which are responsible for as much as 80% of the U.S. supply of solar panels. The ruling means that these companies would have to pay tariffs on the circumvented goods to enter the U.S. market or find other pathways to compliance.
Past records of solar AD/CVD tariffs have shown that the fee can be as high as 50% to 250% of the cost of shipped goods. However, the tariffs will not apply until June 2024, when President Biden’s two-year pause lifts.
The looming threat of tariffs led to a freeze in the utility-scale solar industry in 2022, pulling back by deployments by about 16% on a year that was expected to bring booming growth. Biden’s pause was meant as a bridge as panel makers ramp up production on U.S. shores and international suppliers improve the traceability of their supply chains. 
Notably, major panel suppliers Hanwha Qcells, Jinko and Boviet were found to not be in violation of AD/CVD laws.
The AD/CVD saga began when a small California-based solar manufacturer Auxin Solar filed a petition in 2021.
“When prices of finished panels from Southeast Asia come in below our bill of materials cost, American manufacturers cannot compete,” Mamun Rashid, chief executive officer, Auxin Solar told CNN. “If foreign producers are circumventing U.S. law and causing harm to U.S. producers like Auxin Solar, it needs to be addressed.”
The U.S. enforced anti-dumping duties on Chinese-made solar components for a decade after a Commerce investigation found Chinese companies were receiving large government subsidies that kept their prices artificially low. The five companies found in violation and others will face the same tariff duty rates the U.S. currently assesses on Chinese-made products.
“Trina has created thousands of American jobs, billions of dollars in U.S. investment and clean energy for millions of Americans by providing competitively priced solar panels that are ethically sourced,” said Steven Zhu, president of Trina Solar U.S.
“We take issue with the Commerce Department’s circumvention finding. The work we are doing in Thailand and Vietnam is not minor or insignificant and this decision conflicts directly with its decision in the original case that cell production is the most significant production step,” said Zhu.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/18/californias-first-full-scale-direct-air-capture-hub-awarded-11-8-million/,"SUSTAINABILITY,CALIFORNIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 18, 2023",California’s first full-scale direct air capture hub awarded $11.8 million,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently awarded up to $11.8 million in funding to the California DAC Hub, a consortium of organizations comprised of approximately 40 organizations from across industry, community, tribes, government, technology, national labs, academia, labor, and workforce development. The consortium is looking to build California’s first full-scale direct air capture and storage network of hubs.
The California DAC Hub is being led by CTV Direct, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRC’s Carbon TerraVault that is focused exclusively on DAC plus storage; Kern Community College District (KernCCD), the community benefits plan lead; and EPRI, a non-profit energy research and development institute.
This funding will be used to study a regional carbon management hub in California’s Kern County, following which the consortium plans to build similar facilities in other parts of the state. The group includes nearly 40 organizations, including representatives from industry, government, technology, and labor and workforce development. 

The hub could be able to remove more than 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, or the equivalent of eliminating 220,000 gasoline vehicles on the road annually. In addition to bringing California closer to its climate goals, each hub could also provide high-paying and permanent jobs and workforce development programs, according to Carbon TerraVault Holdings, a subsidiary of the California Resources Corporation, which assembled the consortium. 
The timeline for getting the hub operational will depend on the timing of further DOE funding for the development and construction stages, Richard Venn, a spokesperson for the California Resources Corporation, told pv magazine USA.
The direct air capture industry is in an early stage and provides a tremendous opportunity for many states and regions to invest in a new clean technology industry that will remove carbon dioxide from the air and deliver significant co-benefits to local communities, Venn added. 
“According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), carbon removal methods such as DAC are key to mitigation pathways aimed at keeping global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius,” said Venn. 
Direct air capture technology involves separating carbon dioxide from the air, and either storing it underground permanently or using it in products that contain carbon, like concrete. At least 27 direct air capture plants have been commissioned worldwide, and plans for another 130 facilities are at various stages of development, according to the International Energy Agency. 
The California funding is part of a larger DOE effort to invest in engineered carbon removal. Last week the agency announced up to $1.2 billion in funding to develop two commercial-scale direct air capture facilities in Texas and Louisiana, which are collectively expected to remove more than 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere every year. 
The DOE’s investment lays the foundation for a direct air capture industry that will be crucial to tackling climate change, according to Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Secretary of Energy.
“Cutting back on our carbon emissions alone won’t reverse the growing impacts of climate change; we also need to remove the CO2 that we’ve already put in the atmosphere…” said Granholm. 
The DOE also selected 19 additional projects – including the California hub – to support the earlier stages of project development, such as feasibility assessments. 
“Our research has shown that carbon management, when combined with electrification and clean fuels, delivers the most affordable, resilient and technologically proven path to full carbon neutrality,” said Maryam Brown, president of SoCalGas. The utility’s role in the project includes a front-end engineering design study on transporting the captured carbon to permanent storage. 
The DOE funding will be used in 2024 to conduct studies on the planned facilities in Kern County, Carbon TerraVault said. The consortium could begin developing and constructing the facility in 2025, and plans to put out additional funding requests next year as well.
The opening paragraphs were amended to better explain the mission and leadership of the consortium.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/18/federal-government-proposes-new-rules-for-green-grid-construction/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"AUGUST 18, 2023",Federal government proposes new rules for green-grid construction,"Refining current domestic transmission lines is essential to implementing a clean grid by 2035, according to recent modeling studies reviewed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Benefits include lower energy costs for residential and commercial consumers, and a green grid is more resilient to extreme weather, which is the new normal given the reality of climate change. 
Despite these benefits, current siting and permitting processes are slow. This equates to delays in the construction and improvement of electric transmission infrastructure. However, the federal government and DOE proposed a new rule that might help ethically meet the country’s electric demands – on schedule. 
In May of this year, nine federal agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) allowing the DOE to coordinate federal reviews and authorizations related to building or renovating a clean energy transmission grid. The document authorizes the acceleration of current approval processes related to construction. Moreover, it considers the necessity of protecting the environment and working with local communities throughout each project’s building or renovation phase. 
The DOE established the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program (CITAP) to regulate acceleration and collaboration. The scheme is meant to streamline the approval and construction of transmission grids by suggesting a time-boxed approach to the research collaboration building and renovation phase. 
To begin, all developers must fill out an Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) to participate in the CITAP Program. Doing so allows contractors to gather the appropriate information and approvals to complete a project. The process also enables developers to spot siting constraints and opportunities early. It encourages them to work with local stakeholders to draft and include solutions. These efforts are recorded in a Public Engagement Plan (PEP), which developers must have in their applications. The document outlines how they will collaborate with tribes local communities and other stakeholders like researchers throughout the project. 
DOE suggests the IIP process will help to streamline permitting by requiring developers to collect all the necessary information federal authorities need to approve a transmission project upfront. Once an application is submitted, the DOE and relevant federal agencies have 30 days to approve a proposal. 
Developments that get the go-ahead must then submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). These two documents initiate a research and planning phase involving government agencies to ensure the project complies with regulations like the Endangered Species Act (ESA) National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) or Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). 
DOE’s proposed schedule suggests the IIP NOI and EIS process would take about four months. Once this is completed, the DOE, in collaboration with the developer and federal agencies, will determine a project-specific schedule that limits coordination preparation construction and alterations to 27 months. 
The DOE states the standard schedule is a draft and subject to revision. It emphasizes the importance of tribal governments sharing comments on the impacts of the proposed approaches on tribal communities. All stakeholders have until October 2 to submit their feedback via the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. DOE will host a public webinar on August 23 where attendees can gain more clarification on the suggested regulations.
It’s important to note that the CITAP Program will not replace state or local government permitting or siting authorities. It also does not override federal requirements. The program only seeks to streamline coordination and collaboration between communities developers and departments to hasten government decision-making.
