As for other types of renewables, the Canadian industry is growing and shows great promise.
At least that’s the conclusion that can be drawn from a new report by the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA). The group said that Canada’s wind, solar, and energy storage sectors ended 2020 in a strong position, with the industry ready to expand significantly in 2021.
“Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, Canada ended 2020 with a total wind capacity of 13,588 MW, a total solar capacity of roughly 3,000 MW, significant growth in energy storage, and a positive forecast for 2021,” said Robert Hornung, president and CEO of CanREA.
As in the United States, the Covid-19 pandemic caused supply-chain disruptions, energy-demand fluctuations, and workforce health concerns in Canada–all of which temporarily delayed many renewable energy projects from coming online in 2020.
According to CanREA, Canada installed at least 70 MW of solar PV capacity in 2020, along with an additional 166 MW of wind power.
The group said wind and solar generation now meet 40% of electricity demand in Prince Edward Island and 18% in Nova Scotia, with the contribution approaching 10% in other Canadian provinces.
According to CanREA, wind and solar energy have contributed more to Canada’s installed electricity-generating capacity than any other technologies over the last decade. Much of this growth is attributable to significant cost reductions caused by technological advances.
CanREA said the energy storage market is also growing. Canada currently has a total utility-scale energy storage capacity of more than 130 MW/250 MWh, 10% of which came online in 2020 alone.
With 240 MW of large-scale solar projects and 745 MW of wind projects currently under construction across Canada, CanREA said it anticipates significant expansion in the country’s non-hydro renewables industry over the next year.
Overall, the group expects close to 2 GW of wind and solar projects to be installed or begin construction in 2021.
The group also forecast continued expansion for utility-scale, residential, and commercial storage, thanks to cost decreases and emerging regulatory and market frameworks.
CanREA noted that electricity system operators and regulators are actively working on options for integrating storage on the grid, including a review of market rules in Ontario and Alberta, and pilot projects in Quebec and Saskatchewan.
Despite the year’s challenges, CanREA said 2020 offered new opportunities from multiple levels of government. The Province of Saskatchewan and the City of Edmonton launched procurement processes, with Saskatchewan also seeking feedback on interest in battery storage projects in the province. And the federal government and the Province of Quebec both announced their intention to procure low-cost, non-emitting electricity in the future.
(In January, the federal government opened a request for proposals to buy new clean electricity in the province of Alberta to power federal operations there.)
CanREA said the year ended on a positive note, with the federal government announcing a new climate plan in December and Quebec presenting its new electrification strategy in November. Wind, solar, and storage are expected to play a central role in meeting the greenhouse-gas emissions targets.
Throughout 2020, renewable energy delivered for companies looking to reduce their carbon footprints. For example, RBC signed a contract to procure green energy directly from BluEarth Renewables and Bullfrog Power, Capital Power announced new wind and solar projects intended to reduce their overall emissions.
“Customer interest in wind and solar energy is increasing, and there is a lot of optimism within the industry,” said Hornung. “We are ready to deliver the renewable energy solutions that will be central to Canada’s energy transition, with benefits for all Canadians.”

The 240-acre plot, located in Houston’s Sunnyside neighborhood, has been approved for lease to a Wolfe Energy subsidiary by Mayor Sylvester Turner and the city council. Each acre will be leased for $1.00/year.
The installation, which has been named the Sunnyside Solar Project, will be 50 MW in capacity once it reaches operation, which is currently anticipated for the end of 2022.
Mayor Turner’s office has indicated that a portion of the project will be set aside to serve as a community solar installation, though it has not yet been revealed how much capacity will be dedicated to community solar.
Alongside being the nation’s largest urban solar project, the City of Houston is also touting Sunnyside as the nation’s largest brownfield solar installation. Brownfield refers to projects developed on land that housed previous development and has since been environmentally contaminated.
Because of this contamination, the project’s developers, Sunnyside Energy LLC, will be required to complete a site remediation before construction can begin.
Sunnyside Energy is a partnership among EDF Renewables, MP2 Energy, and Wolfe Energy to supply electricity to the Houston-area power grid through MP2 Energy and CenterPoint, meaning the solar-generated power would be distributed across the metropolitan region.
As part of the agreement between the city and Sunnyside Energy, Sunnyside will provide power discounts to low-income residents in the neighborhood, and will train and employ local workers to construct the project.
Sunnyside’s procurement came as a product of the city’s Climate Action Plan and Complete Communities Initiative. Houston’s Climate Action Plan calls on the city to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions annually and establish a pathway to meet the Paris Agreement goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.
The Complete Communities Initiative is aimed at ensuring that all city residents have equal access to quality services and amenities and includes sustainability, resilience, and economic development components, hence the requirements for Sunnyside Energy to employ local workers and provide power discounts to Sunnyside residents.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/21/navisun-acquires-4-5-mw-community-solar-project/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW JERSEY,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 21, 2021",Navisun acquires 4.5 MW community solar project,"Developers across the United States are increasingly installing solar on former brownfields and landfills, helping to put otherwise difficult real estate to good use.
In New Jersey, for example, Navisun LLC acquired a 4.5 MW community solar project that is being built at the City of Linden’s closed landfill.
CS Energy developed and is constructing the Linden Hawk Rise Solar Project. It is slated to be online by the end of the second quarter.
Navisun, a Massachusetts-based owner-operator of distributed and mid-scale solar, said the project will convert the landfill into a productive solar farm. Once finished, the project is expected to serve about 1,000 residential subscribers.
Linden Mayor Derek Armstead called the project a “tremendous win for our community.”
The project is part of New Jersey’s Year 1 Community Solar Energy Pilot Program, designed to allow utility customers to support and benefit from solar energy without installing it themselves. To expand equitable access to clean electricity, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities encouraged developers to make the program readily available to low- and moderate-income customers.
In October 2020,  state regulators approved a second round for the community solar program, doubling the available development capacity to 150 MW for 2021.

For the next 12 months, utility customers on Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii islands installing new systems on circuits where the new program is available will not need the standard approvals before activating their systems.
Instead, the approval process, one which typically takes several weeks or months for each step to be completed, can now be handled after the system is built and turned on, substantially reducing the wait for many new solar customers.
Customers looking to install new systems still must start by applying for a county building permit, make sure their proposed system conforms to the PUC’s Rule 14H, and ensure their planned installation is no larger than 25 kW in capacity, with other technical requirements.
According to Hawaiian Electric, the program has been enacted in order to support customers and the state’s solar industry during the economic downturn that has come with the Covid-19 pandemic.
“We are committed to help our customers save money and help invigorate Hawaii’s economy as we get through the pandemic and move aggressively to 100 percent renewable electricity,” said Lani Shinsato, customer energy resources co-director at Hawaiian Electric.
Hawaiian Electric noted that if Quick Connect proves to be successful, the program could be extended beyond just one year.
Customers and contractors can find detailed specifications for eligibility at hawaiianelectric.com/quickconnect.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/21/sunrise-brief-solar-is-cheapest-based-on-price-alone-wood-mac-reports/,"EV,MARKETS,POLICY,RACKING,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 21, 2021","Sunrise brief: Solar is cheapest based on price alone, Wood Mac reports","The cost of solar power has dropped 90% over the last two decades and will likely fall another 15% to 25% in the decade to come, says Wood Mackenzie in a new report.
By 2030, solar will become the cheapest source of new power in every U.S. state, plus Canada, China, and 14 other nations.
The report, Total eclipse: How falling costs will secure solar’s dominance in power, calls the solar power industry “highly investible” due to its growing ability to meet both economic and policy goals.
Wood Mackenzie research director Ravi Manghani said: “As the world strives to recover from the economic slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and simultaneously meet the climate and environmental goals of the Paris Agreement, solar is uniquely placed to advance efforts towards a low-carbon, sustainable future.”
Solar is already the cheapest form of new electricity generation in 16 states, plus Spain, Italy, and India, the report said. Even with the Covid-19 pandemic, global installations exceeded 115 GW in 2020, compared to 1.5 GW in 2006.
While the growth of solar to this scale was driven partially by government subsidies and environmental goals, solar generation is now attractive based on price alone. In the next decade, Wood Mackenzie expects more cost reduction to be driven by growth and development in several technologies:
Bifacial panels. New solar cell technology allows both sides of a panel to generate as much as 15% more power.
Larger solar modules. This allows more of each panel’s surface area to generate power, leading to big gains in output.
Trackers. More solar installations include motorized systems that track the sun’s movement and change the alignment of the panels to increase energy capture.
Wood Mackenzie said that its outlook only factored in technological improvements that are already well into the commercial development pipeline. The projections do not assume any breakthroughs in next-generation solar technology or other innovations, which could provide further upside to the outlook.
Operating costs are expected to drop as well over the next decade, the report said. Technologies that are already widely in use by the wind power industry, such as using drones and thermal imaging for inspections, will make operations more efficient, as will developing technologies such as artificial intelligence.
The sector is not without risk for some players, Wood Mackenzie said. For example, as costs drop and installed solar capacity increases, wholesale prices may decline as well, reducing profitability. Even so, falling prices should allow solar to displace coal and other more expensive technologies and increase its markets share.
The report said that battery storage is becoming a larger part of the solar development equation as peak-price hours for electricity still coincide with solar generation hours in most markets. Both developers and utilities are preparing for potential changes in demand by including storage in their plans.
Freedom Forever, one of the largest residential solar installers, has selected Sunrun as its primary solar + battery as-a-service provider for the next three years. The company will leverage Sunrun’s home solar and battery service offering, as well as its favorably branding among consumers.
Sunrun has been part of Freedom Forever’s growth over the last three years. The business has expanded from seven states at the beginning of 2020 to 20 states by the end of the year.
The expanded partnership with Freedom Forever is intended to expand Sunrun’s footprint in existing markets, with plans to enter new markets.
Penn State engineers are developing lithium iron phosphate batteries that they say combine a range of 250 miles with the ability to charge in 10 minutes.
“We developed a pretty clever battery for mass-market electric vehicles with cost parity with combustion engine vehicles,” said Chao-Yang Wang, director of the Electrochemical Engine Center at Penn State. “There is no more range anxiety and this battery is affordable.”

The researchers say that the battery should be good for 2 million miles in its lifetime.
They report in Nature Energy that the key to long-life and rapid recharging is the battery’s ability to quickly heat up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, for charge and discharge, and then cool down when the battery is not working. The fast charge allows developers to downsize the battery without incurring range anxiety.
The battery uses a self-heating approach previously developed in Wang’s center. The self-heating battery uses a thin nickel foil with one end attached to the negative terminal and the other extending outside the cell to create a third terminal. Once electrons flow it rapidly heats up the nickel foil through resistance heating and warm the inside of the battery. When the battery’s internal temperature is 140 degrees F, the switch opens and the battery is ready for rapid charge or discharge.
Wang’s team suggest that by using this self-heating method, they can use low-cost materials for the battery’s cathode and anode and a safe, low-voltage electrolyte. The cathode is thermally stable, lithium iron phosphate, which does not contain any of the expensive and critical materials like cobalt. The anode is made of very large particle graphite, a safe, light and inexpensive material.
According to Wang, these smaller batteries can produce a large amount of power upon heating — 40 kWh and 300 kW of power. An electric vehicle with this battery could go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3 seconds and, he said, would drive like a Porsche.
