https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/24/californias-rate-inequality-is-likely-to-worsen-as-energy-transition-advances/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",California’s rate inequality is likely to worsen as energy transition advances,"Residential customers of California’s three largest investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are being charged as much as two to three times more for electricity than it actually costs to produce and distribute, an inequality that impacts low- and moderate-income people the most.
That was one of the findings of Designing Electricity Rates for an Equitable Energy Transition, a new report from Next 10 and the Energy Institute at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. The report findings were slated to be presented at a hearing before state utility regulators on Feb. 24.
The report cited Pacific Gas & Electric as charging rates 80% higher than the national average.

Data from the report revealed that the state’s three largest IOUs—Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric—charge residential electricity customers much higher prices than are paid in most of the country.
It cited Pacific Gas & Electric for charging rates 80% higher than the national average.
Compounding concerns is the inequity of how the higher costs are distributed. The report said that as wealthier households adopt rooftop solar, the remaining fixed costs are distributed by IOUs across a smaller volume of kilowatt-hours delivered. This, in turn, raises the costs still higher for remaining, generally lower-income customers.
The report outlined potential changes in how utility fixed costs, as well as environmental and low-income program costs, are recovered. It recommended raising revenue from sales or income taxes as a more progressive approach than the current system. It said such a shift would help ensure that higher-income households pay a higher share of the costs.
Wildfire mitigation over the next two years is expected to add still more to the cost of electricity in the Golden State.

Such an income-based fixed charge would be based on three criteria, the report said: 1) setting prices as close to cost as possible, 2) recovering the full system cost, and 3) and distributing the burden of cost recovery fairly.
The report also warned that California electricity rates are projected to rise due to wildfire-related costs. Earlier in February, the state’s IOUs unveiled a plan to spend $15 billion over the next two years to prevent wildfire ignitions. The researchers found that while wildfire prevention programs are likely to be a major near-term price driver, “a significant lack of transparent data” exists on the total costs and how they will be passed on.

Dominion, which serves more than 750,000 customers in the state, announced the proposed retirements in its updated long-term energy plan, though that plan does also include 1 GW of new natural gas power.
“While we’re very glad there’s an end in sight for Dominion Energy’s coal in South Carolina, adding fracked gas is a short-sighted move that means communities in Orangeburg County won’t get the safe, clean energy they deserve,” said Will Harlan, senior representative for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign in South Carolina.
As for the coal plants, Dominion’s modified energy plan said the utility is seeking to retire three coal-fired units at Wateree and Williams Stations in 2028, as well as convert the Cope Station from coal to natural gas by 2030.
Not to be overlooked, the 2 GW of solar capacity and 900 MW of planned storage additions will be a major boon to South Carolina’s renewable portfolio, even though they may be a ways off.
The state currently has a total installed solar capacity of just over 1.7 GW, which is good for 12th in the nation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). However, South Carolina is only projected by SEIA to add 1.4 GW over the next 5 years, making it 23rd in the nation over that span.
The state has begun to embrace solar more in recent years, but consistent growth has been hard to come by.
The resource plan the the utility will be moving forward with, Plan 8, forecasts 50 MW of solar additions in 2026 and 2027, followed by none in 2028 and 2029, before moving to 100 MW annually until 2048.
Both the Wateree and Williams Stations were in immediate need of retrofits in order to meet federal rules meant to protect waterways from mercury, arsenic and other pollutants. When regulators shot down Dominion’s initial integrated resource plan, they informed the utility that it would have to undertake an extensive retirement analysis before it could direct any ratepayer funds toward retrofitting the plants.
In a release commending Dominion’s plan to ditch coal, Sierra Club noted that all three plants are located in majority Black communities and have for years been releasing toxic pollution into local waterways, which the group claims can and has taken a significant toll on the public health of the communities.
“The closure of these plants will be a huge health benefit for families and children who have been forced to live, work, and play in the shadow of coal-burning plants that pollute their air and the rivers where they boat and fish,” said Harlan. “These communities have fought long and hard for protections that others take for granted, and now there’s hope for real change.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/24/two-ways-to-improve-low-income-community-solar-programs/,"COMMUNITY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",Two ways to improve low-income community solar programs,"Low- and moderate-income (LMI) families are among those most likely to benefit from the savings of community solar programs. However, as advocacy group Vote Solar points out, state-run program implementation for LMI customers can be uneven and more complicated than necessary.
To help remove barriers for LMI customers, Vote Solar’s Access & Equity Advisory Committee (AEAC) has released a policy brief outlining two key initiatives for more successful solar expansion programs: 1) automatic qualification in community solar programs, and 2) grant support for more robust community engagement.
The AEAC includes energy leaders from Vote Solar and a rotating list of partner organizations, including nonprofit solar installer GRID Alternatives, the NAACP, and Nexamp.
Automatic qualification means that eligible LMI households would automatically be included in community solar programs through qualification for another government program, such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
The AEAC said it found that one of the biggest barriers to implementing LMI community solar programs is a cumbersome, lengthy, and often humiliating income-verification process in which both the state and the solar vendor are involved. The committee said streamlining this process is critical to enrolling more families in community solar programs.
In Massachusetts, for example, utility National Grid recently proposed a new initiative to circumvent credit checks and expand community solar access for its LMI customers.
The AEAC also said localized community engagement is required to build trust and address the unique needs of the community. Currently, under most state-run programs, if a vendor receives money from the state to deploy solar for LMI communities, that money is for the solar projects only and doesn’t cover the cost of engaging with customers.
The AEAC said state and federal funding programs should include specific allocations for community outreach and education about LMI solar programs and approved vendors, allowing vendors to hire dedicated community outreach staff, engage with community organizations to create a customer acquisition pipeline, and market their product effectively.
Olivia Nedd, Vote Solar’s policy director of the access and equity program, called on policymakers and the solar industry to “think critically about solutions like these to ensure low-wealth communities do not get left behind in the clean energy transition.”
The full policy brief is available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/24/crossed-wires-at-a-utility-jolt-maines-solar-developers/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,MAINE",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",Crossed wires at a utility jolt Maine’s solar developers,"Interconnecting millions of rooftop and small-scale power plants across the nation is proving to be more complex than dealing with the few thousand that existed prior to the rise of distributed wind and solar.
Events in Maine over the course of just two weeks illustrate the kinds of growing pains that can impact a new solar power market and startle solar developers.
As reported on by local Maine writer, Tux Turkel, Central Maine Power (CMP) sent letters to dozens of solar developers announcing that it needed to dramatically raise interconnection costs for projects that had already paid those costs. Some of the developers who received letters reportedly had already built their solar power plants.
Turkel interviewed one company whose $1.4 million worth of power grid upgrades (powerlines, transformers, upgrade substations, and so on) had been paid, and whose interconnection costs were now being increased to cover an emerging “voltage issue” at one of roughly 100 substations impacted by revised cost estimates.
The state’s Renewable Energy Association outlined in a letter the upgrade cost changes that three solar developers received from CMP:
● Developer A – Had signed an IA with anticipated upgrade fees of $100,000. Instead of receiving the countersigned original IA, the developer got a new IA from the utility with an upgrade fee of $1,420,000, plus additional costs to be determined;
● Developer B – Received a notice that six of its projects faced an upgrade, along with additional fees and a longer processing schedule. Five of the projects were already built, with the sixth slated to break ground during the second quarter;
● Developer C – Received a notice that seven of its projects would be impacted: five had already executed IA’s and one was under construction. One project with a signed IA was assessed more than $12 million in upgrade charges for a project less than 2 MW in size.
The uproar led to a call by the state’s governor for a probe, which was launched by state utility regulators.
For its part, CMP responded with a letter rescinding the large interconnection fees. The utility said that its initial upgrade estimates were in the range of $10-$15 million per substation, reflecting the cost of a complete rebuild. It revised most of its estimates to a range of $175,000 to $375,000 for required upgrades. The utility said the new estimates cover upgrades to add transmission-over-voltage protection and tripping of distribution circuit breakers upon detection of an overvoltage condition.
In the end, the drama appears to have been an aberration. CMP executive chairman David Flanagan said that the stratospheric cost estimates were the result of a failure to communicate by midlevel engineers in a new department that has added more than 100 employees over the last 11 months.
Ultimately, the mistake was benign, but solar power professionals worry that such false alarms could have a cooling effect on solar investment in Maine.
Despite the hiccup, clean energy continues to march forward. On Jan. 15, Maine launched its latest request for proposals of procurement seeking 654,775 MWh of clean electricity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/24/these-3-technologies-could-deliver-more-solar-and-wind-to-the-grid/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",These 3 technologies could deliver more solar and wind to the grid,"Three grid-enhancing technologies can boost the utilization of any existing transmission system, according to a study by The Brattle Group.
In Kansas and Oklahoma alone, those technologies could make room for 40 MW more solar and 2.6 GW more wind power by 2025.
The grid-enhancing technologies considered by the report are advanced power flow control, topology optimization, and dynamic line ratings. The technologies are offered by member firms of the WATT Coalition, which provided input to the Brattle study.
As part of its work, Brattle conducted a power flow analysis to determine the wind and solar capacity that could be added in Kansas and Oklahoma, first without the three technologies, and then with them.

Considering the 260 MW of solar projects in those states that have signed interconnection agreements, the grid could accommodate 140 MW of solar by 2025 with the new technologies, versus 100 MW without them. That represents a 40% improvement for solar.
Of the 9.17 GW of wind projects in the two states that also have a signed agreement, the grid could accommodate 5.1 GW with the transmission technologies, or about twice as much as the 2.5 GW possible without them.
Looking just at a scenario with the transmission technologies implemented, the two states could accommodate 54% of the solar projects and 56% of the wind projects with signed interconnection agreements, according to the study’s lead author Bruce Tsuchida.
To describe advanced power flow control, the WATT Coalition first explained that power flow control refers to a set of technologies that redirect power away from overloaded lines and onto underutilized parts of a transmission network. Advanced power flow control accomplishes that task but with hardware having advanced features such as the ability to be quickly deployed, easily scaled, or redeployed as needed.
Topology optimization achieves the same outcome as advanced flow control devices, said the Brattle study, but does so using existing equipment. The optimization technique uses software to identify which transmission line circuit breakers should be switched open or closed to route power flow around congested elements. In this way, said Brattle, it’s like “Waze for the transmission grid.”
The U.S. Department of Energy describes dynamic line ratings by first noting that the maximum power flow capacity on a transmission line is limited by heating considerations. So-called static line ratings are calculated using generally conservative assumptions about the transmission-line’s operating environment, but without considering factors such as wind cooling that allow for greater transmission utilization. Dynamic line rating determines transmission line thermal ratings using improved or real-time data, to help system operators determine the prevailing current-carrying capacity limits of transmission lines.
Brattle prepared the study, “Unlocking the Queue with Grid-Enhancing Technologies,” with input from the WATT Coalition and funding from GridLab, EDF Renewables North America, NextEra Energy Resources, and Duke Energy Renewables.

The company also sought regulatory approval to enter into a power purchase agreement (PPA) for an additional 100 MW of solar energy.
The utility said it plans to enter into an agreement with Capital Dynamics to build the 300 MW solar energy project on 2,500 acres in Indiana’s far southwest corner, near Evansville. Arevon Energy Management and energy company Tenaska are co-developing the project, which would be owned by CenterPoint.
The utility also proposes buying 100 MW of solar power under a 25-year PPA from Clēnera, which is developing a separate project also in southwest Indiana.
The combined 400 MW of solar capacity is intended to support CenterPoint Energy’s goal to cut its operational emissions by 70% by 2035.
The Capital Dynamics project would include more than 730,000 solar panels, and could enter service in 2023.
Duke Energy has started work on the 50 MW Broad River Solar power plant near Charlotte, North Carolina.
The project will be owned and operated by Duke Energy Renewables, a unit of Duke Energy. The project was selected as part of the competitive bidding process established by 2017’s solar legislation in North Carolina.
The power plant will contain more than 170,000 solar panels across approximately 500 acres, and is expected to enter service by the end of 2021.
Under North Carolina’s Competitive Procurement for Renewable Energy, proposed projects must be built where there is a need for energy capacity on the Duke Energy system in North Carolina or South Carolina.
The facility’s design, procurement of inverters, balance of plant systems, and project construction will be performed by Swinerton. Power will be sold through a 20-year power purchase agreement.
Altus Power America is targeting a second quarter completion date for a combined solar plus energy storage system in Massachusetts. The project comprises a 2.9 MW solar system and a 2 MWh battery system. Altus Power said the system is a part of the Massachusetts SMART program.
AC Power submitted nine community solar projects in early February for consideration by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU). If all projects are selected, AC Power’s portfolio would provide 19.49 MW of solar capacity in the Jersey Central Power & Light service territory and 12.04 MW in the Atlantic City Electric service territory, for a total of 31.53 MW of solar power.
Run by the NJBPU, the three-year program will accept more than 225 MW of community solar projects aimed at helping New Jersey reach its goal of generating 100% clean energy by 2050. The program’s second year goal aims to award 150 MW of community solar, doubling the capacity accepted in the first year.
A pair of projects from AC Power were chosen during the first year and are set to break ground this spring. One is 0.83 MW project on part of a closed landfill;  the other is a 1.43 MW project on a former sand and gravel pit. AC Power said it hopes to expand both projects as part of its latest proposed capacity bid. The company has proposed building solar on former landfills and resource extraction sites, including a floating array at a flooded former quarry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/24/an-energy-strategy-worthy-of-texas/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,TEXAS",,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",An energy strategy worthy of Texas,"Texas is no stranger to epic energy events. And Texas has a record of opportunistically meeting energy challenges and coming out even stronger.
The severe weather events of February 2021 should stand to launch another, better chapter in Texas’s energy history. A better energy future for Texas must be just, sustainable, innovative, and smart. Intention must displace opportunism and reaction; value must take precedence over price; and planning must address a growing appreciation of risk.
The analysis of causes (and red herrings) and the shaping of appropriate solutions for the recent Texas electricity crisis will likely continue for many months. Real solutions may take years to design and implement; still, Texas should not waste this crisis.
There seems little dispute about a few key things: First, extreme weather and the challenges it poses to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) will likely recur with greater frequency in a changing climate world. Second, despite a strong reliance on markets, government and regulatory intervention and correction is very much on the table for the future. Third, the hardships were not evenly or equitably distributed. Some customers had options, others did not. In sum, politically and practically, doing nothing is not an option.
“…a simple neat solution does not exist, despite the growing proliferation of soundbite solutions.”

Prices have been low, and the energy-only market plus a regulatory transmission planning and investment initiative has enabled strong growth of utility-scale wind and solar generation. But, despite severe weather events in the recent past–notably in 2011–Texas has largely resisted the imposition of reliability requirements that might constrain the pursuit of lower prices in order to ensure secure electric service for all. And ERCOT famously remains an island in an interconnected national grid.
On the table today is the fundamental question of whether Texas can still afford cheap electricity no matter what it costs—whether the venerated and lightly regulated market will ensure affordable, reliable, secure, and sustainable electric service for all Texans.
Some consensus is emerging, at least, around strategic solutions that merit greater study. And, as with all complex problems, a simple neat solution does not exist, despite the growing proliferation of soundbite solutions.
The first place to start is with articulation and action to secure better goals than just low commodity prices. Electricity is essential to modern life and disruptions due to climate, technical failure, economic forces, or other causes threaten energy security at every level. A market can be a great tool for helping to deliver public benefits, but the priorities of marketers cannot be allowed to subsume or subvert public policy objectives.
<
Government and regulation are not absent in Texas, they are just poorly designed and applied. Legislators should take a hard look at reforming what they ask of and expect from the Public Utility Commission, where I once served, and from the Texas Railroad Commission (which regulates methane gas), and from ERCOT.
Second, despite misleading assertions to the contrary, wind and solar performed pretty much as expected during the severe weather events. There is every reason to believe that Texas’ energy security can be enhanced by increasing, not decreasing, reliance on these resources for the future.
Third, Texas needs to look in more and better places for the tools of energy security. The appeal of large markets is the efficiency and price reduction that flow from liquidity. But creating and maintaining a market environment that maximizes liquidity and favors large generators, as ERCOT has done, overlooks the benefits of right-sized resources sited and scaled to more closely meeting load.
Powerful new analytical tools, like the WIS:dom model developed by Vibrant Clean Energy, have revealed vast overlooked and emergent benefits to be obtained from better coordinated and optimized reliance on distributed generation and distributed storage resources.
I participated in developing the Local Solar Roadmap, one of these latest studies that show that the value of solar and other distributed energy resources scales beautifully to provide grid-wide savings and benefit.

Texas has immense efficiency, demand response, and energy management resources that can be harnessed through regulatory and market mechanisms—preferably both. Texas should make it a policy and development priority to apply the same effort, if not budget, to realize these benefits as it did to standing up the nodal market.
Finally, as a transplanted Texan whose family name goes back to 1750 in that region, I know that Texas pride is often manifest in go-it-alone solutions. But isolationism is not a sound policy when operating in network economies. Texas should take a hard look at increasing the number of interties to other states and even consider full interconnection into the national grid.
Nature teaches us that isolated niche ecosystems are most vulnerable to environmental disruption—so, too, with electric grid networks.
“…isolationism is not a sound policy when operating in network economies.”

Going it alone with the ERCOT market as currently structured and regulated has been tested and found inadequate.
Once Texas had a powerful vision for its energy future. When I co-chaired the Texas Sustainable Energy Development Council, along with Land Commissioner Gary Mauro, way back in 1993, we published a comprehensive roadmap for a different Texas. That effort, in which a wide range of stakeholders participated, offered a compelling vision for Texas’ energy future. We envisioned:
“A Texas responsibly powered by its sustainable energy resource base and serving as a model to others in equitable prosperity, environmental health, advanced technology, innovative government, and respect for future generations.”
Texas deserves, and must secure, nothing less.
