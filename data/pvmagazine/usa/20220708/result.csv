The emissions free generation is likely to come from approximately 17% nuclear, 7-9% solar, 17-19% wind, and 7% hydroelectric.
Unfortunately, we didn’t quite reach 50% this April, though we did reach 45.4%. Year to date, over 10% of the hours of electricity generated in 2022 have been 50% or more emissions free. According to the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Hourly Energy Monitor, the tool’s preliminary numbers suggest that around 43% of the electricity in May was generated by non-fossil sources.
However, both wind and solar generated their all time peak values in April of this year – we ain’t slowin’ down, folks!
According to the EIA, solar photovoltaics generated 4.37% of all electricity from the beginning of the year through the month of April, 2022. This value is 23.7% greater than the same period last year. For the month of April, solar made up 6.03% of all electricity – a monthly record. That’s a growth of 18% over April 2021.
Compared to last year at this time, small scale solar is up 21%.
The EIA projects that solar electricity will deliver 5% of all electricity in 2022, a percent increase over the ~4% of total electricity it generated in 2021. Year to date, electricity demand in 2022 (including distributed generation) is up 4.5% over last year.
The increased solar generation is a result of 23.6 GW of US solar deployments in 2021, a new record. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, 23.6 GW represents 19% more deployed capacity than was deployed in 2020. This volume was large enough that it grew the nation’s solar fleet by over 24%, from 97.7 GWdc of capacity deployed.
This pushed the utility scale solar industry to a record 50 GW of instantaneous generation.
According to SEIA, the first quarter saw 3.6 GWdc of capacity deployed across all project sizes – residential through utility. For the month of April, the EIA notes that 417 MWac of utility scale capacity was deployed across 10 projects.
Deployed capacity in April is trending behind the first quarter of the year – which averaged 738 MWac/month across 30 projects/month, per PV Intel data.
In the United States, the fall and spring months have the lowest electricity demand. This is because there is less heating and cooling demand during these temperate weather conditions. The price of electricity often trends down in this period.
Since wind and solar resources generate electricity without fuels and thus without additional costs, they are almost always up and running. Coal and gas tend to shut down during these seasons, to avoid burning fuel during low priced periods, and to perform necessary repairs and upgrades.
These shutdowns allow wind and solar power to take over larger chunks of generation. However, it’s a complex time of the year when we talk about clean electricity generation.
Nuclear power plants also tend to shut down in spring or fall for annual maintenance. Wind power tapers down off its peaks in February and March. Hydroelectric power, historically, is expected to peak in the springtime as snow melts. However, a 1,000 year drought in the Western USA has been reducing hydroelectric output.
And of course, solar generation naturally increases from winter to the summer solstice peak in June.
Note that the peaks occur in May and April. The major drop in July and August is a result of summertime air conditioning and natural gas capacity ramping up, as wind generation declines. As the summer cools and open window fall days return, we see emissions free generation climb to a second peak, in November. Then, as winter days grow short, and cold, solar falls off and wind begins to pick up. However, overall emissions free electricity declines in winter, as electricity is used to heat.
As we hit 45.41% of emission free electricity in April this year, this author projects that we will come close to hitting 49% in 2023 and clearly break 50% in 2024. This is based on data that the U.S. has added greater than 3.23% of new emissions free kilowatt hours per year since 2014.
In our favor is wind and solar, deploying massive volumes. Hopefully, additional nuclear facilities will not close, especially since nuclear power has been legislated heavy financial incentives. The Southwest USA hydroelectric situation could pose a serious challenge, depending on whether or not it is able to stabilize.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/08/solar-tariffs-are-not-the-answer/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"JULY 8, 2022",Solar tariffs are not the answer,"I have read a lot recently about the solar tariff debate and there are excellent points on both sides of the conversation. However, I cannot help but think that the tariff on solar modules is different. Not because of the intricacies of the solar supply chain, these are real issues as well, but it is different because of the very nature of a solar module and what it is meant to do; provide energy for its usable life. This makes a solar module entirely different from any other manufactured commodity.
If we take a step back for a moment we can imagine what it would look like for us to live in an economy where we had the lowest cost of energy in the world. A lower cost of energy would make our manufacturing economy a global competitor.
Being able to provide the cheapest power to our disadvantaged populations will allow them to have more budget freed up for other essentials. Creating an economy where our energy costs can stay the same regardless of world politics makes us all more secure. It would allow us to be indifferent to what Russia or any other fossil fuel provider wanted to charge us because our fuel costs for solar will always be zero.
One would argue that if our government is interested in the long term success of our manufacturing economy this would be a front and center goal. If we invest our tax dollars in buying down that first cost to get to an even lower cost of energy that would make us even more powerful as a nation and an economy. Even better would be if another country wanted to help subsidize our energy infrastructure and give us those energy modules at a lower cost than it cost to make them. If this all sounds too good to be true, maybe it really isn’t, maybe this is what we are actually fighting against happening right now.
Anyone who has run a solar finance model can tell you that with solar, the first cost is everything. The returns have to be there or else the capital will not flow in to support the construction and operation of the solar asset. Capital is a commodity like any other and to the extent that capital is needed to support solar it needs to have a competitive return. Unlike any other power generator, solar has free fuel; sunlight will never have a cost or any politics associated with it. This is the beauty of solar as a renewable energy source. As a result any cost associated with the first installation of that solar module will dictate its lifetime cost for producing energy. This includes not just the solar module but also sales tax on equipment, permit fees, land use fees, study fees and any other costs that society decides to toss onto the pile.
The Solar Industry understands the need for lower first costs better than anyone and has spent the last 35 years wrangling the costs out of installation labor, racking systems, inverters and balance of systems to get to the lowest possible first cost. The reason is simple, that first cost will determine our cost of energy for the life of that solar asset, the next 20-40 years. In order for solar to be effective for us it needs to be the lowest cost possible. So now developers, contractors, equipment suppliers, system financiers and owner operators all work together in a competitive environment to get to the lowest cost solution possible.
It seems obvious that if there is a place for the government to invest in our country to ensure our future prosperity this would be it. A solar module in the California sun will see about 1,800 sun hours a year. For a 400W module that is 720kWh per year of energy. Assuming some degradation over its life that is still 15,000kWh plus of energy over its lifetime. Unlike a consumable good like a dishwasher or a television, a solar module is actually effectively packaged future consumable energy. Place it in the sun and you get power. So if our goal is to guarantee less expensive energy to everyone over the next 20-40 years, it would make sense for our government to spend its resources here.
If the government was to subsidize a coal or natural gas plant for example, it is different. It is different because those operational assets require fuel to continue to generate the energy that we consume. Those fuels are subject to a dynamic world market. A market that is very sensitive to political unrest, transportation costs, processing costs and environmental issues. Solar on the other hand is only about the up-front costs, there is no cost of fuel. By supporting solar the government is not put in the awkward position of picking a winner in the competition for future fuel suppliers. It seems logical that we should all get behind bringing that first solar cost down to its lowest possible cost.
So when I see all of this debate over the module manufacturing industry and worrying about subsidies I am somewhat befuddled by the original premise that brings us there. If China, or any other country wants to send us over energy that they are subsidizing we should say thank you. It would be different if they were sending us solar modules and then charging us for the sun, but that is not the case. Solar power flips this paradigm around. No one is ever going to be sending us subsidized oil or gas, but sunlight is free. We should just say thank you to anyone wanting to send us subsidized solar. Thank you for pitching in to reduce the cost of energy for America.
Now to be clear, I would also advocate, that in parallel, we build our own solar manufacturing industry here in the US, it is a strategic necessity. But let’s be realistic as to why we are doing so. If we think it is to build returns that would rival a software company or even a highly valued consumer product that is not solar. Ask any of the Chinese solar manufacturers working to achieve a 1 to 2% margin. Solar is not a get rich scheme so we need to figure out where we are you going to get the capital to build this manufacturing capability. And even more importantly we need to figure out who is going to finance the supply chain that would feed such a razor thin margin business. These are not exactly the kind of markets or businesses that are going to attract capital on their own, no one wants to invest in the manufacturing infrastructure to support this kind of low margin business even if it is strategically crucial to our economy.
Energy cost is essentially a tax on every other industry in the country. So, if we are looking to be competitive in the world market we need a lower cost of energy not one that bundles all sorts of stacked margins and costs of social policies into our first cost of solar that becomes the basis for investor returns. Taxes on carbon and other wrong thinking margin stacking agendas piled onto the cost of a basic societal need, energy is exactly what everyone is revolting against. It is like taxing food that is grown in your own garden because you don’t buy it from a commercial farming operation that is providing jobs. Lower energy costs make us all more competitive.
The US should not be placing tariffs on solar cells or modules from China, we should be saying thank you for access to the cheap energy. Then we should use the money that we had allocated to police the ill-conceived and largely ineffective trade war together with the bounty of cheap renewable energy we collected to subsidize our own solar infrastructure here including manufacturing. Then, the US can build it so that when China is done giving subsidized power to the world, the US can ramp up our engine and take part in a competitive market place. All trade wars are not created equally nor should they all be fought the same way.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/08/diversifying-the-solar-supply-chain-necessary-to-meet-climate-goals/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 8, 2022",Diversifying the solar supply chain necessary to meet climate goals,"With solar now mainstream and a contributor to the global energy mix, it’s even more important to increase solar deployment in order to meet energy needs and climate goals. The International Energy Agency for the first time takes a look at the global solar supply chain in the recently released IEA Special Report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains.
The report highlights the role that China plays in the global solar supply chain and how it came to be such a dominant force. For example, China has invested over $50 billion in new solar supply capacity, which is ten times more than Europe, and created more than 300,000 manufacturing jobs across the solar supply chain since 2011. China is home to the top ten suppliers of solar manufacturing equipment, and its share across the entire supply chain exceeds 80%, which is more than double China’s share of global PV demand.

How did China get to be such a dominant force in the solar supply chain? Government policies have focused on solar as a strategic sector, and the result of strong policies and investment is shown in the value of solar exports, which amounted to over $30 billion last year. China’s share is only increasing, according to the report, which estimates that it’s set to rise to over 95% in coming years.
One of the downsides in using solar products manufactured in China has been the amount of carbon used to produce products for use in generating clean energy. A lot of electricity is used in the production of solar products, and 60% of that is generated by coal. However, the report notes that solar manufacturing represented only 0.15% of energy-related global CO2 emissions in 2021. Transporting PV products accounts for only 3% of total PV emissions.
Another downside is the reliance on one single country for almost the entire solar supply chain. Today, China’s Xinjiang province accounts for 40% global polysilicon manufacturing; one out of every seven panels produced worldwide is manufactured by a single facility. The report indicates that this level of concentration represents a considerable vulnerability.
To meet IEA’s Roadmap to Net Zero Emissions by 2050, global production capacity for polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules would need to more than double by 2030 from today’s levels. Diversification of the supply chain will reduce vulnerabilities, as well as offering economic and environmental opportunities, the report contends. It points to supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, and recommends that countries increase resilience by making the investments needed to boost domestic manufacturing. The IEA report estimates that new solar manufacturing facilities along the supply chain could attract $120 billion investment by 2030.
Where and how to invest
Annual investment levels need to double throughout the supply chain, and the report points to critical sectors as being polysilicon, ingots and wafers.  The benefit, in addition to decreasing vulnerability, is jobs and reduced carbon by reducing transportation. The report estimates that the solar industry could create 1 300 manufacturing jobs for each gigawatt of production capacity. Domestic manufacturing can reduce carbon emissions if the local electricity mix is less carbon-intensive than in the exporting country. It also saves on transportation costs when goods are produced closer to where they’re used.
Key to spurring a domestic supply chain is to keep costs low, starting with the cost of electricity. Electricity accounts for over 40% of production costs for polysilicon and nearly 20% for ingots and wafers. In Chinese provinces where polysilicon is produced, the average electricity price of around $75 MWh, or almost 30% below the global industrial price average.
Policies
The IEA report highlights key policy action areas to ensure solar PV security of supply by diversifying manufacturing and raw material supplies. The following are recommendations for diversifying manufacturing and raw material supplies:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/08/virginias-largest-proposed-solar-project-granted-permit/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIRGINIA",TIM SYLVIA,"JULY 8, 2022",Virginia’s largest proposed solar project granted permit,"Officials in Charlotte County, Virginia have voted to grant a conditional use permit to SolUnesco’s planned Randolph Solar project, which is set to be developed on a 21,000-acre footprint across the southern portion of the county.
The Randolph Solar project is planned to clock in at 800 MW, making it the largest solar installation in Virginia, assuming it is constructed, as well as one of the largest projects in the eastern United States. According to SolUnesco, construction of the facility will cost upwards of $800 million, and construction could start in the second quarter of 2025, at the earliest. SolUnesco expects construction of the project to take upwards of two years, and for the efforts to create more than 700 construction jobs.
The permit was granted as part of an agreement between county officials and utility Dominion Energy, which plans to purchase the installation from SolUnesco once it is completed. The agreement was centered around accelerating payments to the country for a previously approved solar project. It is estimated that the Randolph Solar project will generate $311 in revenue for Charlotte County over its 35-year anticipated lifespan.
While the permit has been granted, SolUnesco still needs approval by the State Corporations Commission, which the company is expecting in 2024, after it has performed environmental impact studies, as well as other pre-construction site and viability assessments.
The project, however, could be in for increased scrutiny in these viability assessments, as the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) announced in March a change to how it measures water runoff at solar farms, which will take effect in 2025. The change defines solar panels and the land underneath them as impervious areas, which can sometimes mean defining the dirt under a solar panel as having the same technical water absorption qualities as asphalt or a building.
This additional water would thus have to be managed via tools such as a retention pond or drainage infrastructure. Cost and space that would have been used for solar panels must instead be turned into the aforementioned ponds and infrastructure. The water runoff calculated by the state’s engineers could then be added to tax bills as stormwater fees, depending on each local jurisdiction’s regulations.
One way to mitigate the amount of land that is defined as impervious to water absorption is to store wires above ground in harness systems. This also limits the amount of trenching for said wires that occurs, which disturbs land and is accounted for in water runoff analysis. Some jurisdictions define the impervious area of a solar panel as when it is laid completely flat.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/08/california-solar-net-metering-comment-period-closed-heres-what-leaders-said/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,NET METERING,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 8, 2022","California solar net metering comment period closed, here’s what leaders said","This February, following several weeks of industry outcry, public protest, and political leader involvement, California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 was delayed, and then opened for public comment.
As proposed, NEM 3.0 would have slashed the payments made by utility companies to rooftop solar owners for exporting their excess PV production back to the grid. EQ Analysts said the proposal would lead to a 57% to 71% overall reduction in solar savings across the state.
A revised proposed decision was released after the original was condemned as “a tax on the sun” and a “proposed dystopia.” The revised decision that was sent out this May packaged rooftop solar-slashing provisions in a different form, and it continues to draw the ire of solar-supportive Californians, environmentalists, industry members, political leaders, and those who oppose utility monopoly.
The proposal includes a “glide path”, that would taper down payments for solar customers in increments over a four-year period, eventually reaching the “avoided cost” rate to the utility. The “avoided cost” is a very low rate that does little to support the value that solar owners bring to the grid by exporting local, clean energy to their neighbors.
Under even sharper scrutiny are the “non-bypassable charges” that were added in the revised NEM 3.0. These charges would add a proposed $0.05/kWh to all customers, whether they have solar on their roof or not. The charges would even apply to power generated by the customer’s home solar system, which is unconventional considering the utility does not have ownership over the solar array and did not invest in it.
For context, the average American pays about $0.145/kWh for electricity, so the addition of a $0.05/kWh non-bypassable charge would be a heavy-hitter on Californians’ utility bills.
Public comments
More than two dozen city governments, 43 mayors, and 40 city or county councilmembers from across the state have signed on to support protection of the solar industry and oppose the attempt by utilities to impose a solar tax and slash the net metering credit for California consumers. Their statements can be found below.
The CPUC “threatens to kill rooftop solar in CA with cost-prohibitive fees,” said Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose. “Gavin Newsom, now is not the time to lose California’s clean energy leadership.”
“The CPUC and Governor Newsom should listen to what local leaders across our state clearly want on behalf of their constituents: more local solar and batteries,” said Dave Rosenfeld, Executive Director of the Solar Rights Alliance. “This statewide solar tax would destroy the momentum these California communities have so successfully started.”
“This is the wrong approach when our City and State goals tell us we need to accelerate our clean energy transition,” wrote the City Council of City of Petaluma.
“The proposed decision to increase the costs of solar adoption would jeopardize the installation of future solar projects and penalize those who have already adopted solar energy systems,” South Bay Cities Council of Governments (SBCCOG).
Over one hundred city and county governments have signed on in support of rooftop solar, and hundreds of local businesses and organizations have done the same. The California Public Utilities Commission will review these, and many other comments, before deciding on the proposal, which could occur as soon as late July.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/08/just-one-solar-panel-offsets-the-carbon-emissions-equivalent-of-ten-trees/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 8, 2022",A single solar panel can offset the carbon emissions of 10 trees,"Is it okay to cut down a tree in order to install solar panels? This complex question must consider emissions, as well as the continuity and value of nature. 
An analysis by the European Environmental Commission suggests that a single tree will sequester 22 kg (48.5 lbs) of carbon per year in its physical structure (until the 3 trillion trees die and release themselves as methane). Each acre of mature forest is inhabited by 100 to 400 trees, sequestering 4,850 to 19,400 pounds of carbon per acre each year.

Keep in mind, those aforementioned carbon sequestration rates only apply to full-bodied, mature trees. Brush trees and saplings capture only a fraction of the volume of carbon of large mature trees, which is an important factor to consider when deciding whether or not to fell trees.
When we look at the emissions offsets produced by solar installations, the numbers depend on differences in how each region’s electricity is generated, as well as the time of day that region’s electricity is generated. The hydroelectric power that supplies the majority of upstate New York’s electricity is considerably cleaner than the coal plants that supply roughly half of the electricity to Nebraska, and therefore solar installations in Nebraska offset many times more emissions than equivalent installations located in upstate New York.
According to the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, the nation averaged 0.85 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt-hour generated. Thus, an average 400 W solar panel generating 1.5 kWh per watt per year* will offset 510 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.
*Solar panel output varies greatly by geographic region – panels installed in the South generate more electricity than those in the North.
A single solar panel offsets a carbon emissions equivalent exceeding that of ten mature trees. The average residential solar installation, roughly 7,000 watts, offsets the emissions equivalent of more than 180 trees. A single acre of solar panels with a capacity of 250,000 watts can be expected to offset more carbon emissions than 6,500 trees.
So if the argument were purely based on emissions, a single residential solar installation is already worth more than a few trees. And a single acre of densely populated solar panels offsets at least 16 to 65 times more emissions than a forest of the same size.
Another encouraging fact is that the solar emissions offset value isn’t the final word on a facility’s offset emissions. Solar power facilities that are installed on top of well managed, carbon sequestering land may end up producing additional carbon offsets.

For instance, analysis suggests that an acre of grazed native plants underneath the solar facility may improve soil at a rate of 1 ton of sequestered carbon per year, and that carbon and other nutrients may accumulate for 12 to 15 years before the soil is fully saturated. 
Researchers who modeled prairie grasses in the upper midwest United States, see that that native grasses planted as part of 10 GW of solar generation capacity would sequester 129.3 tons of carbon per hectare; that is 65% and 35% greater than either an agriculture or a solar-turfgrass scenario, respectively.
So while it is true that we need large swatches of interconnected, undisturbed nature to have a healthy environment that supports human life over the coming millennium, it is also true that cutting down some trees, in specific situations, provides a net benefit from an emissions reduction perspective.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/08/canadian-solar-sells-two-australian-solar-farms-to-us-interests/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 8, 2022",Canadian Solar sells two Australian solar farms to US interests,"From pv magazine Australia
Solar module maker and project developer Canadian Solar announced it has completed the sale of the 150 MW Suntop and the 110 MW Gunnedah solar farms in regional New South Wales (NSW) to CalEnergy Resources, a subsidiary of United Kingdom-based electrical distribution company Northern Powergrid Holdings which is in turn owned by Berkshire Hathaway.
The Suntop Solar Farm, near Wellington in central northern NSW, and the Gunnedah Solar Farm, west of Tamworth in the state’s north-west, were acquired by Canadian Solar in 2018 as part of a deal with Netherlands-based renewables developer Photon Energy.
Canadian Solar said both solar farms, which have a combined capacity of 345 MW(dc), have reached substantial completion and are expected to generate more than 700,000 MWh a year, avoiding more than 450,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions annually.
The Gunnedah Solar Farm was among Australia’s top performing utility scale solar assets in June with data from Rystad Energy indicating it was the best performing solar farm in NSW.
Canadian Solar said both the Gunnedah and Suntop projects are underwritten by long-term offtake agreements with Amazon, one of the largest multinational technology companies in the world. The United States-headquartered multinational signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) in 2020 to buy a combined 165 MW of output from the two facilities.
In addition to the sale of the projects, Canadian Solar said it has entered into a multi-year development services agreement with CalEnergy, owned by US investment titan Warren Buffet, that provides a framework for the companies to work together to build out Canadian Solar’s growing renewable energy pipeline in Australia.
“We are delighted to work with CalEnergy in Australia to grow their renewable energy portfolio,” Canadian Solar chairman and chief executive officer Shawn Qu said in a statement. “The sale of these projects in NSW paves the way for a strong collaboration between our respective companies.
“In Australia, we have now brought seven development projects to NTP (notice-to-proceed) and beyond and continue to develop and grow our multi-GW solar and storage pipeline. I look forward to continuing to contribute to Australia’s decarbonization and renewable energy growth ambitions.”
Canadian Solar has a pipeline of projects totalling approximately 1.2 GWp and Qu said he intends to grow the company’s solar projects and solar module supply businesses in Australia, while expanding into other C&I sectors in the region.
“We see a bright future ahead as Australia continues to expand its renewable energy market,” he said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/08/50-states-of-solar-incentives-delaware/,"INSTALLATIONS,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,DELAWARE",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 8, 2022",50 States of Solar Incentives: Delaware,"The pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives now takes us to the South-Atlantic region, with the first stop in Delaware, the second smallest state in the nation. While it is the sixth least populated state, it is also the sixth most densely populated state. Delaware is home to the Institute of Energy Conversion at the University of Delaware, founded in 1972 and believed to be the oldest continuously operating solar research institute in the world.
Delaware is currently ranked 41st in solar installations in the country, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. That’s down from 37th in 2021. Less than 5% of the state’s electricity is derived from solar, and SEIA’s growth projection is for only 341 MW installed in the next five years, dropping the state further to 44th.

Last year the Governor signed a bill boosting the state’s renewable portfolio standard to 40% by 2035, with 10% required to come from solar. When the bill passed, the Sierra Club welcomed the increased RPS, but the group argued the new 40% target was too low and left Delaware “behind virtually every state in the region,” most of which have targets 50% or higher.
To meet the new RPS, two Delaware utilities are offering incentives for customers to add solar. Delmarva Power offers a cash rebate of $0.70 per watt of solar generating capacity installed up to 50 kW, to a maximum of $6,000. Delaware Electric Cooperative offers customers $0.50/W of solar power installed (up to 5 kW), and $0.20/W for any additional solar capacity.
Net metering
The state currently has some strong solar incentives in place, in addition to the federal investment tax credit of 26% for the cost of equipment installed. Delaware’s net metering law allows third-party solar financing and offers a full retail rate for net metered electricity, meaning that homeowners receive the same rate for their excess solar-generated electricity that homeowners pay the utility for grid-supplied power.
Community solar
Community solar has been approved in Delaware since 2010, but a bill signed into law in September 2021, expands access to community solar projects. SB 2 increases the maximum size of systems to 4 MW, requires that each system owner to certify that at least 15% of its customers are low-income, eliminates the requirement that all customers be on the same distribution feeder, and more.
Low- to moderate-income programs
In addition to the requirement for low-income customers to have access to community solar, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) recently announced the launch of a two-year pilot program for low- to moderate-income households, offering free solar panels or cost assistance, depending on eligibility. Low-income households must first apply for installation services through the DNREC’s Weatherization Assistance Program, a cost-free program that improves residential energy efficiency through weatherproofing and other home improvements. Homes that qualify can receive a free solar installation of up to 4.0 kW. Moderate-income households can receive a solar installation 70% covered by the assistance program, and 30% is paid by the homeowner, for systems up to 6.0 kW in capacity. 
A complete list of solar incentives available to Delaware residents can be found here.
Notable installations
Delaware’s largest solar installation is the 15 MW Milford Solar Farm. Commissioned in 2012, it generates 21,000 MWh of electricity or enough to power 9,000 households, offsetting 12,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) a year. The project is owned by PSEG Solar Source and the electricity is sold to Delaware Municipal Electric under a 20-year power purchase agreement. The project includes 30 ABB inverters and 62,000 Canadian Solar modules on fixed-tilt racking systems. Juwi solar is the contractor and provides EPC services.
The longstanding Milford project is about to be eclipsed by two much larger installations: the 114 MW Cedar Creek Solar Project in Townsend and the 50 MW Raceway Solar Project in Harrington. Both are currently under construction by Freepoint Solar.
Last time, the pv magazine tour of the 50 states of solar took us to neighboring New  York, and next we will continue to travel through the South-Atlantic region.
