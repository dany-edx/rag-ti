The 742-panel project will occupy 36,000 square feet of rooftop space, producing an estimated 447,667 kWh in its first year of operations. This is estimated to offset 317 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually for the food provider.
SunOpta made other energy efficiency and sustainability upgrades to its building, including adding nearly 13,000 square feet of renewable bamboo flooring, 920 LED light fixtures, 630 plantings, six indoor trees, a living plant wall to welcome nature into the building and six skylights, five outdoor garden planters for employees to grow organic produce and four electric vehicle charging stations.
“As a producer of plant-based food and beverages, sustainability is at the heart of who we are,” said Joe Ennen, chief executive officer of SunOpta.
The company has a strategy to reduce its electricity use by 40%, natural gas use by 30%, and water consumption by 25% by 2028. Electricity usage in its U.S. and Canada plant facilities has already been reduced by 32% since its baseline year of 2019. The company is also pursuing zero-waste-to-landfill at its manufacturing facilities. Six of its facilities have reached this status, with two more pending third-party verification.
The output of SunOpta’s new solar array is roughly equivalent to powering 40 homes for a year.
“Solar is a triple win for us: A win for the environment, a win for the community as we use fewer public utilities and a win for the business, as solar delivers long-term cost savings. As we drive sales growth towards $2 billion by 2030, it’s important we do so as sustainably as possible, and our recent investment in solar is one of many ESG proof points.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/21/array-technologies-to-secure-domestically-made-steel-from-new-mill-in-texas/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,TEXAS",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 21, 2023",Array Technologies to secure domestically made steel from new mill in Texas  ,"Array Technologies, a U.S.-based provider of trackers for utility-scale solar energy projects, entered into an agreement with Lock Joint Tube, a manufacturer of mechanical and structural-grade steel tubing, to secure supply from a new steel mill in Texas. Lock Joint Tube is a supplier of steel tubing for solar panels and also provides torque tubing for tracker systems or solar tracker tube. The mill is dedicated to manufacturing utility-scale solar tubing. 
Lock Joint Tube is headquartered in Temple, Texas, also the location of the new mill. Using locally sourced steel in the production of solar tubing is in response to domestic content requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Lock Joint Tube also produces steel tubing for Array at a torque tube mill in South Bend, Indiana.   
“Lock Joint Tube’s newest mill will provide Array with domestic tubing under the IRA, which our customers are demanding in this high-growth market for utility-scale solar,” said Kevin Hostetler, chief executive officer at Array Technologies. “This investment in American manufacturing will provide jobs aligned with the renewable energy market to the local community, boost the integrity of the domestic solar supply chain, and support Array’s continued expansion in the U.S., including in Texas and throughout the central U.S.” 
Partnering with established steel suppliers enables Array to secure products on a regional basis to its customers and mitigate supply chain challenges. Array was one manufacturer serving the solar market that released strong guidance in Q4 2022, a time when others in the industry were struggling with supply chain issues.
ROTH Capital Partners noted that the strong guidance may have been a result of a strong relationship between Array Technologies and First Solar, a U.S.-based manufacturer of thin-film CdTe solar panels. ROTH speculated that Array may be paired with a majority or a substantial amount of the 9 GW module delivery that was expected from First Solar last year.
According to Array, its collaboration with Lock Joint Tube will create new manufacturing jobs and use automation technology for optimal efficiency in production.

Nuvola Technology has unveiled its patented direct deposition separator technology, which could replace conventional film separators and deliver incremental improvements in safety and performance.
The SafeCoat Direct Deposition Separator material is the first product launched by the Los Angeles-based startup, formerly known as Millibatt. Under its previous name, the venture-funded company focused on small, rechargeable, high-density batteries for wearables, biomedical uses, and Internet of Things sensor applications.
Nuvola said that it has been selected as one of 10 winners in LG Energy Solution’s annual 2022 Battery Challenge. The competition brought together more than 100 companies with new battery technologies and business models.
SafeCoat is described as a chemistry-agnostic, drop-in solution for lithium-ion batteries compatible with mainstream lithium-ion manufacturing techniques. The porous polymer coating sprayed directly on the entire electrode surface encapsulates and protects them from a thermal runaway and a potential fire.
According to Nuvola, the battery system’s weak point are thousands of tissue-paper thin folded sheets of a porous plastic membrane that keep electrodes apart and make the battery prone to manufacturing errors and failure.
“During the battery assembly process, a single sheet separator can become damaged, creating an undetectable wrinkle, misalignment, misfolding, or even a tiny tear allowing the electrodes to come in contact. This may cause a fire – days, months, or years later,” said the company.
In addition to improving safety, Safe Coat is said to increase the active battery material volume, improving the energy density by up to 20%. Decreasing the thickness of the separator from the plastic film separator’s 20µm to SafeCoat’s 5 µm layer leaves more room for lithium ions in the same physical space.
According to the company, the Nuvola SafeCoat product is now under evaluation by several major battery producers and car manufacturers. It expect products using the technology to hit the market in 2025.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/21/tesla-solar-down-38-energy-storage-up-222-in-q2/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 21, 2023","Tesla solar down 38%, energy storage up 222% in Q2","The Tesla Energy business unit is shifting focus, with Q2 year-over-year solar deployments down 38%, and energy storage deployments up 222%. 
Tesla posted these results in its Q2, 2023 earnings call. The company reported total generation and storage revenues increasing 74% year-over-year to $1.509 billion, which is 6.1% of Tesla’s total revenue. 
In Q2, it deployed 66 MW of solar and 3.65 GWh of energy storage, with average duration of a Powerwall rated for a duration of about three hours. Year-to-date, Tesla energy storage deployments are 7.54 GWh, up 281% year-over-year. 
Tesla’s battery business is set to grow further as the company is making progress on its first California-based Megapack factory, slated to produce 40 GWh of grid-scale stationary batteries per year when complete. The company also recently announced it plans to start building a new Shanghai-based Megapack factory in the third quarter of 2023, with operations to commence in the second quarter of 2024. The factory will potentially add another 40 GWh of manufacturing capacity. 
(Read: “Tesla Master Plan projects 3 TW of solar and 6.5 TWh of storage in U.S.”) 
Tesla’s slump in solar installations may be a sign of a sluggish residential solar market. The company said the dip in solar sales was predominantly due to a high interest rate environment that is postponing customer purchases industry-wide. Deployments were relatively flat quarter-to-quarter this year. 
Solar deployments slowed to 66 MW this quarter, down from a hot Q2 of 106 MW in 2022. For the first half of this year, deployments total 133 MW versus 154 MW last year. Tesla’s solar division has been slipping in share, dropping considerably from its peak quarter of 176 MW in Q2 2017. 
For Tesla’s total business, the company delivered just under $25 billion in revenues, reaching an earnings per share of $0.91. Gross margins are down slightly to 18.2%, down from 19.3% in the previous quarter. The company posted an operating margin of 9.6% and added about $700 million in cash and investments, which now totals over $23 billion.
“We are focusing on cost reduction, new product development that will enable future growth, investments in R&D, better vehicle financing options, continuous product improvement and generation of free cash flow,” said the earnings report. “The challenges of these uncertain times are not over, but we believe we have the right ingredients for the long-term success of the business through a variety of high potential projects.”
Tesla stock fell about 10% on the day following the Q2 earnings call. Full earnings reports can be found here.

The two will also collaborate on the development of new generations of high-efficiency HJT/perovskite solar cell architectures.
Revkor, headquartered in Miami, Fla., is involved in multiple aspects of the solar energy industry, from solar cell and module manufacturing to EPC services and electrical contracting. H2 Gemini, based in Switzerland and Germany, specializes in making the equipment to manufacture high efficiency solar cells. The company was founded and is lead by two former executives from Meyer-Burger and Schmid-Group
The partners already have a 1 million square foot production plant under construction in Salt Lake City, Utah, where production is planned to begin in Q2 2024. The first phase will focus on building a 5 GW annual production facility, aiming for production to begin by the second quarter of 2024. The plan for phase two is to expand the capacity to a total of 20 GW by 2026.
Also planned is the establishment of a research center, which will be a second 1 million square foot facility within the manufacturing complex. The partnership reports that its goal is to use its Utah-based manufacturing and research center to drive advancements in perovskite as well as graphene, plastic recycling and new tire vulcanization methods.
Perovskites hold promise for their low cost to produce, and their thinness allows them to be deposited on most surfaces. While challenges remain with the stability and longevity of perovskites, new efficiency records have been achieved month after month in recent years, and they are edging closer to large-scale manufacturability. The major U.S. thin film solar manufacturer, First Solar, recently announced that it is buying Swedish perovskite manufacturer Evolar AB in a bid to accelerate its efforts to develop tandem PV technology.
In the Utah partnership, H2 Gemini’s role is to provide the HJT/perovskite manufacturing equipment as well as providing project management for the HJT production lines, delivering, implementing production processes and transferring IP technology. Revkor will secure the remaining funding for the manufacturing and research facilities, estimated to be over several billion dollars. The company is engaging with several funding programs that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act as well as the Department of Energy loan guarantee program and CHIPS Act. The Department of Economic Development in Salt Lake City, Utah and the Governor’s office have also been tapped for funding support.
The overall project is expected to generate over 2,500 high-tech jobs in the Salt Lake City area and contribute billions of dollars in revenue to the state of Utah.
This article was amended to remove the statement that Revkor received exclusive license from Suzhou Maxwell Technology to manufacture HJT solar cells and modules.
