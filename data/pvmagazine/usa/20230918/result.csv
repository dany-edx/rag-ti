The inverters come in sizes ranging from 3.8 kW to 11.5 kW output power. Hybrid inverters enable two-way conversion of electricity from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), as well as DC to AC.
The hybrid inverters sport a max efficiency of 97.6% and a CEC efficiency of 97%. Double maximum power point (MPPT) trackers support up to 32 A of MPPT current. The inverters support 120 V / 240 V backup power without requiring the installation of an external autotransformer.
Hoymiles’ new inverters enable a DC/AC ratio of up to 150%. The company said this leads to a lower system cost when compared with systems of the same capacity using other conventional inverters.
The inverters come with integrated arc fault protection and rapid shutdown features. The inverters also allow users to check real-time system data and perform remote operations and maintenance via a transfer stick.
An onboard energy management system allows users to shift between self-consumption mode, “economic mode,” and backup power mode to suit their needs.
“By acting as a medium between solar and grid energy, we ensure electricity is not just accessible but also adaptable and reliable,” said Neutron Wang, product director, Hoymiles. “With our latest inverters, we are pushing the frontiers of solar technology, fostering energy autonomy.”
Founded in 2012, Hoymiles is a global module-level power electronics (MLPE) solution provider specializing in module-level microinverters, storage systems and rapid shutdown systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/18/redflow-and-ameresco-to-deploy-prototype-microgrid-at-stewart-air-national-guard-base/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Redflow and Ameresco to deploy prototype microgrid at Stewart Air National Guard Base,"Redflow Limited, an Australian clean energy storage specialist, and Ameresco, a cleantech integrator, announced that Redflow signed a $2.83 million contract with the United States Department of Defense’s (DOD) Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to deliver a prototype microgrid using a 1.2 to 1.4 MWh long duration energy storage (LDES) system.
Microgrids are groups of distributed energy resources, such as solar connected to a battery system, that can disconnect from the grid and operate independently during a power outage. According to recent analysis by Wood Mackenzie’s Grid Edge Service, the U.S. microgrid market reached 10 GW in the third quarter of 2022, with more than 7 GW in operation and the rest in planning or construction stages.
The microgrid will be constructed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York. The Department of Air Force plans to use the repowered solar microgrid with 1.2 MWh to 1.4 MWh of energy storage to provide energy resilience for critical loads on the base. The microgrid will also provide a dispatchable solar-plus-storage resource capable of peak shaving.
Redflow will partner with Ameresco as its engineering subcontractor to deliver the microgrid project. The project, which aims to extend the duration of energy storage for existing installations, will repower a solar-powered microgrid currently located at the Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state.
Redflow produces zinc-bromine flow batteries that are designed to work in harsh conditions in deep cycling, long-duration stationary energy storage applications in the commercial & industrial sector. The battery systems are scalable from a single battery installation through multiple grid-scale battery deployments.
This project is the result of Redflow being selected to participate in the DIU’s Extended Duration Storage for Installations program. The program is designed to match innovative LDES technologies to projects that demonstrate additional technological capability by providing energy resilience and power backup across the Department of Defense’s 450+ global bases.
“We have been working with the Defense Innovation Unit for the past year to support their energy resilience objectives across the military’s global operations, said Tim Harris, Redflow CEO and managing director. “To be selected as the solution provider is validation that Redflow’s LDES solutions hold the potential to deliver significant benefits to US Department of Defense installations worldwide.”
Ameresco is no stranger to military microgrid installations, having partnered with Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey on a $140 million infrastructure and energy resilience project. As part of the federal government’s Climate Smart Building Initiative, the energy project will include a 32 MW solar facility with a 2 MW/ 4 MWh battery energy storage system. Energy savings steps are also being taken, including the installation of 90,000 smart LED light fixture retrofits.
“This groundbreaking microgrid project at Stewart Air National Guard Base exemplifies the deployment of innovative technologies to deliver resilient, sustainable solutions at US military installations,” said Nicole Bulgarino, executive vice president, Ameresco. “Together with Redflow, we’re energized to witness how this microgrid will bolster base resilience and set new standards for clean energy advancement, inspiring a green and resilient future for US Department of Defense installations worldwide.”
The Department of Air Force is planning deployment and commissioning of this system for the second half of 2024. If successful, the solution could be rolled out across numerous U.S. Department of Defense facilities and critical infrastructure.
The military installation is expected to contribute to the Department of Defense emissions reduction goal of 25% by 2025 and will support New York state’s 70% renewable energy by 2030 goal.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/18/the-times-of-supply-shortage-are-over-solar-giants-bet-big-on-u-s-manufacturing/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023","“The times of supply shortage are over,” solar giants bet big on U.S. manufacturing","A year removed from the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which created long-term industrial policy anchored by rich supply-side and demand-side incentives for manufacturing solar components, large global companies are betting big on U.S. manufacturing.
Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, and Longi have each announced 5 GW solar module manufacturing facilities, adding a combined 15 GW of capacity. To put the investments in context, each of these factories represent $200 million to $600 million in capital expenditure.
Prior to the IRA, the U.S. had about 7 GW of module manufacturing capacity in 2021. As of April 2023, American Clean Power shared that an eight-month period, 46 utility-scale clean energy manufacturing facilities were announced, bringing an expected 18,000 or more U.S. jobs. Since then, several more major announcements, including the three panel giants’ factory openings, have followed.
“The times of supply shortages are over,” said Thomas Koerner, senior vice president, Canadian Solar in an interview with pv magazine USA at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas.
Canadian Solar told pv magazine USA it is moving significant capacity into the United States to meet customer demand. A 10% adder to the investment tax credit is applied to projects that meet a certain threshold of U.S.-made components, driving developers to shift their procurement decisions.
The move may also indicate the three companies looking to adjust to the new enforcement of anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws. Whereas the production of a solar cell used to determine the nation of origin in U.S. Customs and Border Patrol enforcement of AD/CVD tariffs, but that has changed and the production of wafers is now used to determine the nation of origin in production.
The change in enforcement has drawn some fire from industry advocates and global panel suppliers. AD/CVD uncertainties led the supply of utility-scale solar panels to dry up in 2022, leading to a cascade of delayed and cancelled projects and a deployment downturn in a year that was expected to bring installation growth.
Read industry reactions to the changes in enforcement of AD/CVD tariffs here. A guide to avoiding being assessed with AD/CVD tariffs can be found here.
For Canadian Solar, the new U.S. production represents choice for its customers. The company has 12 GW of production of its TOPCon modules in Thailand, and 5 GW of production on the way in the U.S. The sites will produce the same panels, but one will produce made-in-USA goods that are expected to qualify for domestic content requirements for the tax credit bonus.
An upcoming pv magazine USA webinar, “Variables to consider in solar module procurement” will address how price is no longer the defining factor in purchasing decisions. Country of origin, differences in quality and degradation rates, and other determining factors will be assessed.
Three factories
Trina Solar announced it will invest about $200 million in a Texas manufacturing plant with an annual manufacturing capacity of 5 GW. Trina’s new factory is expected to begin producing its Vertex line of modules with 210 mm wafers in 2024.
“We have long had a vision to manufacture solar products in the United States, and we are proud of the jobs we are creating and the investment we are making in the Wilmer community,” said Steven Zhu, president of Trina Solar US.
The Trina facility is expected to create 1,500 local jobs.
“As someone who has lived in Texas for more than a decade, I’m proud to bring Trina’s first module factory in the Western Hemisphere to the Lone Star State,” said Zhu.
Longi announced it will partner with utility-scale developer Invenergy to support a 5 GW panel assembly in Ohio. Invenergy said it will invest more than $600 million to construct a 1.1 million square foot crystalline silicon panel manufacturing facility.
Operations are expected to begin in late 2023, and construction on the plant began in April. Over 850 jobs are expected to be created at the site.
“As an American company and a leading developer and operator of solar projects in the U.S., we recognize the importance of having a strong domestic supply chain to meet the fast-growing demand for affordable solar power,” said Art Fletcher, executive vice president, Global Sourcing at Invenergy.
Canadian Solar will also add 5 GW of manufacturing capacity, building a factory in Mesquite, Texas. The site will produce TOPCon solar panels. The company said it will invest $250 million in the factory, creating about 1,500 jobs along the way.
“Establishing this factory is a key milestone that will enable us to better serve our U.S. customers with the most advanced technology in the industry,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, founder and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar. “We hope that this is the first of many long-term investments we expect to make in the U.S. as we think strategically about a sustainable and resilient clean energy supply chain.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/18/enel-triples-its-operational-utility-scale-storage-capacity-in-texas/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TEXAS",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Enel triples its operational utility-scale storage capacity in Texas,"From Winter Storm Uri in 2021 to the heat waves that have become a regular part of  a Texas summer, Texas stakeholders adapt its energy grid to accommodate fluctuations from extreme weather.
One solution involves an ongoing partnership with Enel North America, a clean energy provider serving over 4,500 business utilities and cities with renewable power generation resources and solutions. The company has built five new battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the state as part of its commitment to strengthen the Texas energy grid. The BESS adds more than 369 MW of dispatchable energy storage, helping provide reserves residents can tap into during peak demand and high rates.
Each BESS is situated at or near renewable generation plants in Texas. They include: 
The construction of these systems brings Enel’s total operational utility-scale battery storage capacity to 520 MW in Texas. The operation supports the state’s current grid regulator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), as it adapts to shifting conditions. 
ERCOT declared an Energy Emergency Level 2 Alert (EEA 2) early this month. This happens when operating reserves drop below 1,750 MW and aren’t expected to recover within 30 minutes. An EEA 2 is also issued when frequency drops below 59.91 Hz for 30 minutes. Residents are encouraged to raise thermostats by a degree or avoid using large appliances, among other energy-saving tips, while ERCOT deploys additional tools to meet current demand. On September 6, Enel delivered about 524/MWh of electricity to the grid. The company’s renewable portfolio in Texas generated almost 19.9/GWh of wind and solar electricity for residents throughout the day. Finally, Enel’s demand response portfolio provided 145 MW of critical load relief. 
“Adding more resource diversity and energy flexibility through solutions like battery storage demand response and renewable generation is key to reinforcing the power grid and ensuring energy availability for Texans amid high demand periods,” said Paolo Romanacci, head of Enel’s renewable energy business, Enel Green Power North America.
According to Enel, all its utility-scale batteries are a part of ERCOT’s Ancillary Services. To help prevent blackouts, Enel consistently stores up to 325 MW of available electricity. This power can be discharged to the grid in seconds if need be and provides enough electricity for 65,000 homes during peak demand. 
Enel has an additional 1.8 GW of solar and 823 MW of utility-scale storage capacity under construction in Texas. This would take more responsibility off of residential consumers as the state scales its generation and battery storage capacity to meet the needs of its growing population and extreme weather conditions. In 2022, residential energy storage systems coupled with solar generation and reduced energy consumption during peak hours, were part of why Texas avoided rolling blackouts during that summer’s heatwave. 
Other ongoing projects dedicated to increasing Texas grid resilience include 200 MW of disaster recovery capacity for commercial and industrial organizations in the ERCOT market managed by Enel. Furthermore, Enel’s retail energy offering, introduced late last year, allows consumers to buy renewable energy directly from Texas generation assets at a competitive price.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/18/johnson-controls-hitachi-air-conditioning-unveils-residential-dual-fuel-heat-pump-system/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning unveils residential dual-fuel heat pump system,"From pv magazine global
Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning has launched a new residential heat pump system combining an air source heat pump (ASHP) and a gas furnace.
“When temperatures are extremely low, most heat pumps rely on energy-intensive, electric resistance ‘strip’ heating, which can significantly increase utility costs and strain the electric grid,” said the U.S.-based cooling and heating specialist. “To maximize efficiency and not compromise heating performance, it’s often more sustainable to use the furnace as a backup heat source during the coldest days of the year.”
The company said the new air365 Hybrid system uses a Hitachi Mini VRF electric heat pump as its primary heating and cooling source.
“When the air365 Hybrid system is in heating mode, a smart sensor monitors the outdoor temperature,” the company explained. “If it reaches a temperature where the heat pump cannot efficiently meet the indoor heating demand, it automatically switches from the heat pump to the furnace.”
Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning offers three versions of the dual fuel system, weighing from 67.46 pounds (30.6 kg) to 84 pounds (38.1 kg). The smallest system has a rated cooling capacity of 36,000 British thermal units (BTU)/h and a rated heating capacity of 40,000 BTU/h. The largest system has a cooling capacity of 60,000 BTU/h and a heating capacity of 66,000 BTU/h.
“The Mini VRF heat pump offers reliable performance across a wide range of temperatures – as low as -5 C [23 F] outdoor ambient temperature in cooling mode and as low as -20 C [-4] in heating mode,” the manufacturer said. “All models feature night shift, which allows the outdoor unit to operate very quietly, as low as 44 decibels, or 10 decibels less than the average household refrigerator.”
The dual fuel system also features the Affinity Gas Furnace from US manufacturer York, which is a subsidiary of Johnson Controls.
