The installation will help power the company’s Pine Bend refinery south of the Twin Cities in Rosemount, MN. The refinery supplies the majority of Minnesota’s and much of the Upper Midwest’s gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as well as heating fuels, asphalt, fertilizer, and the chemical-building blocks used in thousands of everyday products.
The 45 MW installation will include at least 100,000 solar. The Pine Bend refinery is currently among the most efficient refineries in the United States. It has also reduced its traditional criteria emissions by 70% since 2000 while increasing production to meet demand and has reduced greenhouse gases approximately 10% relative to production since 2010.
“With this project we are improving our ability to provide the fuel people need in a way that will allow us to be more competitive today and well into the future,” said Jeff Ramsey, president and CEO of Flint Hills Resources. “Our refinery operations are among the best in the world, and we continue to innovate and find new and better ways to produce and deliver the fuel and other petroleum-derived products that remain essential to the economy and modern life.” 
The Flint Hills Resources solar installation will be located on approximately 300 acres of the company’s property immediately adjacent to the Pine Bend refinery complex in Rosemount, MN. The facility’s expected solar energy production is the equivalent to the energy needed to power more than 8,400 homes per year and has a peak capacity of roughly 30% of the refinery’s power needs during optimal conditions. The estimated cost of this project is $75 million.
Scottsdale, Arizona-based DEPCOM Power, a Koch Engineered Solutions (KES) company, has been selected as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor for the project.
“This is an extraordinary project and exciting opportunity to demonstrate how solar can be seamlessly integrated into a large industrial facility with a high, consistent power demand, reliably and at a lower cost than conventional, retail power,” said Justin Bloch, DEPCOM’s President of Solar. “You don’t often see utility-scale projects for a single facility and while this may be the first project of its kind at this scale, it won’t be the last. Distributed solar generation is proving to be a competitive and reliable source of power for many energy-intensive industries.”
This is the company’s second source of on-site power generation following the completion of its combined heat and power (CHP) system in 2019, which provides about 50 MW of electricity. The CHP’s cogeneration of electricity and steam is more efficient than producing them separately, and on-site electricity generation (CHP and solar) avoids the energy losses associated with long-distance transmission, transformation, and distribution of utility supply. The Pine Bend CHP uses a combination of a state-of-the-art natural gas combustion turbine, a combustion turbine waste heat recovery system and a steam turbine energy recovery system. Under optimal conditions, CHP and solar installation together could satisfy up to 70% of Pine Bend’s power needs.

In many ways, Hartwell presents the classic aesthetic of the American South: rolling fields dotted with quaint ranch houses and farmsteads giving way to forests of tall pines, seemingly standing in formation, and series of creeks, brooks, and ponds, all of which attract the town’s non-human residents, namely great blue heron and whitetail deer.
That is, until you pass down another unassuming country road, down which one of the area’s dime-a-dozen big, red barns is flanked by something more familiar to clean energy veterans: a 20kW ground-mounted solar system.
If the system serves as a sign of what’s to come in the future of power generation and consumption for Georgia and the world at large, then it’s especially fitting that it belongs to longtime Hartwell resident and author of the groundbreaking book, Freeing Energy, Bill Nussey.
Published in December 2021, Freeing Energy explores the concept of our energy grid inevitably evolving in the same way that computers and the internet did – with local solar and battery storage replacing large-scale, centralized power plants as the most reliable and economical option, much in the same way personal computers and the invention of the cloud eclipsed existing mainframe technology. Using another metaphor, from the spoke-and-wheel to the network. 
Going local
It’s a concept Nussey calls “local energy,” and pv magazine had the opportunity to meet Nussey at his Hartwell farm to discuss what it means, and how the concept is already changing the world. To understand the potential of local energy, you first need to understand what Nussey means with the term and how it differs from other oft-used terms in the small-scale renewables space, like residential solar, distributed energy resources (DERs), or residential batteries. For Nussey, half the battle of presenting his vision for the world’s energy future was deciding what to call it, though he’ll be the first to tell you that others had coined the term before him.
“All the words that we usually use: DERs, behind the meter, these words are all used by groups of people that have a vested interest in the existing system,” explained Nussey. “And so it’s always in the context of this 100-year-old industry that’s outdated and needs to change. I wanted to create a new phrase that not only represented the technical dimension that it’s generated locally, but had the emotional draw. This is also about human beings. This is about families and communities.”
The main tenants behind local energy are relatively simple. Our current energy system, globally, but especially so in the United States, is outdated. Few argue this point. It was developed during a time when the idea of being able to power one’s home was novel, and when building large, centralized power stations was the most cost-effective and reliable way to deliver that power.
And while these initial arguments may no longer hold, the system remains in place, largely unchanged. All of the issues and arguments that bog down our efforts to rapidly switch to a cleaner energy supply, be they suboptimal regulatory practices, long interconnection delays, or utilities’ tooth-and-nail defense of the fossil fuel generating stations that made them profitable, all exist because of the existing power and energy framework.
Tech meets electrons
It’s an idea that Bill calls “Big Grid” in the same way that one may lump Google, Meta, and Amazon together as “Big Tech.” In Freeing Energy, the Big Grid serves as the energy transition’s antagonist, rather than the usual culprits of utilities or the regulators that oversee them. As Nussey sees it, while these actors may make contributions that stifle our transition to clean energy, their decisions are largely influenced by the need to operate in the system that they were made for: sustaining the Big Grid.
“It’s easy to kick the shins of the utility industry.” Nussey says. “Vilifying them as individual companies, or even in the industry is weak. It’s a crutch, but you always have to have a villain if you’re going to have people engaged. And so Big Grid became the villain, which really represents the status quo rather than any particular company.”
Nussey lays out that the disestablishment of this status quo is the key to transitioning to a grid powered by clean, local energy. However, the act of actually looking at a system as ingrained as the large-scale electrical grid, the regulated monopolies that exist to serve and use it, the regulators that oversee these monopolies, and all the other dozens of actors in the space is overwhelming, to say the least. 
The scope of this issue has led many, even those in the clean energy space, to question skeptically if an energy transition of any sort, let alone one rapid enough to mitigate the adversity of climate change, is even possible. To Bill Nussey, there is no question. The transition is inevitable.
Nussey outlines that large-scale change of incumbent entities comes about one of two ways: either powerfuel actors and decision-makers recognize an issue and take charge, or the public supports an issue fererenty and en masse, to the point where it can’t be ignored and action must be taken.
It’s the second avenue that Nussey sees as the mechanism local energy will use to dethrone Big Grid. And while emotions and action may not have reached the fever pitch necessary to start making tangible change quickly, support for renewables, especially small scale, consumer-sided solutions, is only growing nationally.
Popular switch
Opinion polls conducted both nationally and at the state level show overwhelming bipartisan support for the clean energy transition. 
Embold Research recently released the results of a survey given to 1360 adults living in Pennsylvania, including the southwest portion of the state, a fossil-fuel hotbed where that industry has provided jobs for decades. The survey results showed that solar energy has strong support across political, racial, gender, and regional lines, with 81% of survey respondents indicating “support” or “strong support” for rooftop solar on homes, making it more popular than coal, nuclear energy, and methane gas. 65% of respondents shared that they would like to see Pennsylvania generate more solar, citing reasons ranging from reduced air pollution to energy bill savings. Not a single demographic group or region expressed a desire for decreased solar production.
One of the core tenets of Freeing Energy is understanding that, unlike coal or natural gas, solar energy is a technology, not a fuel, meaning that it is more subject to rapid innovations and improvements, as well as dramatic cost reductions as production volume increases – also known as Wright’s Law, which open up supply chains and lower overall costs.
Understanding that solar should be thought of as a technology influencing energy in the same way that microprocessors and cloud computing are technologies that influenced the data and communications industries, parallels can be drawn from how disrupting other seemingly-immovable regulated monopolies is possible and how that disruption birthed some of the innovations that modern life is founded upon.
“AT&T fought to maintain a monopoly on long distance phone calls, and they lost,” explained Nussey, referencing the landmark 1982 decision in United States v. AT&T. “The inevitability was that there were better solutions available. AT&T recognized them, but they couldn’t adopt them nearly as fast and didn’t want to anyway. Thankfully, the courts and the government won, because there’d be no internet if AT&T held their monopoly; there would be no mobile phones. These innovations were not always inevitable, they came to be because that market became deregulated and innovators could enter the market.”
In disrupting the Big Grid, it’s not Nussey’s goal to entirely dismantle monopoly utilities and put thousands out of work. His vision still has a place for utilities, just in a different, and potentially more profitable, role. In a reality where tens of millions of homes and small communities can act as their own microgrids, managing all of these generation assets, their production, consumption, battery charging and discharging, as well as critical grid operations, like frequency regulation, will still be an immensely important industry, one that utilities are already built for. 
“The problem is that you have to have all the capacity in your house for all possible situations in your house, as do your neighbors,” Nussey says. “It’s super cheap if you just pool it with your neighbors, right, and there is no more natural group to help facilitate that pooling than the utilities.”
In a sense, instead of working as suppliers, utilities would begin to work as aggregators, marketplace management arms, and a marketplace platform.
“They go from being Walmart to being eBay,” says Nussey, always quick with an analogy. “You can’t move into the future by saying ‘I don’t want utilities,’ you can’t make utilities go away. Society as we know it would collapse … There’s good reasons why utilities are separate corporations. They can access an amount of capital that nobody wants to be taxed to pay.”
This capital to which utilities have access could also be used to help bring local energy to those who aren’t able to afford solar and storage systems for themselves, or those whose living spaces can’t accommodate the installations. However, many times the exact opposite rhetoric is used to downplay the potential of local energy, using the age-old argument that those using their own energy are raising the cost of service to those who don’t, usually in an economically disproportionate fashion.
“You hear utilities saying, ‘Holy cow, if the wealthy people put solar on their roof, that’s going to raise the cost of the grid for poor people.’” Nussey explained. “If you have an asset-driven business, including the grid, you are shifting costs … If you live in a poorer area of an inner city, the cost of wiring each apartment is very small, right? But you’re paying the same rate as we are out here in a rural part. Low-income people in a dense city are subsidizing rural people who are paying the same rate, but they have 1000s of miles of wires connecting them to the grid, whereas hundreds of feet would be enough to connect the inner-city families.”
Freeing Energy dives into the hypocrisy of the cost-shift arguments as it pertains to residential solar, as well as the issues of energy equity and the burden of solar’s soft costs much deeper than is possible in a single article. 
The story of local energy does not end with Freeing Energy, however and it is Nussey’s hope that his book will be able to play a part in the energy transition that he sees as inevitable; one which will provide access to cheap electricity and resiliency to everyone, without relying on the sluggish reluctance of Big Grid.

Construction is currently taking place between Waco and Dallas, Texas.
Buckeye, a long-standing oil pipeline company, has an aggregate oil tank capacity of 125 million barrels. However,  the oil giant has a growing affinity to solar, announcing earlier this year it was planning another solar project with a capacity of 270 MW.
For the 164 MW solar project, Burns & McDonnell will cover design, construction, startup, and commissioning. The scope of the project includes the buildout of a new 345 kV interconnection substation. Transmission constraints are a hot issue for utility scale solar projects in Texas, and the buildout of the substation will better prepare energy to be distributed by the utility transmission system.
The project will include more than 360,000 First Solar modules and is expected to generate power equivalent to the load of 28,000 homes annually. Construction began mid-April and is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2023.
“We are fortunate to be working with forward-thinking innovators in our industry, like Buckeye, to uniquely capture market opportunities in the renewables space,” said Mark Swanson, vice president for refining, logistics, midstream and chemicals in the Oil, Gas & Chemical Group at Burns & McDonnell.
“This new solar energy site demonstrates Buckeye’s continued focus on energy diversity and lower-carbon solutions to enhance our long-term sustainability while meeting our customers’ evolving needs,” said Todd Russo, CEO of Buckeye. “As a world-class EPC contractor, Burns & McDonnell is the right partner to help us advance this critical initiative.”
Burns & McDonnell is a family of companies with a team of 10,000 engineers, construction, and craft professionals, and is 100% employee owned.
Buckeye invests in alternatives
Buckeye has been actively investing in alternative energies as the global transition from fossil fuels continues. It has an alternative energy branch that invests in hydrogen, wind, and solar solutions.
In January 2021, the company made an equity investment in OneH2, a provider of hydrogen fuel supply and logistics solutions, currently representing approximately 20% ownership interest in the entity. OneH2 provides scalable hydrogen fuel production systems coupled with delivered hydrogen fuel for use in transportation markets.
In March 2021, Buckeye invested in Swift Current Energy, a renewable energy project development company, representing a 60% ownership interest. Swift Current Energy develops, acquires, finances, and builds solar and wind projects across the United States. The company’s current portfolio includes fourteen advanced-stage renewable energy development projects in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas.

Schneider Electric and AutoGrid are no strangers to one another, having previously partnered on a fully integrated advanced distribution management system and distributed energy resources management system (DERMS), released two years ago.
Schneider Electric focuses on products for sustainability and efficiency including XW Pro and SW hybrid inverters, MPPT charge controllers, power distribution panels, InsightHome and InsightFacility edge devices, as well as accessories. Three years ago, Schneider Electric pulled out of the utility scale segment in order to strengthen its profile in the residential and C&I space.
“Schneider Electric and AutoGrid have a shared vision for a more sustainable world through electrification, digitization and decarbonization. With AutoGrid, we can deliver significant value to energy companies by delivering cutting-edge technologies to drive adoption of smart grids and reduction of carbon emissions,” said Nadège Petit, Chief Innovation Officer at Schneider Electric.
AutoGrid’s product smooths out sudden fluctuations in renewable energy supply and customer energy demands. The company’s AI-powered virtual power plant (VPP) and DERMS offers a sustainable fossil-fuel dependent backup power plants by managing and deploying additional untapped capacity from batteries, electric vehicles, and flexible load.
“Joining forces with AutoGrid will give customers the most advanced platform to integrate and orchestrate distributed energy resources for the benefit of all grid stakeholders,” said Luis D’Acosta, Executive Vice President of Digital Energy at Schneider Electric. “These new capabilities will accelerate prosumer engagement for a more sustainable and efficient grid.”
In February Schneider Electric purchased a controlling stake in EnergySage, an online comparison-shopping marketplace for rooftop solar, energy storage, project financing, and community solar. The capital from that acquisition is expected to allow EnergySage to accelerate its growth and product innovation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/11/no-end-to-solar-supply-demand-imbalance/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"MAY 11, 2022",No end to solar supply/demand imbalance,"From pv magazine 05/2022
PV InfoLink projects global PV module demand to reach 223 GW this year, with an optimistic forecast of 248 GW. Cumulative installed capacity is expected to reach 1 TW by year’s end.
China still dominates PV demand. The policy-driven 80 GW of module demand will beef up solar market development. In second place is the European market, which is working to accelerate renewables development to wean itself off Russian natural gas. Europe is expected to see 49 GW of module demand this year.
The third-largest market, the United States, has seen diversified supply and demand since last year. Disrupted by the Withhold Release Order (WRO), supply is unable to catch up with demand. Moreover, the investigation into anti-circumvention in Southeast Asia this year causes further uncertainty in cell and module supply for US orders and adds to the low utilization rates in Southeast Asia amid impacts of WRO.
As a result, supply to the US market will fall short of demand throughout this year; module demand will stay at last year’s 26 GW or even lower. The three largest markets together will contribute to around 70% of demand.

Demand in the first quarter of 2022 stayed at around 50 GW, despite persistently high prices. In China, projects deferred from last year were commenced. While ground-mounted projects were postponed due to high module prices over the short term, and demand from distributed-generation projects continued due to lower price sensitivity. In markets outside of China, India witnessed strong inventory draw prior to the introduction of basic custom duty (BCD) on April 1, with 4 GW to 5 GW of demand in the first quarter. Steady demand continued in the US, while Europe saw stronger-than-expected demand with robust order requests and signings. The EU’s market acceptance for higher prices also increased.
Overall, demand in the second quarter may be spurred by distributed generation and some utility-scale projects in China, while Europe’s strong module inventory draws amid the accelerated energy transition, and steady demand from the Asia-Pacific region. The US and India, on the other hand, is expected to see dwindling demand, owing respectively to anti-circumvention investigation and lofty BCD rates. Yet, demand from all regions together amass 52 GW, slightly higher than in the first quarter.
Under current pricing levels, China’s guaranteed installed capacity will drive inventory draws from utility-scale projects in the third and fourth quarter, while distributed generation projects will continue. Against this backdrop, the Chinese market will continue to consume large volumes of modules.
The outlook for the US market will remain obscured until results of the anti-circumvention investigation are unveiled at the end of August. Europe continues to see bullish demand, with no evident high or low seasons throughout the year.
Overall, demand in the second half of the year will surpass that in the first half. PV Infolink predicts a gradual increase over time, reaching a peak in the fourth quarter.
As shown in the graph (left), polysilicon supply has improved from last year and is likely to meet end-user demand. Yet, InfoLink predicts that polysilicon supply will remain short due to the following factors: Firstly, it will take about six months for new production lines to reach full capacity, meaning production is limited. Secondly, the time taken for new capacity to come online varies among manufacturers, with capacity growing slowly during first and second quarter, and then increasing markedly in the third and fourth quarter. Lastly, despite continued polysilicon production, Covid-19’s resurgence in China has disrupted supply, leaving it unable to meet demand from the wafer segment, which holds huge capacity.
Raw material and BOM price trends decide whether module prices will stay on the rise. Like polysilicon, it seems that EVA particle production volume can satisfy demand from the module sector this year, but equipment maintenance and the pandemic will lead to an imbalanced supply-demand relationship in the short term.
Supply chain prices are expected to stay elevated and will not decline until the end of the year, when new polysilicon production capacities come fully online. Next year, the entire supply chain may hopefully recover to a healthy state, allowing the long-stressed module makers and system suppliers to take a deep breath. Unfortunately, striking a balance between high prices and robust demand continues to be major topic of discussion throughout 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/11/georgia-solar-association-calls-for-georgia-power-to-add-4-gw-of-near-term-solar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,GEORGIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 11, 2022",Georgia solar association calls for Georgia Power to add 4 GW of near-term solar,"Georgia’s Public Service Commission should direct Georgia Power to increase its near-term solar target to 4 GW, up from 2.3 GW as the company proposed in its resource plan, said Georgia’s solar trade association GASEIA and allies in joint testimony to the state’s Public Service Commission.
That’s because when Georgia Power ran its planning model with higher natural gas prices, the amount of solar the model added to the system “increased substantially,” the groups said. State regulators should recognize “the real possibility that the era of sustained, low natural gas prices may be ending.”
The groups said regulators should also uncap through 2025 the utility’s program for rooftop solar. The 5,000 customer cap has been reached, they said, calling that value a “rounding error” compared to the utility’s 2.3 million residential customers. They also challenged the utility’s claim of cost shifting, saying that it “rests on an assumption that Georgia Power is owed a certain amount of revenue, and any shortfall in that revenue must be made up from someone else. That is patently false.”
The groups reported a “history of missed procurement targets” for distributed resources planned in previous resource plans. They said regulators should direct Georgia Power to include 300 MW of distributed generation in its near-term solar plans, and should reject the utility’s community solar program, which they said needs a “complete redesign.”
The national Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) joined GASEIA in the joint testimony, along with advocacy group Vote Solar.
Kevin Lucas, senior director of utility regulation and policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), testified that Georgia Power assigned solar and storage “much lower” capacity values than the company found in its own studies, and “failed” to model hybrid solar and storage projects. Regulators should direct Georgia Power to procure solar-plus-storage projects, the groups said, rather than standalone storage, to save money on both project and interconnection costs.
The Southern Renewable Energy Association, an industry-led initiative, filed expert testimony from Michael Goggin, vice president at Grid Strategies LLC, saying that Georgia Power overstated the cost of solar in its modeling, and did not recognize most of the system benefits of storage. The group agreed with SEIA’s expert that Georgia Power understated the capacity value of renewables and storage, adding that the utility also overstated the capacity value of gas. The group said regulators should “reject” the utility’s attempts to limit competition and increase its profits by owning all new battery storage.
The advocacy group Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the service group Southface Energy Institute pointed to “flaws” in Georgia Power’s resource planning, in testimony from consultant Ronald Binz. The utility used a “limit source” solicitation instead of an “all source” solicitation, and chose an “inappropriate” baseline scenario in terms of future carbon prices and future costs of natural gas, Binz testified. Regulators should direct the utility to make specific improvements to its next resource plan in 2025, he said. The groups filed separate testimony on energy efficiency and demand response as grid resources.
Georgia Power serves customers in 155 of the state’s 159 counties.
