The Tennessee-based company, whose balance-of-systems (BOS) solutions are deployed on over 20 GW of solar energy systems globally, has launched a presentation roadshow for potential investors.
In an announcement, Shoals explained it will be offering 10.5 million shares, while a parent entity controlled by funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management LP will offer 39.5 million of the shares. The parent entity also intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 7.5 million shares.
According to Shoals, the IPO price is expected to be between $19.00 and $21.00 per share. The company intends to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “SHLS.”
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters for the offering. Guggenheim Securities and UBS Investment Bank are also acting as joint book-running managers, and Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Credit Suisse are acting as book-runners. Cowen and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. are acting as co-managers.
During an interview with pv magazine in late 2020, Shoals Founder and CEO Dean Solon highlighted the company’s achievements and the solar industry’s strong performance, saying “the short version is that it’s been a damned good year.”
Shoals joins a growing list of solar product providers going public, including the IPO of tracker builder Array Technologies last year.

The company attributes a significant portion of this installation figure to its five-year, $62 million rooftop solar rebate program.
Residential customers who are approved for rebates will get a $0.60/W credit for their installed solar system, up to 10 kW or $6,000, while businesses are eligible for a $0.50/W credit and nonprofits are eligible for $0.75/W. These nonresidential projects cap out at 100 kW of installed capacity, meaning a maximum credit of $50,000 for businesses and $75,000 for nonprofits.
In the company’s own solar pursuits, Duke connected nearly 350 MW of solar capacity in North Carolina last year, headlined by the 69 MW Maiden Creek solar facility in Catawba County and the 25 MW Gaston County solar facility in Bessemer City.
While not as substantial in the capacity department, Duke also came to an agreement with the U.S. Army’s Fort Bragg to install a 1.1 MW floating solar system on Camp Mackall’s Big Muddy Lake, as part of a $36 million energy services effort.
These capacity additions helped Duke to reach the milestone of having more than 3.7 GW of solar capacity connected to its energy grid in North Carolina. The company also reached its goal of owning and contracting for 8 GW of wind, solar, and biomass generation around the nation, a goal which has since been doubled to 16 GW by 2025.
2020 was also a milestone year for Duke’s Green Source Advantage (GSA) program, which allows large-scale customers to offset power purchases by securing renewable energy from projects connected to the Duke Energy grid. In 2020, the utility came to terms with the City of Charlotte, Bank of America, and Duke University on GSA contracts.
Charlotte’s agreement is for a 35 MW installation, set to be built within the city. Bank of America agreed to a 25 MW project in the Piedmont region, and Duke University came to terms on a 101 MW deal from three solar facilities in the state.

Investors include Power Sustainable, Desjardins Group, Great-West Lifeco, National Bank of Canada, and Après-demain SA.
Through Potentia Renewables and Nautilus Solar Energy, two Power Sustainable business units, the partnership will invest in the development, construction, financing, and operation of renewable energy assets across North America.
The venture marks the first of what the company said would be several projects that it plans to bring to the sustainable investment marketplace in the coming years.
The partnership will be led by co-managing partners Pierre Larochelle and Pierre-Olivier Perras. Before joining Power Sustainable, Larochelle was president and CEO of Power Energy Corp., a unit of Power Sustainable. Perras joined Power Energy in 2019 after more than 20 years at BMO Capital Markets.
Power Sustainable is a global asset manager focused on sustainable strategies. It has offices in Montréal, Toronto, Shanghai, Beijing, and New Jersey.
Macquarie’s Green Investment Group said it will make an investment in esVolta, a developer and owner of utility-scale energy storage projects across North America. The size of the investment was not disclosed.
The investment is intended to support the continued expansion of esVolta and finance its portfolio of more than 600 MWh of  contracted energy storage projects, primarily in California, and an additional development pipeline of more than 2 GWh.
The investment will consist of a bridge loan that will convert to equity upon receipt of regulatory approvals, including the approval of The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The investment group said that the expected addition of more solar on California’s grid will “lead to overproduction and curtailment during the day, while requiring ramping and peaking capacity in the evening” when solar power is not available. The investment in esVolta and its energy storage projects is intended to help add flexibility to help California achieve its renewable energy targets.
Green Investment Group is part of Macquarie Group, a financial group providing clients with asset management and finance, banking, advisory and risk and capital solutions across debt, equity and commodities.
Houston-based EDPR Renewables North America said it acquired a majority interest in C2 Omega, the distributed solar platform of C2 Energy Capital LLC. The new company, EDPR NA Distributed Generation LLC, will provide small-scale downstream generation and energy efficiency services in the United States for EDPR NA.
With around 200 projects across 16 states, the acquisition is intended to establish EDPR NA’s presence in the downstream solar energy market as an owner-operator of commercial and industrial distributed generation assets. Under terms of the deal, EDPR will acquire an 85% equity stake in C2’s solar portfolio. That portfolio includes 89 MW of operating and near-completion capacity across multiple sites, and a near-term pipeline of more than 120 MW.
Guggenheim Securities, LLC acted as financial advisor to EDPR. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions precedent, and closing is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2021.
EDP Renewables North America LLC develops, constructs, owns, and operates wind farms and solar facilities across North America. Assets include 54 wind farms and eight solar parks.
San Francisco-based Pattern Energy Group LP closed financing of a $515 million fund, Green Power Renewable No. 1 Investment LP, which will focus on solar energy and wind investments in Japan. Pattern Energy’s affiliate in Japan, Green Power Investment Corp., will manage the fund and is also one of its largest investors. The Development Bank of Japan will serve as the anchor investor.
The fund will invest in five renewable energy facilities that were developed, constructed, and are now owned and operated by GPI, including Futtsu Solar, Kanagi Solar, Ohorayama Wind, Otsuki Wind, and Tsugaru Wind.
Pattern and its Green Power Investment unit have a development pipeline of 2.4 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in Japan.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/19/storage-wind-superpower-part-3/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,INTERVIEW,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ECKHART GOURAS,"JANUARY 19, 2021","Storage, wind, superpower: Part 3","Tony Seba was among the first to recognize the disruptive potential of solar PV with the publication of his book “Solar Trillions” in 2010. His think tank, RethinkX, recently published a report titled “Rethinking Energy 2020-2030 – 100% Solar, Wind and Batteries is Just the Beginning.”
In early December, pv magazine publisher, Eckhart Gouras, interviewed Seba and Adam Dorr, the two authors of this report. As Seba and Dorr make clear in the interview, a 100% solar-wind-battery system is not only possible, but the cheapest way to build an electricity system in the U.S. by 2030. (Read Part 1 and Part 2.)
In the initial interview, they introduce the concept of the “Clean Energy U-curve,” which shows that the cheapest system is actually one that involves a lot more solar PV and wind power capacity than the peak power demand profile.
They go one step further by introducing the concept of “SuperPower”: by investing in even more solar PV and wind power than the lowest-cost system defined by the “Clean Energy U-curve,” the gain in additional energy, or “superpower,” is exponential to the money invested.
The conversation continues below.
pv magazine: Your report highlights the fact that conventional analyses and forecasts of the electricity sector and energy transition start from the peak electricity demand profile and then build the generation to fit this profile. Instead, your analysis starts with the supply side and comes to the radical conclusion that the supply of clean energy (primarily solar PV) needs to be over-dimensioned by a significant factor to provide the lowest-cost clean energy system. To what extent is this radical idea gaining traction in the power sector and state and federal regulatory authorities?
Adam Dorr (AD): We agree this is still a new idea. It’s still quite radical. It’s only been recognized at all in the scientific community for at most about two years. And the full implications of this were not recognized before.
Image: AdamDorr.com
Seeing the implications of the clean energy U curve and superpower make the full impacts of this idea clear. But what we are seeing, and what’s very encouraging … [is that] there is now a small but quickly growing group of researchers worldwide who are converging with different methods on the same conclusion. So we are not alone.
If you think beyond the existing system to what a new system would look like, and you’re not constrained to just a one-to-one replacement, that new system will have a very different structure, and it will have much more generating capacity. This reduces the energy storage requirement in a non-linear way, and you find that the optimal combination is much more affordable than you realize.
This is going to be the mainstream idea a couple of years from now. Quite soon we will see the research community begin to coalesce into a shared voice.
Tony Seba (TS): We’ve already been contacted by policy makers in several countries. It’s a new lens, a new formula. Once you have a new lens, there’s shock, they attack you, and then you’re right. It’s a classic paradigm shift in the way we see the world.
pv magazine: Oversizing the solar PV deployment yields the “superpower” that you reference, which seems to be another radical concept tied to your focus on the supply side of the electricity sector. But if grid capacity is already a bottleneck in states like Hawaii with a relatively high PV penetration, how can this overbuild be accomplished with the old grid infrastructure that’s in place?
TS: If you look at most disruptions, they make the existing value chain obsolete. When we were building the new Internet [in the 1990s] we did not look at how to bolt the Internet on to this 100-year-old landline telecom infrastructure. That made no sense. And now the ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicle value chain is being obsoleted by the electrification of transportation, by EVs and so on. It happens every single time that the existing value chain basically becomes obsolete.
Image: @tonyseba
When we studied this, we did not start with the idea of how can we bolt on solar, wind and batteries to the existing grid. What we wanted to study is first, is it possible? And that’s the only way you can find all of these interesting insights that we found such as the clean energy U curve and superpower.
And there’s more … if you had, for instance, the idea that there is a non-linear trade-off between generation and storage, that there’s also a trade-off between transmission and storage? The more storage you have, the less transmission you need and the better you can utilize the transmission. If you put that together, you have a three-dimensional decision making process, which would have made the report more complex. We constrained the system on purpose to see what the new generation and storage looks like, then we would go on to design the right grid for that new system.
AD: Keep in mind that it is only an assumption from the incumbent perspective that these changes will require a new additional, very costly infrastructure investments for transmission and distribution. This is an assumption, and it’s not clear if that’s going to be true everywhere.
I’ll give you one example: recent research into the costs by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, CSIRO (Australia’s national science agency), showed that for very high penetration of solar, wind and storage systems the cost of transmission and distribution is a small percentage of that, less than 10%. Even with a very high percentage, there is already research showing that the actual costs of the transmission and distribution infrastructure are not going to be extremely onerous and too difficult to achieve and are not going to be a deterrent.
pv magazine: Your report focuses on the U.S. and in particular California, Texas and New England. Here in Europe we are keen to transition to a decarbonized energy sector, and your report mentions the parallels between a region like New England and northern Europe. For a 100% solar-wind-battery (SWB) system in northern Europe, the time period December and January is the most challenging, given that these months include many days with weak solar and wind resources. The onus would be on the B part in the SWB system. Would the 89 average demand hours (or 1,232 GWh of battery storage) be sufficient to keep the lights on over here?
AD: That’s a great question. We don’t have the specific numbers for Europe as a whole or for any countries in Europe yet. However, our methodology allows us to produce at least preliminary numbers for an individual country, as long as we’re able to get high quality data.
We don’t see any reason to expect that there will be large differences or major problems for a region like Europe that we did not already encounter and cover in our analysis with New England.
Image: David Wagman
New England’s solar resources and wind resources are really quite comparable to northern Europe – not southern Europe, which is much more like California and Texas. Now, without running the numbers we can’t say for sure, but we have no reason to believe that Europe will be somehow twice as difficult…five times as difficult…anything like that.
We chose those regions of the United States precisely because they represent other geographies and we can draw conclusions from that. California is very sunny, but not much wind. Texas has lots of sun and lots of wind. New England has not much sun and not much wind.
pv magazine: I just mentioned the drive to decarbonize the entire energy sector in Europe, so not only electricity. Can we expect RethinkX to also look at the overall energy system, and to what extent can this even bigger beast be decarbonized in the next 10, 20 or 30 years?
AD: The most important thing to keep in mind is that we can do all of this at once. We are not looking at a sequence, one step and then another step and another step. We don’t have to do electric power first and then transportation and then industry, and then residential and commercial heating. We’re going to do it all at once.
That’s why the disruption is going to affect all energy all at once. And the thrilling part about superpower: even if you don’t make the additional investment, even at the lowest cost–the very optimal part of the U curve–you still get some superpower: In California, for example, as much superpower as all of the normal electricity generation. That’s a huge amount of energy compared to what is used in California in transportation, and in residential and commercial heating. Even in the very lowest-cost system, you still are going to have a situation where you can begin to electrify, and therefore decarbonize, the rest of the economy at the same time.
Image: NREL/Dennis Schroeder
But wait, there’s more. If you make that additional investment, 10%, 20% more, and you 5X, 10X your superpower, it’s incredible what you can achieve in the rest of the economy in terms of decarbonization.
There is going to be competition as soon as one or two regions begin to show what is possible. The entire world is going to see this as a race to the top. And this is something that we see again and again, throughout the history of disruptions, we don’t have to wait and do things one at a time. It’s going to happen all at once.
TS: Countries will find that they cannot compete with energy that is vastly more expensive and that they’d have to import. So they’re going to have to do this for purely economic reasons. Once they figure it out (and with super-abundant, super-cheap superpower), you can decarbonize everything: transport, heat and so on.
AD: The incentives are going to be enormous to take advantage of ultra-low costs, perhaps, in some cases, free energy. If you are a smart region–we use the example of Texas in our report–and you say “we are going to attract manufacturing to boost the economy, we are going to make super energy from superpower available for free for some part of the day.”
If a region did that, there would be enormous incentive to go through the process of innovation and business model development to take advantage of that superpower. There’s going to be enormous incentive for industry to find ways to use superpower because it’s almost free. It’s so close to zero cost. This changes everything.
