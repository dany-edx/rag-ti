GRID IE was awarded a $2.5 million grant under the California Department of Community Services and Development (CSD) Low-income Weatherization/Community Solar Pilot Program to fund the project. The ground-mount array, totaling 994.6 kW and about 3,000 solar panels, is located on the Santa Rosa Band of Cahuilla Indians reservation in Anza Valley.
The project broke ground in June 2020 and was completed this past January. According to GRID IE, the CSD Santa Rosa Solar Project is expected to provide $5.4 million in savings to benefit members of the Anza Electric Cooperative, including 38 tribal homes and up to 200 qualified low-income utility customers.
GRID IE said the project reflects the collaborative spirit of this small rural community coming together for the benefit of those less fortunate. Because of the large size of the project, GRID staff also worked alongside tribal trainees recruited to assist with construction.
GRID’s Tribal Program helps tribal communities become self-sustaining by providing resources to assist with their clean energy goals.

Construction is expected to start in the second quarter, with a commercial operation date expected in the first half of 2022. The project will supply power to the Houston area and has secured one commercial and industrial power purchase agreement (PPA) and another PPA with an energy trading company.
Established in 1924, Shikun & Binui Ltd. (S&B) is a construction, development, and real estate group based in Israel. This is the second major solar project acquisition that S&B USA has made since it entered the U.S. market in March 2020. The first acquisition, last December, was for a 49.5% interest in the 107.8 MW Beacon portfolio, alongside fellow energy investment firm TortoiseEcofin. The seller in that transaction, Capital Dynamics, retained 1% ownership.
The Beacon portfolio consists of two projects: Beacon II (59.6 MW) and Beacon V (48.2 MW). Both sites interconnect and sell power to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power under two 25-year fixed rate PPAs. Capital Dynamics bought the assets from SunEdison in early 2016. The solar plants achieved commercial operation at the end of 2017.
The total Beacon project includes five phases. Hecate Energy developed three phases for a total capacity of 162 MW and SunEdison developed the remaining 88 MW in two phases.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/30/greenbacker-wraps-up-10-mw-community-solar-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,COLORADO",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 30, 2021",Greenbacker wraps up 10 MW community solar portfolio,"Greenbacker Renewable Energy Co. LLC announced completion of a 10 MW portfolio made up of five community solar projects in southern Colorado.
New York City-based Greenbacker bought the projects in 2019 from Community Energy, which stayed on to handle the engineering, procurement, and construction work. Greenbacker said the portfolio also came with long-term subscription agreements with investment-grade offtakes under utility Xcel Energy’s Solar*Rewards Community program.
The five community solar projects–Alden, Monte Vista 2, Rock Creek 2, Platteville, and Alamosa Solar South–are located in rural areas of the state and service a range of subscribers. This includes a population of income-qualified households, who receive donated solar credits to help lower their monthly electric bills.
The portfolio’s commercial subscribers, including school districts, nonprofits, and municipalities, will also save on their power bills and support clean energy without having to install their own solar.
Greenbacker said it now owns around 1.04 GW of generating capacity, including assets that are to be constructed. That capacity consists of 773.5 MW of utility-scale and distributed solar facilities, 242.6 MW of wind facilities, 15.5 MW of battery storage, and 12 MW of biomass facilities.

They found that innovative and low-cost LDES technologies could have a big impact, potentially making a deeply decarbonized electricity system more affordable and reliable.
The team defined LDES as a range of emerging technologies that can respond to the variable output of renewables, discharging electrons for days and even weeks and providing resilience to the electric grid.
In their paper, published in Nature Energy, the researchers looked at whether LDES paired with renewable energy sources and short-duration energy storage options like lithium-ion batteries could power a big and cost-effective move to a decarbonized grid. They also looked at whether LDES might end the need for low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear power and natural gas fitted with carbon capture and sequestration.
The researchers surveyed technologies including pumped hydropower storage, vanadium redox flow batteries, aqueous sulfur flow batteries, and firebrick resistance-heated thermal storage, among others.
Key takeaways included:
The researchers said that niche market opportunities for LDES exist now, such as in places with a lot of solar and wind already deployed and where transmission limits exist. In those places, storage could fill up when transmission is at its limit then export power later while maximizing use of the power line capacity.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Decathlon is slated to open on April 12 as a virtual event with competing homes “located” on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the first event was launched in 2002.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the scheduled 2020 event was postponed and moved to a format in which teams build their homes in their local communities where they will remain after the competition. Future Solar Decathlons will follow this local-build model, with the next competition scheduled for 2023.
For this year’s event, 63 finalist teams were selected, representing 57 collegiate institutions. They will compete in one of seven Divisions: Suburban Single-Family Housing, Urban Single-Family Housing, Attached Housing, Mixed-Use Multifamily Building, Elementary School, Office Building, and Retail Building. In addition to U.S. institutions, college teams from Canada, the U.K., India, Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, South Korea, and Australia will take part.
Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker signed a climate bill into law. After accepting Baker’s “more technical” amendments, the state legislature sent the bill to him a third and final time in mid-March.
The law aims to cut state emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. It includes renewables goals, environmental justice provisions, and tax certainty for solar projects. Although solar and environmental groups applauded the law, they called for more action on climate policy.
California-based Nextracker was selected by Solaria Energía y Medio Ambiente to supply 125 MW of solar tracker technology for multiple project sites in Spain.
The company will supply its single-axis NX Horizon product. Solaria based its decision in part on Nextracker’s wind design expertise, which should benefit locations with persistent wind forces due to Spain’s cierzo wind phenomena, which occurs mostly in the autumn and winter and is known for its strong, persistent winds.
