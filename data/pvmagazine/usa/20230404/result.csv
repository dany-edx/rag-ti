Rising electricity costs and demands create risks for millions of Americans.
At the same time, power outages from severe weather are leaving millions in the dark. These grid events are costly for U.S. ratepayers. A recent white paper from Vote Solar and Solar United Neighbors looks back at these issues to understand how local solar plus batteries can be leveraged to address the issue.
More than 141.5 U.S. residents across 40 states were impacted by capacity constraints, said the report. These constraints resulted in further increased energy costs and even blackouts.
All of the Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) issued warnings anticipating further grid capacity shortages for 2022 and beyond.  Severe weather events have only further compounded these issues. In 2022, there were 18 weather or climate-related disasters with losses of over $1 billion each to affect the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Among these was Winter Storm Elliot in Dec. 2022 which swept across the bulk of the United States at the peak of the holiday season.  As a result, more than 1.2 million customers across North and South Carolina lost power during rolling blackouts due to insufficient supply to meet rising cold weather demand.  The Midwest regional grid operator report found almost 50 GW of generating capacity had been forced offline each day, 22 GW being natural gas and 14 GW being coal generation.
These outages do not affect everyone equally.  The most vulnerable members of society often have fewer resources for dealing with outages, while also being disproportionately harmed by the outages.  For example, the white paper notes racial and income disparities in electricity reliability in Minnesota.  Communities of color and predominantly low-wealth in Northside and Southside Green Zones in Minneapolis, Minnesota had between 59% to 85% higher incidence of long-duration outages compared to Xcel customers within the same county, and 32% to 35% increased incidence across Xcel’s overall service territory.
In 2023, more issues are coming.  Colorado utilities are already discussing concerns about meeting summer demands in 2023.  Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and ISO New England (ISO-NE) are issuing warnings about winter-peaking electricity demands and the need to reduce electricity usage after repeated issues over the past two years.  State regulators in Iowa are asking utilities how they plan to manage the grid reliably amidst these warning signs.
In Texas, researchers found that ERCOT had been significantly underestimating the needed capacity to meet peak demand by ignoring the effects of climate change and possible weather variability outside historical ranges.  This resulted in hourly peak demand 22% above ERCOT’s most extreme forecast during Winter Storm Uri in 2021.
Distributed energy resources (DERs), like local rooftop or community solar paired with battery storage, offer a proven solution for energy resiliency, and cost management.
For example, California ISO issued warnings to conserve power from Sept. 1 until Sept. 8 during a heat wave.  The grid narrowly avoided blackouts.  This success was enabled by the more than 80,000 distributed batteries connected to the California grid which can provide over 900 MW of capacity.  About 76% of these batteries were set to discharge during the peak hours of 4 pm to 9 pm.  This was enabled in part by programs like the Demand Side Grid Support Program from Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern CA Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric which provides additional compensation to customers for dispatching during certain events.
The California Solar and Storage Association estimated that California utilities spent an extra $450 million purchasing electricity on the spot market compared to a “normal” hot day.  Similar investments into local solar and storage would yield benefits over a decade, instead of a single day.
All involved stakeholders, from policymakers down to the individual residential consumer, should recognize the benefits offered by these DERs.  The potential is enormous for new pathways and programs to leverage these resources into aggregated DERs tailored to meet pervasive grid needs in their local and regional context.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/04/mercedes-benz-a-first-customer-of-battery-material-that-boosts-range-by-20/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 4, 2023",Mercedes-Benz a first customer of battery material that boosts range by 20%,"Sila Nanotechnologies, a battery materials provider, announced the commercial availability of Titan Silicon, a drop-in battery material that promises to increase electric vehicle range by 20%.
Titan Silicon replaces conventional graphite anodes with a nano-composite silicon anode that boosts performance and addresses supply chain issues related to graphite. The company announced plans to manufacture enough material to power one million EVs over the next five years.
In May 2022, Mercedes-Benz announced that it had selected Sila’s material for its luxury electric fleet, starting with the G-Class EV model, due out by mid-decade.
As graphite anodes and simple silicon compounds for lithium-ion batteries near their theoretical limits, new anode materials like Sila’s product are sought to extend range, meeting consumer expectations. The 20% range boost provided by the anode could result in up to 100 extra miles for some EVs.
Sila said its product can also dramatically improve battery charging time, charging a battery from 10% to 80% in just 20 minutes, even if the vehicle’s charge time is currently as long as 60 minutes. The company said it targets reducing the 10% to 80% charge time to approximately 10 minutes in the future. These gains in fast-charge time come without sacrifices to cycle life or safety while maintaining low swell, said the company.
The advanced anode material benefits from up to a 15% reduction in battery weight and 20% increase in space compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries, the company said.
The material is currently used in mobile fitness trackers. Titan Silicon is a “drop-in” solution, compatible with any cell form factor, including cylindrical, pouch and prismatic cells.
Sila offers customers a choice of partial or complete graphite replacement based on automaker or cell manufacturing performance goals. Today, over 90% of graphite is mined or processed in China, posing potential supply chain challenges for a high-graphite product.
The materials are all U.S. made, helping contribute toward battery integrators and automakers achieving domestic sourcing goals to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act incentives. The company said its silicon generates 50% to 75% less CO2 per kWh than graphite during production. Sila is also ISO 9001:2015 certified.
A survey conducted by the company found that nearly 90% of respondents who own or intend to purchase an EV view high-performance battery technology as more valuable than other tech enhancements or luxury features, including autonomous driving capabilities.
“Titan Silicon is the highest performing nano-composite silicon in the market today. Our battery and materials teams are constantly iterating and improving upon our chemistry to deliver the best, and most cost-efficient results possible,” said Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO of Sila. “With the wide adoption of EVs, consumers are looking for best-in-class solutions that deliver best-in-class performance, and our solutions provide just that: longer range and faster charge.”
The material has been developed for mass production, with a facility expected to come online in the second half of 2024 at the company’s Moses Lake, Wash. site.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/04/guidance-released-for-energy-community-10-tax-credit-adder/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 4, 2023",Guidance released for energy community 10% tax credit adder,"Renewable energy developers seeking to maximize their receipt of tax credits have now received guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a key provision that adds value to projects sited on “energy communities.”
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a 30% investment tax credit for the cost of developing renewable energy resources, provided developers meet labor requirements. Another 10% adder is applied to projects in energy communities, which have now been defined by the IRS:
A study by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in 2021 showed that landfills in the U.S. could host more than 63 GW of solar capacity, generating 83 TWh of electricity each year. This would equate to $6.6 billion in annual electricity revenues, according to RMI. There are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the nation. These sites often offer good sun exposure and little opportunity for other uses.
A mapping tool from the U.S. Department of Energy can be found here.
LandGate, a leading provider for data solutions and an online marketplace for U.S. commercial land and resources, published a guide for profiting from these energy communities using their PowerData tool.
“We are pleased to see that the Treasury Department adopted many of SEIA’s recommendations, including clear references to government data for qualifying areas, a 50% rule for projects to be located in an energy community, and a commonsense rule for adjoining census tracts,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Ross Hopper continued that there are a number of items that still require guidance from the Treasury Department, including domestic content, transferability, and the manufacturing production tax credit.
SEIA accomplishments
In November 2022, SEIA made numerous recommendations in filings with the Treasury department, many of which were adopted in the final guidance:
The Inflation Reduction Act generally defines “energy communities” with respect to certain types of U.S. government statistical data areas, such as “census tracts,” “metropolitan statistical areas,” and “non-metropolitan statistical areas.” However, the Act did not specify which vintages of these areas should be used by taxpayers. Today’s guidance clarifies which data sets will apply, and the mapping tool reflects and will reflect those data sets in a user-friendly way.
The IRA also did not specify if clean energy projects were required to be entirely contained within an energy community. The guidance adopts SEIA’s proposal that if 50% or more of a project’s nameplate capacity or square footage is in an energy community, it will qualify for an adder credit.
The act also did not define “adjoining” census tracts for purposes of determining energy communities near closed coal mines or coal-fired power plants. The guidance also adopts SEIA’s proposal that single-point adjacency, like adjoining corners in the case of quadrangle census tract shapes, is sufficient to be an “adjoining” census tract.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/04/from-brownfields-to-brightfields-a-land-filled-with-renewables-opportunity/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 4, 2023",From brownfields to brightfields: A land-filled with renewables opportunity,"One of the biggest debates that can arise during the development of a renewables project is where to put the projects. Ideal locations for these land-intensive projects often overlap with agricultural land, community resources, and environmentally or economically valuable land.  
Siting renewables projects on land that is no longer useful – aka  brownfield development  – provides a clever solution to the conundrum. Building solar on land that has already been disturbed or damaged by previous human action is often referred to as turning brownfields to brightfields. 
Landfills, oil refineries, and superfund sites are increasingly popular locations for solar development in the eyes of the public and the energy industry. These sites are often closed to traditional redevelopment, which limits opposition and competition for the land. And there are plenty of them. In fact, the EPA estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfield sites across America – sites that pose health and safety hazards for the communities around them, and are daily reminders of past productivity.  
However, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), this left-behind legacy of the industrial revolution – closed landfills, shuttered coal plants, superfunds and brownfields – are excellent opportunities for clean energy development.  
Brownfield development helps accelerate renewable deployment and furthers environmental and land stewardship. It also creates benefits for nearby Low- and Moderate-Income (LMI) communities, helping with environmental and social aspects of Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) goals.
Several years ago, the EPA, with BQ Energy’s assistance, created RE-Powering America’s Land, an initiative that encourages renewable energy development on contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites when such development is aligned with the community’s vision for the site.  
Thanks to the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, this sector of renewables development is poised for even more growth.  Specifically, the IRA’s “energy community” provisions offer substantial economic incentives for landfill-to-solar development. According to the IRA, “energy communities” are defined to include: 
Projects located in these “energy communities” will qualify for a 10% increase to the base and bonus credits. The tax credit adder of 10%, over and above the 30% investment tax credit, brings the total potential tax credit to 40%. 
With policy now supporting brownfield development, we are seeing a substantial uptick in this sector. The EPA tracks a number of landfill to solar projects across the U.S. – either completed, under construction or planned. As of the end of 2022, solar landfills have a capacity of about 2.4 GW, or enough to power an estimated 500,000 homes. 
Today, following the acquisition of BQ Energy by CleanCapital, the teams work together on brownfield to brightfield projects that not only advance the energy transition but also put underutilized and polluted land to new use with myriad climate and community-related benefits. 
The Sunnyside Solar project in Houston, Texas is a great example of the multifaceted benefits brownfield development can provide. Not only is it slated to be the largest urban solar project in the nation built on a landfill, but Sunnyside will also provide a myriad of community benefits.
This 240-acre former landfill, which sat dormant for more than five decades, will be transformed into a solar facility that will provide enough energy for 5,000 to 10,000 homes. It also includes 2MW of community solar, which provides opportunity for residents of Houston to directly benefit from the economics of the solar. The project will also provide training and jobs to local workers during construction and operation.
During this pivotal time in the renewable energy industry, projects like Sunnyside Solar are needed more than ever. Repurposing brownfield/landfills to clean solar energy is crucial to reaching our nation’s clean energy goals, fighting the climate crisis, and improving the quality of life for the LMI communities surrounding these sites. There has never been a better time to turn our nations polluted lands into brightfields — beacons for our clean energy future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/04/rhode-island-considering-solar-for-all-new-construction-and-parking-lots/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RHODE ISLAND",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 4, 2023",Rhode Island considering solar for all new construction and parking lots,"Rhode Island representative Jennifer Boylan has submitted legislation that would mandate the inclusion of solar power in all newly constructed single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, large commercial buildings, and parking lots exceeding 16,000 sq. ft.
The legislation, titled the Solar Neighborhoods Act, calls for the Rhode Island Building Code Commission to establish new code requirements for each of the aforementioned construction types. The document specifies that, at a minimum, the Code Commission must add code provisions to address:
The legislation also recommends that the Code Commission consider amending the building code to account for roof orientation and angle, roofing materials that minimize or require no roof penetrations, conduit for wiring from roof to electrical panels, and the inclusion of level 2 electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
The legislation also proposes unique code requirements for each building type. For example, single-family dwelling solar systems should be able to meet at least 80% of onsite electricity usage, unless batteries and other energy efficiency measures are incorporated, in which case 40% of electricity demands must be met. Code requirements for multi-family and multi-story buildings would consider the limited roof space and the higher electricity demand of the structures.
The legislation further requires outdoor parking lots larger than 16,000 sq. ft to install raised solar-panel canopies covering at least 50% of the parking lot’s surface, and that 5% of the parking spaces must feature electric vehicle charging stations. Moreover, 20% of parking spaces should be equipped with the infrastructure, such as underground wiring, to accommodate additional EV charging stations in the future.
The bill also includes provisions allowing developers to demonstrate that a specific site may not be viable for a solar power project due to factors such as natural or constructed barriers shading 70% or more of the roof space, or the presence of a “green roof” (made from layers of vegetation). Low-income housing projects may be exempt if they lack the necessary funds to include solar installations in their budget.
The press release issued by Boylan highlights that California has already implemented a new construction solar mandate, and that a similar measure is under consideration in neighboring Massachusetts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/04/soltage-begins-work-on-7-24-mw-pollinator-friendly-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,ILLINOIS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 4, 2023",Soltage begins work on 7.24 MW pollinator-friendly portfolio,"Soltage, a Jersey City, N.J.-based utility and distributed generation solar developer, launched the construction of three Illinois community solar projects with 7.24 MWdc of total power generation. 
Two of the projects, Bolton Freeport Solar 1 (2.58 MW) and Freeport Fairview Solar 2 (2.58 MW), are located in Commonwealth Edison service territory in northern Illinois, and the third project, Danville Michigan Solar 1 (1.81 MW), is located in Ameren’s service territory in Danville, Ill., in the eastern part of the state. 
MC Squared Energy Services is the subscription manager for the community solar platform, while the customer concentration is expected to consist of residential, local commercial businesses and municipal customers in the Freeport and Danville areas. 
“Customers who subscribe to these projects receive significant savings on their electricity bills, as well as price certainty over time as these projects will be running for many decades,” said Jon Cole, senior vice president of development, Soltage. These projects demonstrate Soltage’s commitment to build out clean energy infrastructure to serve Illinois customers. The addition of these projects brings Soltage’s community solar portfolio in the state to 11 projects, the company said. 
 The three projects, once constructed, are anticipated to provide more than 10,000 MWh of clean energy per year and operate for a minimum of 40 years. 
 A Soltage spokeswoman told pv magazine USA that the three projects are employing an agrivoltaics protocol utilizing a native pollinator species at each of the project sites. These will feature 27 varieties of low-profile and pollinator-friendly native vegetation planted across over 20 acres of land. In addition to producing clean energy, the projects will serve as a critical habitat for local flora and fauna, the company said. 
“Dual-use projects serve multiple purposes and generate many values that jump off the page when you take a second to look at them,” Dan French, executive producer of Solar Farm Summit, LLC, told pv magazine USA.  “Solar developers are starting to figure it out, and the fact that agrivoltaics is scaling so strongly in Illinois is powerful evidence that these practices can already pencil. Proper cropping may not come at scale until down the road a ways, but we know that advanced conservation with beneficial vegetation works now, and that’s why it’s booming,” French added.
The Illinois Community Solar Program was enacted in 2018 by the Future Energy Jobs Act to support the development of new distributed generation and community solar projects across Illinois. A component of the program, the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, obligates the Illinois Commerce Commission to take various actions to implement new programs, initiatives, and directives to further the State’s goals of transitioning the state to 100% clean energy. 
 According to the Illinois Shines’ website, the state has 62 community solar projects in operation or advanced development across the Ameren and ComEd territories.  
 By the end of 2023, ComEd recently said it expects to double its current cumulative installation to more than 150 community solar projects installed, serving more than 36,000 customers across its more than 11,400 square mile service territory in northern Illinois. The utility recently completed its 75th community solar project, Speedway Solar, a 2.5 MW facility in Joliet, Illinois, built by Summit Ridge Energy. 
 Solar in Illinois practically did not exist until 2019, when the Illinois Shines program was introduced, creating renewable energy credits that pay residential and commercial solar asset owners based on their system’s production. The state has also a rich community solar offering under Illinois Shines and a healthy mix of residential, commercial, and community solar installations. 
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Illinois ranks tenth in the U.S. by its robust 5.7 GW development pipeline of projects to be installed over the next five years. The state brought online 583 MW of projects in 2022, SEIA reports.
