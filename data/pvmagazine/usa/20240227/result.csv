While module procurement decisions in the past several years have largely been dictated by price, shifting dynamics in the industry are changing that. Factors such as supply chain reliability and traceability, changes in module technologies, and extreme weather events are shifting the decision-making processes for purchasers. A pv magazine USA webinar featuring Clean Energy Associates dives into the variables to consider in today’s module procurement market.
Anza said solar and storage procurement processes have historically relied on inefficient, manual, and offline processes that are incompatible with today’s dynamic market.
Purchasers need to be able to react quickly to changing market complexities like equipment pricing volatility extreme weather and counterparty risk to external supply-chain factors like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and the ongoing Auxin petition related to antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD).
“Procurement professionals have to navigate a vast field of module options, and without access to real-time data to evaluate risk and other key factors, they are left having to make critical multi-million-dollar decisions with limited information,” said Mike Hall, chief executive officer, Anza.
Anza’s platform includes decision-making supporting features, including:
Anza was launched in May 2023 as an independent company. Its platform has facilitated more than 25 GW of solar and 60 GWh of energy storage across 650 projects to date.

1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/27/massachusetts-lawmakers-urged-to-adopt-million-solar-roofs-equivalent/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-27,Massachusetts lawmakers urged to adopt “million solar roofs” equivalent,"Massachusetts is among the most densely populated states in the United States. Despite the land use constraints caused by a dense population, the state has made considerable progress installing small-scale solar. However, the state has a long way to go to meet its clean energy targets, and solar is expected to serve the bulk of the capacity added.
The state’s Climate Plan for 2050 estimates that between 27 GW and 34 GW of solar would be required to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by midcentury. The Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) reports that 4.3 GW of solar was installed through Q3 2023, so there is a long runway for growth.
With this growth path comes the opportunity to ensure that solar is built in a way that preserves Massachusetts’ many forests, farmlands, and other undisturbed lands.
Johanna Neumann, acting director of Environment Massachusetts, urged lawmakers to take action to consider adopting a “million solar roofs” equivalent in the state. In California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s million solar roofs initiative helped the state launch the nation’s largest rooftop solar market, which represented roughly 50% of the nation’s rooftop solar deployment at its peak.
Neumann’s plan for Massachusetts would enact a goal to install the equivalent of a million solar roofs, or 10 GW, by 2030. Those interested in supporting this measure can sign a petition from Environment America.
“Today, in Massachusetts, you can get your energy straight from your roof,” Neumann told lawmakers. “It’s making less and less sense to pay for power from a distant plant spewing pollution when we can soak up the sun on our rooftops.”
As of 2022, Massachusetts has tapped about 10.8% of its total rooftop solar potential, said Environment America. The state ranks 11 nationwide for total solar deployment and fourth in small-scale solar deployment.
Why rooftop?
Rooftop solar “has myriad benefits for the environment and consumers,” said a report from Environment America. This includes reducing the need for dirty power plants and expensive transmission lines, providing lower costs, and can help to increase the grid’s resilience to extreme weather and other shocks.
Distributed solar helps squeeze other emitting sources off the grid. Take the 1.4 GW Mystic Generating Station serving the ISO New England grid operator region. The natural gas plant used to be fired up in the winter to prevent blackouts, but the grid operator said increased solar capacity has made the grid reliable enough to shut Mystic down. Over 5.4 GW of solar, most of it rooftop, has helped enable the transition away from fossil fuels, even in the harsh New England winter.
Another environmental benefit of rooftop solar is the reduction of land use for energy development, sometimes referred to as “energy sprawl.” For each gigawatt of rooftop solar installed in lieu of utility-scale projects, over 5,200 acres of land are saved.
Further, rooftop solar can save the nation on rising transmission needs and costs.
“Because rooftop solar generates power that can be used on-site reduces the need for transmission from central generating stations, potentially saving states and municipalities time and money on their energy transitions,” said the report. “To reach renewable energy targets, some expansion of transmission infrastructure will be necessary, but maximizing the potential of rooftop solar can help to minimize the amount we need to build.”
Solar is also now the most cost-effective new generation source in most markets and most conditions in the United States. On average, new-build solar costs 29% less than the next-cheapest fossil fuel alternative.

The Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy study (LA100) explored how different approaches to achieving carbon neutrality affected air quality and health outcomes in Los Angeles over time. The researchers used 2012 as a baseline year compared to health and air quality outcomes across four adoption scenarios by 2045. 
Results showed that each scenario explored could reduce citywide air pollutant emissions like oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
The most significant reductions in emissions resulted from electrification and infrastructural changes to the non-power sector, such as transportation, buildings, the Port of Los Angeles, and the Port of Long Beach. This is due to reduced air pollutant emissions that led to citywide reductions of PM2.5 concentration.
However, researchers state that reductions also led to an increase in ozone  concentration in certain parts of Los Angeles, which they attribute to “temporary but inevitable growing pains” the city will experience as it works toward ozone reductions.
“Once NOx emissions get sufficiently low, further emission decreases will lead to marked ozone reductions,” the researchers stated.
The study found that health outcomes reflected air quality changes. For example, in one scenario, researchers state that 96 premature deaths and 53 cardiovascular-related hospital admissions were avoided. However, there was an increase of 30 asthma-related emergency room visits resulting from the rise in ozone concentrations.
NREL said a health outcomes focused scenario translates to about $900 million in yearly monetized health benefits for the City of Los Angeles. The figure exceeded $4 billion when adding the monetized health benefits of neighboring counties.
NREL conducted a follow-up study, LA100: The Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study and Equity Strategies, to assess how air pollution affects different demographic groups. They focused on heavy-duty transportation electrification as a tool to reduce air pollutant emissions, concentrations and health effects. They found that electrifying large trucks could help to reduce air quality-related health disparities as many members of disadvantaged communities in Los Angeles live near major highways.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/27/all-floating-pv-technologies-at-a-glance/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BERNADETTE GEYER,2024-02-27,All floating PV technologies at a glance,"From pv magazine Global
An international research team has compiled and reviewed published literature on floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) systems from 2013-2022 and how water-based systems compare to those based on land. The paper summarizes the important findings of a broad range of studies on FPV systems and presents a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art of the technology, its benefits and challenges, and highlights research gaps.
The study’s corresponding author, Ramanan Chidambaram Jayaraj, told pv magazine that the team reviewed more than 300 articles, as well as patents, industry websites, and reports. The researchers charted the energy gain in FPV relative to LPV for 19 different reports examining FPV technologies ranging in size and tilt angle, as well as the efficiency gain for 10 different reports. For this report, the team excluded from their review studies that investigated submerged and partially submerged PV as well as systems that were in contact with water for cooling.
“With 70% of the world covered with water, research and development of FPV on ocean platforms opens a new era of solar energy with the advancement of robust floating structures,” the scientists emphasized. “However, it should be noted that oceans are not necessarily calm, and harsh ocean currents may pose serious challenges to FPV structures. Therefore, research and development efforts addressing this issue are crucial.”
The researchers noted that the results of the studies reviewed suggest that the increased energy production capacity from FPVs can potentially result in a decrease of up to 85% in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) compared to land-based PV (LPV) systems, even despite the higher initial capital investment. Data compiled from the literature showed potential energy yield increases of up to 35.9% for FPV compared to conventional systems. They highlight several factors that affect the ability to achieve this maximum performance, including irradiance level, tilt angle, temperature, and cooling effect, among others.
The team also observed a range between 0.1% and 4.45% for the efficiency gain of FPVs against LPVs, as well as improvements of 2.4% to 3.3% for FPVs employing tracking technology. Additionally, the reviewed studies showed that bifacial floating solar panels that also use dual-axis tracking and cooling effects could even achieve gains of 42.5% to 47.5%.
“Based on the comprehensive review spanning from 2013 to 2022, it has been consistently demonstrated that floating photovoltaic systems outperform conventional land solar PV systems under homogeneous conditions,” they concluded. Additionally, they emphasized that FPV integrated with hydropower dams “not only maximizes renewable energy generation but also capitalizes on existing infrastructure, potentially revolutionizing the energy landscape.”
The study included a discussion of challenges faced by FPV systems, noting that factors such as the varying elevation of land in the pathway of the panels – as well as rocks, grass, and other panels – can influence the effectiveness of wind in cooling the panels. It cites a case where the temperature of an FPV was higher than that of a rooftop system during peak sun hours, emphasizing that performance is “highly dependent” on the system’s location.
The group explained that certain limitations emerged from the analyses reviewed in the study. “The existing techno-economic analyses and predictions on FPV performance often rely on software tools, which offer advantages in terms of cost, time, and resource efficiency compared to traditional research methods,” it said. “However, these software tools often require significant modifications to their user interfaces to adequately accommodate the unique characteristics and requirements of FPV systems. Additionally, some studies have found that even reputable solar PV software may not be fully capable of accurately predicting the performance of FPV systems.”
The results of the review are available in the study “Towards sustainable power generation: Recent advancements in floating photovoltaic technologies – ScienceDirect,” which was published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The team comprises researchers from Malaysia’s Curtin University and India’s Energy Institute Bangalore and Assam Energy Institute.
The researchers stressed that “there is a pressing need for further development of software dedicated to numerical modeling and prediction specifically tailored for FPV applications. This development would enable more accurate and reliable assessments of FPV performance, contributing to the advancement and widespread adoption of the technology in the renewable energy sector.”

Cross-party discussions and the resulting uncertainties about future developments and political support continue to burden the European PV industry. Unlike in Spain and Poland, for example, this does not necessarily seem to be slowing down the growth of solar in Germany.
After a successful year in 2023, the new year began with promising figures. More than 1 GW of PV was deployed in Germany in January and this growth should continue unabated in February. This can be deduced from the sales figures of manufacturers and wholesalers.
However, higher demand is colliding with the hesitant shipment strategies of manufacturers. Apparently, after the shock of large inventories caused by overproduction last year, capacity in China has been significantly reduced and market oversupply has been curbed. This is an attempt to stop the dramatic price slide that began last year.
However, this is only happening gradually at the moment. There was no longer a significant downward correction in prices in February, but rather a sideways movement. A small price drop was only observed for high-efficiency modules.
Module prices were on a downward trend due to existing stocks from last fall, with volumes starting to slowly flow out. Nevertheless, installers are well advised to stock up on modules and inverters in good time for the next few months. Future module deliveries will be delayed and products will be slightly more expensive.
Artificial shortages and increased transport costs are affecting availability. Many suppliers will only offer high-performance modules and larger hybrid inverters to new customers starting in April or May. Orders for large-format modules, mainly used in ground-mounted projects, may only be fulfilled in June.
The perception that undersupply and long delivery times were over has changed. A general two-week standstill in China during Chinese New Year and longer delivery times for container goods, now up to eight weeks, indicate a prolonged dry spell. This may only be resolved by products with weaker performance. Unfortunately, there is no strong European solar industry to mitigate such trade turbulence in the near future.
If the reports and alarmist statements on social media networks are to be believed, we are even threatened with the exodus or closure of the remaining German solar industry. To prevent this, politicians should strive to create fair conditions for local producers and finally abolish European tariffs on preliminary products, as they did for finished solar modules. The farmer protests taking place everywhere show us that a pure subsidy policy without strategies for the transition to fair and sustainable competition leads to nothing but resentment and a loud counter-movement as soon as the subsidy is collected again.
Overview of the price points differentiated by technology in January 2024, including the changes compared to the preceding month (as of Feb. 19, 2024):

This funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is intended to support community-driven energy projects, such as microgrids for community health centers, which strengthen energy security and delivers economic opportunities in rural and remote regions.
Rural and remote communities face a unique set of energy challenges and often have higher electric bills, unreliable energy supplies and some have no access to electricity at all. For example, 21% of Navajo Nation homes and 35% of Hopi Indian Tribe homes remain unelectrified, according to a 2022 report by DOE’s Office of Indian Energy. Low-income residents consistently face an energy burden three times higher than other households, according to the DOE.
The projects are part of DOE’s Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas (ERA) program, which is managed by the DOE Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED).  The selected projects cover a range of clean energy technologies, from solar, battery storage systems and microgrids to hydropower, heat pumps, biomass, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Of the 17 funded projects, 12 are solar and 11 of those include energy storage. At least 12 projects will support tribal communities, such as the Navajo and Hopi Nations, who plan to install solar and battery energy storage systems to provide electricity for 300 homes. Another project expects its proposed tribal clean energy projects to save every Taos Pueblo household in its service area an estimated $700 per year by transitioning to clean energy.

Swiss PV manufacturer Meyer Burger has decided to discontinue solar module production in March in Freiberg, Germany, in a bid to stop sustained losses in Europe. The company will instead concentrate on building up its production facilities in the United States.
“As there has not yet been any decision on policy support measures to remediate current market distortions created by oversupply and dumping prices of solar modules, the group has decided to start preparations for the closure of its Freiberg site,” the company said on Friday.
The company said it expects significant cost savings from April. Sales activities in Europe will be unaffected and customers will receive full -product warranties for up to 30 years, it added.
Europe’s solar manufacturers have urged the European Union to step in with emergency measures to protect them from insolvency. Earlier this month, the bloc finalized the Net Zero Industry Act, under which at least 40% of solar equipment deployed on the continent should be locally produced. However, thus far it has failed to introduce any emergency measures that would help to safeguard ailing businesses.
Meyer Burger said that it will seek shareholder approval for a rights issue of as much as CHF 250 million to finance the completion of its U.S. manufacturing facilities in Colorado and Arizona.
“The rights issue is an attractive proposal to our investors as they can invest into the highly attractive US business where we are positioned to have the potential to grow a profitable business,” Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt said on Friday. “Furthermore, a clear focus on our US business makes us independent of political decisions in Europe.”
Eventually, the company’s goal is to close the funding gap of CHF 450 million with a combination of the rights issue, an export agency credit guarantee from the German government of up to $95 million, and either the “45X” advanced manufacturing production tax credit under the US Inflation Reduction Act, in the amount to $300 million, or a US Department of Energy loan.
Meyer Burger said it expects to use these potential sources of financing to complete its solar cell manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and its solar module manufacturing site in Goodyear, Arizona. Both facilities are currently under construction, with a targeted production capacity of 2 GW each.
“Due to a lack of European protection against unfair competition from China, nearly four years of hard work by great employees in Europe is at risk,” said Sentis, which is Meyer Burger’s largest shareholder with a 10.01% stake.
In reaction to Meyer Burger’s announcement on Friday, SolarPower Europe Walburga Hemetsberger said that “this only underlines the absolute urgency with which policymakers should act. Are governments happy to leave our energy transition goals entirely in the hands of others?”

7,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/27/energy-vault-begins-building-first-of-its-kind-green-hydrogen-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-02-27,Energy Vault begins building first-of-its-kind green hydrogen storage project,"Utility-scale energy storage company Energy Vault has begun constructing what will be the largest green hydrogen long-duration energy storage project in the U.S., located in Northern California.
The green hydrogen and battery storage facility, which will be able to provide 293 MWh of energy, is being built in the city of Calistoga, in utility Pacific Gas & Electric’s service territory. Calistoga is especially prone to public safety power shut-offs – that is, proactive outages that the utility deploys when weather conditions increase the risk of wildfires caused by its power lines. PG&E’s infrastructure has been linked with multiple wildfires in Northern California and in 2019, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of these liabilities.
The Calistoga Resiliency Center, as the project is called, is expected to be completed by the end of Q2 2024, at which point it will be “the first-of-its-kind and the largest utility-scale green hydrogen energy storage project in the United States,” according to Energy Vault. The facility will essentially replace the diesel generators that PG&E currently uses to maintain back-up power in the region during wildfire-related outages. It will be able to power downtown Calistoga and the areas immediately around it, including critical facilities like fire and police stations, for up to 48 hours.
Since this project is a first-of-its kind, it required specific design and engineering capabilities, according to Marco Terruzzin, the company’s chief product officer.
The new facility’s “innovative design is an example of two proven technologies – hydrogen fuel cells and batteries – being used in concert on a single site to provide high-quality emission-free power,” Terruzzin told pv magazine USA.
The facility will operate independently from the wider grid, meaning the fuel cells and batteries must work together to provide a ‘grid-forming’ electricity supply which must reach instantaneously to the demands of the Calistoga microgrid and increase or decrease power output accordingly, he added.
“Deploying cost-effective, next-generation energy supply and long-term storage technologies is essential to ensuring grid reliability and to achieving PG&E’s goal of a net zero energy system by 2040,” Mike Delaney, PG&E’s vice president of utility partnerships and innovation, said.
Under the companies’ 10.5-year agreement, Energy Vault will own and operate the center, providing PG&E with dispatchable power. The company plans to use its energy management system, dubbed VaultOS™, to optimize the project’s operations.
The California market is particularly appealing to Energy Vault when it comes to ultra-long duration energy storage solutions because of the increased risk of prolonged wildfire-related shutoffs, Terruzzin said.
More broadly, the company is seeing an increased interest in the use of green hydrogen in utility-scale microgrids from utilities looking for configurations similar to the one being constructed in Calistoga, as well as from the public and private sectors interested in multi-day resiliency solutions, he added.
“We expect that interest to increase as customers shift their focus from simple [power purchase agreements] to 24/7 PPAs that match their electric power hour-by-hour with the electricity being generated in the region in which the customer’s electric load is located,” he said.
