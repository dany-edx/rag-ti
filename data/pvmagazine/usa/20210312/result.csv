Mainspring Energy Inc. has launched the Mainspring Linear Generator, a fully dispatchable and fuel-flexible power generation technology for commercial and industrial buildings, utilities, and microgrids. Mainspring’s technology, based on research originally conducted by the company’s co-founders in a thermodynamics laboratory at Stanford University, is designed to meet clean energy and power resiliency demands.
The product’s design uses a low-temperature reaction of air and fuel to drive magnets through copper coils to efficiently produce electricity. The company said this design, combined with the company’s adaptive control software, enables near-zero NOx emissions, full dispatchability, and seamless switching between natural gas and renewable fuels like biogas and hydrogen. The product’s load-following capability also means it pairs well with onsite solar or battery storage, dispatching power when needed. More info available here
Engineering company Solar Support now offers independent plant and equipment end-of-warranty assessment services for utility-scale solar PV asset owners. The company said the services include onsite review of system and equipment performance, as well as detailed documentation owners can use to secure support before EPC and manufacturer warranties lapse. This work builds upon Solar Support’s inverter predictive analysis program launched last fall.
The company said warranty length varies—typically two years for construction and five years for equipment such as central inverters. Given a 28- to 35-year plant lifespan, asset owners could face full responsibility for decades of maintenance and repair after warranties expire. More info available here.
T2M Global recently was awarded a $1.3 million project from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to develop and validate its Advanced Electrolyzer System (AES) technology, a 100 kW-class green electrolytic hydrogen energy storage module. When successful, the company claimed, the electrical system efficiency of this hydrogen electrolyzer will double compared to some existing products in the market today. The AES system can be powered by using excess electricity or other waste energy streams. CEC solicited proposals to fund the development of emerging energy storage technologies to diversify its portfolio. More info available here.
KiloVault unveiled its new 2V 1000 XLC lead carbon, sealed AGM, deep-cycle energy storage battery. Designed for optimum performance in partial-state-of-charge applications, the XLC is well suited for high-demand off-grid or battery backup applications. The company said the XLC provides flexible and reliable storage for smart grids, hybrid power supply systems, and microgrids.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/12/iowa-project-goes-online-boosting-states-solar-market/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,IOWA",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 12, 2021","Iowa project goes online, boosting state’s solar market","Idaho-based developer Clenera flipped the switch on its 127.5 MW, $100 million Wapello Solar project in Louisa County, Iowa.
Located in far eastern Iowa, Wapello Solar is now among the largest projects in the Hawkeye State, almost doubling the state’s previously recorded solar total. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Iowa had about 150 MW and ranked 38th in the nation for installed solar capacity as of the fourth quarter of 2020.
The project features 318,000 bifacial solar panels supplied by Risen Energy that are fixed to FTC Solar’s Voyager single-axis trackers, which are optimized for bifacial performance. The project covers nearly 800 acres and includes 34 SunGrow inverters.
Besides acting as project developer, Clenera will provide ongoing asset management. The company partnered with RES (Renewable Energy Systems) to build the project in six months.
Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) will buy the project’s output through a 25-year power purchase agreement.
Clenera said its current operating portfolio exceeds 1.4 GW, with more than 13 GW of solar and energy storage assets in development across the U.S.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/12/10-energy-bills-to-watch-in-the-2021-state-legislative-session/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARIZONA,CALIFORNIA,CONNECTICUT,GEORGIA,HAWAII,INDIANA,KENTUCKY,MAINE,OHIO",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 12, 2021",10 energy bills to watch in the 2021 state legislative session,"The 2021 state legislative sessions are underway and multiple solar, renewable energy, and clean energy bills are being considered. pv magazine thinks these 10, organized by state, deserve close attention.
HB 2498 would set up a Clean Energy Technology Improvement Grant Program. As written, the bill would offer grants to companies and institutions working to develop new and innovative uses of clean energy technology that also increase electric grid efficiency, system reliability, and resiliency, all while keeping the state’s energy affordable.
The program would draw on $5 million from the state’s general fund in fiscal year 2021-2022. The bill was initially drafted to focus on battery storage technologies, but was expanded to include clean energy as a whole.
California has the most proposed clean energy legislation of any state so far in 2021. These two are worth watching.
SB 207 would require the state’s Secretary for Environmental Protection to convene the Photovoltaic Recycling Advisory Group by April 1 next year to review and advise the legislature on policies aimed at recycling PV modules and their components.
By April 1, 2025, the group would have to submit policy recommendations to lawmakers aimed at ensuring that 100% of PV panels in the state, or as close to 100% as possible, are reused or recycled at end of life in a safe and cost-effective manner.
AB 1325 would require the state’s Public Utility Commission to develop and implement a Clean Community Microgrid Incentive Program by 2022. The program would fund community distributed energy resource microgrids in vulnerable communities.
Program budget would be dispersed in phases to local public agencies for community microgrid development. The program would be overseen by a third-party, non-public utility administrator.
The legislature’s Joint Committee on Energy and Technology introduced a bill setting energy storage procurement and deployment mandates.
Specifically, RB 952 would require the state to deploy 300 MW of energy storage by the end of 2024, 650 MW by the end of 2027, and 1 GW by the end of 2030. What the bill does not do is specify how these capacities would be deployed among residential, commercial, and utility-scale storage installations, although there would be specific megawatt blocks for each type.
The bill also calls for research into programs and rate designs to incentivize energy storage deployments that most effectively provide positive net present value to all ratepayers; provide multiple types of benefits to the electric grid (like peak shaving, ancillary services and, demand response); promote a state-based electric energy storage industry; and maximize the value from the participation of energy storage systems in capacity markets.
Financial incentives would be capped at $30 million per year for each of the state’s utilities.
Multiple lawmakers introduced a bill that supports establishing a state goal of 100% clean energy by 2050.
Unlike a renewable portfolio standard or specific mandate, this bill is more of a nod to cities, businesses, environmental groups, and other entities in Georgia that have called on the state to make the 100% renewable transition.
The bill also notes that the fact that low-income communities are disproportionately harmed by fossil fuel pollution and pay on average more than 40% of their annual income in home energy costs make the transition all the more important.
Perhaps the boldest legislation under consideration this session comes from Hawaii, where HB 111 looks to eliminate all types of fossil fuels for electricity generation.
The state earlier passed legislation eliminating the use of coal for electricity production. HB 111 goes further, prohibiting all fossil fuels for electricity generation or storage by the end of 2045.
The bill would also prohibit state regulators from approving cost recovery of any application or proposal for generation or storage facilities that use fossil fuels. Only fossil fueled emergency generators would be exempt from HB 111.
SB 420 would require all Hoosier State electricity suppliers to offer net metering to all new distributed solar customers, either until the aggregate net metering project capacity equals at least 5% of the supplier’s most recent summer peak load, or July 1, 2027, whichever occurs earlier.
The state’s current net metering mandate has a 1.5% peak load cap, or July 1, 2022.
The bill would require all of the state’s net metering tariffs to be phased out by July 1, 2052, and would raise the maximum net-metered project size from 1 MW to 5 MW.
A bill would ban developing solar on agricultural lands. Also within the text of SB 266 is a ban on solar project development on “watercourses or other bodies of water” within the state.
While efforts to ban the development of solar on farmland are nothing new, this is the first instance known to pv magazine of an attempt to ban floating solar.
The bill justifies the development ban by framing it as an effort to end the loss of natural resources located on and within the state’s farmland and waterways.
Legislators introduced a bill that would set an energy storage deployment goal. SP 213 would set a goal of 100 MW of energy storage capacity to be installed in the state by the end of 2025.
The bill also recognizes the value in energy storage’s ability to reduce peak electricity demand.
Besides storage, the bill directs state regulators to look at opportunities to modernize transmission and distribution utility rate designs through time-of-use rates; develop and implement a pilot program to test and evaluate those rates; and develop and implement a schedule to regularly review and update rate designs.
Similar to a piece of legislation under consideration in Minnesota, Ohio lawmakers are considering HB 20, which would prohibit condominium, homeowners, and neighborhood associations from imposing unreasonable limitations on solar system installations on the roof or exterior walls of dwellings.
The bill defines “unreasonable limitations” as something that significantly increases the cost, or significantly decreases the efficiency of a solar system.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/12/sunrise-brief-lg-plans-massive-u-s-investment-in-battery-production-for-evs-and-energy-storage/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MARCH 12, 2021",Sunrise brief: LG plans massive U.S. investment in battery production for EVs and energy storage,"LG Energy Solution said that it plans to invest more than $4.5 billion over the next four years to expand its battery production capacity in the U.S. by 70 GWh. The expansion will give the company a total production capacity of more than 110 GWh in the U.S.
In addition to a new battery facility, the company and automaker GM are discussing plans to build a second joint venture plant in the U.S.
LG Energy Solution invested $600 million to build a 5 GWh capacity plant in Michigan in 2012. Two years ago, it formed a joint venture with GM to build a $2.3 billion battery plant in Ohio. That facility is slated for completion in 2022 and will have an annual production capacity of 35 GWh.
The latest proposed plant will produce pouch cell batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems, as well as cylindrical cell EV batteries. The company said it will select two candidate sites for the new plant later this year before making its final pick.
Home energy storage company Electriq Power said it signed a three-year private label deal valued at up to $200 million for its PowerPod home energy storage systems. The deal was with an unnamed U.S.-based power generation systems and equipment manufacturer.
Under the agreement, California-based Electriq Power will supply home energy storage devices for distribution and sales by the customer in North America and the Caribbean, beginning in the second quarter. Electriq also will provide system integration, product packaging, testing and certifications, communications, firmware, software portals, a network operations center, and associated user apps.
Electriq Power’s technology includes a lithium-iron-phosphate battery, hybrid battery/solar inverter, home energy management system, and an energy consumption meter. The system offers backup power as well as a smart home energy software app to manage electricity use.
The U.S. Department of Energy announced $18 million in funding for four projects aimed at helping passenger vehicles operate more efficiently and reduce energy consumption. The funding is part of Phase II of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy’s (ARPA-E) Next-Generation Energy Technologies for Connected and Automated On-Road Vehicles (NEXTCAR) program.
Phase I involved 10 teams that shared $32 million in funding. That phase focused on connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies for use in all vehicle classes with the goal of enabling a 20% reduction in energy consumption. Teams that moved on to Phase II will focus on light-duty passenger vehicles, achieving a 30% reduction in energy consumption, and enabling vehicles to reach Level 4 automation, in which a vehicle handles all driving operations on its own with optional human override.
The four teams tapped for Phase II funding are:
Additional funding will be provided later for demonstration and testing activities.
