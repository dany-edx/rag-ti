https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/12/next-gen-community-solar-characterized-by-resilience-equity-ev-charging-co-location/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 12, 2022","Next-gen community solar characterized by resilience, equity, EV charging co-location","Community solar has expanded access to clean energy to many in the United States, bucking the traditional centralized power plant model for one that brings energy generation closer to the point of demand. In three short years, the Biden Administration targets 5 million US households to be served by community solar, leading to an estimated $1 billion in utility bill savings.
Community solar projects are distribution-level (i.e., not direct-connected to high voltage, interstate transmission) solar facilities that typically range between half a megawatt to 10MW. Through a subscription-based model, community solar connects renters, homeowners, and businesses without a viable roof for solar to a source of local energy.
Recently, New York State surpassed 1GW of total community solar capacity, edging out Minnesota as the top state for development. Remarking on the milestone, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said, “Reaching this nation-leading milestone – with more than one gigawatt of community solar installed – is a testament to New York’s aggressive pursuit of clean-energy alternatives that will supercharge our economy and bring us one step closer to a carbon-neutral future.”
This distributed model of energy has been studied to have numerous benefits in lowering transmission costs and efficiency losses, improves security, climate resiliency, and brings financial benefits closer to community stakeholders. With the rapid deployment outlook for community solar comes the opportunity to build it in a way that really emphasizes the “community” aspect. A concept, called “community solar+”, was introduced in a report by Rocky Mountain Institute.
The report outlines four core values to the next-gen community solar+: 
The report also recommends the buildout of solar PV parking canopies, pointing to the benefits of reducing urban heat island effects and providing weather protection.
RMI recommends that these projects leverage underutilized sites such as arenas, airports, hospitals and health centers, schools, malls, parking facilities, landfills, or multifamily housing. By accessing a larger customer base, these projects can be built larger than a typical rooftop solar project, and thus benefit from economies of scale.
The report outlines that EV charging buildout could be accelerated by pairing with community solar, mostly due to the reduction of soft costs. Hard costs have come down dramatically for EV charging in the US, but today, soft costs, like permitting, easements, and utility interconnection, are three to five times greater in the US than in Europe. By building EV charging concurrently with solar interconnection, redundancies are cut, and the process becomes more streamlined and cost effective. PV and EV charging can also benefit each other by sharing project “make ready” costs.
Between 2010 and 2019, the US has experienced 119 disaster events that have caused more than $1 billion in costs each event. With climate-related disasters on a steady rise, resilience in extreme weather events should be a priority in the buildout of new energy infrastructure. Solar projects at critical facilities with energy storage and microgrid capabilities can provide essential services like air conditioning, heating, basic health care, or cell phone charging, said RMI.
Building distributed community solar has massive cost benefits, too. A study by Vibrant Clean Energy found that optimizing distribution planning could reduce the cost of a clean energy future by $500 billion relative to a more centralized deployment of renewables in the grid. RMI said additional electrification of transportation, heating and cooling, and more is expected to increase total electricity demand in Texas and Massachusetts, as an example, by a respective 30% and 50% by 2050 compared with the baseline. The transmission infrastructure needed to support this is massive, and it can be difficult to flexibly plan around these changes. Distributed energy resources can be managed more flexibly than centralized power, better responding to the needs of an evolving community.
Community solar is also seen as a way to bring more equity to our energy system. More than 70% of community solar projects offer financing for people with low credit scores, immediate and direct bill savings, community education, and little or no up-front investment requirements. RMI’s equity model for community solar+ involves the buildout of community “energy hubs” that would provide support under climate events.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/12/you-know-solar-has-made-it-when-fossils-fund-misinformation-campaigns/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 12, 2022",You know solar has made it when fossils fund misinformation campaigns,"As solar power grows, some rural landowners are pushing back against its deployment. Nuanced research in New York state suggests the bigger the project, the bigger the pushback. It is also increasingly common to see pushback based on misinformation and outright lies that are likely being funded by fossil interests.
They give the indication that it’s all bunny rabbits and butterflies over there. And it’s not. It’s 2,400 acres of total destruction.
Reuters News recently covered this pushback, “U.S. solar expansion stalled by rural land-use protests”, and we here at pv magazine USA thought it would be appropriate to insert our two watts worth of opinion by debunking the misinformation.
The article notes that much of the disinformation and organizing against solar is happening on the atrocious platform Facebook, in its ‘groups’.
The article suggests that solar power can only be installed on flat, dry land. While flat, cleared, desert-like land is optimal — and the cheapest — that is not a requirement. Nextracker’s racking product allows solar to be installed on hills, as seen in photo above.
More extreme installations can even be found on mountainsides.

In fact, land doesn’t even need to be firm. Landfills are ideal sites for solar panels, despite the fact that they are constantly settling. Landfill-sited solar capacity could nearly double the Biden administration’s goal to grow community solar, while increasing the total US solar power capacity by around 58%.
The idea that “dry” land is required for optimal solar is wrong as well. One of the nation’s leading utility scale markets is located in one of the rainiest states — Florida. And one of the nation’s most advanced solar markets — Hawaii — is home to one of the rainiest places on earth.

In fact, floating solar panels are a benefit to bodies of water in dry climates because they slow evaporation, significantly preserving precious water reserves. Global floating PV is likely to reach 4.8GW globally by 2026. A project in Portugal just signed a negative contract around a floating facility, which is about to add 263MW of floating solar. China recently switched on one of the world’s largest floating PV plants, at 320MW.
The article, and the opposition groups, also reference the loss of farmland. This author thinks that argument is truly bunk. 40% of our nation’s cornland — 40 million acres worth — is used to fill up the engines of cars. If these millions of acres were turned into agrivoltaic installations, they would power 100% of the grid and 100% of passenger car miles — all while making real food, instead of contributing to farmer welfare.

Other arguments put forth in the article — duly noted by the author as false — are that solar panels “rarely” produce electricity or leach cadmium into the waterways. Well, in reference to the “rarely” comment — if the sun rises, solar is generated, and if the sun doesn’t rise — then well, we have bigger issues than electricity.
Regarding cadmium, this is yet another tall tale. First off, most solar panels have no cadmium or rare earth metals as anti-solar propagandists like to claim. Research — and common sense — has repeatedly shown that solar panels are specifically designed to last for decades without anything getting inside of, or escaping from, the panels.
For example, let’s look at when a FirstSolar power plant was struck by a tornado.
The damaged panels were collected, approximately 135,000 were recycled, and the remainder were disposed of. Sampling of soil and module pieces from the tornado event passed Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure tests, and an environmental non-governmental agency contacted the US Bureau of Land Management and reported no indication of soil contamination.
First Solar, in essence, vacuumed up the broken solar panels and recycled them.
Let me repeat this for the cheap seats, A TORNADO WAS NOT ABLE TO BREAK THE PANELS UP ENOUGH TO LEECH CHEMICALS INTO THE SOIL!

Pardon the loud noises…
One person interviewed in the Reuters article claimed that the herbicides used and electromagnetic waves generated by solar farms pose health concerns. So, I’m guessing the farms next to this individual are purely organic, and that they have no electricity in her home? (Even organic farming is not free from heavy metals).
We believe it’s important to be aware of one of the defense tactics these groups use to spread misinformation via forums, which they are conscious of, and purposefully keep online:
It is important to not judge, and censor utility-scale solar content/opinions contributed by citizens. If we become judge and jury, we are headed down the wrong path.
Much like Fox News has become the propaganda arm of a certain brand of right wing politics in the USA for the sake of power and control, these anti-solar Facebook groups are not seeking truth or education — but seek to push their control. With the blunt reality that fossil fuels have massive sums of money to underwrite these actions, it is highly probable that these are not grassroot organizations in any manner, but highly coordinated and funded actions no different than the lies that have polluted our politics since #ExxonKnew in the 1960s and 70s.

Qcells’ parent corporation, Hanwha Solutions, responded to the uncertainty by announcing that it intends to invest across the full solar supply chain from the polysilicon produced at the REC Silicon Washington and Montana plants to solar modules manufactured at Qcells’ Georgia facility. Last month Hanwha announced plans to become the majority shareholder of REC Silicon, thus securing its capabilities across the full US solar technology supply chain.
“We plan to make investments to secure capabilities across the entire solar supply chain, with the goal of supplying our partners with Made-inAmerica products that will help the US regain its leadership in clean energy solutions,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Qcells.
According to the Q1 2022 USPV Leaderboard report, Qcells obtained 24.1% market share in the US residential market for FY 2021. The Leaderboard report also ranks Qcells as the US commercial market leader with 20.6% market share, a 2% increase from 2020. Qcells has held the No.1 position in the commercial segment for the last three fiscal years.
Qcells’ commitment is seen not only in its plan to revitalize US manufacturing of solar grade silicon through its investment in REC Silicon, but its module manufacturing plant in Georgia is the largest in the United States. The Georgia-based factory can produce 1.7GW of solar modules per year, accounting for nearly 20% of module production in the United States. The Georgia plant currently employs up to 750 people, which the company expects to expand in the coming months.
As the company embraces its increasing identity as a complete clean energy solutions provider, Qcells has launched a new international brand identity. The company unveiled new logo and brand platform that consists of core values, a mission statement and slogan that reflect recent efforts to expand its portfolio that includes solar cells, modules and energy storage systems, as well as solar power plants and energy distribution.

The new logo’s color gradation shift from green to blue is intended to reflect its fundamental approach to generate clean energy, inspired by nature. It consists of different-sized rectangular shapes, forming a grid pattern to symbolize the company’s expanding value chain in varying business sectors and ever-growing commitment to sustainability.
Qcells’ new mission statement, “We aim for a greener tomorrow with completely clean energy solutions,” and slogan, “Completely Clean Energy,” uphold the brand’s ambition to build a sustainable future for the next generations to come. The company plans to roll out its new brand identity within the first half of 2022, including featuring the new look on its new products.

While this is not the first supply partnership to be reached between the two companies, the level of commitment dramatically expands on their prior partnership, under which First Solar has supplied modules to over 30 projects totaling more than 1GW since 2015. The deal uses First Solar’s agile contracting approach, which means that Silicon Ranch will benefit from any advances in technology First Solar achieves prior to the first delivery of modules. The contract also includes a recycling clause, under which end-of-life CadTel modules from Silicon Ranch projects can be processed by First Solar’s recycling program, which recovers approximately 90% of CadTel material, allowing those materials to be used to manufacture new modules.
The move also likely alleviates some module sourcing stress for Silicon Ranch, as many developers have had their existing supply agreement plans turned upside-down by the Department of Commerce’s anti-circumvention investigation. In a webinar last week, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) shared preliminary survey data from more than 200 respondents across the solar industry. Within the survey 75% of respondents reported that they are already experiencing cancelled or delayed module shipments, while 11% have not yet been notified of delays, but expect them to come.
“Long-term module supply agreements with a trusted partner provide a vital hedge against the pricing and supply uncertainties that have impacted the solar industry over the past few years,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer at First Solar. “And with First Solar’s agile contracting strategy, Silicon Ranch will have the added benefit of access to our best-in-class PV technologies as they continue to evolve.”
Silicon Ranch isn’t the only company turning to First Solar to shore up their supply. Just yesterday, Origis Energy placed an order for 750MW of First Solar’s modules.
First Solar is investing $680 million in expanding America’s domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3GW annually, by building its third US manufacturing facility, in Lake Township, Ohio. The new facility is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023 and when fully operational will bring the company’s Northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6GW.
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building a new 3.3GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. With First Solar’s expansion in the United States and India and optimization of its existing fleet, the First Solar anticipate that its manufacturing capacity will double to 16GW by 2024.

The single-axis tracking, located on 195 acres in Dobson, North Carolina, will generate enough electricity to power approximately 5,000 homes. The 22.6MW facility will add to the state’s growing solar capacity. Currently ranked fourth in the nation for solar installed, North Carolina is generating just over 8% of its electricity from solar power, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The facility, which is owned and operated by Duke Sustainable Solutions, was designed and built by SOLV Energy. SOLV was founded in 2008 and has over 8GW of completed projects. The solar power generated by the project will be delivered through a 20-year power purchase agreement.
Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions is a nonregulated commercial brand of Duke Energy, which recently announced clean energy goals of reducing carbon 50% by 2030 and is aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Duke is taking additional toward reducing carbon including decreasing use of coal to less than 5% of total generation by 2030 and to fully exit coal by 2035 as part of what it says is the largest planned coal fleet retirement in the industry.  In 2017, 33% of Duke’s portfolio was made up of coal/oil; 28% natural gas; 34% nuclear and only 5% hydro/wind/solar. The plan is for that balance to change by 2030 to 16% coal/oil; 42% natural gas; 32% nuclear; and 10% hydro/wind/solar.
