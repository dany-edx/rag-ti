The report, Energy Market Design and the Southeast United States, said that unlike the system used elsewhere in the country, where Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) coordinate resources to create a least-cost system, the Southeast’s vertically integrated monopoly utilities both generate and distribute electricity without a centralized wholesale market. This means that what they offer is what the customer gets, and that’s the end of that.
For context, nearly 70% of the nation’s electricity moves through organized wholesale power markets where electricity is bought and sold among generators, utilities, and traders before reaching end-use customers.
The basic arguments for setting up real-time, wholesale energy markets is that they save customers money on their electric bills, allow for more effective implementation of consumer-supported renewable energy, and make it easier to implement new and emerging energy technologies onto the grid.
Real-time markets use competition to drive the construction and use of least-cost resources. The report outlined that, as price signals govern generator investment and dispatch decisions, the grid’s resource mix will continue to change as the lower-cost resources clear auctions to bid another day. More expensive resources retire.
Under the system seen in the Southeast, when electrons move across a utility footprint the transmitting utility adds a charge for the service. When and if those electrons flow to another utility, that utility adds its own charge. These charges stack, raising consumer costs above the actual cost of providing service. This is known as “rate pancaking,” and is not seen in real-time markets.
A larger market area also opens the door for a more diverse power mix, making it easier to get on-line renewables of all kinds, and overall enabling more rapid grid decarbonization.
A collection of 17 Southeastern utilities across 12 states are already seeking regulatory approval to formalize and expand a bilateral contracting framework they plan to name the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM). This structure is not a real-time wholesale energy market, but is used in the context of the report to examine the benefits of markets, and what a real-time market would mean for the region.
The Southeast’s vertically integrated utilities have long shared power across their service territories using bilateral agreements. But SEEM proposes to formalize and expand this arrangement using a system of supply and demand matchmaking that augments utility-self supply and power purchase agreements via the trading excess power over underutilized transmission capacity. Requirements to balance generation and load would remain under the purview of the utilities, and access to the SEEM platform by independent power producers seeking to develop projects within the SEEM footprint would not be guaranteed.
Under SEEM’s platform, bids and offers are proposed to match every 15 minutes, as opposed to the 5-minute RTO/ISO standard, which the authors said could give an advantage to slower-ramping resources, like nuclear and coal-fired power units.
In addition, SEEM’s auction clearing prices would be calculated using a “split savings” method that splits the difference between bids and offers, which would be brought together by an electronic trading platform, rather than the locational marginal clearing prices of the RTO/ISO standard.
The trading platform would be governed by the SEEM participants, each one having a vote weighted according to its load. A  market auditor would be brought in to regularly examine SEEM’s functioning; this auditor would be hired by and report to the very same participants it would be assigned to audit, which is suboptimal.
The SEEM proposal has been modeled by consulting firms Guidehouse and Charles River Associates, which found that the footprint would–at a minimum–realize $47 million in net benefits, a real-life savings of a couple cents per customer.
Because many of the power providers in the SEEM footprint have significant commitments to reducing emissions and businesses and households within the SEEM footprint currently pay some of the nation’s highest retail electric bills, getting as much low-cost renewable capacity on-line as fast as possible is a no-brainer.
Competitive, real-time wholesale energy markets could provide an easy solution, as their competition-driven model leads to lowest-cost resources that will only get cheaper as the costs of renewable energy and energy storage continue to decline as expected.
In the Southeast, building new solar is already cost-competitive with the marginal cost of continuing to operate existing thermal energy sources.
While RTO/ISOs regularly reach new highs for reliable renewable energy usage, supplying more than 80% of power demand in SPP and CAISO at various points in time, the current SEEM model doesn’t promote the same growth and usage.
The report outlined that SEEM’s 15-minute transaction interval and the lack of an independent entity overseeing open access to transmission service by independent power producers, whose new development is all but guaranteed to be renewable, may stymie growth in the full SEEM footprint.
Furthermore, the current proposal extends the load-serving capability of otherwise uneconomic existing generation, which helps insulate the inflexibility of those resources, giving them a longer service life than would otherwise be economic. It essentially makes a coal plant more viable by filling in any load gaps.
Though the report did state that the institution of a real-time, wholesale energy market in the Southeast may not solve all of the area’s generation and transmission needs, it is a proven market structure for implementing low-cost renewables across almost the entire rest of the country.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/29/solar-trash-without-intervention-a-shocking-and-costly-amount-will-be-produced/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 29, 2021","Solar trash: Without intervention, a shocking (and costly) amount will be produced","The growth of solar will be instrumental in the world’s fight against emission-caused climate change, but not all is rosy for the technology.
Without changes to the current structure of solar panel retirements, the world could witness some 78 million tons of solar trash disposed in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). They predict the U.S. will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash to that 2050 total.
To put into context, the U.S. dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. So while solar waste may seem like a drop in the bucket, researchers writing in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) are growing concerned that the wave of solar trash may be much larger, and on a much closer horizon than originally predicted.
According to the HBR article, the IRENA estimates may be conservative as they assume a 30-year life for panels before retirement, a timeframe that the HBR authors viewed as probably unrealistic. They said that early replacement of solar panels will likely increase as incentives offered to consumers shift.  
If the cost of trading up for new, more efficient, highly incentivized solar panels is low enough, and if the grid compensation rate is high enough, then the HBR authors said they expected consumers to swap out for new panels, regardless of whether or not their current equipment has more years of productive life.
With this factored in, the HBR projection makes solar waste a much more immediate problem. Projections land at 50 times the IRENA outlook for the next five years. And this analysis only factors in residential-side conditions; shifting incentives at the commercial and utility scale could drive still more early retirements.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the U.S. ceiling for solar deployment is around 700 GW by 2050. The HBR study’s early replacement projection showed that the volume of waste could actually surpass that of new installations by 2031. Around four years later, panel trash could outweigh new modules sold by more than two-and-a-half times.
Under current conditions, little financial reason exists to recycle a panel rather than simply throw it away. Panels contain only small amounts of valuables like silver, with the bulk of their bodies made of relatively low-value glass. It costs an estimated $20-30 to recycle one panel, but sending it to a landfill costs on the order of  $1-$2, according to the HBR authors.
To make matters more difficult, some governments classify solar panels as hazardous waste, largely due to a small amount of cadmium and lead. This increases transport costs, requiring longer trucking miles, specialized vehicles and specialized processing centers. Add to this the fact that it requires labor to remove these panels from roofs, fields, and carports, and equipment end-of-life costs increase. 
This would have a thunderous impact on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar, increasing it to four times the current projection, said the HBR authors.
Clearly, solar panel recycling capacity must be built, with a holistic end-of-life infrastructure including removal, transport, and even temporary waste storage.  
The HBR authors suggested that government intervention will be needed to incentivize recycling. Evolution on this front is occurring in Europe, where PV panel producers are now liable for the end-of-life phase of a panel, and for financing waste management, said the IRENA report. 
“Orphaned-waste” programs will also be needed to find a path for panels deployed by companies no longer in business, said the HBR authors.
IRENA suggested the EU-passed WEEE Directive, an electronics recycling regulation, could serve as a waypoint for U.S. legislation. The EU added solar panels to their electronics waste regulations in 2014. But the U.S. has not yet added solar panels to the “e-waste” classification as an amendment to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
The UN reports that only 17.4% of global e-waste in 2019 was collected and recycled, even though 71% of the world’s population, in 78 countries, is covered by some type of legislation or policy on recycling. Only one major U.S. panel manufacturer, First Solar, has enacted an in-house recycling program, said HBR.
NREL reported that the current regulatory scheme for managing end of life (EoL) PV modules is complex and varies by jurisdiction, and there is not a clear understanding of the permitting requirements or liabilities associated with the full cycle of EoL processing. To date, the most common regulatory mechanisms for EoL product management are extended producer responsibility (EPR) and landfill diversion policies. However, no publicly available study comprehensively analyzes the overall success of these policies, or how they compare to other regulatory models, or whether these frameworks make sense for PV modules, said NREL.
IRENA said with the right policies and enabling frameworks in place, new industries can be spawned to repurpose and recycle old solar PV panels, driving considerable economic value creation. NREL supports this notion, and said that more information is needed to support value creation.
Specifically, they identify a need for more information about the value of and the markets for recovered materials, the volume and composition of EoL PV modules, module recycling technology and infrastructure needs, permitting requirements and liabilities, and costs associated with PV module recycling.
NREL said that decreasing uncertainty will pave the way towards a more appropriate response to this issue.
For example, using mandates or incentives so that manufacturers provide PV module labels with concentrations of hazardous material could provide transparency between stakeholders and eliminate the need for expensive hazardous waste testing.
In general, the NREL report advocated for policies that reduce the regulatory burden for recycling compared to disposal, thereby making the economics of recycling more palatable to decision-makers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/29/watch-nrel-releases-five-year-study-on-continent-wide-integration-of-renewable-energy-resources/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 29, 2021",Watch: NREL releases five-year study on continent-wide integration of renewable energy resources,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) released findings from it five-year North American Renewable Integration Study (NARIS), which aims to inform grid planners, utilities, industry, policymakers, and other stakeholders about challenges and opportunities for continental system integration of large amounts of wind, solar, and hydropower to support a low-carbon future grid.
The study looked at a range of future scenarios and considered potential impacts on costs, emissions, resource adequacy, and specific technologies. The analysis focused in particular on the potential role of cooperation across North America and between regions within each country, and how transmission can support sharing of supply and demand diversity across the continent.

Results show that a future low-carbon North American grid can be achieved through multiple pathways that can balance supply and demand using a variety of flexible resources. The study also shows that increasing electricity trade and expanding transmission could have significant benefits, highlighting opportunities for a coordinated, low-carbon continental grid.
NREL said that four key findings emerged from the analysis.
Finding 1: Multiple Pathways Can Lead to 80% Power-Sector Carbon Reduction Continent-Wide by 2050. Steeper cost reduction of wind and solar technologies can lead to a faster and less costly transition, and carbon targets can still be achieved with conservative wind and solar cost assumptions. When it comes to total system costs of achieving 80% power-sector emissions reductions, wind and solar cost trajectories have a more significant impact than carbon policy assumptions.

Finding 2: The Future Low-Carbon Power System Can Balance Supply and Demand in a Wide Range of Future Conditions. For each core NARIS scenario, NREL estimated the number of hours in a year where supply would not be expected to meet demand in a region, as well as shortages that may occur due to generator or transmission outages. For both the United States and Canada, these metrics compare favorably with the North American Energy Reliability Corporation’s projections for the contemporary grid, meaning the scenarios analyzed in NARIS would not fundamentally impact the power system’s ability to balance supply and demand.
The report said that in the U.S., between 1,200 and 2,000 gigawatts of renewable energy can be deployed to produce 70%–80% of U.S. electricity by 2050 while meeting planning reserve requirements. Thermal generation (nuclear, gas, and coal) was found to contribute significantly to the future power system’s ability to balance supply and demand in all scenarios, even when most of the energy generation comes from wind and solar. Storage can also help provide capacity to the system, the report said.
In Canada, hydropower, gas, and wind technologies were found to contribute most to the future system’s ability to balance supply and demand. Thermal generation would provide 5%–10% of energy in all scenarios in 2050, but still would contribute more than a quarter of winter planning reserves in most scenarios.
However, existing market structures may not support these generators operating in this manner, the report said. Some of this contribution from thermal generation could be replaced by new hydropower or storage. Hydropower would continue to provide around half of Canadian planning reserve needs by 2050; hydropower expansion could potentially contribute more, especially in a future with higher electricity demand.
Finding 3: Interregional and International Cooperation Can Provide Significant Net System Benefits Through 2050. Allowing international transmission expansion was found to provide $10 billion to $30 billion (based on 2018 dollars) of net value to the continental system between 2020 and 2050 in all but the business-as-usual case—the most conservative of the core scenarios.
Expanding transmission between regions of a country would provide $60 billion to $180 billion in net system benefits. Although these values are less than 4% of the total $5 trillion to $8 trillion total system costs (which include all capital and operating generation and transmission system costs), transmission was found to play an important role in minimizing costs.
NARIS showed significant value in expanding transmission across North America to support sharing of supply and demand diversity. These values are estimated by comparing the total system cost in each core scenario in model runs with and without allowing additional transmission expansion (either interregional or international).
Finding 4: Operational Flexibility Comes From Transmission, Storage, and Flexible Operation of All Generator Types. The results showed the future low-carbon power system will benefit from many different forms of operational flexibility. In the United States, this included flexible operation of natural gas and hydropower, curtailment of wind and solar generation, and storage (mostly pumped storage hydropower). International imports, enabled by transmission build outs, also help to balance the grid.

In Canada, hydropower, wind, solar, and thermal generation were found to be key sources of flexibility. On days when Canada has high energy demand but lower wind energy output, Canada would import electricity from the United States. For days with higher Canadian wind output, the Canadian grid would export electricity to the United States, even when electricity demand peaks in both countries in the evening.
Hydropower would provide a zero-carbon source of energy, capacity, and flexibility to the grid. In comparing similar scenarios with and without the ability to adjust power output from U.S. and Canadian hydropower generators, annual system costs were found to be $2.3 billion higher without this flexibility.
Follow-on work could focus on studying the stability aspect of power system reliability, analyzing new scenarios that reflect today’s emissions reduction goals as well as technology costs, understanding the impact of different market structures on building new transmission and generation, and refining how electricity demand patterns and sources of flexibility are modeled under future widespread electrification.

The capacity will include two projects: the 80 MW Angelina Solar Project and the 70 MW Alamo Solar Project. Angelina will occupy up to 827 acres within a 934-acre project area in Preble County, on the Ohio-Indiana border. Developed by Open Road Renewables, the project was originally applied for back in 2018. The specific hardware planned for use in the project has not yet been made available.
Alamo will occupy up to 919 acres within a 1,003-acre project area, also in Preble County south of Dayton. Like Angelina, the Alamo project was originally applied for back in 2018 and is being developed by Open Road Renewables. Specific hardware choices for this project have also not been made available yet.
Open Road has not yet announced revised construction schedules for these two projects, as they were both initially planned for groundbreaking in late 2019 and full commercial operation by late last year. It is unlikely that these projects will take longer to build than the initially-planned year.
In early July, OPSB will hold a public hearing for two solar systems that are among the largest planned in the state. Those installations are the Wheatsborough Solar project, a 125 MW array with a 50 MW battery energy storage system in Erie County, between Cleveland and Toledo, and the Sycamore Creek Solar project, a 117 MW standalone project in Crawford County, also between Cleveland and Toledo.

The system was acquired by Arervon, a unit of global asset management firm Capital Dynamics, in May, together with infrastructure developer S&B USA Energy. Capital Dynamics owns 51% of the project and S&B USA the remaining 49%.
Electricity from the site is supplied to Southern California Edison under the terms of a 20-year purchase and sale agreement. The project was developed by Strata Clean Energy.
The system uses 142 Megapacks, Tesla’s utility-scale battery storage product. It also will use a battery storage performance management platform from Power Factors. The decision to build the Saticoy battery came after local residents and community leaders helped stop plans for a proposed gas peaker plant. Arevon completed the project in nine months. Energy stored on the site can power the city of Oxnard for four hours or all of Ventura County for 30 minutes.
Private markets firm Partners Group acquired a controlling equity stake in Dimension Renewable Energy, an Atlanta-based distributed energy platform focusing on community solar and battery storage.
Separately, FTC Solar, a provider of solar tracker systems, software, and engineering services, received a net payout of around $22 million through the sale of its minority stake in Dimension Energy, with the potential to receive an additional payout of up to $14 million through an earn-out structure.
FTC Solar made an initial investment of $4 million in Dimension in 2018. FTC Solar has since received dividends totaling around $2.1 million.
Calgary-based Lithion Battery Inc. said that Koch Strategic Platforms is providing it with growth capital, becoming a strategic minority investment partner. TriWest Capital Partners, a Canadian-based private equity fund, remains as the majority equity holder.
Lithion is a vertically integrated manufacturer of battery cells and rechargeable and non-rechargeable battery modules and packs serving industrial, medical, robotic, military / defense and energy end-markets.
Koch Strategic Platforms, founded as part of Koch Industries’ investment arm, Koch Investments Group, focuses on growth equity in computing and connectivity, industrial automation, health care, and energy transformation.
AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles plans to install a 2.2 MW solar energy array on top of its 180,000-square-foot research and development facility located on the wharf at the Port of Los Angeles. The array will be installed by PermaCity, a division of Catalyze, using its SolarStrap roof mounting technology. Completion is expected by late fall.
The installation will export its energy to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power under a feed-in tariff. The solar project has funding from True Green Energy LLC, which, together with PermaCity, has funded and built most of the solar projects at the port.
Oceanographer and explorer Dr. Robert Ballard has plans for a 10,000-square-foot research center at the site and docks his Exploration Vessel Nautilus at AltaSea.
Captona acquired its third fuel cell project in partnership with South Jersey Industries subsidiary, Marina Energy, through its Catamaran Renewables joint venture.  The 5 MW late-stage development fuel cell project is located in Bronx, New York, and is currently under construction and scheduled to be placed into service later this year. With the investment, Captona’s fuel cell portfolio grows to 12.5 MW.
Canadian Solar said it was awarded 86 MW in Japan’s 8th solar energy auction. The total includes three projects located in the Tohoku region: an 80 MW project in Miyagi Prefecture, a 3 MW project in Fukushima Prefecture, and a 3 MW project in Aomori Prefecture.
Once built, these projects will enter into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Tohoku Power Electric Company at a weighted average rate of $0.098 per kWh. The company said it expects the projects to reach commercial operation between 2024 and 2026.
Canadian Solar has one of the largest cumulative market shares in Japan’s feed-in-tariff auction program since its launch in 2017. Since entering Japan’s solar project development business in 2011, the company has worked on more than 45 projects and is currently executing on nearly 30 projects to be delivered over the next 3-5 years.
