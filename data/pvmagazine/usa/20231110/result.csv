The Lakeland, Florida community will be called Myrtlebrook.
Microgrids, which connect solar, energy storage, and smart appliances, come with a bouquet of benefits like localized backup power and resilience, insulation from volatile utility rates, and a more efficient use of energy by connecting what would otherwise be stranded assets.
Microgrid communities can operate separately from the utility’s electric grid, operating even when power outages occur. This is particularly appealing for Florida communities, which are no strangers to the impacts of hurricanes and power outages.
“This microgrid project is disruptive, it’s new and it’s everything emerging technology stands for,” Mike Dammer, manager, emergent technologies at Lakeland Electric. “We are going into the new.”
Each home will be outfitted with an 8 kW solar array integrated on a membrane section of the new homes’ roofs. Every two homes will be linked by a 43 kWh battery. The solar and energy storage devices will together form a microgrid that Block Energy calls the “BlockLoop.”
The planned community is designed to be 77% self-sufficient, though Block Energy is optimistic the system can outperform expectations. It has a similar 37-home microgrid community in Wimauma, Florida that has achieved 93% independence, only drawing 7% of its electric load from utility Tampa Electric company.
“The caveat there is that that 23% will never be on peak — it will always be off peak,” said Dammer.
Purchasing power off-peak only is a win-win for the utility and the microgrid community, as it keeps prices low for customers, and enables the utility to avoid using natural gas-fired peaker plants for additional peak reserve power.
Block Energy plans to break ground on the pilot community in 2024, with home developer Highland Homes beginning housing construction in 2025. The new homes community is expected to be complete in late 2025 or early 2026.
The utility, Lakeland Electric, will be owner-operator of the solar and storage assets, will seek federal tax incentives for the project, which are expected to save $1.1 million in costs.
Microgrids and solar-battery aggregations are shown to have huge benefits for resource efficiency. A study by the University of Otago found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both energy load smoothing and peak demand shaving, meaning the flexible use of energy reduces the amount of infrastructure buildout to support demand. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% for peak shaving.
“This is a way of saying to our customers, ‘We are invested in your future to make sure we can limit outages.’ This is a system that is designed to be built with and for the community. It is part of the community. It is not an add on. It is not a retrofit. This community is a solar community,” said Dammer.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/10/kentucky-regulators-approve-plan-for-900-increase-in-renewable-energy/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,KENTUCKY",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Kentucky regulators approve plan for 900% increase in renewable energy,"The Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) approved a plan by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities to retire several fossil fuel plants and replace them with significant solar and battery energy storage. 
The plan calls for 877 MW of solar and 125 MW / 500 MWh of battery energy storage. This represents a 900% increase in renewable energy in their service areas. These resources are expected to be cost-effective replacements for the retirements of two coal-fired power plants and three natural gas fired plants. 
“The enormous costs to bring these aging units in line with federal environmental regulations would have saddled customers with uneconomic plants that can’t run,” said Terrell Holder, chair of Greater Louisville Group of the Sierra Club.  
The retirements come as a result of a new state law that requires utilities to acquire approval from the PSC to retire fossil fuel facilities. 
The solar and battery storage projects came with support from the Sierra Club, which performed a study that showed that rolling blackouts during Winter Storm Elliott were caused by coal plant failures in cold weather. 
“Coal has proved to be unreliable, as demonstrated by last December’s rolling blackouts during Winter Storm Elliott that were in part caused by failures at coal-fired power plants. Closing these inefficient and unreliable units is absolutely the right business decision for LG&E/KU,” said Holder. 
Sierra Club is also urging the PSC to investigate the potential for the two utilities to join a broader regional organization to secure lower customer prices and lower the risk of further winter blackouts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/10/plug-power-shares-fall-on-north-america-hydrogen-concerns/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Plug Power shares fall on North America hydrogen concerns,"Plug Power, a company that is building an end-to-end green hydrogen ecosystem, saw its stock fall more than 30% on the Nasdaq on Friday, following its report stating that its 2023 financial performance was negatively affected by unprecedented supply challenges in the North American hydrogen network, despite a more than threefold increase in electrolyzer sales.
The New York-based company said it will seek additional capital to fund its activities, expressing confidence that the hydrogen supply issue is temporary, expecting full capacity production at its Georgia and Tennessee facilities by year end.
Green hydrogen reportedly has a bright future. According to a report from the Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress (DCSP) the hydrogen fuel produced by renewable energy sources set global market milestones of $642 billion by 2030, $980 billion by 2040, and $1.4 trillion by 2050, with growth in the industry split among the major global economies relatively evenly by mid-century. 
Hard-to-abate sectors like steelmaking, chemical manufacturing, aviation and global shipping require high amounts of energy dispatch, something that can be difficult for electrochemical batteries to achieve. While batteries may serve mobile devices, electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage, hydrogen may present a viable path forward for decarbonizing these high-dispatch use cases.
The report said that these sectors may drive hydrogen demand and use six-fold by 2050, leading to nearly 600 million tons of hydrogen fuel use. While hydrogen electrolysis requires large amounts of electricity, the only byproduct of burning hydrogen fuel is water, making it an emissions-free source when created by renewable sources.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/10/u-s-geological-survey-and-berkeley-labs-release-updated-solar-project-database/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",U.S. Geological Survey and Berkeley Labs release updated solar project database,"A new map tracking most utility-scale solar power plants has been developed from government project databases. The map, called the U.S. Large-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (USPVDB), tracks ground-mounted, front-of-the-meter, 1 MW direct current sized or larger-sized projects.
The map was developed by individuals within the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Energy Resources Program along with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Energy Markets and Policy Department. Funding came from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office and USGS Energy Resources Program.
While much of this information has already existed in various government databases, the USPVDB augments that data with complementary information on the total footprint area and detailed attributes of each facility, including panel technology type, axis type, year of installation, and generation capacity.
Project site information was also added – whether it is a greenfield, or has previous, current, or suspected contamination, or if agrivoltaic. The projects were position-verified and digitized by aerial imagery, and checked for quality to verify facility locations.

The map viewer shows 3,676 total solar facilities representing 54,880 MWac of generating capacity that was online before 2022. Data from the resulting process is available for public use and is provided in multiple formats – ESRI shapefile, GeoJSON file, CSV, and XML.
The resource is being made available to researchers, as well as being used to inform decision makers within the DOE and the President’s offices. The DOE said ground-mounted solar could require 5.7 million acres by 2035, and 10 million acres by 2050. Thus, the administration was seeking tools to help mitigate the impacts on the environment when siting solar power facilities.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management put up for consideration land that could host 5.3 GW of solar, as part of the nation’s goal of 25 GWs by 2025 on public lands.
In addition to the map and data released, the groups also published a research paper – Georectified polygon database of ground-mounted large-scale solar photovoltaic sites in the United States – on the subject, sharing how they did their work to develop this tool.

The basics of the process that the researchers went through to develop the database are described above. Work began by first ‘georectifying’ facility coordinates by finding the sites via latitude and longitude data provided by the DOE’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), then to visually verify using high-resolution aerial imagery. Next, using the georectified coordinates, polygons were manually drawn around the extent of panel arrays and inverters by USGS and LBNL analysts using ArcGIS software. Last, the team appended existing data within information from other databases.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/10/solar-ready-vets-trains-veterans-for-solar-and-storage-careers/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Solar Ready Vets trains veterans for solar and storage careers,"The Solar Ready Vets Network, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, is a program that provides training to veterans for careers in the rapidly growing solar and energy storage industries.
Led by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), the program supports the industry’s need for a trained workforce as well as providing pathways to careers for veterans.
IREC has recently secured additional funding to build on the work that has been ongoing since 2014. New initiatives help with registered apprenticeship programs, pair workers with employers and more.
Each year, about 200,000 men and women leave military service in the United States and the Department of Defense has set up the SkillBridge program to help them transition to careers in civilian life. The Solar Ready Vets program works with the SkillBridge program to offer opportunities aligned with workforce needs in the solar industry.
The Department of Defense SkillBridge program allows service members to pursue career training before transition, setting them up for success to bring their diverse skills to a wide range of industries. The Solar Ready Vets Fellowship, implemented through the Hiring Our Heroes Corporate Fellowship Program, is a SkillBridge program. Through this program, close to 100 service members have started careers with solar employers in roles such as project management, operations and logistics, communications, policy, and more.
The Hiring Our Heroes program is launching a new Skills-Based Fellowship model, which IREC says will connect a much wider pool of military talent with solar fellowships opportunities in 2024 and beyond.
With new training partners such as Solar Energy International (SEI), IREC is developing a standardized, solar industry specific SkillBridge training model to equip veterans for demanding entry-level roles. IREC reports that, along with  SEI, it is launching a consensus-based process with industry and training stakeholders to define learning outcomes and program structures. The program will be piloted in 2024, and IREC is seeking employers from within the solar industry that are interested in contributing to the SkillBridge group.
Apprenticeship
Apprenticeship programs are a great way for workers to get on-the-job training, but solar developers now also have tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act if they employ apprentices and have a certain ratio from registered apprenticeship programs. The Solar Ready Vets program is partnering with Midwest Renewable Energy Association to establish and register National Guidelines for Apprenticeship Standards that will align Department of Labor-approved occupations with the needs of solar employers.
Once developed, the guidelines will be available for use by any employer to design an apprenticeship program for those occupations. IREC is convening a working group to help inform the development of these standards and employers can reach out to IREC to learn more about participating.
Solar career course
IREC plans to offer solar mentorship opportunities and hiring events for military-connected individuals, and will be conducting a new, self-paced solar career navigation course. The course is planned for early next year and will showcase the opportunities available. IREC is also establishing a direct referral process to connect qualified veteran candidates to job openings with select solar employers. Click here for more information.
This nationwide work is carried out in partnership with leading industry, training and veterans’ services organizations including the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Hiring our Heroes (HOH), Solar Energy International (SEI), and the Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/10/maxeon-solar-cells-cleared-of-forced-labor-allegations-after-review/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Maxeon solar cells cleared of forced labor allegations after review,"Maxeon Solar Technologies, a leading solar module manufacturer, has been exonerated from allegations of using Uyghur forced labor in their polysilicon supply chain. This conclusion comes from Laura Murphy, policy advisor to the Under Secretary in the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and author of the report, ‘Over Exposed: Uyghur Region Exposure Assessment for Solar Industry Sourcing.’
On her LinkedIn page, Murphy announced that after a series of engagements with Maxeon, her team has updated their assessment of the company.
Murphy noted:
Based on substantive information submitted to Sheffield Hallam by Maxeon Solar Technologies, we updated our report with a reassessment of Maxeon modules, assessing the company’s exposure to the XUAR as NONE (unverified).
The reassessment acknowledges the extensive data Maxeon shared regarding their procurement processes and the implementation of comprehensive tracking and verification within their supply chains. The dialogue between Murphy and Maxeon, which also involved other manufacturers, is publicly accessible via their website, within Annex A: Corporate Responses.
The initial exchange with Maxeon began on July 27, 2023, as Maxeon contested implications of forced labor in their supply. The subsequent discourse is recorded in a ten-page email thread, found within the same document.
The revision was influenced by three pivotal pieces of evidence:
1. A disclosure detailing suppliers of wafers, polysilicon, and metal-grade silicon (MGS) for the production of Gen 3 and Gen 6 cells since 1 January 2023. This includes Maxeon’s supply chain map, which was previously submitted to Sheffield Hallam and featured in the original report, and has since been published online.
2. An assertion that Maxeon demanded its suppliers to refrain from using XUAR-sourced materials in the entire supply chain, although this claim remains unverified.
3. Maxeon’s insistence that their suppliers, OCI and TCL Zhonghuan, source exclusively non-XUAR materials for Maxeon-specific products.
Before the reassessment, Maxeon faced a “very high” probability rating for utilizing forced labor-sourced polysilicon. This rating has been downgraded to “None (Unverified)”.
The report defines “none (unverified)” as a scenario where “All polysilicon producers are documented but cannot be independently verified. MGS sourcing locations documented in corporate or other reputable disclosures show none is in the XUAR, but no additional public or official disclosures verify the claim.”
Industry expert Christian Roselund challenged the methodology behind the initial ratings on his LinkedIn:
The supply chain maps provided for the Maxeon 3/5/6 and SunPower X-/A-/M-Series never verified a connection to Xinjiang – they merely assumed it based on limited and inconclusive evidence. In violation of the report’s own stated methodology, other nodes and supply chains are given “very high” scores simply because the report’s authors did not find all of the information they were looking for.
The recent update to Murphy’s full forced labor report, which now includes the fresh insights about Maxeon, originally assigned a “very high” rating partly because of the lack of specific information. The report observed, “Without clear supply chain disclosures that would account for wafer sourcing, analysis of the current Maxeon 3/5/6 supply chain depends on analysis of Maxeon’s investment and business relationships.”
Such affiliations, linked to entities with ties to the Xinjiang region, led to the presumption that Maxeon’s solar cells were sourced there as well.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/10/bess-thermal-events-what-to-know-and-what-to-expect/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",BESS thermal events: What to know and what to expect,"Skim through any power and energy publication or platform and you’re likely to see the topic of battery energy storage systems (BESS) hovering above the fold. It’s an important—if not polarizing topic–as hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. funding are released to enable renewable sources of energy. As technology continues to outpace required upgrades to the power grid, how we store this energy becomes a priority of increasing importance.
There are many benefits to installing battery energy storage systems. In addition to assisting the grid with demand and frequency response, BESS can also provide backup power during outages and reduce the cost of electricity by using stored energy during times of peak usage when it is the most expensive.
These benefits, along with the proliferation of alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar, are driving the heightened interest in BESS. However, some recent thermal events have demonstrated that to benefit from these systems, we need to ensure that there is a greater understanding of potential issues that should be considered with BESS installations.
Recent thermal events
Between May and August of 2023, as summer was claiming its status as the hottest meteorological season on record, three BESS facilities in New York State were the subject of thermal events. The events involved four lithium battery storage units at the Chaumont Solar Farm in Jefferson County, two battery storage units in Orange County, and a 5 MW BESS facility in Suffolk County. While each event was contained without injury or extensive damage to the surrounding area, Jefferson County residents were ordered to shelter-in-place for several hours. Even as investigations into the cause of the events ended, public concerns remain.
There is a fundamental need to better inform the public about BESS installations. Each system is unique, and the most critical components are the batteries themselves. As the number of installations increase, it’s more important than ever that both elected officials and the public understand potential hazards associated with each installation, so they can ensure that these critical systems are properly designed and sited to effectively support their communities.
Potential BESS hazards
Radiant heat: When battery energy storage facilities are installed in close proximity to structures, combustible vegetation, or public transportation, radiant heat from a thermal event can present a risk to property and/or disrupt transportation. However, the actual impact of radiant heat during a thermal event can be calculated and these calculations are used to determine safe distances when siting these facilities.
Airborne contaminants: Some of the products of combustion from thermal events may be considered hazardous. This is true for BESS installations, as well as most other fires. It is important to understand the specific hazards for each installation, which will allow a safe perimeter to be established during a thermal event. This perimeter will protect emergency responders without creating undue shelter in place warnings.
Groundwater contamination (leaching): Concerns around the leaching of hazardous materials into the ground during a failure include the introduction of fire water. Fire response to a BESS thermal event can involve the application of significant volumes of water, which does not allow for the collection and treatment. It is important to understand what liquid constituents are released in a thermal event and whether they are soluble.
Decommissioning: Objections raised around decommissioning or plans to remove facilities at the end of their lifecycle, are easily addressed through prefunded demolition and thorough commissioning plans.
Understanding current codes/standards
The following codes and standards are used to regulate BESS installations in New York State and can serve as an example.
Hazard assessment & best practices
 BESS systems can vary dramatically, but the New York State Code and reference standards that regulate them are a one size fits all approach. This makes the site-specific hazard assessment critical to successful approval of each system. These assessments should be prepared by licensed professionals and provided for every BESS installation. They outline the hazards of each system and should be the basis for a jurisdictional review and approval.
While there is no substitution for a site-specific hazard assessment, the following are some approaches we have seen implemented in response to AHJ/public comments during the approval process along with some suggested tasks that can assist in reducing the potential for system safety issues arising:
Anticipated code/permit changes and outcomes
The outbreak of fires at three different BESS facilities has led to the reevaluation of industry safety procedures. New York State Senator Mark Walcyzk has called for a freeze on building new BESS projects until a full investigation is conducted. In response, New York’s Governor Hochul announced that large-scale energy storage facilities across the state will be inspected to ensure compliance with safety regulations. Additionally, Hochul created an inter-agency Fire Safety Working Group that includes NYSERDA, OFPC and the Department of Public Services (DPS), and LaBella Associates’ Building Code & Life Safety Services team. Together, we’ll work to establish best practices and help standardize the review and approval of BESS systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/10/merging-der-platforms-into-single-virtual-power-plant-solution/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"NOVEMBER 10, 2023",Merging DER platforms into single virtual power plant solution,"Grid solutions providers Swell Energy and Shifted Energy are merging the capabilities of their individual distributed energy resource management systems into a single offering that they say will help utilities better manage distributed assets on the grid. 
Shifted Energy’s Grid Maestro system focuses on the smart management of household loads, like water heaters, thermostats and electric vehicle chargers, while Swell’s GridAmp manages and dispatches distributed solar and energy storage systems. Together, the two comprise a turnkey virtual power plant (VPP) solution that will provide utilities with forecasts of energy demand and generation across the board, the companies say. 
As the electricity grid grows more distributed, VPPs – essentially networks of distributed energy resources, like rooftop solar and home battery storage systems – are becoming a key solution to ensuring reliability amid a transitioning energy mix and extreme weather events. 
VPPs can improve the way electricity supply and demand are balanced on the grid – a balancing act that is becoming more crucial as the grid relies increasingly on renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which don’t produce electricity as steadily as a traditional fossil fuel plant, Sarah Delisle, vice president of government affairs and communications at Swell Energy, told pv magazine USA.
“By spreading out smaller, localized energy generation systems across the grid rather than depending on a few large, centralized power plants, we can reduce our dependence on long-distance power transmission,” she said. 
And the integration of the two companies’ platforms offers several benefits to utilities, Delisle said. By expanding the pool of distributed energy resources (DERs) available to participate in a VPP, utilities can access a larger pool of controlled energy capacity in a single program, for example. And with more DERs integrated into the grid, they can use demand response strategies to reduce load during peak times, for instance by instructing connected devices to lower their energy use. 
There’s also the potential to use these resources for “capacity building” events – for instance, during times of low demand on the grid, excess energy from solar panels or the grid can be stored in batteries or water heaters, and then used during peak hours, she said. 
“A grid with greater control of and participation from the distributed energy generation and loads it is designed to serve can better withstand disruptions and provide improved grid resilience,” said Delisle. 
Moreover, utilities can also see cost savings by deferring or avoiding infrastructure upgrades that would otherwise be needed to meet peak demand, she added. 
The companies are working with multiple utilities in California and Hawaii, but in light of the changing climate, aging infrastructure and increasing demand on the grid, see VPPs as a good fit almost everywhere. That said, certain states – including Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts, among others – have markets and economics that are most advantageous for the technology, Delisle said. These states are also where Swell and Shifted are focusing their efforts. 
A Brattle report from earlier this year compared the net cost of providing 400 MW of resource adequacy from three resources – a natural gas peaker, a grid-interconnected battery system, and a VPP composed of residential demand flexibility technologies – and found that the VPP offered utilities a net cost that is roughly 40% to 60% that of alternative options. In fact, 60 GW of VPP deployment could meet future domestic resource adequacy needs at a cost that is $15 billion to $35 billion lower than alternatives over the ensuing decade, according to the report.
