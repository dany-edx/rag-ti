The BLM, part of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), released the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) and amendment to the California Desert Conservation Area Land Use Plan for the project.
Publication of these documents initiated a 30-day protest period and a 60-day consistency review by the California governor. The BLM said it will then work to resolve any protests and issue a record of decision.
If approved, the Crimson solar project is expected to generate enough electricity to power 87,500 homes. Sonoran West Solar Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Canadian Solar unit Recurrent Energy, would build and operate the project on up to 2,500 acres of public land.
As currently proposed, the Crimson project represents an investment of $550 million and would support up to 650 temporary construction jobs, 10 permanent jobs, and 40 temporary jobs in operations and maintenance over its 30-year expected lifetime.
The BLM’s actions come after President Joe Biden issued several executive orders to take a government-wide approach to fight climate change.
In his Jan. 27 orders, Biden rolled back Trump administration policies and halted new oil and gas leases on federal lands. The president also tasked the DOI with identifying steps to accelerate responsible development of renewable energy on public lands and waters.
The DOI said it has initiated a review of processes and procedures to date as it reinvests in a “rigorous” renewable energy program.
Information about the Crimson project, along with the BLM’s preferred alternative and instructions for filing a protest, is available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/15/university-wins-approval-for-a-2-4-mw-solar-array-in-wisconsin/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WISCONSIN",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 15, 2021",University wins approval for a 2.4 MW solar array in Wisconsin,"The University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UW-Platteville) received state approval to build a 2.4 MW solar array on five acres in the public university’s Memorial Park.
According to UW-Platteville, the project will be the largest solar array owned by a Wisconsin state agency and is scheduled to go online this fall.
UW-Platteville said the array will feed power directly into the university’s main electricity system, which is connected to its 32 campus buildings, rather than send it back to the grid. The project is expected to meet 17% of the university’s energy use and save $217,000 annually. It is also designed to accommodate future battery energy storage.
Plans for the solar project stemmed from a 2018 petition, signed by more than 300 UW-Platteville students, asking the university to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2030.
The 2.4 MW array is one of several projects the university is advancing in response to the petition. The campus already hosts a wind turbine and a smaller rooftop solar project atop its Engineering Hall.
Chancellor Dennis J. Shields said the university’s sustainability efforts will save taxpayer money and help “pave the way for other state agencies to follow suit.”
UW-Platteville offers a four-year renewable energy degree and recently launched an environmental science and conservation degree. In addition to the energy savings, the solar project is intended to bring hands-on learning opportunities across the university.
Students helped design the initial solar project, formed a plan to graze sheep under the array, and developed a native pollinator seeding plan for the space.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/15/military-veterans-are-poised-to-help-lead-record-solar-growth/,"EMPLOYMENT,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 15, 2021",Military veterans are poised to help lead record solar growth,"As clean energy companies work to meet growing demands, many have had difficulty finding qualified job applicants.
In the 10th annual National Solar Jobs Census released in 2019, 83% of solar employers reported it was difficult or somewhat difficult to fill key roles, predominantly because of a lack of candidates with sufficient training or technical skills.
The good news is that the solar industry is poised for rapid, historic growth over the next few years, and there is a technically-skilled pool of men and women with diverse backgrounds ready to fill the thousands of jobs this industry will create – military veterans.
Veterans are team players who know how to lead a team, and they don’t shy away from hard work. Many of the technical skills that veterans acquire during their military service align with the skills that solar companies are seeking – not only for installers, but also for leadership positions in project management, engineering, IT, and other areas where training and experience are crucial. For these reasons and many more, our military veterans are ideal candidates for solar talent acquisition departments and organizations, like Hiring Our Heroes, are here to make those connections.
Hiring Our Heroes, a workforce development initiative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, is committed to strengthening and diversifying the nation’s workforce by connecting employers with top talent. We help veterans identify careers that maximize their skill sets and have found the solar industry to be a successful match. For job candidates, solar companies offer an attractive career path with competitive pay and a wide range of leadership opportunities.
Is the solar industry taking advantage of the skills our veterans have to offer? There are more than 19,000 veterans working in the solar industry, representing 7.6% of the overall workforce, according to The Solar Foundation’s latest National Solar Jobs Census. While this runs slightly ahead of the overall economy, in which veterans represent 5.9% of the workforce, there is incredible room for growth.
With less than 1% of all Americans currently serving in the military, HR professionals and hiring managers often lack sufficient knowledge about military service or the skills acquired during that time. They traditionally don’t understand how to interpret military experience when looking at veterans’ resumes, and when they do hire a veteran, most are overwhelmingly pleased with their performance.
A survey of 400 HR professionals conducted by Hiring Our Heroes found that HR professionals  associate veterans with attributes like discipline, loyalty, work ethic, timeliness, and their ability to work on a team – the same attributes that solar company hiring managers tell us they are seeking in job candidates. The study went on to say these attributes aren’t as easily found in civilian applicants.
There are several roadblocks that continue to be a challenge. Our research found that more than 80% of HR professionals say that their companies lack specialized training to help civilian employees and staff relate to veterans. Similarly, nearly 70% report that their employers do not provide any special assistance to veterans during the onboarding process.
We are working to change these statistics through the Solar Ready Vets Fellowship program, a pathway to connect solar companies with military veterans. This program, led by The Solar Foundation and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the broader Solar Ready Vets Network, places active-duty service members in a 12-week, work-based learning program focused on management and professional positions, such as project management, engineering and system design, supply chain and logistics, project development, operations and asset management, business development, IT, and a variety of corporate functions. Through a collaborative effort between Hiring Our Heroes, The Solar Foundation, and the Solar Energy Industries Association, this program is offered to solar companies at no cost.
Fellowship candidates are carefully matched with participating companies based on their specific knowledge and skills, and the preferences of both parties. Through this process, employers gain access to the best and brightest transitioning military talent while gaining a deeper understanding of the veteran labor market.
Hiring Our Heroes is ready for companies to participate in the next cohort, with a March 5 deadline approaching. Companies are encouraged to apply to be a host company in the Solar Ready Vets Fellowship program to tap into this valuable talent pool.
The solar industry is growing quickly and in order to be successful, you need employees with the skills to match that growth. Veterans are ready to contribute to your company’s success in 2021 and beyond.
Eric Eversole is the president of Hiring Our Heroes, and a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Included in the deal is the 200 MW Sun Streams 2 solar plant, which is under construction and slated to enter service in June. The other two projects, which represent a combined 700 MW of capacity, have yet to break ground. They could be developed to include up to 2 GWh of energy storage capacity.
First Solar will provide its Series 6 modules for the facilities. Around 700 MW represent new bookings for the manufacturer.
Sun Streams 2 is being built by McCarthy Building Cos. Its energy production will be sold under a long-term contract with an unnamed buyer.
Sun Streams 4 and 5 have target in-service dates of 2022 and 2024, respectively. Sun Streams 4 would have a capacity of 200 MW; Sun Streams 5 would have 500 MW of capacity.
The Sun Streams complex offers access to the California Independent System Operator grid as well as Southwest markets. It is located west of Phoenix and close to the Palo Verde nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear generating station in the United States.
In January, First Solar said it would sell a 10 GW utility-scale solar project platform to Leeward Renewable Energy Development. The $261 million transaction is expected to close in the first quarter. Leeward is a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, an investment arm of OMERS, one of Canada’s largest benefit pension plans.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/15/sunrise-brief-southeast-utilities-ask-ferc-for-market-changes-that-could-help-renewables/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 15, 2021",Sunrise brief: Southeast utilities ask FERC for market changes that could help renewables,"Utility members of the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve an automated, intra-hour energy exchange that they said could lower costs and optimize renewable energy resources.
The new SEEM platform is intended to facilitate sub-hourly, bilateral trading. It would allow participants to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, making use of available unreserved transmission. The platform would extend an existing bilateral market platform.
SEEM members said the new design would result in cost savings and improved resource integration.
Founding members of SEEM are expected to include Associated Electric Cooperative, Dalton Utilities, Dominion Energy South Carolina, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Georgia System Operations Corp., Georgia Transmission Corp., LG&E and KU Energy, MEAG Power, NCEMC, Oglethorpe Power Corp., PowerSouth, Santee Cooper, Southern Company and TVA.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) said it entered emergency conditions and started rotating outages at 1:25 a.m. February 15.
About 10,500 MW of customer load was shed at the highest point, enough to serve around two million homes.
The grid operator said that extreme weather conditions caused many generating units – across fuel types – to trip offline and become unavailable. It reported more than 30,000 MW of generation had been forced off the system.
“Every grid operator and every electric company is fighting to restore power right now,” said ERCOT President and CEO Bill Magness.
A reported 93% of participating PNM Resources shareholders voted to approve a merger agreement with Avangrid. Under terms of the merger, PNM Resources shareholders would receive $50.30 in cash for each share of PNM Resources common stock held at closing.
Clearances under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) have already been received. Approvals are still needed from the Federal Communications Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Public Utility Commission of Texas, and New Mexico Public Regulation Commission.
PNM Resources said it expects the merger to close in the second half of 2021.
The value of distributed energy resources (DERs) largely depends on three things: Location, location, location.
That’s according to a new Berkeley Lab report, Locational Value of Distributed Energy Resources, which explores economic valuation and regulatory considerations for assessing locational value.
DERs can provide significant benefits to the grid by generating electricity or controlling or reducing electricity consumption, avoiding some types of electricity system costs. The potential value of a DER at a specific location on the grid depends on its capability and potential costs it can avoid at that location.

The report focuses on potential DER benefits for distribution systems, primarily in their role as non-wires alternatives to defer, mitigate, or eliminate the need for some traditional system investments at locations where distribution capacity is insufficient to meet expected future needs. DERs that avoid distribution system losses also may reduce transmission system losses and generation capacity needs. These reductions may have other benefits, including achieving goals for greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.
The report said that as solar panels cover more rooftops, and as buildings with load controls and storage provide more grid services, understanding the value of distributed energy resources is increasingly important. However, few utilities and states currently consider their value at specific points on the electric system in planning, procuring, and designing DER programs and rates.
In addition to analyzing DERs as potential alternatives to specific traditional distribution system projects, the report said that utilities can conduct systematic studies of the locational value of DERs to better understand where to target DERs, calibrate incentive levels, reduce load growth for specific areas of the distribution system, and reduce the need for traditional distribution system upgrades. These studies can become a routine part of the utility’s distribution planning process. Information also can be used for DER programs and rate designs.
The report includes 24 case studies to illustrate how states and utilities are considering the locational value of DERs.
Dominion Energy Virginia said its crews are working to restore power after more than 48 hours of freezing rain and ice brought “significant damage” to parts of central and southern Virginia, including broken poles and hundreds of downed power lines. The utility said the ice storm was the worst since 2000. Restoration efforts were underway over the weekend and the utility said the “vast majority of customers” were expected to be back online by Tuesday. More than 290,000 customers had lost power since 4 a.m. February 13.
