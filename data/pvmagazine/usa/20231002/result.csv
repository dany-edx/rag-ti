Researchers led by MIT and Shanghai Jiao Tong University have demonstrated solar-powered multi-stage membrane distillation. They claim it can significantly reduce the cost of water production.
“The configuration of the device allows water to circulate in swirling eddies, in a manner similar to the much larger ‘thermohaline’ circulation of the ocean,” the scientists said. “This circulation, combined with the sun’s heat, drives water to evaporate, leaving salt behind. The resulting water vapor can then be condensed and collected as pure, drinkable water. In the meantime, the leftover salt continues to circulate through and out of the device, rather than accumulating and clogging the system.”
Thermohaline circulation describes how fluid motion occurs due to the buoyancy difference between hot, less dense material rising and cold, denser material sinking under gravity, leading to heat transfer.
The researchers said that if they upscale the system to the size of a small suitcase, it could generate 4 liters to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last for several years before needing replacement components. At this scale and efficiency, the system could produce drinking water more affordably than tap water.
The device comprises a series of compartments with heat exchangers and condensate collectors. The central component is a single-stage unit resembling a slim box covered in heat-absorbing dark material. Inside, the box is divided into upper and lower sections.
Water flows through the top half, featuring an evaporator layer on its surface that utilizes solar heat to evaporate water directly. The resulting water vapor is then directed into the bottom half of the box, where a condensation layer cools it, transforming it into drinkable, salt-free liquid. The researchers positioned the entire box at an angle inside a larger, empty container, connecting a tube from the top half of the box to the bottom of the vessel and allowing it to float in saltwater.
“In this configuration, water can naturally push up through the tube and into the box, where the tilt of the box, combined with the thermal energy from the sun, induces the water to swirl as it flows through,” the researchers explained. “The small eddies help to bring water in contact with the upper evaporating layer while keeping salt circulating, rather than settling and clogging.”
The team built several prototypes, with one, three and 10 stages, and tested their performance in water of different salinity, including natural seawater and seven times saltier water.
“With a 10-stage device, we achieve record-breaking solar-water efficiency of 322%-121% in a salinity range of 0 to 20% by weight, under the illumination of a single sun. Furthermore, we demonstrate extreme resistance to salt accumulation with a 180-hour continuous desalination of 20 wt% concentrated seawater,” they concluded.
They presented the system in “Extreme salt-resisting multistage solar distillation with thermohaline convection,” which was recently published in Joule.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/02/massachusetts-can-save-4-6-million-metric-tons-of-carbon-by-changing-solar-development-strategy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 2, 2023",Massachusetts can save 4.6 million metric tons of carbon by changing solar development strategy,"Solar energy is a cornerstone of the global push toward a decarbonized economy in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. But the environmental outcomes of solar projects can vary vastly. 
In Massachusetts, a small and densely populated state, open spaces come at a premium. This leads to forested and workable lands being purchased and developed for solar projects.  
The Massachusetts Audubon Society released a report that showed the state has developed about 5,000 acres of natural and working lands for the purposes of solar development between 2010 and 2020. While the state has over 5 million acres of forest, the impact of this development is more than just the land area lost. Forests are powerful carbon sinks, as plants respirate by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. 
The 5,000 acres of development since 2010 has led to an equivalent carbon sequestration loss of over 500,000 metric tons of carbon. This is comparable to the annual emissions of 100,000 gas powered vehicles. More than half the ground mount solar capacity in the state has been developed on destroyed forest land, said the report. 
This loss of stored carbon works against the state’s goals of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In order to reach that target, solar will need to expand five to seven times its current cumulative capacity by mid-century.  
The report said that if current development trends continue, over 4.6 million metric tons of sequestered CO2 would be stripped from the earth, which is equivalent to about 75% of the annual emissions of the City of Boston. 
The unprecedented development offers an opportunity to place a value on the difference in environmental outcomes of a project. The Audubon Society recommends encouraging a mix of rooftop solar, solar parking canopies, and solar developed on landfills and other contaminated sites, and defunct golf courses. 
The report assessed that with legal zoning setbacks incorporated, about 35,000 acres of Massachusetts’ 55,000 parking lots could host solar parking canopies, leading to a 9.9 GW total solar technical potential. When combined with nearly 120,000 acres of viable rooftop space, parking canopies and rooftops can combine for over 30 GW of solar potential. 
The report recognizes that rooftop and parking canopy development is more expensive than ground-mounted utility-scale systems. Reaching Massachusetts’ mid-century climate goal while following the Audubon Society’s mid-range land preservation scenario, which still allows for about 98,000 acres of land development, would cost about $900 million more than the business-as-usual scenario. 
However, the report argues that when a valuation is placed on the stored carbon, this development scenario could lead to $940 million to $980 million in benefits. 
“Forests directly absorb carbon from the atmosphere — that’s what photosynthesis is. They are a technology for carbon removal,” said Jonathan Thompson, senior ecologist at Harvard Forest and report co-author.  
“But we also need to remember that forests are far more than buckets of carbon. They are providers of clean air and clean water. They are where we recreate. They’re where we find solace and they are home for biodiversity,” said Thompson. 
The report from Massachusetts Audubon included several policy recommendations for the state:

(TSI) reached what it called an agreeable settlement in a lawsuit brought in May by First Solar.
First Solar initially filed a lawsuit against Toledo Solar, a thin-film solar module manufacturer, which, according to court filing  sold Malayasian-made First Solar modules under the Toledo name, claiming they were made in America.
First Solar stated that Toledo falsely claimed that it manufactured the solar modules that Toledo had provided for installation on the Ohio Governor’s mansion in Columbus, that Toledo falsely represent that the modules were made by Toledo in Ohio, and that Toledo advertised on social media that it manufactured certain solar modules in Ohio.
Details of the settlement are confidential; however, Toledo Solar announced a new investor-led independent board of directors and leadership team. The company said the change is to “re-affirm Toledo Solar’s commitment to US energy security by manufacturing high-quality American-made CdTe solar panels in Ohio for the residential, commercial, and industrial markets”.
Lead investor, Sean Fontenot, is the board’s new chairman and he noted that First Solar’s lawsuit came as a surprise.
“The recent First Solar complaint was a very concerning surprise. We are finalizing gathering all of the facts around this and expect to resolve the matter shortly. From our perspective, First Solar and Toledo Solar are critical partners in several critical industry programs that are important to the Government’s US Energy Security policies for American-made solar products, and we are re-dedicating our commitment to making sure this continues.”
Tom Pratt has been appointed interim president, treasurer, and secretary by Toledo Solar’s board of directors.
“I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with the Board of Directors for Toledo Solar and the impressive team, both technical and administrative, that is working hard to bring Toledo Solar’s innovative products to market,” said Pratt.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/02/utility-scale-project-updates-for-booming-texas-solar-market/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 2, 2023",Utility-scale project updates for booming Texas solar market,"Texas now leads the way for solar development in the United States, with many large utility-scale projects coming online month after month. A 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the roughly 16 GW that is active to date.
Much of this investment in solar, which nears $20 billion, is going towards large solar facilities, often exceeding 100 MW in capacity. Over 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and those jobs numbers will sharply rise as more utility-scale projects are built. Today, nearly 5% of Texas electricity is generated by solar.
(Read: “Solar is reliably and predictably supporting the Texas grid”)
The solar buildout is promising for Texas, though it does come with some mounting challenges in transmission costs and congestion, climate resilience, and price stabilization.
Relatively low land costs and high solar irradiance in West Texas makes it one of the premier hotbeds of solar development. This development is pushed along by high demand from East Texas, which houses five of the top 15 largest cities in the U.S. Below are some recent utility-scale solar developments across the Lonestar State:
Ashtrom 400 MW
Ashtrom Renewable Energy, an independent power producer, announced it signed financing totaling about $270 million with a group of five banks to fund a 400 MW solar project in Texas. The U.S operation of Bank Hapoalim Group, Bayerische Landesbank, ING Capital, Rabobank and Société Générale were participants.
The project includes a tax credit transfer agreement to sell the production tax credit (PTC) associated with the project, which is valued at $300 million. The project is among the first solar projects in the U.S. to execute a PTC credit transfer agreement under the Inflation Reduction Act.
In a 20-year power purchase agreement, Ashtrom will sell about 60% of the project’s electricity generation to CPS Energy, the municipal utility serving San Antonio.
The project is located on 2,400 acres in Pecos County, Texas and is currently under construction. Commercial operations are expected for Q4 2024.
bp 187 MW
bp announced is has begun construction on a 187 MWdc project that will supply power to a Gulf Coast Growth Ventures petrochemical complex. The facility produces materials used to manufacture clothes, food containers, packaging, agricultural film and construction materials. 
The project is expected to bring 300 construction jobs and $25 million in tax revenues over a 25-year period.
At full capacity, the project is estimated to offset the emissions of the equivalent of about 55,000 fuel-burning cars. The project is expected to come online in the second half of 2024.
Recurrent Energy 134 MW
Recurrent Energy, the development arm of Canadian Solar, announced it closed financing for a 134 MWdc solar project in Liberty County, Texas. The project is about 50 miles northeast of Houston.
Rabobank acted as the Coordinating Lead Arranger and the Joint Lead Arranger. Nord LB and U.S. Bank acted as Joint Lead Arrangers. Rabobank, Nord LB and U.S. Bank are expected to provide construction debt, a letter of credit facility and a term facility, totaling $120 million. U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank, is expected to provide the tax equity totaling $80 million.
Liberty Solar will expand solar energy capacity in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region, which includes most of Liberty County where Liberty Solar is located. Solar energy currently makes up only 1% of the resource mix in MISO.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/02/virginia-utilitys-resource-plan-needs-more-solar-and-storage-says-trade-group/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,VIRGINIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 2, 2023","Virginia utility’s resource plan needs more solar and storage, says trade group","A Virginia utility artificially limited the amount of solar, wind and storage that could be added each year in the resource plan it submitted to state regulators, said Maria Roumpani, technical director for Strategen Consulting, in testimony filed by the trade group Advanced Energy United.
Dominion Energy’s Virginia utility did not develop a least-cost resource plan compliant with the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), Roumpani said.
State regulators, she said, should require Dominion to revise its resource plan and include at least one resource mix that meets VCEA requirements regarding the amount of solar, wind and storage to be added over the coming years, and that allows for selection of renewable resources above the VCEA development targets “on a least-cost optimization basis.”
That resource mix should not include “forced-in fossil resources,” Roumpani said, and should meet five additional criteria as well.
Dominion limited solar capacity additions to 900 MW per year through 2038. But in its 2020 resource plan, Dominion’s resource modeling selected 1,440 MW of utility-scale solar for several years within the planning period, Roumpani said. “Although real-life limitations exist, Dominion could pursue additional solar projects at customer sites, brownfield locations, or consider easing interconnection considerations with different configurations of hybrid resources with larger-sized DC components.”
Dominion’s resource planning process limited storage capacity additions to 300 MW per year, while in comparison California already has 5,600 MW of storage capacity, Roumpani said.
When allowed to optimize, Dominion’s model selected only power purchase agreements, “as it found them to be more economic than company-owned resources,” Roumpani added.
More solar and storage
The Sierra Club also challenged Dominion’s resource plan, submitting testimony from Devi Glick, a senior principal at Synapse Energy Economics, who conducted independent modeling using the EnCompass resource planning model.
Glick testified that if Dominion retired three coal plants and added more solar and storage, it could reduce CO2 emissions and save ratepayers $7.7 billion over the 25-year study period, based on solar and storage cost projections from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Annual Technology Baseline.
Those CO2 reductions and customer savings would result from adding 17 GW more solar and 5 GW more storage over the next 15 years than in a resource mix in Dominion’s plan that was selected for comparison.
Glick recommended that state regulators require Dominion to revise its resource plan by lifting or easing the build limits it placed on solar PV and battery storage.
Virginia regulators rejected Dominion’s initial proposed resource plans in both 2018 and 2021.

Global solar PV employment sat at 4.9 million in 2022, up from 4.3 million in 2021, according to the recently published Renewable Energy and Jobs Annual Review 2023 by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Among all renewable energy technologies – including hydro, wind and biogas – solar PV was the “fastest-growing” sector and accounted for over one-third of the total renewable energy workforce (13.7) million, the report claimed.
India employed the second largest number of workers, with 281,400 staffers, with on-grid solar estimated to have generated 201,400 jobs and another 80,600 in off-grid settings, the report stated. The US comprised the third-largest solar PV workforce in 2022 with 264,000 employees.
“Increasing solar PV installations in Brazil boosted employment in this industry to 241,000 jobs. Japan added less capacity in 2021 than the previous year. IRENA estimates its workforce at 127,000,” the report stated.
force with 540,000 workers in 2022. The report stated that the European Union experienced a “surge” in PV imports in the first half of 2022 due to the Ukraine crisis and subsequent efforts to reduce reliance on oil and gas imports. “However, installation rates trailed due to shortages of inverters and skilled labor, which subsequently slowed imports during the second half of the year,” stated the report.
Female representation in the solar industry was higher than any other renewable energy in 2022, with 40% of the workforce being female – twice as much as in wind, oil and gas sectors, the report claimed. However, women’s participation still falls “somewhat short” of the share of women employed in the overall economy.
Women’s employment in the industry was “uneven”, with females mostly hired for administrative positions (58%) followed by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (38%) and non-STEM technical positions (35%). Women accounted for only 30% of managerial jobs and only 17% of the total senior management.
