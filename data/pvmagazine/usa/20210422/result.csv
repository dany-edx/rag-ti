One investment priority is to seek leadership commitments from, and organize 80 or more building owners and anchor institutions, to develop and implement long-range energy plans for their buildings. The goal is to equip at least 65 faith communities with roadmaps to phase out their buildings’ use of fossil fuels, and complete 30 energy efficiency demonstration projects.
Faith institutions were chosen because their show of commitment is expected to help in the ongoing development of a project pipeline. Projects included in the program may include solar arrays.
The grant money was offered to Metro Industrial Areas Foundation (Metro IAF ), the Community Purchasing Alliance (CPA), and BlocPower.
As part of the partnership, CPA will help a group of congregations and building owners navigate the process of developing solar on their roofs, parking lots, or other properties, and “get the best terms possible through their combined buying power,” said Joe Naroditsky, director of solar programs for the group.
Outreach to institutions in disadvantaged communities is being prioritized. The energy efficiency work is expected to generate millions of dollars in economic activity as well as jobs and health benefits for communities that need them most.
Metro IAF will oversee each project. Contractors will commit to workforce development standards that include ensuring that the projects benefit congregation members. The program sets a target that 40% of the total worker hours be performed by residents of disadvantaged communities or people who previously were unemployed or underemployed.
Funding for the initiative is through the state’s 10-year, $5.3 billion Clean Energy Fund. The program supports Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 85% by 2050, as outlined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.

Cushing is home to one of the world’s largest oil-storage tank farms, with a working capacity of more than 10% of total U.S. storage. It is also the delivery and pricing point for West Texas Intermediate crude oil future contracts, a global benchmark.
The solar generation will initially power Plexus industrial data centers, which deliver off-grid power and data center services for the energy and technology sectors. The system will also supply power to Getka’s planned terminal expansion in Cushing, which the company said will include tank designs to minimize and capture emissions and will use solar power for terminal operations.
Getka said it plans to reduce so-called avoidable emissions through renewable energy and operational processes, working toward zero emissions for its oil and refined-products terminals.
Based in Tulsa, Getka Group is focused on upstream mineral production, acquisitions and operations, asset development, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, as well as alternative and renewable energy operations. Getka recently launched a solar division and said it is developing megawatt-scale solar facilities in the U.S. and Europe.

The investment is in addition to a separate $1.5 billion, multi-year loan purchase program with Congressional Bank announced on April 14. That program gives Mosaic access to Congressional Bank’s subsidiary, Alliance partners, the asset manager to BancAlliance, a network of more than 260 community banks nationwide.
The new financing partnerships are expected to help more than 100,000 homeowners afford sustainable energy and home improvement projects.
Earlier, Mosaic announced a $331 million securitization of its residential solar loans, its ninth loan securitization to date. The securitization was priced at a weighted average yield of 2.0% and was inside of 100 basis points.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/22/omco-solar-to-provide-15-mw-of-trackers-to-projects-across-arkansas/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARKANSAS",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 22, 2021",OMCO Solar to provide 15 MW of trackers to Arkansas projects,"OMCO Solar, through its partnership with Arkansas-based Entegrity Energy Partners, said it will supply 15 MW worth of  trackers for solar projects across the state.
This is not OMCO Solar’s first project partnership with Entegrity; the two previously teamed up on a 1.36 MW co-located solar array for two Arkansas school districts.
OMCO Solar said its ORIGIN tracker offers unique benefits for project developers and installers in both design and cost. OMCO boasts that the tracker allows for long module rows, up to 120 modules, and minimized gaps over posts, between modules and at row ends. The company also manufactures its own torque tubes, which allows for domestic control of the supply chain and reduced distribution costs. Since torque tubes can be among of the most expensive pieces of a tracker system, OMCO said that its tubes have saved up to 25% of the tracker cost in some cases.
OMCO Solar and its ORIGIN tracker has been specified for more than 30 projects across the U.S. since 2019. Worldwide, the company has delivered roughly 8 GW of solar mounting structures.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/04/22/solar-101-attaching-your-solar-system-to-your-roof/,"RACKING,RESIDENTIAL PV,NORTH AMERICA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 22, 2021",Solar 101: Attaching your solar system to your roof,"In our first article of our Solar 101 series, (“Is my roof ready for solar?“) we discussed the age of our roof and how it affects the finances involved in a solar installation.
Now, we’ll consider the roof’s physical characteristics. After all, the roofing material type and its underlying structure, as well the various angles of its faces and layout, will affect many aspects of the installation.
Most rooftops in the United States are built up from plywood and finished with asphalt shingles. However, depending on your region and neighborhood aesthetic, the top layer of the roofing type can vary greatly. We often find Spanish tiles in the south, metal seam roofs in the far north, and clay, slate, and concrete tile products peppered all over the map.
All of these roof types will require a mechanical attachment.
QuickMountPV offers up an installation guide – with a very nice series of images – for those installing solar power on top of tiled roofs.
In this installation tweet from Sunrun, you can see how to attach to the plywood base layer of a roof. Underneath the metal flashing, you can see a series of lag bolts and silicon that cures and seals the attachment.
A metal seam roof will also require a hard attachment to the roof, but via a less obtrusive tool, perhaps by someone like S-5!. This quick video by S-5! gives an idea of how that attachment occurs.
But most installations won’t be like these three examples. They will use standard flashing and lag bolts drilled through the existing asphalt shingles.
All major racking manufacturers provide this hardware. Quickbolt offers a unique – almost cute – “microflashing” unit. This is as simple as it gets: drill hole, install sealant, tighten fastener.
Racking hardware connects your panels to the L-feet and the flashing connections mentioned above. All of this hardware is built to engineering specifications and are ready to hold up to the worst that Mother Nature can deliver.
In South Florida, the local building code requires some rooftop solar systems within a mile of the ocean to be able to withstand uplift generated by winds greater than 180 miles per hour. In the northern United States, snow loads greater than 50 pounds per square foot must be accounted for.
Wind and snow loads dictate a lot about how your solar system is designed. Racking manufacturer Unirac includes general solar panel setback from the edge of roof requirements in its installation manuals.
In the images below, the areas where wind forces are highest are represented in gray. Thus, engineers suggest we ‘”set back” our solar panels from these areas, or pay extra for hardware to strengthen the attachment points.
Image: Unirac
The strength of a solar racking system is determined in part by the metal racking, but it also depends on the roof’s underlying structure. Specifically, rafters (or trusses) and any supporting structures must be strong enough to withstand your region’s maximum wind loads.
The lag bolts noted above are generally drilled into the wood beams underneath the base layer of your roof’s plywood. As a rule of thumb, in most homes we’re looking for a minimum of two-inch-thick wood beams spaced no more than 36 inches apart.
Your installer will most likely consult with a state-certified structural engineer to determine if your home’s construction is appropriate for solar. While most homes are deemed structurally sound, proving that to some building departments can sometimes be a bit costly.
Now that we’ve covered the basics of connecting solar panels to a roof, it’s time to find a place for the panels. The most obvious feature we’re looking for is large, uninterrupted roof space. Bigger chunks of roof are easier, and cheaper, to install solar panels.
Keep in mind that a standard residential solar panel is roughly five and a half feet tall by three feet wide. Pictured below, this 290 to 320 watt solar panel from URE represents a standard residential product. Panel sizes vary by manufacturer and model. For instance, Solaria’s 400 watt PowerXT high efficiency panel is an extra six inches wider.

Using these approximate sizes of the panels and our roof, we can determine roughly how many panels will fit on our roof, and where.
In our next article, we discuss how a home’s latitude affects a solar project’s design and performance. We will also offer examples of how to calculate the electricity generated by a system.

The announcement was made during a two-day international Leaders Summit on Climate that Biden organized in an effort to challenge the world on addressing climate change.
Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said that the Nationally Determined Contribution submitted by the Biden administration “sends a clear message that the United States is ready to embrace the economic transformation necessary to tackle the climate crisis.”

As part of the administration’s ambition to halve U.S. emissions, it set a goal to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. It aims to do that by deploying a range of generating resources, transmission, and energy storage, and by retrofitting fossil-fueled power plants with carbon capture technology. Nuclear power is also part of the administration’s mix of technology options.

Another goal is to pursue efficiency upgrades and electrification in buildings. This would be done through wider use of heat pumps and induction stoves, and adoption of modern energy codes for new buildings. The U.S. will also invest in new technologies to reduce emissions associated with construction, including for high-performance electrified buildings.
As part of the administration’s ambition to halve U.S. emissions, it set a goal to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.

In the industrial sector, the Biden administration pointed to possible carbon reductions through carbon capture as well as new sources of hydrogen—produced from renewable energy, nuclear energy, or waste—to power industrial facilities. It said the government can use its procurement power to support early markets for these low- and zero-carbon industrial goods.
The administration also said that the U.S. will invest in innovation to improve and broaden the set of solutions as a “critical complement to deploying the affordable, reliable, and resilient clean technologies and infrastructure available today.”
Canadian Solar said that its Recurrent Energy unit has started work on the 100 MW Sunflower Solar Project in western Mississippi. To support construction, Recurrent closed debt financing totaling more than $146 million with Norddeutsche Landesbank and Rabobank.
Sunflower is being built under a Build Transfer Agreement. Recurrent signed a BTA with Entergy Mississippi in 2018 designating that the utility will own the Sunflower solar project when it reaches commercial operation in early 2022. The BTA was approved by state utility regulators in April 2020. The project will use Canadian Solar’s high-efficiency modules.
News reports said that Tesla solar panels and roof will only be sold together with its Powerwall battery. Solar power from these panels will feed exclusively to Powerwall, CEO Elon Musk reportedly said in a series of tweets.

His comments followed a Twitter exchange with Ark Investment Management’s Director of Research Brett Winton who said his solar installed by Tesla in January “hasn’t generated a single watt-hour” and that he was waiting for his utility to approve the connection. Musk said during Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January that the company was focusing on further integrating Powerwall with its solar division. The Twitter announcement would seem to move that idea forward.
A fourth Florida Power & Light Co. solar energy center begins construction in May, this time on the 74.5 MW Grove Solar Energy Center near Vero Beach on Florida’s east coast. Work is expected to be completed this summer. FPL currently has 37 solar energy centers in operation. The company plans to have more than 100 solar energy centers across Florida by 2030.
Miami-based Atlas Renewable Energy signed a Collaboration Agreement with Hitachi ABB Power Grids to jointly develop and execute battery energy storage systems (BESS) at a utility scale level for Atlas’ renewable projects.
The agreement will allow Hitachi ABB Power Grids to take part in developing and deploying BESS in new projects across Latin America. Hitachi ABB Power Grids will be invited to participate in tenders launched by Atlas Renewable Energy for the Engineering Package of the projects.
The main objective behind this agreement is to ensure that BESS can be successfully integrated into the design of new projects during the early development stage.
Two years ago, Atlas announced that it would be one of the first generators in Latin America to roll-out the TrueCapture system developed by Nextracker. Through the use of TrueCapture, the company’s solar plants tracking system has been optimized to the modular level resulting in an increase of the plants’ overall performance and efficiency.
Atlas Renewable Energy has also been one of the first developers to test bifacial modules and to introduce this technology on large scale, with around 1 GW of capacity being generated with this panel technology.
Atlas has around 2.2 GW of contracted projects in development, construction or operational stages, and aims to expand that amount by an additional 4 GW.
