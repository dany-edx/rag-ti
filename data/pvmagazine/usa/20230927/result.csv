A report published in the Journal of Photovoltaics showed that emissions-free electricity generation represents about 38% of the global mix as of the end of 2022.
The 38% mix is represented by solar, wind, hydroelectric, nuclear, and other non-emitting sources.
The report was authored by two senior researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Fossil fuel still provides the majority of the world’s total electricity generation each year, but that number is shrinking.
Despite supply chain and trade issues around the globe, solar energy represented the largest contribution to new electric generation capacity for the second year in a row in 2022. Non-fossil sources represented 85% of new capacity additions worldwide, and solar accounted for about two-thirds of that total. Solar alone contributed 56% of global capacity additions.
Solar is growing rapidly. In 2022 alone, 25% of the world’s cumulative global solar capacity was installed. The technology moved from 3.6% of the total electricity generation mix to about 4.5% in 2022, and it shows no signs of slowing down.
“In 2050, solar PV will be in unassailable position as the cheapest source of new electricity globally,” said DNV, a global risk assurance firm.
DNV expects the world energy mix to be 70% reliant on variable renewable sources like solar and wind power by 2050. Fossil fuels will represent just over 10% of the energy mix by that time.
Along this path, solar capacity increases 22-fold in DNV’s energy transition vision. The firm said it views variable renewables as the cheapest and quickest route to both decarbonization and energy security.
“It’s impressive to see how solar is dominating the current sales,” said Sarah Kurtz, a fellow with NREL’s National Center for Photovoltaics and a professor at the University of California, Merced. “We’re interested to see how much fossil generation expansion there is in the 2023 data for next year’s recap article. It could be that carbon-free energy sources will be consistently supplying almost all of our new generation capacity very soon.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/27/carbon-electrode-perovskite-solar-cells-on-track-to-commercialization/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023",Carbon electrode perovskite solar cells on track to commercialization,"From pv magazine Global
Thin-film perovskite solar cells made with carbon electrode back contacts, instead of metal ones, provide the opportunity to use low-temperature cell processes, with fewer steps, while ensuring stability. However, the advantages have always come at the cost of power conversion efficiency – until very recently.
“This year carbon electrode-based devices broke the psychological barrier of 20%, efficiency with several teams in several different locations announcing they had crossed the threshold,” Lukas Wagner, a researcher at Philipps-University Marburg, told pv magazine.
Researchers have made significant advancements in carbon electrode perovskite solar cells (c-PSC). In February, devices with 21.2% power conversion efficiency, as well as 19.6%-efficient mini-modules with stability above 4,390 hours, were reported in Nature Energy.
In June, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published a paper showcasing a c-PSC with 21.0% efficiency in ACS Energy Letters. Chinese researchers, meanwhile, reported a c-PSC with 20.8% efficiency, while another team developed an indoor c-PSC with an efficiency exceeding 30%.
Some experts see carbon electrodes as a promising avenue for the commercialization of low-cost, stable perovskite solar modules, as noted in the journal Electronics in February.
With  stability and efficiency on an upwards trajectory, there are now enough c-PSC companies and research teams exploring the technology to merit a conference – the First International Conference on Carbon Electrode-based Perovskite Solar Cells. It has attracted 34 speakers and more than 220 participants to participate in October, according to Wagner.
The ability to print the all or most of the cell stack is also a big part of the appeal of carbon electrodes.
“The cell stacks can be printed which eases upscaling and process with low capital expenditure,” said Wagner.
The event will feature speakers from various research groups and perovskite startup companies, including Switzerland-based materials firm Solaronix, Polish indoor/outdoor perovskite solar cell manufacturer Saule Technologies, Canadian thin-film startup Rayleigh Solar Tech, and perovskite materials specialist Greatcell Solar Italia.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/27/solar-is-reliably-and-predictably-supporting-the-texas-grid/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023",Solar is reliably and predictably supporting the Texas grid,"Solar energy is often a source of controversy in the discussion of the Texas electric grid, as opponents often argue that it fails to meet the hours of peak electricity demand as an intermittent source of electricity generation. While it is true that more energy storage will be needed to balance a grid increasingly dominated by solar and wind energy, the renewable resources are already providing more critical support than one may expect.
Analysis of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) reports on grid operation data shows that utility-scale solar power reliably provided peak electricity demand throughout the summer, said the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
Peak demand typically lands around 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. as air conditioning reaches its peak and homeowners return from work. From June 15 through September 15, 2023, ERCOT data shows that solar provided an average of about 14% of peak electricity demand statewide. Peak demand contributions ranged between 10% to 16% throughout the summer, showing a high level of predictability and reliability.
This is impressive when considering that peak demand hours come after peak generation hours for solar as the sun begins to set.
“The figures undercut a key argument used by fossil fuel advocates when talking about renewables—that they are not reliable or predictable,” said IEEFA. “The data proves otherwise. Solar is both reliable and predictable.”
IEEFA highlighted the extraordinary growth of solar in Texas in recent years. A ballooning population and increased electrification has sharply increased demand, and solar has stepped up to serve it. In 2019, utility-scale solar provided just over 500,000 MWh each month in July and August, just over 1% of electricity demand. This year, it delivered more than 3.9 million MWh in each month in July and August, meeting 8% of demand.
“But this overall figure vastly understates solar’s importance, since all solar generation occurs during the higher-demand daylight hours,” said IEEFA.
As solar grows to meet demand, energy storage is following to fully unlock its ability to serve electricity demand and stabilize the market. In 2020, 300 MW of storage was installed statewide. Now, there is over 3.5 GW of storage, and ERCOT’s interconnection queue has another 10 GW lined up. A significant portion of the projects, 7.2 GW, are designed as standalone energy storage projects, while the rest are co-located with solar generation. Batteries played an important role in keeping the lights on in Texas as heat waves passed through, according to local reports.
Significant solar capacity additions are on the way, too. By the end of June 2024, about 7 GW of utility-scale solar is expected to come online, according to ERCOT data.
“Together, these two highly predictable, and reliable, resources are primed to provide the system with low-cost electricity throughout the day, and especially at the peak hour when the grid needs it most,” concluded IEEFA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/27/edf-renewables-signs-20-year-ppa-for-solar-and-storage-project-with-el-paso-electric/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TEXAS",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023",EDF Renewables signs 20-year PPA for solar and storage project with El Paso Electric,"EDF Renewables, a clean energy infrastructure developer and subsidiary of Electricite de France SA, announced the start of a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with west Texas and New Mexico energy provider El Paso Electric (EPE). The PPA covers the output for two parts of the Milagro Solar+Storage Project. The first is a 150 MW solar park proposed by Milagro Solar I, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDF Renewables. The second is a 75 MW battery energy storage system (BESS). 
The Milagro Solar+Storage Project will sit on 1,100 acres in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, NM. It is expected to generate about 469,500 MWh of clean energy each year. According to EDF Renewables, tracker-mounted photovoltaic (PV) system blocks will convert solar energy directly to electrical power for export to the electrical grid. The tracker modules will likely sit on an aluminum rail, while the PV modules will consist of semiconductor material encapsulated in glass. The BESS container will include a transformer, monitoring, lighting, and cooling equipment. Developers are deciding whether to use a DC (direct-current) coupled or an AC (alternating current) coupled Lithium-Ion battery system.
This project moves EPE closer to its goal of producing 80% carbon-free energy by 2035 and 100% by 2045.
Since 2016, the utility provider has become increasingly inclined to adopt solar. According to Economist Impact, this was the same year EPE became the first utility in New Mexico and Texas to remove coal generation from its portfolio. Since then, EPE has constructed a 3,000 kW facility that houses its community solar program. In 2021, the energy provider issued an all-source Request for Proposal  for short and long-term renewable energy projects to help meet New Mexico’s generation rules. The state requires that 40% of all utility sales in its jurisdiction be powered by renewable energy by the beginning of 2025. Economist Impact reports that EPE plans to bring online four generating units producing 715 MW of renewables by 2026.  
“We are determined to continue our legacy of reliability while maintaining affordability and minimizing our environmental impact,” EPE President and Chief Executive Officer Kelly Tomblin said. 
The Milagro Solar+Storage project is projected to create about 200 jobs during the peak of its construction phase and will generate an estimated $7.9 million in tax revenue during the facility’s operating lifetime. The funds will support three local school districts and the Doña Ana flood control authority, which qualifies the project for the Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB). 
According to the Texas Governor’s Office, this federal program provides tax-exempt or taxable bond finance for projects that involve significant private activity promoting new and existing businesses or employment opportunities while expanding a community’s tax base.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/27/storm-readiness-shifting-from-generators-to-energy-storage-systems/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2023",Storm readiness: Shifting from generators to energy storage systems,"We are living in an era of extreme weather, and there is no end in sight. In July 2023 alone, there were devastating wildfires in Canada, severe thunderstorms that rocked the eastern United States, and extreme heat that made July 2023 the hottest on record. That led into August, which saw high winds down power lines causing the tragic Maui fires, while Southern California was hit by a 1-2 punch of Hurricane Hilary and an earthquake. All these events add pressure to an already taxed grid, leaving homeowners everywhere at an increased risk of power outages.
To offset this risk, many homeowners are making an investment in a backup energy source. Traditionally, fuel-powered generators are the common choice for backup energy, but the newer energy storage systems (ESS) are growing in popularity.
Energy storage systems, often referred to as ESS or battery backups, do just as the name says: store energy for use at a later time (i.e., when there is a power outage). They can be coupled with existing solar equipment or connected directly to the grid to build up energy storage. Then, energy is discharged when the grid is down, in the event of severe weather or other outages.
Energy storage systems require an up-front investment but deliver energy protection. Much like homeowners insurance, it is there if you need it. Depending on how many energy storage units are needed, ESS prices vary widely, but a good energy storage system is personalized to the homeowner’s specific needs. Much of the initial investment can be balanced through rebates and tax credits offered through state and federal incentives, such as the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Installation and use of an ESS is typically easier than generators and does not require difficult or time-consuming maintenance, labor and cost. Most ESS equipment can be mounted to either a wall or floor, usually in a garage or basement. Even if installed on an exterior wall, ESS can generally be controlled from a mobile app as well, meaning there is normally no requirement to go outside in potentially dangerous conditions to operate. In fact, many are safe for indoor use and typically UL certified for system safety.
Once an ESS is installed, it starts paying the homeowner back. Not only is “ESS insurance” real payback, most ESS can be switched to self-consumption mode instead of grid electric during peak usage/rate periods, often known as Time of Use. And some utility companies are working with homeowners to establish a virtual power plant, which is a system where an ESS owner shares battery-stored power back to a utility company during high peak periods, with a corresponding incentive payment.
In the event of a prolonged power outage, an ESS can accommodate energy needs, but the system must be designed and installed accordingly. This can be accomplished in three ways. First, ESS paired with solar panels will help prolong the impact of the ESS battery by recharging it on sunny days, even without grid power. Second, multiple ESS can be connected to extend the length of time an ESS can power a home. Finally, an ESS can be personalized to only back up certain must-have applications instead of every power need in the house. Many homeowners choose to back up refrigerators and air conditioners, televisions, lights, and essential outlets, but may opt to omit certain and larger loads in the interest of longer battery “run time.” There are load-management products that can pair with ESS, but these add cost and complexity to systems.
Generators
Fuel-powered generators are efficient and durable, which historically has made them a popular choice for homeowners in need of a backup power source. Small, portable generators can cost as little as a few hundred dollars and can power a handful of devices for a period of time, while a whole home generator system could cost thousands of dollars, not to mention required annual maintenance costs.
But fuel-powered generators carry with them a few concerns. The biggest concern is that generators emit carbon monoxide, which could prove deadly. After Hurricane Laura in 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health verified personal injury and deaths due to generator emissions. Generators should always be placed far away from a home, meaning accessing a generator during a weather event (or its immediate aftermath) could pose additional personal risk.
Although fuel-powered generators must operate outdoors to receive adequate ventilation, generators should not be exposed to wet conditions due to the risk of electric shock, making their use challenging for rain-soaked areas. Other hidden costs of generators include the ongoing cost of fuel to power the generator, properly rated extension cords, setup and installation, and routine maintenance to keep the generator running in peak condition.
If used correctly, generators can provide backup power in the event of an outage. Depending on the size and scope of the generator, it can provide power for a few days to a few weeks. However, homeowners have more choices these days for backup power, and a high-quality ESS is proving to be the best investment when considering all aspects of backup power generation.
In summary, energy storage systems are fast becoming the first choice for emergency backup power or self-consumption scenarios. The initial investment can be offset with appropriate rebates, incentives, and use cases. Every ESS can be personalized to meet specific homeowner needs. On the other hand, fuel-powered generators are a long-standing backup power operating paradigm, strapped with emissions concerns, ongoing maintenance labor and cost, and potential personal risk during or after a power outage.
No matter which backup power option a homeowner chooses, the ongoing electric grid challenges and the rise of extreme weather make it clear that backup energy sources are quickly transitioning from a luxury to a must-have. Will you be ready when your power goes out?
