https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/14/nanograf-raises-65-million-to-scale-u-s-production-of-battery-materials/,"BATTERY,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,ILLINOIS",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023",NanoGraf raises $65 Million to scale U.S. production of battery materials,"NanoGraf, an advanced battery materials company, announced that it has raised $65 million in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. NanoGraf had previously raised a total of $27 million in funding from a mix of venture, angel and non-dilutive funding sources.
In December NanoGraf announced plans to launch production of advanced silicon anode materials in Q4 2023 in a 17,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Chicago. The company expects phase one material production capacity of 35 tons per year, which is enough for 24 million battery cells, with plans to ramp production to 1000 tons of material production per year by 2024.
NanoGraf’s Series B funding supports its silicon anode production in Chicago, as well as the continued development, production and supply of advanced lithium-ion technologies.
In 2021 pv magazine reported that NanoGraf said it had achieved previously unattainable levels of energy density in an 18650 cylindrical lithium-ion cell. In 2022, NanoGraf reported that it had set a new industry benchmark for the most energy-dense lithium-ion 18650 battery, with more than 20% higher energy density than the industry’s leading cells today.
The energy density achievement was enabled by developing a proprietary silicon-oxide anode material that can be introduced into the same battery form factor at densities beyond what has been achieved previously, according to Kurt “Chip” Breitenkamp, vice president of Business Development.
“NanoGraf’s breakthrough silicon technology further exemplifies our commitment to extending the energy and power performance characteristics of today’s lithium-ion batteries for a sustainable electrified future. I’m incredibly proud of the technologies and products our team has developed over the last 36 months,” said Dr. Francis Wang, CEO of NanoGraf. “This funding not only ensures a domestic supply of a key strategic component of next generation lithium-ion batteries but also enhances our national competitiveness in the global energy storage space.”
NanoGraf is a spinout of Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory. This funding round was co-led by Volta Energy Technologies and CC Industries with participation from GIC, Emerald Technology Ventures, Material Impact, Arosa Capital, Nabtesco Technology Ventures, and TechNexus. Existing investors including Hyde Park Angels, Evergreen Climate Innovations, and Goose Capital also participated in the round.
In November of 2022, the company was awarded a $10 million contract from the U.S. Government to develop its manufacturing facility in Chicago.
“Nanograf’s technology promises to enable higher energy density in lithium-ion batteries, in a way that uses silicon with what is practically drop-in to existing battery manufacturing processes,” said Jeff Chamberlain, CEO of Volta Energy Technologies. “Volta is excited to add Nanograf to its growing portfolio of advanced technology that will be part of the important supply chain of advanced battery and related technology. We are equally enthused by the quality of the group of investors in this round of financing being announced today.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/14/the-ira-will-unleash-community-solar-markets/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023",The IRA will unleash community solar markets,"Community solar is popular. For residents and businesses, it’s accessible, equitable, and flexible. For developers, it’s a scalable way to deploy large distributed solar projects. For policymakers, it’s democratizing and revenue-generating. It’s no wonder most new community solar programs are immediately over capacity once they launch. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) should change that.
Most community solar programs are capped, meaning a limited number of megawatts are available. Regulators work to design these programs with a Goldilocks mindset, with just enough incentives to attract developers into an unknown market while trying to limit the monetary expense to maximize the number of projects built. In the early stages of a program, incentives are generous to compensate for the risk. The generosity pays off: Illinois attracted ten times the available capacity, and New Jersey’s program launch had 862 MW applications for just 78 MW of public programs.
Developers rely on incentives like renewable energy credits, generous bill credits, and/or rebates to make projects pencil. As programs mature, these incentives are revised to stretch a program budget further, but markets are still capped when the money runs out. In some cases, the caps are legislative—only a limited number of MW can participate each year. In other cases, like New York, the caps occur when a critical incentive runs out. But in any case, limited community solar markets frustrate nearly everyone: Developers and asset owners can be hesitant to invest in land campaigns with certainty that their project will be selected, residents and businesses have limited options for projects, and policymakers can’t achieve lofty goals for energy access.
Opportunity for change 
In the fall of 2021, shortly after the passage of the IRA, I moderated a panel of community solar experts at RE+. We were trying to answer the question, “Are Uncapped Community Solar Markets Possible?” Every person on stage was painfully aware of the gold rush effect that has become the hallmark of community solar markets. The developers agreed they might be willing to exchange less generous incentives for more capacity. The certainty and scale that larger, uncapped markets could offer are attractive compared to a lottery for a few lucrative projects.
My panelists were not arguing that community solar could or should exist without incentives and market signals, just that programs can better allocate funds to prioritize more projects.
Imagine an oversimplified version of a community solar project. There are three revenue streams from a project: subscriber payments, state/utility incentives like RECS, rebates, or fixed credit values, and federal tax incentives. The IRA supercharges the Federal Tax piece for strategically positioned projects with additional community benefits. If we imagine that a developer will receive a higher tax credit under the IRA, there are three outcomes from this bump (let’s assume the project needs to make $0.14/kWh to be viable):
1.    She could keep everything the same, generating a higher return on the project.
2.    She could pass on additional savings to the subscriber, keeping her returns equal to a pre-IRA project.
3.    The state could haircut its portion of the capital stack; the developer could keep the discount to the subscriber the same and achieve a similar IRR to a pre-IRA project.

Options one and two have clear advantages over today’s community solar market. If a developer keeps more returns, she may likely take more investment risk and enter markets earlier. Still, it could throw fire on an already hot market. In option two, residents and businesses see more meaningful savings and could be more eager to sign up, reducing the cost of acquiring subscribers. Still, the total number of projects is capped at today’s market size. Neither of these scenarios leads to more projects.
Option three could be the key to significantly expanding community solar markets: the developer keeps her return margin, the subscriber still sees savings, and the state/utility has more money. They spend the same amount on a program that serves more residents and businesses while subscribers still see meaningful savings on their utilities. More project availability also creates more certainty in the market for developers, thus making them more likely to invest in a specific market.
Complex equation for equity
The IRA has the potential to bring in more money for each project, leading to more community solar development opportunities. Still, community solar is more complex than three data points leading to a return on investment. If states are to revisit their incentive structures, it’s important to remember that the higher ITC values available under the IRA aren’t free.
Maxing out the ITC may require siting systems in energy communities, which could increase costs or decrease production. Additionally, projects with higher ITC are expected to service more low-to-moderate-income families and organizations. Without advances in utility bill crediting, outreach to LMI households can be more hands-on, driving up project costs.
The IRA was structured with the notion that more impactful projects are harder to implement and to reward them. Any change in state incentives will likely not be a 1-to-1 ratio between state and federal dollars. Regulators must work with the developer community to determine the actual cost of the calculation, and developers should be honest to create the most sustainable markets possible.
Additionally, some states may want to incentivize more savings for households and businesses over additional project deployment.  In this case, it’s still imperative that developers, asset owners, and regulators work together to define savings targets and ensure that projects have enough funding to sustain the market.
More projects is the answer 
Some have advocated for a smaller state or utility budget to support community solar programs. This is a mistake. Community solar provides measurable, tangible benefits to the grid and ratepayers. While some may argue about the exact value of these benefits, distributed solar, and community solar specifically, is an integral part of the grid: It democratizes access to clean energy, supports resiliency, and helps to achieve energy equity. While state and utility programs should evolve under the IRA, the goal should be to benefit more participants, fulfilling the promise of shared solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/14/solar-canopy-plus-saltwater-flow-battery-to-be-installed-on-california-irrigation-canals/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 14, 2023",Iron flow battery added to solar-on-canal project,"A California water irrigation district launched Project Nexus, which is installing a 4 MW solar canopy on an irrigation canal in California. Today ESS Inc., a saltwater energy storage system manufacturer, announced the delivery of an Energy Warehouse system to the Turlock Irrigation District in Central California. The energy storage company will deploy a few Energy Warehouse containers to pair with solar panels over irrigation canals.
Project Nexus, which is a consortium comprised of Turlock Irrigation District, Solar AquaGrid, the University of California Merced, and the California Department of Water Resources, intends to generate clean energy while conserving water resources in an increasingly arid California environment.
The Energy Warehouse was selected for its safe and non-toxic characteristics, making it ideal for siting adjacent to water infrastructure. Funding for the Turlock project is provided by the State of California and administered by the Department of Water Resources.
The solar-plus-storage project will shade canals with solar panels, a process that will reduce evaporative losses while generating clean energy.
ESS will be exhibiting at Intersolar North America this week (Feb. 14 to 16) in Long Beach, Calif. The company will be demonstrating its long duration systems at booth #1031.
Recent research by the University of California, Merced shows the potential for 13 GW of solar capacity to be installed over California canals, which could necessitate about 3 GW of energy storage systems and contribute to the state’s clean energy and water conservation goals.
“This project addresses multiple climate challenges at once and is the kind of innovative approach that will build a climate-resilient future,” said Hugh McDermott, senior vice president, business development and sales at ESS. “We look forward to delivering a solution that can be replicated across California and other drought-prone areas.”
Turlock’s initial solar-plus-storage project is set to be complete in 2024. ESS’ iron flow technology provides long-duration energy storage and is designed for applications that require up to 12 hours of flexible energy capacity. The company reports that its non-toxic flow battery has a 25-year design life without capacity fade.
Long-duration storage systems of more than four-hour discharge are increasingly deployed in states with high solar penetration. After California, additional utility offtakers include NV Energy in Nevada, Georgia Power, Orlando Utilities Commission and Minnesota’s Great River Energy, Julia Souder, executive director of the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, told pv magazine USA in a recent interview.
According to BloombergNEF estimates, the federal Inflation Reduction Act is expected to drive an additional 6.6 GW / 26.4 GWh of new energy storage capacity in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market through 2030, even though Texas is forecast to add a higher amount of storage systems, at 8.9 GW / 35.6 GWh of additional capacity.
Unlike typical lithium-ion batteries that are packaged as fixed cells  or modules, a flow battery such as the Energy Warehouse allows power to be decoupled from the capacity, allowing users the flexibility of using the battery for a variety of use cases simultaneously on a project.
The ESS warehouse container provides 400 kWh of peak energy in a module whose average life is more than 20,000 cycles. The container weighs 41.9 tons at wet weight and measures 40 feet by 8 feet, standing 9.5 feet high. The system uses recycled iron components and abundant saltwater, making its electrolyte system fully recyclable.
In August, ESS completed a microgrid system using the Energy Warehouse at an industrial recycling facility in West Grove, Penn. Developed by TerraSol Energies, a turnkey solar and storage developer, the system features the 75 kW / 300 kWh warehouse paired with a 115 kW DC solar array, creating a microgrid that reduces peak electricity demand and provides back-up power for Sycamore International, a recycling company.
Munich RE provides an industry-first ten-year insurance plan coverage for ESS battery storage systems regardless of project size or location.
Founded in 2011, Wilsonville, Ore.-based ESS has a $325 million market capitalization and will report its Q4 2022 and full year 2022 financial results on March 1, 2023 at 5:00pm EST. Interested parties can register for the call on the company’s investor relations website.
