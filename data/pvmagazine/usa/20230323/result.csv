https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/23/four-legislative-actions-for-an-equitable-energy-transition/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 23, 2023",Four legislative actions for an equitable energy transition,"Renewable energy, primarily solar, wind and energy storage, is expected to become the dominant source of electric generation by 2030. The low-case and high-case projections place clean energy’s share of electricity generation between 71% to 90%.
But this energy transition will not happen automatically, and political actions must be taken to ensure that the move towards renewable energy happens rapidly and equitably. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) shared his vision of a progressive energy transition in a presentation delivered at the Roosevelt Institute in New York.
The Senator’s plan aims to ensure that “any proposal centers justice and does not perpetuate more harms” to the “communities who have suffered and sacrificed the most for generations” as a result of environmental injustices.
Pass funding
Step one has been completed in Markey’s plan, as historic levels of funding have been passed through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These funds, among many other things, will help towards the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), often referred to as the “Magna Carta of environmental law.”
The Inflation Reduction Act included $60 billion in critical funding for environmental justice, including designating funds to NEPA implementation. These funds will allow agencies to thoroughly and effectively review proposed infrastructure projects, said Markey. He said that additional funding for state and Tribal permitting and historic preservation offices is needed as well.
Fix broken permits, interconnection, siting
Markey’s Connecting Hard-to-reach Areas with Renewably Generated Energy (CHARGE) Act would proactively plan and build a reliable and resilient energy grid across broad regions of the country, bridging the gap between the supply of renewable energy and the cities and towns that need access. The legislation would also implement a series of reforms through Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), requiring strong transmission planning reforms, establishing minimum levels of transfer capabilities between regions, supporting competition, and requiring effective oversight of transmission networks.
FERC currently has ongoing rulemakings to address the interconnection backlog, cost allocation, and regional planning.
“FERC can continue to do more to support grid-enhancing technologies that improve transmission without requiring more infrastructure to be built,” said Markey.
Congress should amend Federal Power Act Section 216 to designate FERC as the siting authority for transmission facilities with capacity ratings of 1 GW or greater and should direct FERC to allocate costs of transmission projects, said Markey.
Markey also notes that poor utility and wholesale market planning has led to a backlog of clean and distributed energy being trapped in interconnection queues.
“At the end of 2021, more than 1,400,000 MW of total generation and storage capacity was in the queue for connection to the grid—more than 90% of which was zero-carbon resources like solar, wind, and battery storage,” said Markey.
Markey pointed to his permit reform plan as a preferable path to the House Republican-backed H.R.1, a proposal that he said would “renege on commitments made to frontline environmental justice communities” and roll back “environmental protections for oil and gas projects, incentivizing dirty energy production on federal lands.”
Stakeholder engagement
The plan aims to support transparent and efficient deployment of clean energy by bringing frontline environmental justice communities to the table earlier in the process and establishing equity and justice requirements.
To achieve this, support for pre-development programs like the Local Infrastructure and Technical Assistance (LIFT) Act is recommended. The programs provide grants to communities to cover market assessments, community engagement, site acquisition, and permitting costs for projects ranging from rooftop solar to electrification.
He also supports legal frameworks and requirements for environmental justice and equity, like those in the Environmental Justice for All Act. The Act establishes environmental justice requirements, advisory bodies, and programs to address the disproportionate adverse health or environmental effects of federal laws or programs on communities of color, low-income communities, or tribal and indigenous communities.
Furthermore, an intervener funding program through the FERC’s Office of Public Participation to help members of the public cover expenses incurred in relation to their engagement in Commission proceedings. This program could ensure underrepresented communities are empowered to fully engage in FERC decisions.
The plan calls for development of tools to both speed project adoption while preventing communities from being cut out of the process. This includes creating a centralized database to track project timelines and approval processes and prioritizing permitting of clean energy and transit projects that are supported by environmental justice communities and reduce energy burden. It would also involve supporting an analogue to the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Committee (FPISC) that would focus on helping under-resourced communities shepherd projects through the permitting process.
Prioritize environmental justice
More legislation could support completion of projects that are both of significant national importance and a priority for environmental justice communities.
“For instance, legislation could designate 25 zero-emission energy generation projects as projects of strategic national importance, of which at least 50% would be for clean energy projects that support environmental justice communities,” said Markey.
Environmental justice liaisons in federal agencies and funding for interveners could also ensure that communities are brought in at the front of the process, he concluded.
“We must make sure that households everywhere can get clean, affordable energy that protects their health and the health of the climate,” said Senator Markey.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/23/qcells-announces-new-solar-encapsulant-facility-in-georgia/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 23, 2023",Qcells announces new solar encapsulant facility in Georgia,"Hanwha Qcells America announced that its solar supplier, Hanwha Advanced Materials Georgia (HAGA), will build a new advanced materials manufacturing facility in Bartow County, Georgia.
HAGA will supply Qcells with encapsulant film ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), which is the front “foil” on solar modules sandwiching the cells against the backsheet and front glass. There were shortages of EVA in 2022, and by supplying its own EVA foil, Qcells is ensured a steady supply of the necessary material. Qcells noted that HAGA will be the only company in the U.S. manufacturing solar EVA.
The investment of $147 million by HAGA is expected to create more than 160 full-time jobs, including engineers, line operators with the facility starting production in June 2024.  The facility is critical to supporting Qcells’ plans of developing a fully integrated U.S. solar supply chain. 
“The products we make are an important piece of the clean energy supply chain puzzle, and we are excited to meet this need,” said Inhwan Kim, chief executive officer, Hanwha Advanced Materials. “Building our cutting-edge, advanced materials in Georgia will not only create new careers in solar but help bring more affordable, reliable clean energy to customers across the country.”
The announcement comes two months after Qcells announced plans to invest a historic $2.5 billion to expand its operations to house a fully integrated solar supply chain manufacturing base in Georgia. In what is considered the largest investment in U.S. solar history, the Korean company, a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions, is the first company to establish a fully-integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the U.S.
Qcells also recently announced plans to buy polysilicon from REC Silicon, which is using clean energy to power its facility in Moses Lake, Washington. In its Q3 22 report, REC Silicon confirmed it will restart solar polysilicon production at Moses Lake in the U.S. state of Washington in Q3 23, following Hanwha’s decision to acquire a 16.67% stake in the Norwegian manufacturer in late 2021. REC Silicon reported that Moses Lake’s ramp up will see the facility at 50% capacity utilization by mid-2024, with full capacity production on track for Q4 24.
The investment by HAGA follows the passage of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act (SEMA) within the Inflation Reduction Act. Qcells also cites Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff’s SEMA Act, now part of the Inflation Reduction Act, as playing a key role in promoting additional investments in the U.S. The IRA offers numerous tax credits for clean energy manufacturing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/23/north-america-represents-21-of-global-energy-storage-market-by-2030/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,CANADA,CHINA,LATIN AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 23, 2023",North America represents 21% of global energy storage market by 2030,"Energy storage deployments reached a new high in 2022, with 16 GW/35 GWh of new capacity projects added, up 68% from 2021, according to a report by BloombergNEF. The energy storage market is growing at a strong 23% compound annual growth rate, with annual additions projected to reach 88GW/278GWh in 2030, or 5.3 times the expected 2022 level for new installations, according to BNEF’s 1H23 energy storage outlook.
Multiple markets announced energy storage targets totaling over 130 GW by 2030. BNEF is cautious about the impact of these targets on its total forecast demand due to the lack of policy clarity and reforms. Government entities across the world have also approved millions in subsidies for storage development. These subsidies boost deployment, but highlight the underlying challenge that batteries are not yet economically attractive in most parts of the world.
China is forecast to overtake the U.S. as the largest energy storage market in megawatt terms by 2030, according to BNEF. The research group at BNEF, which consists of 19 analysts, increased its China cumulative 2030 capacity forecast by 66% to account for new provincial energy storage targets, power market reforms and industry expectations supporting significant new capacity.
In contrast, project delays continue to stymy U.S. storage deployments, based on 7.2 GW/18.4 GWh of utility-scale storage projects that were delayed in 2022 due to rising battery costs and supply-chain disruption. Despite delays, utilities continue to procure more solar and storage to displace conventional thermal assets and meet system capacity needs, according to the report.
The Americas region represents 21% of annual energy storage capacity on a GW basis by 2030. The U.S. is by far the largest market within the region, led by a pipeline of large-scale projects in California, the Southwest and Texas, the report notes.

Despite project delays, a handful of long-duration storage projects have gained traction. Market reforms in Chile could pave the way for larger energy storage additions in Latin America’s nascent energy storage market. Rapidly increasing volumes of solar and wind across Chile and Brazil and underinvestment in the grid in Mexico could provide opportunities for storage, BNEF reports.
The Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region added 4.5 GW/7.1 GWh of new storage assets in 2022. Residential batteries led installations in the region, a trend that is expected to remain until 2025, as high retail electricity prices and government incentive programs in Europe support household deployments.
LFP expansion
High energy storage system costs have incentivized companies to accelerate the move toward lower-cost chemistries such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP). More Chinese battery makers are expanding LFP products overseas, BloombergNEF expects China’s share to continue growing globally until 2026 due to its lower cost, longer cycle life, and manufacturing scale.
After 2027, sodium-ion batteries may become more popular for energy storage system demand growth, the report said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/23/solar-wind-and-storage-awaiting-interconnection-up-28-to-1700-gw/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 23, 2023","1700 GW of solar, wind and storage await interconnection, up 28% in a year","“An unprecedented number” of interconnection requests last year from utility-scale renewables and storage projects “continue to prolong interconnection queue backlogs,” said a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) staff report.
Drawing on preliminary data compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the report says about 1730 GW of utility-scale solar, wind and storage projects are now active in the interconnection queues of transmission system operators. That’s almost 400 GW more than the approximately 1350 GW reported by Berkeley Lab at year-end 2021.
Solar, wind and storage projects in the interconnection queues make up nearly 94% of the total capacity in the queues, with solar constituting over half of that amount, the report said.
Total capacity in the queues exceeds 1,366 GW of generation, 325 GW of standalone storage, and 159 GW of hybrid storage and generation capacity. Those values including 84 GW of natural gas and 2 GW of coal capacity.
Berkeley Lab has estimated that 24% of the projects seeking interconnection from 2000 to 2020 have subsequently been built, the report said. The PJM grid operator, which serves a larger population than any other grid operator, has projected that 5% of the projects now in its interconnection queue will be built.
The FERC staff report said the costs to interconnect “have grown substantially over time with the cost of broader network upgrades driving nearly all this growth,” and provided the nearby graph from Berkeley Lab. Interconnection costs for solar, wind and storage are higher than for natural gas, the report added.

Interconnection queues are maintained by transmission system operators. In much of the U.S. the transmission operators are known as RTOs or ISOs, as shown on the nearby map from Sustainable FERC Project. In much of the West and the Southeastern U.S., the transmission operators are electric utilities.

To be interconnected to the transmission grid, a project entering an interconnection queue must wait for the transmission provider to complete a series of interconnection studies, as shown in the nearby image from Berkeley Lab, and then pay the interconnection cost as determined by the final study. The transmission operator then builds the interconnection infrastructure.

The FERC staff report credits transmission system operators as they “continue to look to possible solutions to address generator interconnection queue backlogs,” noting that several transmission operators have moved toward cluster studies that allow multiple projects to be studied simultaneously.
Summarizing FERC’s work on this issue, the staff report states that last June FERC proposed several reforms to the generator interconnection process to implement a first-ready, first-served cluster study process, increase the speed of interconnection queue processing, and incorporate technological advances into the interconnections process.
The FERC staff report is titled “2022 State of the Markets.”

Falling prices combined with rising utility rates has made solar a good investment, and homeowners have taken notice, according to a recent study released by Aurora Solar.
Aurora Solar, established in 2013, offers a cloud-based platform that uses lidar-based vision and machine learning algorithms to streamline the process of selling solar. The company recently reached the milestone of having designed 10 million solar sites.
According to Wood Mackenzie, Aurora is used by 80% of the top 75 installers in the U.S., with 10 million solar sites logged and over 7,000 customers creating more than 100,000 projects per week.
Beginning with its own customers, Aurora has seen impressive growth of nearly 40% year over year across the U.S., which corroborates data from the Solar Energy Industries Association’s Solar Market Insight Report that found 2022 to be a record year for solar with 6 GW (DC) installations, representing 40% over 2021.
With the solar market made up of both homeowners and solar professionals, Aurora looked at data from both groups. Partnering with Dynata, a first-data research company, they surveyed 1,000 homeowners about concerns, intentions and about solar installers. They then surveyed 898 solar professionals to learn what is driving their businesses, what they expect in the future, what they need to succeed and what trends they are seeing.
Some of the top solar trends driving the U.S. residential solar market in 2023 include heightened interest in going solar, expressed need for energy storage, and a surge in EV owners adopting solar.
The study breaks down the reasons behind these trends. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 brought an extension of the investment tax credit for solar through 2032, restoring it back to its original 30%. Aurora notes that this has eliminated uncertainty for potential solar adopters, and it has given homeowners time to consider solar and not feel pressured into making the investment immediately.
With energy prices are outpacing inflation, the cost of energy was also found to be a motivating factor. Of survey respondents, expect prices to continue to rise, and 48% are concerned about power outages due to weather events.
Homeowners respond
First off, the study found that one in 10 of homeowners surveyed had gone solar in the past year. Other data from homeowners:
Solar pros respond
Of the solar professionals surveyed, 70% noted a growth in business. Other notable data from solar pros:
Obstacles to adoption
With all the interest in going solar, the study found that there are still some myths around going solar, as well as legitimate concerns.
Myths
Legitimate concerns
The study found that half of the homeowners surveyed find it hard to know which contractors to trust. And contractor’s outreach practices were considered “spammy” by 27%. As a result, 38% feel more comfortable  working with a national-level contractor. 28% said they would only trust word-of-mouth recommendations.
Challenges for solar pros
Difficulty in finding workers was the reason given by 17% of solar pros as an obstacle to ramping up to meet the demand. Other challenges cited:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/23/creating-success-and-energy-justice-in-community-solar-markets/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,DELAWARE,LOUISIANA,MARYLAND,NEW JERSEY,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 23, 2023",Creating success and energy justice in community solar markets,"Energy justice and promoting the development of low-to-moderate (LMI) income solar projects were common community solar themes at the Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA) Finance, Tax and Buyers Seminar this week in New York.
During a panel titled, “How to Create Successful Community Solar and LMI Projects,” panelists from community and residential development companies said following statewide community solar programs set up Maryland and New Jersey recently, the community solar market should see additional programs set up in two or three more states this year.
Moderator Anna Balzer, solar community engagement coordinator of Boston Government Services, which supports the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), opened the session by saying the National Community Solar Partnership has set a target to enable community solar to provide $1 billion in monthly electricity bill savings over the next five years to subscribers.
Eric LaMora, executive director of community solar at Nautilus Solar, said community solar is enacted by state legislatures around the country to allow solar energy to close to 50% of U.S. households and small businesses that don’t physically have rooftops equipped for solar arrays.
By subscribing into community solar programs, developers and owners of such projects operate within a state utility’s framework in order to generate on average 10% to 20% savings to residents and business owners each month in the form of electric bill reductions, LaMora said, adding that community solar is now in 22 states.
Geoff Johnson, head of distributed generation for Cypress Creek Renewables, said low-to-middle income (LMI) community solar programs serve about 20% to 50% of that demographic bracket’s population, with NextEra Energy’s Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy being two utilities with noteworthy LMI community solar access programs in the southeast utilities’ territory.
Susannah Churchill, western policy director of Solar Landscape, a community solar developer based in New Jersey, one of the latest community solar states, said that in New Jersey the state utility framework requires 51% of projects be available to LMI residents for subscription.
LMI risks
Balzer was keen on pointing out that with any consumer subscription model comes non-payment risk among residents of the LMI bracket, which poses a risk to developers of community solar in new state markets.
“There is a distrust of community solar initially in LMI communities as many have been burned before by retail energy false promises,” said LaMora. “People are suspicious but there really are no hooks with community solar.”
LMI residents are leery to provide tax records or much documents at all in order to sign up for community solar, LaMora said.  “We were surprised to see less of a default rate with LMI residents. We attribute this to the fact that they see significant savings on their electric bill, making it easier to pay each month,” he said.
The three community solar developers agreed that Census Track Data and Self Attestation are the best tools to navigate where to deploy new LMI solar projects.
With few low-income bracket residents willing to provide tax records in a utility framework, developers site new projects based on statewide census track data, which shows counties and municipalities with higher LMI demographics over others.
Ben Healey, chief commercial officer of PosiGen, a residential solar installer to LMI residents, said similarities between his company and the community solar project developers to LMI groups are plenty. New Orleans-based PosiGen’s residential rooftop customers still show a delinquency rate of about 10% on payments across a group of 1,200 customers, while the company quickly turns power back on if payments are made after 90 days of non-payment, he said.
“New Orleans customers still pay monthly electric bills in cash, while the energy burden in the south is still felt from the gas utility side of the energy market,” Healey said.
Solar Landscape’s Churchill said self attestation is a method of identifying LMI community solar communities that involves interested subscribers in community programs just providing a signed disclosure with minimal proof of residence and that the household qualifies by a certain income standard to receive community solar discounted from its electric bill.
While the majority of low-income consumers having a low or no FICO credit score to serve as a payment metric, the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides the utility market a framework for community solar subscribers to self-attest to their income as a means to more equitable solar deployment, Balzer said.
As was before, LMI solar subscribers continue to receive one electric bill each month under a community solar program. With consolidated billing, the subscriber pays the utility and the utility remits payment to the developer, Churchill said. Cypress Creek’s Johnson said the consolidated billing system employed by a majority of the community solar market is the best method to keep LMI customers enrolled in community solar, as it provides a hands-free method of providing the savings of solar energy to low-income residents without additional paperwork or billing.
Challenges to adoption
Despite community solar providing social responsibility from an environmental, social and governance (ESG) mindset in the U.S. energy market, Nautilus Solar’s LaMora and Solar Landscape’s Churchill agreed that public utilities continue to be opponents to the widespread adoption of community solar.
“Utilities don’t want this,” LaMora exclaimed. “They’re forced into it.  What we need is to outline the rules utilities have to follow to support community solar expansion.”
Speaking to pv magazine USA on the sidelines of the SEIA Finance seminar, LaMora said other states around the Mid-Atlantic region are primed for community solar, pointing to Delaware as a state with favorable demographics, after advancements in neighboring states New Jersey and Maryland.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/23/sunnova-files-for-3-3-billion-department-of-energy-loan/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,SOFTWARE,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 23, 2023",Sunnova files for $3.3 billion Department of Energy loan,"Sunnova, a publicly traded energy-as-a-service and residential solar provider, is looking to advance its buildout of virtual power plants (VPP) through a $3.3 billion loan from the Department of Energy (DOE).
The company made an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining the purpose of the loan, which would be made available through DOE’s Loan Programs Office. If approved, the funding is expected to “expand access to the Company’s ‘Energy as a Service’ offerings, lay the foundation for future voluntary protection program activities, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and increase the demand response impact of residential power systems.”
Sunnova seeks an indirect guarantee of 90% of up to $3.3 billion of solar loans. But first, several steps remain for the project to achieve critical milestones, and certain conditions must be satisfied before the DOE issues such a partial loan guarantee, including finalization of a definitive loan guarantee agreement and financing documents. “There can be no assurances that the Company and DOE will consummate the contemplated transaction on these terms or at all.”
The head of the DOE Loan Programs Office, Jigar Shah, has shown a proclivity toward VPPs in the past. In a contributed article for pv magazine USA, he wrote:
“A VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances). VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.”
Shah’s office sees a lot of promise in VPPs lowering costs and helping U.S. ratepayers better shoulder energy burden. He shared that spending on energy comprises 3.1% of the average U.S. household’s income, but for low-income households, its 8.1%. What’s more, 40% of low-income households spend more than a tenth of their incomes on home energy.
“Lucky for us, the price of renewable energy is less volatile than fossil fuels over time thanks to zero-cost inputs; we do not pay for sunshine and wind,” said Shah. Even with rising costs, the average levelized cost of energy for renewable projects “has begun to compete aggressively” with new fossil fuel based technology projects “even putting tax credits aside,” he said.
Texas VPP 
Earlier this month, Sunnova announced a partnership with David Energy, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based retail energy provider, to deploy a VPP service called Adaptive Retail in Texas.
The VPP leverages Sunnova’s solar and battery storage systems, optimizing fleet interaction of energy assets connected to the electric grid. By aggregating customer resources, the company can provide a more reliable, flexible source of energy that can respond to changes in demand and market conditions.
“Our Adaptive Retail plan represents a significant departure from the traditional centralized power generation model, putting more control and flexibility in the hands of our customers,” said William (John) Berger, chief executive officer of Sunnova.
Sunnova’s fleet of batteries will respond in real time to David Energy’s electricity modeling software platform, dispatching the fleet in response to wholesale electricity market prices. The partnership will allow distributed energy resources to integrate the value of demand response and bid their capacity into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s (ERCOT) ancillary markets, tapping into new revenue streams that the company said will help boost customer savings.
“By combining a retail energy plan with software that connects to a broad range of devices many customers already have, David Energy’s platform can turn Texans’ homes into power plants. The potential to bring hundreds of megawatts of much needed flexible capacity to ERCOT via these VPPs in the near future is very real,” said James McGinniss, chief executive officer of David Energy.
ERCOT pilot
In September 2022, ERCOT approved a pilot project to test the efficacy of VPPs to support the grid. The pilot project, ERCOT says, will enable premises with any combination of generation, energy storage, or controllable load with the capability of 1 MW or less to participate in ERCOT’s wholesale markets.
The project will at first enroll up to 80 MW of aggregated resources. Each local aggregation must have the capability to provide at least 100 kW of response, through demand response capability and injection capability. These aggregations will be eligible to provide up to 40 MW of “non-spinning reserve service,” or capacity that can be started or interrupted within 30 minutes as needed.
ERCOT’s goals for the pilot project are to examine how aggregated DERs can support reliability, enhance the wholesale market, incentivize investment, potentially reduce transmission and distribution investments, and support better load management during emergencies.
Following the first one-year phase of the pilot project, ERCOT expects to design additional phases that could expand participation. ERCOT will also study, using data from the pilot project, how different dispatch and pricing schemes could improve its efforts in managing the state’s costly problem of transmission congestion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/23/meta-picks-utilities-based-on-solar-potential-at-data-centers/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 23, 2023",Meta picks utilities based on solar potential at data centers,"Meta, the social media giant behind Facebook and Instagram, is focused on renewable energy deployments, which are currently expanding at an impressive 30% compound annual growth rate. Urvi Parekh, director of renewable energy, discussed the company’s clean energy initiatives at the Solar Energy Industry Association’s Finance, Tax and Buyers Seminar held in New York.
At present, Meta stands as the largest commercial and industrial purchaser of solar power in the U.S., boasting close to 3.6 GW of installed solar capacity. Parekh also revealed that the company has over 9 GW of capacity awaiting development over the coming years.
One of Meta’s procurement strategies concerns the siting of new data centers. The company clarified that they do not necessarily own these data centers but they incorporate an “emissions first” rationale into their process, making inquiries with suppliers and aiming for local sourcing wherever feasible. When selecting a data center site, a key factor influencing the major electricity buyer’s decision is the ability to collaborate with the local utility.

Parekh highlighted the company’s success in partnering with utilities in the southeastern U.S., specifically recent collaborations with the Tennessee Valley Authority, Alabama Power and Walton EMC. As Meta selects data center locations, it communicates with utilities to ensure that cleaner electricity sources, namely solar, power the facilities.
In December, Meta announced 720 MW of solar power projects in development with Silicon Ranch, a Nashville-based developer backed by Shell New Energies, Manulife, TD Greystone Infrastructure and Mountain Group Partners.
The company has begun to approach utilities earlier in the development process, as they have historically struggled to purchase clean electricity sources in certain states. Parekh shared one of Meta’s key lessons: obtaining custom renewable energy tariffs from these groups is not an overnight process, often requiring up to 18 months to finalize details.
Image: Meta
Meta has set an ambitious net-zero goal for 2030 and is currently experiencing significant growth in clean energy. However, the company observed a slowdown in projects entering the queue since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Like others, Meta eagerly awaits guidance and clarification from the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department on IRA adders and tax incentives.
The company is considering involvement in two additional areas: energy storage and power transmission and distribution system upgrades. Meta’s relatively flat demand curves suggest that energy storage, which is predominantly in the peak demand and demand charge management phase of deployment, is not yet economically viable.
A utility in the western region and Alabama have expressed interest in exploring peak power shifting opportunities, Parekh said.
