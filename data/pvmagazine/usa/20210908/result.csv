Included in the letter are six policy actions that SEIA and the signess see as critical to raising solar’s share of the nation’s generation profile to 20% by 2030 and at least 40% by 2035:
“The science is clear: we must rapidly decarbonize the electric grid to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, and the ITC is the most effective policy we have to drive solar deployment in the United States,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper, who continued on to call the ITC a “proven job creator,” that will be necessary to to clean up the grid and create the millions of jobs necessary to build an equitable clean energy economy.

All of the listed guidelines represent the investment deemed necessary in order to quadruple expected annual capacity additions, a measure that will be needed to bring solar to the generation shares laid out above. With increased capacity comes a need for more solar workers to get these projects designed, developed and built, and SEIA shares that the size of the solar workforce must quadruple to more than 900,000 Americans by 2035.
Solar is currently a $25 billion industry that employs over 231,000 Americans. That figure is down roughly 6.7% from the number of Americans employed in solar in 2019, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The policy guidelines included in the letter echo the calls to action that SEIA has been making for the better part of the year. In a June webinar, SEIA advocated for an expansive, lengthy extension of the federal solar investment tax credit, the inclusion of a separate tax credit for energy storage systems, and the creation of a direct-pay system.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/08/new-york-city-ev-charging-effort-gets-a-boost-from-conedison/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,NEW YORK",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",New York City EV charging effort gets a boost from ConEdison,"Con Edison is chipping in $250,000 to pay for a portion of the planned installation of 100 fast electric vehicle chargers across New York City.
The chargers will primarily serve city-owned electric vehicles, but at least 10 chargers will be available for public use. ConEdison’s PowerReady program supports the project, which will deploy both level-2 chargers and DC fast chargers.
The funding will reimburse costs for 15 fast chargers at six locations in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. The funding is the first award out of a total $1.3 million that the city may receive from Con Edison to support 39 of the city’s 100 fast chargers. Ninety of these fast chargers have been placed in operation in the last year. 
ConEdison’s PowerReady Program will cover as much as 50% to 90% of the charger installation costs.
The New York Public Service Commission issued an order in July 2020 approving the EV PowerReady Program to help New York meet its emissions reduction targets by supporting increased adoption of electric vehicles through statewide deployment of more than 50,000 electric vehicle charging plugs by the end of 2025. In total, $290 million in funding is available under the program.
DC fast charging is up to seven times faster than a level-2 charger. The DC chargers are expected to service city vehicles, including emergency response vehicles and trucks.
New York City’s municipal vehicle fleet includes 2,350 active on-road electric vehicles, and 796 off-road electric and solar units. The city’s entire fleet is planned to be all-electric by 2040.
Currently, there are 1,061 electric vehicle charging ports available to the fleet. This includes level-2 chargers, DC fast chargers, a mobile charging unit, and 89 free-standing solar charging carports.

The two companies have experience serving as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors for solar customers at the residential, commercial, industrial, and utility scale.
iSun said the move positions it to target opportunities in the residential and small commercial sectors. The deal is expected to double the company’s projected revenue for 2021.
The transaction includes $24 million in cash and $15 million in stock, and provides $2.5 million directly to SunCommon employees. It also establishes a stock ownership plan for all iSun employees.
iSun said the alignment of software, shared services, and the two companies’ vendor base will unlock synergies with an expected savings of $1.25 million in the first year. 
iSun CEO Jeffrey Peck hailed SunCommon’s success in residential customer acquisition, citing its leadership in the sector with an acquisition cost of $0.36/watt. The combined organization generated net revenues of roughly $51.4 and $70.0 million in calendar years 2020 and 2019, respectively. SunCommon brings a positive EBITDA along with a strong customer acquisition platform, the companies said.
In addition to its solar EPC services, iSun provides energy storage solutions, and Level 2 electric vehicle charging stations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/08/solving-a-problem-thats-already-been-solved/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,EMPLOYMENT,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",New York community solar proposal “solving a problem that’s already been solved”,"At the beginning of September, alongside the launch of the villages of Brockport and Lima’s opt-out community solar programs, National Grid and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) filed a petition with state regulators that requests that National Grid and, eventually, all investor-owned utilities be granted authority to purchase and distribute a significant portion, if not all, of the state’s expected community solar resources.
Among a few other changes, the proposal looks to shift the program’s ownership model so that utilities own the community solar installations, rather than the communities served by the installation owning them. The proposal would place municipal leaders in direct competition with utilities, requiring them to file applications and justify to utilities the benefit of access to community solar. Municipal leaders would need to argue for their own low-to-moderate income residents, even when projects are located on their municipal land.
The proposal has caught the attention of residents and activists alike in New York, specifically drawing the ire of leadership at Joule Community Power, the community choice program developer. The company has argued that, not only does this partially devalue the community aspect of the program, but it could also restrict the ability for municipal leaders to dedicate savings from solar projects to their own residents and communities.
To better understand what National Grid and NYSERDA intend to accomplish with the proposal, pv magazine sat down with Jessica Stromback, CEO of Joule Assets Inc.
“In our view, the petition is looking to solve a problem that, in fact, the market has already solved…” said Stromback. “The main focus there is to make sure that low to moderate income residents receive access to solar, in a good way, and that, of course, everybody absolutely supports.”
NYSERDA has already incorporated adders into the program which enable solar developers to access and work with low- and middle-income customers. In addition, firms and companies have worked with municipalities to ensure that the programs reach all customers equitably.
For one reason or another, NYSERDA hasn’t been able to recognize these impacts, resulting in the filing of a petition to solve a problem that doesn’t exist.

The petition also looks to lower customer acquisition costs for the program, however this is another aspect that Stromback attests is a non-issue.
According to data provided by Joule, in National Grid’s service area, total project costs – excluding construction – as represented by customer acquisition plus annual maintenance plus credit payments to subscribers have been reduced by more than 35% over the last 18 months. Customer acquisition costs were 22% of the total cost. These have been reduced by 65%, and they now make up roughly 12% of total project costs.
Statewide, total project costs, determined by the same metrics as above, have been reduced by roughly 26%. Customer acquisition costs were 18% of the total cost. These have been reduced by 65%. They now make up  a shade under 9.5% of total project costs.
The same thing holds true when it comes to customer management costs, which have been cut in half in the last few months. Customer acquisition costs are coming down a bit more rapidly than customer maintenance costs, however Stromback expects that that maintenance costs will be cut in half again.
“They were looking at also solving the cost,” said Stromback. “But those costs have already gone down really significantly.”
According to Stromback, the negative effects created by the National Grid/NYSERDA proposal would be threefold:
The first point is actually similar to a phenomenon we’ve seen play out in Virginia, where residents have come out in droves to protest the construction of solar projects, not always community solar, because they feel that a corporation is encroaching on their community without their consent.
In New York, however, smaller developers have taken the time to connect with the communities that will foster and benefit from their projects, which has gone a long way in promoting goodwill toward future projects.
Another benefit that these smaller developers have brought with is a vibrant, competitive project market. Such a market forces developers to come up with optimal projects that serve their communities best. According to Stromback, without this competition, there’s no incentive to provide the best project for the best benefit.
“If you take that away, by making it much more centralized at market, you remove that impetus, you just take away that driving force,” she said.
Independent of the petition, auction times for projects have historically lagged, and changing their ownership will do little to remedy this issue.
So the auction process itself takes months,” explained Stromback. “And that’s after the contract is negotiated. So when you have a really powerful player coming in for what is looking like almost all of the accessible market for residential solar… you’re looking at just a black hole of time, when nothing’s getting built, nothing’s getting contracted. And no one else is able to contract either because it’s just a block in the market.”

The stagnation of the community solar market is bad from a perspective of market health, but it’s not just the market that will suffer. The proliferation of community solar projects in New York have become a critical pillar towards achieving the statewide goal of 70% renewable energy by 2030. With community solar demand going from highest in the nation to potentially nothing, it’ll become a lot harder to hit those goals.
The stagnation of the market will also hurt low- and middle-income New York residents, who not only gain access to what has historically been a financially restrictive form of energy, but are set to see electricity bills reduced by up to 10%.
Low- and middle-income people and families have always been the ones most affected by the adverse effects of unclean energy and the least able to access the benefits of clean energy. According to Stromback, stagnating the market will only serve to deepen this historic inequity.
The proposal has not gone unnoticed by groups and individuals, and Stromback shares that 274 comments were submitted to state regulators either outright rejecting the measure, or only supporting it with heavy redesigns and changes.
“Overall, there’s been a lot of concern in the market about the petition,” she said. “And I think what’s very compelling is that you have everyone from the Coalition for Community Solar cells to New Yorkers For Clean Power that are doing it. Then we had 28 municipalities that wrote in, and social justice groups, environmental groups that were writing in concern. So I think the concern has been really strong.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/08/solar-futures-study-offers-a-roadmap-for-solar-to-decarbonize-the-grid/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",Solar Futures Study offers a roadmap for solar to decarbonize the grid,"The U.S. Department of Energy released a study that examines solar’s role in decarbonizing the nation’s electric power grid.
The Solar Futures Study, led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, puts numbers behind the expected massive amount of solar necessary to decarbonize the grid. An advance copy of the report was provided to pv magazine.
The report examines what the U.S. needs to reach clean energy goals and how such a large amount of solar energy impacts the grid, the economy, the solar industry, the environment, and how solar might interact with other technologies such as storage, electric vehicles, buildings, industry.
The report said that by 2035 the U.S. would need to quadruple its yearly solar capacity additions and provide 40% of the electricity on the grid,  on the order of 1,000 GW. By 2050, solar energy could provide 1,600 GW on a zero-carbon grid, the study said. Decarbonizing the entire energy system could result in as much as 3,000 GW of solar by 2050 as  result of increased electrification in the transportation, buildings, and industrial sectors.

The report said that a 60% reduction in PV energy costs by 2030 could be achieved through improvements in photovoltaic efficiency, lifetime energy yield, and cost. It said that higher-temperature, higher-efficiency concentrating solar power technologies could deliver cost and performance improvements.
The report said that further advances also are needed in areas including energy storage, load flexibility, generation flexibility, and inverter-based resource capabilities for grid services. It said that solar technologies “may proliferate in novel configurations” associated with agriculture, water bodies, buildings, and other parts of the built environment.
The study said that electrification of fuel-based end uses could enable solar electricity to power about 30% of all building end uses and 14% of transportation end uses by 2050.

For buildings, rooftop solar were forecast to increase the value of batteries and investments in load automation systems. For transportation, rooftop solar could increase the value of electric vehicle adoption to consumers through a combination of low-marginal-cost electricity and managed charging.
It cautioned that the long- term role of solar electricity in industry is less certain. Even so, it said that industrial process heat from concentrating solar thermal plants can help decarbonize the sector.
The study said a clean grid requires “massive, equitable deployment” of diverse, sustainable energy sources. It said the U.S. must install an average of 30 GW of solar capacity each year between now and 2025 and 60 GW each year from 2025-2030. The study’s modeling showed that the remainder of a carbon-free grid largely supplied by wind (36%), nuclear (11%-13%), hydroelectric (5%-6%), and biopower/geothermal (1%).

The study said that solar will employ 500,000 to 1.5 million people across the country by 2035. And overall, the clean energy transition will generate around 3 million jobs across technologies.
It said that new tools that increase grid flexibility, like storage and advanced inverters, as well as transmission expansion, will help to move solar energy to all parts of the country. The report said that solar and wind combined are expected to provide 75% of electricity by 2035 and 90% by 2050.
The deployment of storage would enable more flexibility and resilience, growing from 30 GW to nearly 400 GW in 2035 and 1,700 GW in 2050. Tools like grid-forming inverters, forecasting, and microgrids also are expected to play a role in maintaining the reliability and performance a renewable-dominant grid, the report said.
Reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality were expected to result in savings of $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion, outweighing the additional costs incurred from transitioning to clean energy. The projected price of electricity for consumers was not expected to rise by 2035 as the costs are expected to be fully offset by savings from technological improvements.
The report said that without some combination of limits on carbon emissions and mechanisms to incentivize clean energy, the U.S. “cannot fully decarbonize the grid.” Its modeling showed that grid emissions could be expected to fall around 60% without policy.
