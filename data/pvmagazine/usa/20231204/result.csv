However, the level of influence is not even across income levels, as noted in the recent report  by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, “The role of peer influence in rooftop solar adoption inequity in the United States,” published in Science Direct.
Understanding peer influence in the solar buying decision is important as the solar industry strives to roll out solar to increasing numbers of households. As it is discovered that peer influence is not as strong among low- to middle-income (LMI) households, the solar industry may be better able to adjust its marketing focus and policy makers may consider changes to policies to increase LMI adoption.
As a data source, the researchers used records of over 800,000 U.S. rooftop solar installation records compiled by BuildZoom, an online platform connecting households with service contractors. They then used customer addresses to match the solar records to modeled household-level income estimates generated by Experian and eliminated tracts with daily adoption rates of >10% as extreme outliers or possible data errors.
They found that peer effects are stronger within income groups than across varying groups. But they also found that low-income households are less likely to adopt solar based on peer effects, likely due to the barriers of adoption.
The report identifies the greatest barrier to adoption for LMI households to be budget constraint. The reality is, according to the researchers, that while LMI households may be influenced by peers, they are less likely to adopt.
With solar adoption as a part of U.S. solar policy, for example, through the Justice40 initiative, the results of the report can provide a rationale for seeding programs. This would entail installing solar on LMI rooftops or in LMI areas, hoping that they prime area residents to adopt solar. The researchers suggest that the results provide a further rationale to pair such policies with incentives or access to low-cost financing in order to remove the budget constraint barrier, thus making solar more accessible to all.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/04/california-added-insult-to-injury-latest-anti-solar-ruling/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",California “added insult to injury” latest anti-solar ruling,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has made another anti-rooftop solar decision, ruling that solar-plus-storage customers cannot export electricity to the grid in exchange for an offset of their utility delivery charges.
Under current billing structures, rooftop solar owners are encouraged to attach batteries so that they can export electricity during times of high demand on the grid. This dispatch of electricity helps reduce the amount of inefficient natural gas “peaker” plants in operation on the grid and smooths supply and demand, leading to stable pricing across the grid. Now, under the new ruling, “delivery” and “generation” charges on utility bills are classified separately, and customers are not allowed to use solar-battery exports to offset “delivery” charges set by the utility.
“While the solar and storage industry adapts to an abrupt shift to net billing, the CPUC has added insult to injury with a series of damaging decisions that completely change the environment for rooftop solar in California,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
California’s once-flourishing rooftop solar market is now reeling from a year of rulemaking decisions by CPUC, which has shown a proclivity to support the interests of its major investor-owned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric.
Last December, the CPUC transitioned to a net billing format for single-family rooftop solar customers, pushing the state into NEM 3.0. Checks of utility interconnection queues show that requests for new solar array connections have fallen by about 80% since the transition to net billing was made. Nearly 20,000 solar workers have been laid off following the decision.

In another anti-solar move, this past November the Commission moved to make cuts to the value of rooftop solar export compensation for multi-metered accounts like apartment buildings, schools, and farms.
The justification for these cuts was to help restore balance to the imbalanced supply and demand caused by intermittent generation. The net metering rate cuts were promised by CPUC to incentivize more battery energy storage adoption alongside solar, making beneficial upgrades to an increasingly renewables-dominated grid.
However, this recent third ruling that negates part of the value of solar-plus-storage systems flies in the face of CPUC’s purported goals for supported more distributed storage on the grid. Analysts estimate that the ruling will shave another 10% to 15% off the savings provided by a solar-plus-storage system, thereby extending the average return on investment from about four to seven year to nine years or more.
SEIA estimates the residential solar market will decline by 40% next year, and the state’s commercial rooftop sector is expected to decline by 25% from 2024 to 2025 as a result of recent rulings.
“The solar and storage industry is calling on state leaders and the CPUC to change course before they cause more damage to America’s leading clean energy market,” said Ross Hopper.
Unfortunately for Californians, more damage may be on the way. The state’s major investor-owned utilities have pushed forward proposals to assess fixed monthly charges on all ratepayers, whether or not they are pulling any electricity from the grid. The new income-based fixed charges would average $50 to $70 per month and are expected to have an outsized negative impact on Californians that currently pay small electric bills.

The company had reported a Q3 adjusted loss of 55 cents per share, which missed earnings estimates of 68 cents, and in the hours following the report, its stock price immediately fell 10% to 20%.
While its stock price has risen in recent weeks, the S&P Dow Jones Indices will move SolarEdge (NASD: SEDG) from the S&P 500 to the S&P SmallCap 600 prior to the open of trading on December 18. pv magazine USA reached out to SolarEdge for comment, but has not received a response as of press time.
SolarEdge, based in Israel, is a provider of string inverters, power optimizers, and energy storage. For Q3 2023, the company posted revenues of $725 million, $676 million of which is from its solar segment. However, looking ahead to Q4, SolarEdge provided guidance of $325 million in revenues.
“The results for the third quarter fell short of our prior expectations and are reflecting a slow market environment, which has resulted in high inventory of our products in the distribution channels, in particular in Europe,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer, SolarEdge.
The slow market environment is the result of recent macroeconomic and regulatory forces that are squeezing the residential solar industry. High interest rates and the reduction of net energy metering credit values are causing sharp declines in demand for SolarEdge and its peers.
Its major competitor, Enphase, posted significantly depressed revenue estimates for Q4. And the entry of Tesla into the string inverter market may be causing further downward pressure on the company. SolarEdge shares are up about 2% today at time of publish.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/04/depcom-power-begins-construction-of-puerto-ricos-largest-hybrid-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,PUERTO RICO",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",DEPCOM Power is constructing Puerto Rico’s largest hybrid solar project,"DEPCOM Power, a solar engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and operations and maintenance (O&M) provider, held an inauguration event for the construction on Ciro One, the largest solar-plus-storage project in Puerto Rico.
The project, inaugurated on November 1 in Salinas, Puerto Rico, is expected to begin operations at the end of 2024. DEPCOM developed, procured, and is managing the installation of the 90 MW solar project. It includes a 51.5 MW on-site battery energy storage system (BESS).
Ciro One is expected to generate enough energy to power the equivalent of 60,000 Puerto Rico homes.
The project is developed alongside developer partner Ciro Energy Group and subcontractor Lord Construction Inc. Over 370 direct jobs were made in the development of the project.
The BESS uses a lithium-titanate oxide battery, delivering higher cycling power and lower degradation rates than more commonly used lithium iron phosphate technology. The system is covered by warranty for 25 years.
The PV system is designed to withstand hurricane force winds, featuring a lower panel tilt angle and east/west row orientation. The inverters include salt fog filters to mitigate the effect of ocean salinity on the island system’s power electronics.
Due to land area limitations on the island, co-locating agricultural practices with utility-scale solar facilities is being explored in the project. Vegetation at one of the arrays in Ciro One will be managed by grazing sheep. This has a co-benefit of feeding sheep while keeping vegetation away from the array.
“This project will strengthen our island’s energy network at a scale that gets us closer to meeting our renewable goals,” says Ciro Energy Group President Mario Tomasini. “At the same time, we are maximizing the site’s potential through a multi-use approach, integrating vital agriculture with solar power generation.”
Puerto Rico has a mandate to generate 100% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2050.
Six U.S. national laboratories have described in a report how Puerto Rico could reach 40% renewable electricity by 2025, as mandated by Puerto Rico’s Act 17.
The U.S. territory could reach 36% renewables by 2025 if 3.75 GW of utility-scale solar and 1.5 GW of storage that Puerto Rico has mandated the utility PREPA to procure were constructed and interconnected by year-end 2025, which would be “very rapid deployment,” the national laboratories said in a report.

The hot brine in a vast underground reserve under the Salton Sea in California probably contains enough lithium to build 375 million batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), according to “Characterizing the Geothermal Lithium Resource at the Salton Sea,” a new report by the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The researchers attempted to thoroughly quantify the amount of lithium that the deep subsurface geothermal reservoir of the lake could contain.
Researchers estimate 18 million metric tons of lithium in the Salton Sea’s geothermal reservoir, with at least 4 million tons already confirmed through drilling. The challenge now lies in discovering how to extract lithium from this geothermal brine on a commercial scale. Separating lithium from geothermal brine is considered a less invasive procedure than the blasting and other hard rock mining done in countries such as Australia, or the huge open-air evaporation pools in the salt flats of Latin America.
The study also notes the advantage that this type of lithium extraction is accompanied by the production of geothermal energy, which combines the production of renewable energy with the generation of materials to promote the development of electric vehicles.
“This is one of the largest lithium brine deposits in the world,” said Michael McKibben, a geochemistry professor at the University of California, Riverside, and one of the report’s 22 authors. “This could make the United States completely self-sufficient in lithium and stop importing it through China.”
The Salton Sea Geothermal Resource Area currently has approximately 400 MW of geothermal generation capacity installed, and is estimated to have the potential for up to 2,950 MW. It is estimated that the currently proposed geothermal energy and lithium recovery operations would require around 3% of the historically available water in the region.
The land beneath the Salton Sea is owned by three entities: the federal government, the Imperial Irrigation District of California and the Cahuilla Indians of the Torres Martínez Desert.
In January 2023, electric vehicle battery maker Statevolt acquired 135 acres in Imperial Valley, California, near the Salton Sea, where it plans to build a 54 GWh lithium-ion battery gigafactory, capable of producing enough batteries to power 650,000 electric vehicles per year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/04/tesla-cybertruck-can-power-your-home-and-more/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",Tesla Cybertruck can power your home and more,"In a first for the nation’s leading EV manufacturer, Tesla’s newly released Cybertruck features vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) capabilities, branded as Powershare.
Although Tesla’s website does not specifically state that the vehicle includes vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, it connects to the home using either a Powerwall or the Tesla Gateway. In turn, the Powerwall offers V2G capabilities and virtual power plant participation via the Gateway.
Powershare offers two sets of specifications: one for powering a home and another for supplying power to five individual outlets.

The home backup specifications feature an 11.5 kW max continuous power output at 240 volts, aligning with the company’s upcoming Powerwall 3 and solar inverter, introduced at RE+ in September.
Some additional hardware is required to utilize the V2H feature. The Universal Wall Connector, likely on many Cybertruck buyers’ wish lists already, is priced at $595. Additionally, the Tesla Gateway, essential for integrating standard Powerwall or solar installations, costs $1,800. Tesla also recommends the optional Backup Switch, known for streamlining the installation and potentially reducing overall costs. However, the price of this switch varies with different installation requirements and is not uniformly listed.
Tesla indicates that existing Powerwall owners won’t need extra hardware to enable the V2H feature.

The vehicle is equipped with five outlets: four standard 120V wall plugs – two in the cabin and two in the cargo bed – and a high-voltage 240V plug, capable of charging another Tesla, as depicted in the featured image.
In total, these five outlets offer 9.6 kW of power.
Tesla asserts that the vehicle can supply a minimum of 30 kWh to a home over a 24-hour period, matching the average daily energy usage of an American household.
The Cybertruck will also offer an optional removable range-extending battery box, designed to be installed in the truck’s bed, adding approximately 120 to 130 miles of additional range. Reflecting figures from Car and Driver, and other sources, we estimate Cybertruck’s efficiency to be between 2.33 and 2.5 miles per kWh. This efficiency estimate suggests that the capacity of the range extender is likely between 48 to 56 kWh.
While the official price for this accessory has yet to be announced, a Twitter user’s exploration of Tesla’s website code suggests the hardware might be priced at $16,000.
For comparison, the Tesla Powerwall, which provides 13.5 kWh of storage capacity, is priced at $8,401.
