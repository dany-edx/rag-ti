Despite CEO Mark Widmar warning “extended transit times for ocean freight impacted our third-quarter results,” and net sales for the three-month period falling $46 million from Q2, to $584 million, the solar manufacturer said it now expects to have a year-end net cash balance of $1.45-1.55 billion, a range $100 million higher than previously forecast.
That may be, in part, due to a lower-than-expected 2021 capital expenditure figure which has come in from $825-875 million to $675-725 million, with First Solar reporting, in Thursday’s financial update, it began building its third factory in Ohio in the last quarter, and also started ordering equipment for its first Indian fab.
First Solar said it produced 2 GWdc of modules last quarter and pointed out the $51 million operating-income figure posted in Q3 was battered by $66 million worth of depreciation charges, $9 million related to the aforementioned production start-up costs, and another $6 million for shares compensation awards.
The other full-year forecasts made by the company remained unchanged and include an expected annual ‘gross margin’ – net sales minus the cost of producing the goods but without selling expenses, tax etc taken into account – of $695-760 million. First Solar expects full-year net sales worth $2.88-3.1 billion on the back of an anticipated 7.6-8 GW of products shipped, as previously announced.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/09/sunpower-to-decide-fate-of-commercial-industrial-solar-business-this-year/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",MAX HALL,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",SunPower to decide fate of commercial-industrial solar business this year,"The latest quarterly figures published by U.S. solar and energy storage installer SunPower appear to indicate the days are numbered for its commercial and industrial (C&I) business unit.
Having last month announced it would consider divesting the commercial operation, the Californian business last week revealed C&I projects had contributed an $8 million hit to its third-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) figure of $17.5 million. Without that red result from its C&I customers – caused, in part by supply chain problems – the earnings number would have bested the $22.2 million posted in the previous three-month window.
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed this afternoon at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues from 4 p.m. (CET). For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
Although chief financial officer Manavendra Sial insisted in Wednesday’s update the “commercial and industrial solutions (CIS) business also had strong bookings for the third quarter,” the financial update added: “The company is considering strategic options for CIS and will provide an update in the fourth quarter.”
The uncertainty over the future of the business unit was deepened by the fact SunPower – which is controlled by French giant TotalEnergies – stripped out its CIS numbers – plus its already-confirmed legacy businesses – in the section of the update devoted to its expectations for the current quarter and full year.
That is probably because the inclusion of the commercial and industrial segment has prompted SunPower to revise down its full-year expectations for revenue, from the previous $1.41-1.49 billion, and for EBITDA, from $110-130 million. Curiously, the press release issued to announce the Q3 update did not appear to specify what those outlook numbers have been pulled back to.
SunPower posted a quarterly net loss of $84.4 million – down from net income of $75.2 million in the previous window – with the reverse “primarily driven by” a negative adjustment to the value of the stake SunPower holds in microinverter and storage business Enphase Energy, which would appear to have knocked that income-loss number by $86 million, according to the section of the update concerned with more friendly, non-generally accepted accounting principles.
The installer was rather more keen to stress its rising number of residential customers, with 108 MW of such systems recognized in the last quarter, to take the business to a total 390,000 household customers, not including the extra 20,000 acquired when SunPower paid “up to $165 million” for rival Blue Raven Solar last month, to open up new custom in the Northwestern and Mid-Atlantic markets of the U.S.
SunPower said it expects to recognize 345-375 MW of residential solar systems this year, with 55,000-60,000 new customers added. The business also said it is on track to hit $100 million worth of storage systems, and revealed it had secured a grant of $6.65 million from the U.S. Department of Energy last quarter, for its role in the ‘connected communities’ project which will assess the merits of community versus individual-household storage systems in two locations.

Here, pv magazine takes a look at the six New England states, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, and the current incentives they offer:
Net metering: Homeowners’ excess solar generation can be fed back to the grid in exchange for credits on utility bills. Rhode Island’s Renewable Energy Growth plan guarantees enrolled customers will receive $0.2965 per kWh exported for 15 years.
Property tax exemption: Customer-owned solar panels may raise the value of the home, but they do not increase property taxes.
Sales tax exemption: Solar is exempt from Rhode Island’s 7% sales tax rate.
CommerceRI Renewable Energy Fund grant: This is a capacity-based payment of $0.85 per watt, with a maximum of $7,000. Average systems generally pay about $4,000-$5,000.
Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) Program: A declining-block incentive program with 3.2 GW cap for total projects receiving incentives. As more projects apply for the incentive, it moves through tiers of declining values. Customers receive significant incentive rate adders for including energy storage or agreeing to participate in peak-demand load shifting programs. Eligible for customers of National Grid, Eversource, and Unitil only.

Residential Energy Credit: A credit worth up to 15% of the solar array, capped at $1,000.
Sales and property tax exemptions: Customers do not pay the Massachusetts 6.25% sales tax, and do not pay property tax for the increase of home value solar creates.
Net metering: customers of National Grid, Eversource, Unitil are eligible for net metering. Customers can use excess generation to offset utility bills, or they can transfer credits to another participating account within the ISO-NE electrical grid.
Residential Solar Investment Rebate Program: Connecticut Green Bank offers $0.463 per watt of solar installed. Homeowners often receive more than $2,000 in savings through this program.
Energy Conservation Loan Program: Low-to-no interest loans can be taken from the Connecticut state government. Rates land between 0-6% for up to $25,000 and 10 years.
Net metering: Customers are eligible to send excess solar generation to the grid for credit on utility bills. All projects under 2 MW can qualify for net metering.
Sales and property tax exemptions: Homeowners avoid the 6.35% sales tax, and do not pay property taxes for solar.
Net metering: Customers of Eversource, Liberty Utilities, New Hampshire Electric Cooperative and Unitil are eligible to export excess solar generation in exchange for utility bill credits.

Property tax exemption: New Hampshire residents, in select counties, avoid increased property taxes due to solar. NH does not have sales tax.
Renewable Energy Generation Incentive Program: Projects 10 kW or less can receive credit worth either $0.20 per watt, up to $1,000, or half the cost of their residential solar system.
Property and sales tax exemptions: Vermont homeowners do not pay sales tax or property tax for solar.
Net metering: Major utility Green Mountain Power offers $0.1484 per kWh for exported solar energy, less than 100% of the retail price of power in their territory. There is an upfront cost of $110 to add a net meter, and all credits must be used within 12 months.
Green Mountain Power Bring Your Own Device: Customers can receive up to $10,500 towards the purchase of a home battery attached to their solar array.
Net metering: Maine offers a 1-t0-1 for kWh exported for net metering use. At the end of each calendar year, net metering credits are reset.
PACE loan: Property Assessed Clean energy loans allow for no money down, and rather than making monthly loan payments, customers repay with an annual assessment on property taxes. In Maine, customers can receive PACE loans for up to $15,000 for 15 years at a 4.99% interest rate.

We spoke with experts and industry leaders, policy makers and innovators about the present and future of the solar industry. We learned about solar infrastructure resiliency in an age of extremes, and what needs to be done to accelerate deployment in the U.S. and worldwide.
Thank you to all who attended, including all viewers, panelists, and speakers. Thank you to our sponsors to the event. We look forward to seeing you next year, and at our international Roundtables events!
Speakers:
Chris Gordon, manager, project development, EDF Renewables North America
Karl Rábago, principal, Rábago Energy, LLC
Marlene Motyka, US and global renewable energy leader, Deloitte
Massoud Amin, professor, department of electrical and computer engineering, University of Minnesota
 
Motyka: Nations are currently operating with over 50% renewable penetration with no reliability issues.
Gordon: Distribution scale is where the industry is headed. Generation should be sited near load centers. This poses a high land-cost issue as well as NIMBY concerns. Local zoning laws are beginning to challenge development.
Rábago: The path forward to the best value capture is the inclusion of both distributed AND utility-scale.
Ann Marie Augustus – co-founder, VP of operations, Urban Electric Power:
UEP reworks chemistry found in alkaline batteries (double AA) and makes it rechargable.
Zinc and manganese used in the batteries are much more abundant than lithium, offering a low-cost alternative.
The tech is safer, no issues of thermal runway.
George Schulz, VP, Clean Energy at Ariel Re:
New technologies present challenges for insurance underwriting.
Data is king when creating impactful insurance. There is a lack of data transparency in existing and emerging technologies.
Vartan Oskanian, advisor to the CEO, Recom, and Hamlet Tunyan, CEO Recom present: Heterojunction modules: technology, supply chains, and innovation.
Tunyan: Recom is still considering a heterojunction gigafactory in the U.S.
Recom modules whitepapers provide extra levels of transparency showing where its supply chain originates. It also traces the total carbon emission output in its module creation, which it said is lower than industry averages.
Heterojunction combines silicon and thin-film technologies.
Parr:
A large amount of manufacturing (70-90%) is located in China.
Chinese solar has nearly double the carbon emissions of the rest of the world.
If manufacturing continues solely in China, within 20 years carbon emissions could double the global emissions of the aluminum industry.
A geographically diverse manufacturing supply chain is needed.
Ossoff and Demings bills create a web of policies that will expand manufacturing in the U.S.
Market demand will be the strongest force for reducing carbon. Buyers must actively select low-carbon module sourcing, which will spur manufacturing in low-carbon regions.

Leta: One of the best ways we can address the soft costs of permitting is through automated permitting. This is widely available from DOE-backed SolarAPP+
Sanderson: 30% of the solar workforce are women, 8% are Black. The industry needs to address these diversity shortcomings.
 
Nielsen:
Decarbonization plus electrification could save $1.7 trillion in net savings through 2050.
About 0.5% of total land area of the entire U.S. is estimated to be needed to decarbonize the grid. (1/80th the land used for agriculture.)
Securing the domestic supply chain is a chief concern of the DOE.
Long-term policy efforts are being considered, but the low cost of energy and market forces are driving the bulk of solar growth.
DOE’s deputy director Garrett Nielsen will present a keynote discussion on solar futures.
He will be followed by a panel discussion “Lead, follow, or get out of the way: What solar needs to expand”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/09/new-jersey-passes-solar-ready-warehouse-bill/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW JERSEY",TIM SYLVIA,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",New Jersey solar-ready warehouse bill is now law,"New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law bill A3352, which requires all new warehouses in the state to be built as solar-ready buildings.
When first passed by the state legislature earlier this year, the bill defined a warehouse as any building 10,000 square feet or larger and that primarily is used to store goods for resale. That definition has since been changed to 100,000 square feet or more.
Now, new warehouses built on or after July 1, 2022 will need to be optimized for solar. If the structure is intended to use hot water, then it also must allow for the installation of a solar water heating system.
In practice, each warehouse must reserve a section of a roof or building overhang for the future installation of a photovoltaic or solar thermal system which is at less 40% of the roof area.
Upon A3352’s initial passage, Scott Elias, senior manager of state affairs for the Mid-Atlantic at the Solar Energy Industries Association said the bill was another opportunity for New Jersey to make progress on its goal to reach 17 GW of solar by 2035.
Warehouse sprawl has been an ongoing issue in the Garden State. A survey conducted by Newmark, a commercial real estate advisory firm, found the aggregate area of leased warehouse space in the northern and central parts of the state grew by 11.1 million square feet in the first quarter of 2021. Alongside this, South Jersey has become a hotspot for construction.
Efforts are also being made to ensure that new warehouses in New Jersey are not developed on environmentally sensitive areas such as sensitive farmland and near residential areas, due to concerns over stormwater runoff, traffic congestion, and increased pollution.
In an op-ed for local press, Megan Steele, the communications coordinator for the Sierra Club New Jersey Chapter, proposed that the legislation could be used to expand community solar programs for low- and moderate-income families by opening up warehouse projects to these customers.
Now that it is law, A3352 is set to take effect immediately.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/09/black-veatch-is-hired-for-hawaii-solar-plus-pumped-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,HAWAII",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",Black & Veatch is hired for Hawaii solar-plus-pumped storage project,"Black & Veatch won a contract from AES Clean Energy to serve as owner’s engineer for the pumped storage and hydropower portion of the West Kaua‘i Energy Project, which will serve more than 70,000 residents on the Hawaiian island.
The West Kaua‘i Energy Project (WKEP) is an integrated renewable energy and irrigation project that includes energy production with pumped storage hydropower, conventional hydropower, solar photovoltaic generation and battery energy storage. WKEP is part of the state’s decarbonization plans as it is intended to move Kaua‘i to more than 80% renewable generation and meet up to 25% of the island’s energy needs.
When operational, the solar array will contribute up to 35 MW to the grid and store up to 240 MWh for dispatch during evening peak demand. The hydro resources are expected to produce 24 MW on average daily, which includes 12 hours of storage for overnight use.
Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative has completed two solar-plus-storage renewable projects in partnership with AES: a 20 MW facility in Lāwa‘i and a 14 MW facility at the Pacific Missile Range Facility. AES has more than 200 MW of solar, solar + storage, and wind resources in operation or under development across Hawaii.
The latest storage project will pump water from the lower Mānā Reservoir to the upper Pu‘u ‘Ōpae Reservoir using energy production from the solar PV portion of the project. During the evening peak, nighttime, and morning peak hours (as well as during periods of rainy or cloudy weather), water will be sent back to the lower reservoir via gravity penstock from Pu‘u ‘Ōpae, through the Mānā Powerhouse and its 20 MW Pelton turbine to generate power for the grid.
Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative signed agreements with AES to develop, build, and operate the cooperative’s solar pumped storage hydro project and a power purchase agreement (PPA) was filed with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission in late 2020.
As owner’s engineer, Black & Veatch will help AES develop technical design criteria for hydro power and hydraulic structures of the project, providing design and constructability reviews, reviewing technical and procurement specifications, performing factory inspections, and witnessing acceptance testing as well as providing construction and commissioning support and closing out the project.
In the pumped storage plant, the pumps and turbine generator are separate and designed to store enough energy in the Pu‘u ‘Ōpae Reservoir to allow the Mānā Powerhouse to run for 12 hours during the peak demand hours.
Pu‘u ‘Ōpae Reservoir is the middle reservoir in a series of three. Pu‘u Lua Reservoir is used to store water as a buffer to provide a steady supply of water for the system and offers recreational fishing access for residents. Water is also delivered to the Pu‘u ‘Ōpae Reservoir through a 4 MW Pelton turbine from the Pu‘u Moe divide diversion structure between Pu‘u Lua and Pu‘u ‘Ōpae.
