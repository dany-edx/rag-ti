Maybe not the typical find at your favorite junk yard. But Encore Renewable Energy and the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority (VPPSA) just commissioned a 2.1 MW community solar project sited on top of a former auto salvage yard.
The project is estimated to produce 3.2 million kWh a year, enough to power about 325 homes annually. The array is part of a larger 10 MW development planned between the two on behalf of VPPSA’s municipal utility members.
All generation from the Salvage Yard solar project will be sold to Vermont electric utilities that are not already 100% renewably-powered. Under the public-private partnership, Encore performs design, development, financing, and construction, while VPPSA manages the electric generation and maximizes value for its member utilities’ communities.

The salvage yard landowners will remain on the land that has been in their family for generations. The solar system offers both an annual lease payment and the means to complete required environmental remediation work. 
The ground beneath the solar array is planted with pollinator-friendly ground cover, which the project sponsors said supports local biodiversity, reduces storm water runoff, and improves soil quality.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/10/solar-in-uncommon-spaces/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,BELGIUM,SINGAPORE,UNITED STATES,UTAH,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2021",Solar in uncommon spaces,"Solar is at the forefront of climate mitigation efforts, but comes with some environmental baggage of its own.
One concern is the amount of land needed for the energy revolution, especially as more utility-scale solar projects are brought forward.
For example, in July developers of a proposed 850 MW solar plant in the desert north of Las Vegas pulled their application with the Bureau of Land Management in the wake of local opposition. Residents argued that the array, proposed to cover more than 14 square miles, would be an eyesore and could hurt area recreational activities.
A study by Clemson University estimated that energy production for domestic use and export will rise by 27% by 2040. Roughly 124,000 square miles of land will be needed to site all of the related facilities. With spacing requirements included, nearly 500,000 square miles of land will need to be dedicated to new energy production, an area larger than Texas.
To be sure, the built environment (rooftops, carports, and the like) are common places for solar installations. The benefits of these distributed sites are numerous. But if the nation is to rapidly hit clean energy penetration targets, then large-scale projects with big footprints are needed as well. 
Not all large-scale solar deployments need to be sited on vacant spaces or farmland, however. Three options include floatovoltaics, landfill solar, and highway rights-of-way. Let’s have a look at each in turn.
Floatovoltaics are a hot PV trend set to double in capacity in 2021. The structures largely take land use debates off the table as the solar array floats on top of a body of water. Typically, these installations are found buoyed-up on a lake or basin, where the water is calmer than the ocean.
Dual-use locations are often a site for these projects. Reservoirs, hydroelectric dam water sources, and wastewater treatment ponds are all potential candidates to host floatovoltaics. 
Take the Far Niente Winery in Napa Valley, California, for example. Completed in 2008, it is widely considered to be the first grid-connected floatovoltaic array in the world. To meet annual demand of 800,000 kWh, the solar array uses 2,296 panels, 1,200 of which sit on top of the winery’s irrigation reservoir, reserving nearby vineyard space for grape production.

The buoyant structure that supports the panels was a simple, yet clever solution. Pontoons made of 18-inch ribbed pipe filled with Styrofoam sit beneath the panels and are attached to four concrete mounts. The array can freely rise and fall 18 feet as water is used, and the concrete mounts prevent the modules from rotating and ensure an optimal azimuth.
What’s more, the array reduces evaporation by covering and cooling the water. This same effect also prevents the spread of unwanted algae. In turn, the pond benefits the panels, acting as a stable thermal mass that regulates temperature, slowing panel degradation and increasing efficiency.
An example of how such projects be effective comes from the Sembcorp Floating Solar, a 60 MW FPV array on the Tengeh Reservior in Singapore, which recently entered service. The system’s 122,000 Trina Solar 210 Vertex dual-glass modules, which cover a surface area the size of 45 football fields, deliver green energy from Singapore’s main reservoir of drinking water via a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the National Water Agency.
Image: Sembcorp
Singapore’s Public Utilities Board said it selected the Trina solar modules due to their double-glass protection, which will aid in making them durable enough to perform in wet and humid conditions for 25 years. The panels are supported by high-density polyethylene (HDPE) floats. The floats are UV-resistant, a necessity to protect them from degradation.
When evaluating the effectiveness of floating PV, cost is likely a first concern as these structures have unique construction mounting (or docking) needs. However, cost parity may be closer than one may expect.
FPV has slightly higher capital costs, but lower operation and management (O&M) costs, no land costs, and increased efficiency benefits the cost structure.
According to Stetson Tchividjian, director of business development at D3Energy, an FPV developer, the price to install floating solar is about 10% to 15% higher than land-based PV. However, O&M cost reductions may help close the gap. If the externalities that stem from developing otherwise-useful land are included, then the economics behind floating solar may keep a project above water.
Landfills and other contaminated brownfield sites are another area for growth. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency tracks solar-landfill topping installations as part of its RE-Powering America’s Land initiative, and has recorded an 80% rise in installations in the last five years. Nearly 60% of the tracked projects sit on landfills, and more than 90% of the RE-Powering projects are solar PV.
Image: EPA
Most of the sites are either municipally or privately owned, with about 1.5 GW of the 1.8 GW installed capacity falling under those ownership structures. Two-thirds of the projects sell power back to the grid, and 22% of the tracked sites are community solar projects. Nearly 70% of these facilities offer 1 MW or more of capacity.
Massachusetts currently leads the field with 30% of the country’s landfill projects. EPA said that a favorable policy climate is important to supporting brownfield sites. Massachusetts’ SMART Program offers enhanced incentives for landfill and brownfield development and built a fast-track for the approval process of these projects, hence the state’s leadership in this arena.
New Jersey and Illinois have also made strides in policy and utility involvement, said the EPA.
One of the largest is the 50 MW Sunnyside solar facility, planned to top a 240-acre Houston landfill and enter service by the end of 2022. Sunnyside’s procurement came as a result of the city’s Climate Action Plan.
Typically, installers are not allowed to penetrate the landfill’s surface, and mounting hardware and foundational structures must be adaptable and lighter than in a conventional ground-mount design. For example, mounting supplier Solar FlexRack provided cast-in-place racks for a community solar landfill development south of Provo, Utah. The mounting system used lighter ballasts with internal bracing and fewer components than a typical solar mount.
Image: SolarFlexRack
Lighter mounts, less expensive land, and environmentally minded policy are all drivers that can push costs down for solar landfills. 
Highway right of way (ROW) areas offer unique qualities that lend themselves to solar installations. For example, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) explained that ROW areas offer ease of access to the adjacent solar facilities and transmission lines often follow highway alignments.  What’s more, ROWs have well-maintained vegetation and few trees or other shading elements.
The CDOT study noted a number of potential safety and quality issues with ROW PV. The top concerns included snow drift and deposition, panel glint and glare, water quality management issues, driver safety in collisions, and safe access for maintenance.
As a result of the study, CDOT created a series of tools for properly siting solar projects. The tools included glint and glare hazard models, array siting criteria, an impact matrix and mitigation strategies.
Highway ROW solar has been deployed in Europe for more than 30 years, and innovations continue to be introduced. For example, a Belgian consortium created two testing facilities to develop PV-equipped noise barriers for use where land and policy constraints make ground-mounted solar plants nearly impossible to install. 
Image: Rolling Solar
The dual-use structure must first function as a sound barrier, which may limit the accompanying PV production. Modules are covered with a transparent sound dampening layer that the researchers said cut production by about 30%.
In the U.S., the land area available for ROW installations can be tight and is generally best left for highway interchanges and exits, according to a study by the University of Texas at Austin’s Webber Energy Group. 
The study found that most states have more than 200 miles of suitable interstate frontage available. That amounts to between 440 and 6,600 acres of preferable install site area per state. Each state had an identified potential of anywhere from 127 to 1,814 GWh per year, with Texas sitting in the top spot. California and Illinois ranked second and third in potential.
The Texas researchers identified a need for GIS data to better support the development of ROW solar. Iowa was the only state included in the that had completed detailed highway interchange profiles to facilitate the transition to solar site planning.

Sirius is capable of managing various energy sources and will automatically choose the greenest or cheapest one available to meet the building’s demand, while simultaneously storing energy surpluses in EVs or battery walls plugged to the system.

the beta test was run using a fleet of 23 Nissan LEAF cars, Wallbox’s bidirectional Quasar chargers, roughly 7,500 square feet of solar panels, and 560 kWh of onsite energy storage, all tied to the city’s electric grid.
The company’s headquarters actually supplied the inspiration behind Sirius, as CPO and co-founder of Wallbox, Eduard Castañeda outlines.
“When expanding our headquarters, we realized that our energy usage would be up more than 400 percent,” said Castañeda. “It would have required a new substation to provide the power we needed, which would take nine months for its full installation. We decided to apply our own technology and saved a lot of time and money while reducing our carbon footprint.”
Beta testing of the product is not yet complete, but upon completion Sirius will be available in every merket where Wallbox currently operates, roughly 8o countries globally. In addition to Sirius, Wallbox is developing several other energy management systems, and soon expects to launch Eco-Smart, solar and wind EV charging technology which will allow a consumer to use the green energy generated from solar panels or wind turbines at home to charge electric vehicles.
In July, after announcing that Sunpower and Wallbox had come to terms on a partnership that would allow SunPower to install a Wallbox EV charger at the same time as their solar and/or storage installation, the companies hinted that they were exploring the potential of backup power solutions incorporating the EV charger’s bi-directional technology into the solar and storage system.

Tiffany Theriot, who runs the Cajun Commissary, an emergency distribution site set up on a tennis court in Houma, Louisiana, said, “Having these solar power stations has truly transformed how we are able to help people.” The energy is supporting refrigerators, fans, and cell phone charging stations, among other uses.
“We have all the energy we need to serve the volunteers who are serving the people of this community, and it all comes right from the sun,” she said.
The 12 self-contained solar power stations include 30 solar panels that provide 11,400 watts of power, along with an inverter and dual battery pack that provides up to 27,000 watt-hours of electricity.
PosiGen said it is also working to install 300 solar power batteries at homes in low-income neighborhoods.

The measure, SB 2408, also known as The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, passed by an 83-33 vote in a late-night vote on September 9, after lawmakers rushed to come to a compromise on the bill. Working groups that were initially tasked with writing the legislation failed to do so, pushing responsibility into the hands of the legislature itself.
SB 2408 includes bailouts for the state’s nuclear generation facilities, but also has been met with support by renewable energy advocates. In a brief detailing the legislation, Vote Solar said the bill “Represents the most robust energy justice bill in the nation and sets new precedent for how states can help navigate a just transition to a renewable energy economy that puts disadvantaged communities at the helm.”
Provisions of the bill included:
An immediate re-start of solar incentives through the Adjustable Block Program, potentially protecting thousands of solar jobs and unlocking billions in solar savings for Illinois families and businesses.
A 350% increase in the pace of renewable energy development in Illinois, putting the state on target to reach 40% renewable energy by 2030.
A 500% funding increase for the Illinois Solar for All program, a dedicated subprogram that unlocks higher solar savings for low-income residents, increasing the annual budget to $50 million.
A $80 million in annual funding for programs that support workers and contractors from disadvantaged communities, including.
That final line item includes $34 million for a grant program to provide seed capital to emerging disadvantaged businesses; $1 million for the Jobs and Justice Fund, a nonprofit “green bank” that will infuse disadvantaged businesses with capital; $21 million for a 16 clean energy workforce training hubs across the state; $21 million for a system of contractor incubators to provide training and technical support to disadvantaged clean energy contractors; $9 million for contractor accelerators that will support further growth of clean energy businesses to become prime contractors and project developers; and $6 million for a training program for Illinoisans in institutions that are preparing for their return.
“The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act is the moment we have all been waiting for,” said John Delurey, Midwest Senior Regional Director at Vote Solar. “It will save thousands of existing solar jobs and chart a course towards a vibrant, clean, and equitable energy future for Illinois.”
On September 1, the Illinois Senate voted to pass a nearly identical bill, Senate Bill 18. If the Senate passes SB 2408, the last thing standing between Illinois and the comprehensive energy legislation it has needed is Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s signature, which is expected.

A group of Russian researchers has developed a new active technique to reduce the operating temperatures of solar modules that acts simultaneously on both sides of a panel.
The system, dubbed “dual surface cooling,” is built with a 16 mm single polyvinyl chloride (PVC) perforated pipe applied on the upper part of the module that spreads water on the front and the rear surfaces. A cotton wick mesh is applied on the rear surface to collect the water and spread it on the rear surface.
“One issue that this study minimizes is the loss of water through evaporation through the covering of the back surface of the panel with aluminum sheet which is also strategically perforated to allow the flow of air into the inner section of the enclosed area,” the academics explained. “This approach does not totally prevent the loss of water but minimizes its loss especially at the rear section of the panel.”
The technique was tested on two panels with a size of 95×45 cm, an output of 30 W, and a tilt angle of 45 degrees each.

“Holes were created in the aluminum sheet in order to allow some level of air exchange in the inner section of the panel and the ambient air,” the Russian group said.
The technique was tested on two panels with a size of 95×45 cm, an output of 30 W, and a tilt angle of 45 degrees each. The thermal imager Testo 875 was used to take infra-red thermal images for both panels during mid-day and a GM 1362-EN-01 temperature thermometer and 14 K-type thermocouples were utilized to measure the panel temperature. The performance of the system was compared to that of a reference system with no cooling system applied.
The measurements showed that the cooled system achieved an average temperature of 35.72 degrees Celsius while the uncooled one reached 59.27 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the cooled panel had an average power and voltage of 18.53 V and 13.03 W compared to 16.71 V and 10.00 W for the uncooled system.
“Similarly, the cooled PV module recorded an average efficiency of 14.36% against 12.83% for the uncooled panel. This represents a difference of 1.53% which is an 11.9% improvement in the efficiency of the cooled panel,” the researchers said.
“The system was tested in a real environment but we haven’t evaluated the economics of the cooling mechanism,” researcher Ephraim Bonah Agyekum told pv magazine. Looking forward, the research team wants to add sieves to the basin beneath the panel to filter out dirt and to consider the effect of flow rate on the performance of the module.
The system is described in the study “Effect of dual surface cooling of solar photovoltaic panel on the efficiency of the module: experimental investigation,” which was recently published in Heliyon.

The project would produce, store, and transport green hydrogen in salt dome caverns at utility scale for power generation, transportation, and industrial applications in the western United States.
The joint venture is located in Delta, Utah, next to the Intermountain Power Plant (IPP), which would be converted from coal to natural gas and green hydrogen to produce electricity. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) is leading the power plant conversion. The plant would use a gas turbine designed and built to operate on 100% green hydrogen.
Dubbed “IPP Renewed,” the Intermountain project includes retiring existing coal-fired units and installing new natural gas-fired electricity generating units capable of using hydrogen for 840 MW net generation output. Additional investment will modernize the power plant’s transmission system to southern California, and develop hydrogen production and long-term storage capabilities.

The natural gas generating units will be provided by Mitsubishi Power and designed to use 30% hydrogen fuel at start-up, transitioning to 100% hydrogen fuel by 2045 as technology improves.
Salt dome storage of hydrogen is being evaluated at other U.S. locations by a partnership between Mitsubishi Power and Texas Brine.
In May, the Green Hydrogen Coalition, LADWP,  and other partners launched HyDeal LA, an initiative to achieve at-scale green hydrogen procurement at $1.50/kilogram in the Los Angeles Basin by 2030. HyDeal LA aims to overcome the biggest barrier to the green hydrogen economy—its high cost—by launching a commercial green hydrogen cluster at scale.
Phase 1 is planned to design the supply chain needed to achieve $1.50/kg delivered green hydrogen in the LA Basin. It also will strive to agree on terms and conditions to achieve production, storage, transport, and delivery of green hydrogen at scale.
Future anticipated projects under the ACES Delta umbrella include expanding green hydrogen supply to other Western states and the construction of connecting hydrogen infrastructure to build a regional hydrogen production, transportation, and supply network.
Chevron said it is working to build demand for hydrogen in heavy-duty transportation and industrial sectors where greenhouse gas emissions have been hard to abate.
ACES Delta is co-owned by Magnum, which is a Haddington Ventures portfolio company, and Mitsubishi Power. Chevron, Magnum, and Mitsubishi Power are negotiating definitive documentation outlining Chevron’s participation. Terms of the transaction are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, and closing is expected to be subject to customary closing conditions.
