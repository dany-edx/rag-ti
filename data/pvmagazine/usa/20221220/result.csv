The Postal Service says its priority is to provide its carriers and communities with safer, more efficient vehicles as soon as possible. The greening of the fleet is part of the U.S. Postal Service’s overall network modernization efforts, which will cost $9.6 billion, paid for in part by the $3 billion appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act.
“The $3 billion provided by Congress has significantly reduced the risk associated with accelerating the implementation of a nationwide infrastructure necessary to electrify our delivery fleet,” said Louis DeJoy, Postmaster General. “While most of the electric vehicle funding will continue to come from Postal Service revenues, we are grateful for the confidence that Congress and the Administration have placed in us to build and acquire what has the potential to become the largest electric vehicle fleet in the nation.”
While the initial acquisition will include internal combustion vehicles as necessary to meet immediate vehicle replacement needs, any vehicles delivered from 2026 and beyond are expected to be electric.
“We have a statutory requirement to deliver mail and packages to 163 million addresses six days per week and to cover our costs in doing so – that is our mission,” said DeJoy. “As I have said in the past, if we can achieve those objectives in a more environmentally responsible way, we will do so.”
In February of this year, the Postal Service had committed to at least 10% electric, but in March, 20% of its purchase order from Oshkosh Defense was made up of 20% electric delivery trucks. In July the Postal Service announced its intent to conduct a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement that anticipated increasing the next-generation delivery vehicles (NGDV) to 40% electric.
By May 2023, the Postal Service intends to publish a draft supplemental environmental impact statement with an assessment of the results of the acquisitions.
“What is less widely understood is that our network modernization initiative is necessary to enable this vehicle electrification and will also provide meaningful cost and carbon reductions in other ways,” said DeJoy. “A key focus of our modernization effort is to reduce inefficient transportation and improve distribution operations, resulting in far less air cargo and far fewer truck trips. When combined with our substantial commitment to the electrification of our delivery vehicles, the Postal Service will be at the forefront of our nation’s green initiatives.”
The announcement did not include estimates in how much the Postal Service will save on not buying gas for its delivery vehicles, nor does it estimate the amount of carbon prevented by using electric vehicles.
Expect mail delivery by electric vehicle to begin in late 2023.

The projects will include Mitsubishi Power Emerald batteries and are planned to come online over the next two years. Origis has over 1.5 GW of operational and contracted projects in the region, and over 4 GW nationwide.
The grid-scale energy storage projects offer services like arbitrage, energy market participation, transmission and distribution deferral services, renewable capacity support, curtailment avoidance, grid frequency regulation, and voltage support.
“Storage of renewably generated power is an increasingly important grid asset,” said Kenneth Kim, vice president, engineering and strategy planning, Origis Energy. “By adding the BESS solution to these facilities, we increase the value of the asset, adding enhanced grid solutions to clean, cost-effective solar power.”
Origis Energy is headquartered in Miami, Florida. The company has 2.3 GWh of storage projects contracted or in negotiation with 13.7 GWh currently being developed. It operates in energy storage development, financing, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and operations, maintenance and asset management for investors and clean energy consumers.
In May, Origis closed a bundled $375 million credit facility that included both a letter of credit and equipment financing. Origis said it will use the funds to support the its growing pipeline of solar and energy storage projects. This oversubscribed round of funding was led by CIT, a division of First Citizens Bank, along with Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Nomura, Rabobank, and Santander. Latham and Watkins represented Origis Energy in the transaction and Norton Rose Fulbright acted as lender counsel.
The trio of Southeast energy storage projects will use Mitsubishi’s energy management system and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to control charge and discharge cycles, monitor the system’s status, send alarms and alerts, and enable long-term data storage. The company has more than 2.5 GWh of utility-scale battery energy storage projects in various stages of deployment globally.

“The Emerald storage solution technology we’re delivering for Origis follows rigorous NERC CIP and IEC 62443 Security Development Lifecycle Process policy and processes aligned to industry best practices,” said Alejandro Schnakofsky, vice president of global strategy, energy storage solutions, Mitsubishi Power Americas.
“It is imperative in everything we do to protect energy systems and operators with the strongest level of cybersecurity possible,” said Schankofsky.
In July, module supplier Boviet Solar announced it entered large solar module supply deal with Origis Energy, providing its 550 W PERC monocrystalline bifacial double-glass PV modules for use in utility-scale solar projects across the United States. More than 700 MW of solar modules were contracted as part of the order, with delivery slated for 2023. The shipment includes Vega Series 550 W panels.

The company expects its new site to be fully functional by 2024, expanding its manufacturing operations out of Germany into the U.S. ADS-TEC plans to invest $8 million for the construction of its new site, which will facilitate the expansion of its proprietary battery-buffered EV charging infrastructure into the U.S.
“We’re excited to welcome yet another high-tech German company to Alabama,” said Governor Kay Ivey. “The partnership between German engineering and Alabama manufacturing has brought many innovative products to the North American market.”
Auburn’s business corridor has attracted numerous aerospace, industrial and manufacturing companies over the years. Following Airbus and NASA, automotive manufacturers Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Hyundai and Toyota also operate facilities in the city.
ADS-TEC Energy is a manufacturer of the 300 kW ChargePost ultra-fast charging post, which charges two EVs using 150 kW outpost units in up to 10 minutes. The commercial charging station unit delivers more than 201 kWh of battery back-up power from a lithium-ion battery cell, providing an easy EV charging solution to cities or towns with limited grid voltage frequencies.
The ChargeBox power dispenser delivers 320 kW of battery power to the company’s ChargePost EV charging posts.
ADS-TEC Energy’s charging technology was nominated for the German Future Prize in 2022 by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany and elevated to the “circle of excellence.”
ADS-TEC Energy is a unit of ADS-TEC Group, a family-operated company that dates back to 1980 and is partly owned by Bosch Thermotechnik.
The EV charging company went public in December 2021 after a SPAC merger with European Sustainable Growth Acquisition Corporation with $156 million in equity proceeds.  The company currently trades at $3.33 per share with a $163 million market capitalization, down 66.4% from $9.81 per share a year ago when it began trading on the Nasdaq exchange.
Alabama Booster
As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, businesses that install EV chargers and station equipment at their property are eligible to receive a 30% tax credit. The maximum amount of the tax credit increases from $30,000 to $100,000 for charging projects starting in January 2023.
The IRA provides an additional $5 billion in new investments alone to the sourcing of U.S.-made EV production and charging station infrastructure.
Once a historic hub for the automotive parts market, Alabama saw signs of life in August with Mercedes-Benz announcing a $7 billion commitment to invest in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Full-scale production of the automaker’s all-electric EQS SUV model is slated to begin in late 2022 in Tuscaloosa, while Mercedes first invested in Bibb County, Alabama in 2017 to assemble EV components.
“We are receiving an increasing number of phone calls from people asking about the IRA being a tool to explore commercial opportunities in the state,” said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, a clean energy advocacy group.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/20/california-cuts-rooftop-solar-net-metering-an-industry-reacts/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 20, 2022",California cuts rooftop solar net metering: An industry reacts,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) unanimously voted to approve Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM), slashing payments for excess solar production sent to the grid by 75%.
CPUC voted to cut the average export rate in California from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, making the cuts effective on April 15, 2023. Customers who have new systems installed and approved for grid interconnection before the effective date in April will be grandfathered in to NEM 2.0 rates.
Currently, average net metering rates range from $0.23 per kWh to $0.35 per kWh, and the new proposed decision cuts those rates to an average of $0.05 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh. This is set to be the largest cut of export rates in U.S. history, in a market that represents roughly 50% of the nation’s residential solar market.
An industry reacts
“What the CPUC did today is a disgrace and a disservice not only to Californians, but to the nation. The commission’s decision will hammer the residential solar market in California and undercut Gov. Newsom’s pledge to be the nation’s leader in building a 100% clean energy grid.” Ken Cook, president, Environmental Working Group.
“California regulators just rammed through a plan to make rooftop solar more expensive as the climate crisis spirals out of control. The commission has taken a step backward by widening the divide between those who can afford solar and those who can’t. It’s an affront to low-income communities who are hit by the climate crisis first and worst, and we’ll do everything we can to convince the commission to fix the deep flaws in its proposal.” Roger Lin, attorney, energy justice, Center for Biological Diversity.
“The California solar market took a hit last week with the reduction in solar net metering benefits (NEM3.0), hurting payback for new customers starting April 2023. It’s however a huge opportunity for the California battery storage OEMs and installers – we need more supply, lower prices, faster sales and easier plug-and-play integration. Germany went through similar NEM policy changes in 2013, driving a shift to self consumption of solar: today, storage is now paired with 90% of new German residential solar sales. And then Hawaii went through the same when NEM was killed in 2015 and there too, storage is now paired 90% of new residential solar sales. California will be no different and a US$ Trillion opportunity for Solar Installers to adopt storage quickly – only 10% of new CA solar buyers get storage today.” Deep Chakraborty, co-founder and chief executive, Enact Systems.
“The update to the new rooftop solar program is a win for all parties. Encouraging solar systems paired with batteries will provide reliability, affordability and climate benefits. We need solar. It has helped turn California into a clean energy world leader. But we need to do more. Clean energy use during the day must be extended into the evening. Solar with batteries does exactly that. It’s the next step toward a clean energy future that will improve the air we breathe, the communities we live in, and our overall quality of life.” Matt Baker, director, Public Advocates Office.
“More than a hundred thousand citizens of California protested the PD. The PD included two absolutely barbaric features: a grid access charge and a plan to impose the harsh new conditions retroactively. It also had a third barbaric feature: slash and burn export compensation. The authors of the PD caved in and removed the first two barbaric features. But they left the third, continuing to push the disingenuous “poor-to-rich” cost shift argument. They continued to use DSM cost-benefit tests to evaluate rooftop solar. Those tests are irrelevant since the utilities are not providing any financial incentives to install rooftop solar panels, unlike DSM, where the incentives total $1.5 billion annually. A few strident voices are pushing a tiresome argument that NEM is about the survival of the solar industry. That is not the issue in customer minds. Customers want to lower their energy bills, which are shooting through the roof.” Dr. Ahmad Faruqui, economist-at-large and rate design expert.
“Solar advocates are proud we were able to fight back against the most egregious attacks on rooftop solar the CPUC included in earlier proposed changes to net metering. We stopped a discriminatory solar tax and protected current solar users from a broken deal. Still, the changes to net metering approved by the CPUC are a step backwards when we really need to be moving forward with solar and battery storage. It is a dark day in California when the utility regulators try to block out the sun. The solar movement will continue looking for ways to keep rooftop solar growing and affordable in California despite this setback,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director, California Solar and Storage Association.

Fittingly, the town is known for a Christmas tree farm at The Rocks, a historic property, now owned by the non-profit Society for the Protection of NH Forests (Forest Society).
The Rocks was a working farm in the 19th century and features exceptional period architecture including an Olmsted-designed garden and a network of woodland trails. The owners’ descendants donated 1,400 acre property to the Forest Society in 1978, which has continued as a Christmas tree farm and educational center, as well as being maintained as a working forest. In 2019, the main building burned to the ground, and since that time The Forest Society has undertaken a major renovation, which includes a new solar array that will bring The Rocks’ facilities close to net zero energy use.
In 2020, The Forest Society engaged ReVision Energy, a large New England solar installer, to install a ground-mount solar array of 180 QCells 480 Watt solar modules. The modules are mounted on an APA racking system, installed in the rocky ground with ground screws. A PowerDash DAS provides monitoring and management. And there are nine single-phase SMA SB 7.0 kW inverters.
The 86.4 kW array, which will be powered up just after the new year, will produce over 100,000 kWh of clean solar energy annually, offsetting 156,000 pounds of carbon, or the equivalent to removing 15 passenger cars from the road.
In addition to the solar array, The Forest Society is having the 1884 Carriage Barn renovated while retaining its historic stone and shingle exterior. The solar array will power new heat pumps, and a geothermal system will be added for heating and cooling. To ensure that the building is as energy efficient as possible, an insulated building envelope will be created on the interior. With the renovation, The Rocks is becoming The Forest Society North, where professional conservation staff who serve the North Country will be based.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/20/let-california-farmers-opt-in-to-dynamic-pricing-of-electricity-says-trade-group/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"DECEMBER 20, 2022","Let California farmers opt in to dynamic pricing of electricity, says trade group","The California Community Choice Association (CalCCA) has called for state regulators to expand an opt-in dynamic pricing pilot to farmers statewide.
CalCCA made the proposal in a California dynamic pricing rulemaking proceeding focused on increasing demand flexibility for electricity, in order to reduce the curtailment of renewable generation, enhance grid reliability, and reduce system costs.
A 5 MW opt-in pilot project involving automated agricultural pumping by customers of one community choice aggregator has cost-effectively shifted “significant” agricultural load in both the ramp and peak hours, CalCCA said. On that basis, CalCCA proposed expanding the pilot to serve farmers across the territories of the state’s investor-owned utilities, to reach “up to 500 MW” in load flexibility capacity.
CalCCA represents the interests of 24 community choice electricity providers in California. According to California utility PG&E, over 60% of PG&E customers take their generation service from one of 12 community choice aggregators in the utility’s service area.
CalCCA’s proposed value of 500 MW of eligible capacity is approximately equal, the group said, to the statewide load shift potential identified in a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study for agricultural pumping and processing, after conversion from gigawatt-hours to MW of peak load. CalCCA said an expanded dynamic pricing program should be open to all types of agricultural customer load, not just irrigation pumping.
CalCCA submitted its proposal in response to a question, posed by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in the dynamic pricing rulemaking, about whether to expand dynamic pricing pilots.
CalCCA presented pilot project data showing that electricity consumption by project participants last August and September fell sharply in the 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. period, when air conditioning needs were high, as illustrated in the nearby bar chart.
Participants in the pilot project are all customers of Valley Clean Energy Alliance (VCE), a community choice aggregator. VCE’s interest in the pilot project stemmed from the Berkeley Lab study showing the high load shift potential for irrigation pumping, CalCCA said in its proposal.
California has approved or is considering eight real-time pricing pilot programs, according to the Public Advocates Office of the CPUC.
Nationwide, $33 billion in annual savings would result from allowing customers to opt in to real-time pricing that balances renewables, thus shifting some consumption to lower-cost periods, according to a study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Customer bills would be reduced by 10% to 17%, the study said.
A supplier of automated irrigation pumps, Polaris Energy Services, also commented to the CPUC in support of expanding the VCE pilot program, as did TeMix, which developed the real-time pricing platform for the VCE pilot.

The company has both expanded existing facilities and established new factories, and reports that it now has manufacturing facilities in in Michigan, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky.
“GameChange has always been committed to the USA market with the majority of our employees and vendors residing in the USA,” said Derick Botha, chief commercial officer at GameChange Solar.  “With our growth and the growth in the utility scale solar industry anticipated for the next decade, we have greatly expanded our USA annual capacity to 24 GW for key structural systems to directly meet the needs of our customers for domestically sourced products. We are pleased to be able to expand greatly the domestic manufacturing sector supporting renewable energy and the many jobs it will create.”
The company has demonstrated steady growth since founding in 2012 and in 2020 was ranked the third largest solar tracker company in the United States and sixth globally by Wood Mackenzie. The company reports that it has sold over 21 GW of racking systems.
In November 2022 GameChange Solar unveiled a new fixed-tilt racking system for ground-mounted projects. It has a 5-degree or 10-degree east-west landscape configuration. The MaxDensity system is designed to maximize the number of modules packed onto a site, with a ground coverage ratio of up to 98%. It can be installed in blocks of up to 7 MW, in configurations of up to 12,000 modules. It supports all commercially available framed modules, according to the company.
In December 2021, GameChange Solar Holdings Corp., received an investment of $150 million from Koch Strategic Platforms (KSP), a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group. The preferred stock investment, if converted, would represent a minority stake in GameChange. In addition to capital investment, Koch and GameChange are exploring further synergies across Koch Industries, including KBX, a global transportation, logistics, and technology arm, and Koch Engineered Solutions.
