More than 20 inches of rain fell, causing flash flooding, triggering mudslides, and leaving much of the island without power. Except, of course, for those with solar power and energy storage, some of which was put into place after Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc five years ago.
Let’s Share the Sun is a non-profit founded in 2010 that has much experience in Puerto Rico, where electrical power was tenuous prior to hurricane devastation. Electricity is also expensive because it’s mostly generated from petroleum that has to be brought from the mainland, so solar not only builds resilience but helps residents with cost of living expenses.
After Hurricane Fiona left island residents without power, Let’s Share the Sun has been joined by Solar Landscape, a New Jersey-based full-service developer, designer, installer, owner, and operator of community solar and solar energy solutions for the commercial/industrial, municipal, public school and non-profit marketplaces. The company employs more than 100 people and has more than 200 MW of solar energy projects completed or under construction.
Solar Landscape is pitching in to help make Puerto Rico become more resilient by donating financial resources, expertise and labor to install solar panels and batteries on homes with critical energy and medical needs.
Solar Landscape chief development officer John Moran has participated in Let’s Share the Sun installation projects in Puerto Rico and has seen the difference that the program has made for residents there. “Let’s Share the Sun and Solar Landscape share a similar mission: to bring the advantages of solar energy to disadvantaged communities,” said Moran. “As we witness the recurring power outages in Puerto Rico, Solar Landscape is proud to help Let’s Share the Sun bring resilient and renewable power to households with health conditions that require them to have uninterrupted access to energy.”

A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $10,000 or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, according to EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
Blackouts or power outages occur with varied frequency and for different reasons, depending on location. Some regions experience transmission issues on the grid, weather events can knock out power, and some regions like southern California have scheduled rolling blackouts during high energy-demand periods.

A SunPower-backed survey of 1,500 homeowners found that 40% of respondents worried about power outages on a monthly basis. And one-third of respondents said high-profile outages, like the ones caused by winter storms in Texas this past February, are the top reason for considering energy storage.
The next logical question might be: how much battery to install, and for how long should it provide backup?
Installers typically give the choice between whole-home backup, which often require the installation of multiple batteries, or a partial backup, which allows the homeowner to select specific circuits that are tied to desired appliances or outlets. When selecting specific breakers, homeowners often select the refrigerator, garage door opener, home office, or other kitchen appliances.
To understand a home’s power needs, and to evaluate what is most essential to back-up, homeowners can use the Department of Energy’s Energy Saver appliance energy calculator.
One of the most common home batteries is the Tesla Powerwall, which has a 13.5 kWh usable storage capacity. This means it can provide 13.5 kW for one hour, or 1 kW for 13.5 hours, said EnergySage. A second big energy storage brand is from LG Chem, which has  9.6 kWh and 16 kWh models.

Translated to appliances, EnergySage said 13.5 kWh is equivalent to running a 3,500 W air source heat pump for just under four hours, a 200 W refrigerator for 67.5 hours, or five 20 W light bulbs for 135 hours.
EnergySage said a PowerWall can typically back up essentials like WiFi, phone, refrigerator, and some lights for about 24 hours.
Simulations run by the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of residential solar and storage systems operated for backup power purposes suggest that a system with a 7 kW pv array and 10 kWh of storage could support 60-80% of a customer’s average daily load over the course of a year, depending on the region.
Plus, if the sun is still shining, a battery-connected solar array will continue to produce and store electricity. Solar arrays without a battery must power down during an outage, for safety reasons. Without a battery to store the power, there is no safe place for the power to go, so the system must use a rapid shut down device (the grid is inaccessible as it’s being repaired).
Solar installers will typically work with a homeowner to determine backup needs, and will evaluate the readiness of the home’s main electrical panel to be integrated for backup. In some cases, the installer will call for a main panel upgrade to accommodate the battery, Doing this may come at an additional cost.
Without a battery, a grid-tied home solar array will export any unused power directly to the grid in real-time. With a battery, electricity can be charged and discharged in ways that optimize energy bill savings.

Take demand charges, for instance. Some utilities, including providers in Massachusetts, Arizona, and Illinois, charge an additional fee based on the maximum amount of power required over a single hour, or 15-minute period, in a given month. A battery can be scheduled to discharge power during peak use times so that peak energy demand is smoothed, and demand charges are lower.
Utilities also use a billing design called time-of-use, which, similarly to demand charges, are intended to discourage power use during peak demand periods. For example, a utility may charge a lower rate of $0.15/kWh during off-peak hours, and then increase the rate to $0.32/kWh.
With a battery, the home is able to store energy during off-peak hours, which typically occur during the day when the solar array is producing the most. The battery can then export power to the home during on-peak hours, which are often in the evening as people return from work and run appliances and the array produces less power. Without a battery, homeowners are subject to whatever rate is being charged if the array is not actively producing.
A third benefit is the ability of the battery to provide value in utilities without net metering. Net metering is the process of exporting energy to the power grid in exchange for credits that can be used to offset utility bill costs.

Some utilities offer a one-to-one value, meaning each kWh of power sent out will cover one kWh of utility bill costs. Others have a decreased value for net metering. 
For example, power may be billed by the utility at $0.16/kWh, but the value of exported energy only offers a credit value of $0.08/kWh. Other utilities offer no net metering credit whatsoever, like in Hawaii, where battery attachment rates are much higher than the rest of the United States at 80%. Again, in the net metering scenario, batteries are able to store and provide power, limiting exposure to the value loss in poor net metering climates.
A lithium-ion home battery comes with a sizeable price tag, usually around $10,000. Currently, energy storage that is paired with a residential solar system is eligible for the 26% federal investment tax credit.
Certain states and utilities offer additional incentives for including batteries, and in some cases the value adder can make a dramatic difference. The SMART program in Massachusetts, the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) of California, and incentive programs in Maryland and Long Island provide up-front cost relief for batteries.
Programs like ConnectedSolutions of New England offer further savings to homeowners who opt-in to a “bring-your-own-battery” program, wherein an incentive is paid to homeowner who agree to allow their batteries to export power to the grid during times of extreme peak demand.
In addition to the ticket-price of the battery, there may be hardware costs associated, as well. Tesla estimates supporting hardware for the battery costs $1,100, and installation will range from $800 to $2,000. Electrical work like a main panel upgrade may drive costs higher, and some installers will require the customer to cover costs like permit fees or retailer/connection charges, said EnergySage.
Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance reports lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 87% from 2010 to 2019. With global supply chains ramping up lithium production due to increased demand (also driven by electric vehicle adoption) it is possible that further price reductions may occur. But is it worth waiting for a cheaper battery?

The answer depends, but in the past, the cost of installing a battery after-the-fact, or “retrofitting”, is dependent on the inverters on the array, said EnergySage. Most home solar arrays are installed with AC-coupled inverters, which would then need to be re-converted by an additional inverter back to DC for use by the battery. This means a retrofitted battery would come with an additional cost of another inverter, plus installation costs.
A solar system with a battery included at initial install can include just one DC-coupled inverter, which reduces costs, and converts and stores energy more efficiently than AC-coupled solutions.
Now that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is law, the 30% Investment Tax Credit applies not just to solar-paired batteries, but also to standalone storage. This has made retrofits and standalone installations more common among installers.
Inverter companies are actively working to make retrofits easier. For example, Enphase recently released a microinverter that the company said can be retrofit to any type of home energy storage battery without the need for recoupling

Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A  SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The goal is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
According to EnergySage, nearly 40% of consumers reported electricity self-supply as a reason for getting a storage quote, up from less than 20% in 2022. Backup power for outages and savings on utility rates were also listed as top reasons for including energy storage in a quote.
Battery adoption has climbed rapidly in recent years. In 2020 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and by 2022 17% of residential solar projects included energy storage.
 
Leading battery brand warranties can offer a view into the expected life of the device. The Tesla PowerWall has a limited warranty protecting defects for 10 years following installation. It also warrants that the PowerWall will start its life with a capacity of 13.5 kWh, and will retain energy capacity based on a degradation schedule.
LG, developer of the popular LG Chem, warrants that its system will retain at least 60% of its nominal energy capacity (9.8 kWh) for 10 years. The battery must operate between -10 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees Celsius to remain warranted. Total throughput of energy within the warranty is limited to 27.4 MWh.
Enphase, another top battery supplier, offers a 10 year or 7,300 cycle warranty. Full warranty sheet here.
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between 5-15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20-30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.

Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimized. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/30/the-inflation-reduction-act-may-exacerbate-the-lithium-problem/,"BATTERY,EV,GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2022",The Inflation Reduction Act may exacerbate the lithium problem,"It’s been a jubilant couple of weeks in Washington, DC, with everyone from clean energy developers to environmental advocates to labor unions celebrating the passage of the landmark climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. There’s much to celebrate: America is finally joining the rest of the developed world in setting ambitious carbon pollution reduction goals, putting real money behind it.
Billions of dollars are flowing toward all aspects of the energy transition, from production to infrastructure. Soon America will move away from dirty fossil fuels and electrify everything. Limitless clean electricity from solar and wind will flood the grid, straight into our electric cars, forklifts, battery storage systems and smartphones.
Except there’s a big problem. The plan to electrify everything relies on lithium batteries to store all this clean energy. The world’s largest lithium sources can’t be cost effectively purified to meet the growing demand. Purifying lithium so that it’s usable in, say, electric vehicle batteries, costs a fortune. The lithium battery production bottleneck will block the adoption of 350 million electric vehicles by 2040 unless supply chain constraints are removed.
I’ve spent over two decades in the chemical, energy, and automotive sectors, watching battery storage development ramp up in fits and starts. I’ve tracked lithium availability, public policy, and the price of gasoline. The move away from fossil fuels to electric is inevitable. But there was one critical question: How can we unleash lithium, getting it from more sources and refining it in more places?
A snapshot of lithium production is that the mineral can be extracted anywhere in the world – from brines found deep underground or on flood plains, from rock, clay, or batteries that can be recycled. That lithium, however, needs to be refined into high-quality lithium hydroxide and carbonate, and 80% of that refinement happens in Asia, with China accounting for more than half of that production.
The carbon footprint made by transporting lithium to and from Asia in order to make an eco-friendly vehicle is ironic. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China makes the lithium hydroxide and carbonate supply unreliable, not to mention the constant COVID-related shutdowns in China that continue to rock global supply. And the cost to North American manufacturers? Through the roof. With money pouring into electric vehicle manufacturing, demand for battery-grade lithium will further outstrip supply. In fact, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts the lithium supply gap to be 725kt by 2040 in North America and Europe, enough to hold back 350 million electric vehicles.
The industries that depend on lithium batteries are about to hit a brick wall, but we know how to avoid it:
Unlock lithium at its source. More than 60% of Earth’s lithium is in brines, which has been mostly inaccessible until now. We have developed a way to extract that lithium so it can compete with lithium from other sources, at even lower prices.
Decentralize lithium refinement. We must refine lithium on site of any manufacturer that needs it. We must be able to utilize lithium from any source. Whether you’re mining lithium or making cars or batteries, if you are refining on site, you no longer need to pay to ship the mineral around the world; it can happen right there on your property. Small- and mid-sized lithium producers and extractors would have an affordable option to refine lithium on their own. Geopolitical risks are minimized, and lithium refinement costs from brine feedstocks would be slashed by 40 percent.
Eliminate waste. If an electrochemical refinement process was used onsite, as opposed to the chemical phase separation method used in Asia today, the byproducts of that lithium refinement process would be hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, which can be used to extract more lithium. Loop closed.
Defenders of gasoline-powered vehicles claim that the relics of internal combustion will end up in landfills, and that the processing of batteries creates lots of pollution and waste. But every successful industry has had to overcome significant roadblocks; we can locate alongside battery recyclers to efficiently and economically refine lithium from recycled batteries, which creates a closed loop battery value chain and a more sustainable energy source. In the interest of clean air and national security, we must remove as many inefficiencies from lithium battery production as possible. Until then, President Biden’s vision for the clean energy transition won’t live up to its potential.
