Two runners-up were awarded $25,000 each, for a total of $300,000.
Winners were decided by the Solar Energy Technology (SETO) group, run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This program builds on the 2018 program of a similar name.
The winning teams submitted day-ahead solar forecasts for ten predetermined locations, every day for four weeks. The winners were those who had the highest levels of accuracy during the period, and presented the best plans for moving their technologies forward. The results of these projections can be found here.
The winners of the 2022 Solar Forecasting awards are:

A great example of the value of forecasting solar, and wind, could be found recently in the Texas ERCOT power grid region.

On March 17th, ERCOT was 71% powered by CO2 free electricity. However, on March 16th, wind generation dipped from 26 GW of power to below 5 GW of power just as the sun was setting and solar was falling. During this period, fossil gas generation increased from about 10 GW of capacity to almost 25 GW before aggressively scaling back as wind generation returned on the 17th.
Of course, every single day in California has a massive solar power ramp in the morning, which later decreases – by double digit of gigawatts of output – in the afternoon.
The five winning teams came from private and university settings. Nimbus AI, CLaSP, and WenYuan-Tang were university teams – from University of Hawai’i, University of Michigan, And North Carolina State University, respectively. Northview Weather and Leaptran teams were private ventures.
Nimbus AI combines ground based historical data with up to date satellite based data and physics based weather predictions – plus some machine learning – to make probabilistic forecasts. A slightly more in depth description of their work can be found here.
The CLaSP team uses a two part model. First, they collect large scale weather conditions and satellite cloud imagery, then complement that with ‘exogenous and endogenous variables to train a regression model to forecast solar irradiance in one to eight hours.’
WenYuan Tang is a researcher focused on electricity markets, data analytics, machine learning, and power system optimization. Tang and his team developed a solar forecasting and grid optimization tool that draws on data from several base models, physical models and statistical models. Their simple, effective methods produce accurate solar forecasting despite low data and computational costs.
Northview Weather’s renewable energy software uses “an ensemble weather forecasting approach, which allows for richer information on possible outcomes and improved forecast accuracy.” It does this by using a mesoscale weather forecast model to generate probabilistic solar forecast information, which they then combine with statistical information and machine learning of historic sky cover observations.
Leaptran produces intelligent control systems that manage large buildings and microgrids, using AI and data-driven algorithms to predict loads and adapt to changes in the environment. Their solar forecasting team combined crowd-sourced weather data and algorithms, site-specific data to produce intra-day and days-ahead solar predictions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/30/solar-advocates-reaffirm-their-approval-of-duke-energys-proposed-net-metering-successor-in-north-carolina/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,NORTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 30, 2022",Solar advocates reaffirm their approval of Duke Energy’s proposed net metering successor in North Carolina,"A coterie of clean energy advocates, including the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association (NCSEA), the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) on behalf of Vote Solar and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, have submitted comments to North Carolina regulators reaffirming their already-public support for Duke Energy’s Solar Choice Net Metering proposal, which was originally filed on November 29, 2021.
While North Carolina is only required to revisit the current net metering structure some time before 2027, the state’s current rebate program is set to expire in 2022, which has created an environment of urgency for clean-energy focused groups hoping to avoid the industry-harming effects that even a couple of weeks of incentive uncertainty can have on the residential solar market.
The groups say that the proposal, when combined with a pending Smart $aver Solar incentive, which would offer rebates to non-residential customers to install energy efficient equipment in their facilities, would still provide the upfront savings, reduced utility costs, and bill savings necessary to keep the state’s distributed solar market healthy and growing. Duke’s proposal would change the state’s base net metering incentive from the full retail rate of electricity, to the avoided cost rate represented by sourcing that electricity from distributed solar, rather than any other generating resource.
The proposal would also institute time-of-use rates, with different net metering rates for peak periods (times when projected electricity demand, and, as a result, costs, are high) and discount periods (times when projected electricity demand, and, as a result, costs, are lower). In practice, this would lower net metering rates from between $0.05 and $0.20 per kWh, as it stands today, to around $0.03/kWh. The reason for such a large variance in current rates is that the full retail rate is based on time of use and critical-peak pricing, which fluctuates, depending on the time of day and time of year.
Duke’s plan would also institute a minimum monthly bill of up to $28 for homes adding solar.
While lowered export rates and fixed fees for solar owners are both policies that the organizations included in this letter have fought against before, they do not do the industry nearly as much harm as an incentive expiration period would, something the organizations recognize. According to the advocates, the net metering successor program has been approached from a utility-collaborative perspective, in an attempt to avoid the ugly battles s over harmful proposals that rooftop solar customers have weathered in states like California and Florida.
“While there has been some concern about the changes this agreement presents to the industry, it mitigates many of the worst-case scenarios seen in the aforementioned states, which can have devastating results for rooftop solar communities,” reads a released published by NCSEA on behalf of the advocates as a group, referencing not just Florida and California, but ugly fights past in Illinois, Nevada, and Arizona.
“While NCSEA and our partners understand that this change may be difficult in the short-term, the long-term predictability affords the continued growth and sustainability of rooftop solar as a whole in North Carolina,” said to Peter Ledford, general counsel and director of policy with NCSEA.
Faces of opposition
This is not to say, however, that climate and renewable energy advocates are in favor of the proposal across the board. Earlier this month, 15 rooftop solar companies within the state sent an open letter to Governor Roy Cooper calling for his help to protect rooftop solar from Duke’s attempt to weaken the industry. The letter states, “We believe the proposed changes could harm a growing industry on behalf of a single corporation, cause the loss of thousands of well-paying jobs in the North Carolina solar industry, threaten your climate goals and hurt all electricity customers by limiting the delivery of low-cost power to the grid.”
Additionally, three climate justice nonprofits have filed a joint challenge to Duke Energy’s proposal, claiming that Duke’s plan would harm all North Carolinians, especially low-income individuals and families.
A spokesperson for the group, dubbed NC WARN, explained the position, saying:
“For 10 years, Duke executives have led the national fight against renewable energy – and fought against an honest, independent study of solar’s true value in this monopoly state.  Duke’s sole argument for its proposed rules change – that solar homes don’t pay their fair share compared to non-solar households – cannot survive an impartial study that assesses solar costs and benefits.”
In addition to NC Warn’s letter, over 50 nonprofits have signed a statement opposing Duke’s proposal. A statewide TV-online ad campaign is also st to run; phase one will last four weeks and is intended to build public pressure.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/30/pvel-teams-up-with-drone-inspection-specialist-to-provide-aerial-inspection-as-a-service/,"MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 30, 2022",PVEL teams up with drone inspection specialist to provide aerial inspection as a service,"PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) and QE-Labs are teaming up to provide drone inspection services in the US solar market.
PVEL, known for its annual PV Reliability Scorecard, is an independent lab for the downstream solar and energy storage market. It has accumulated more than a decade of measured reliability and performance data for PV and storage equipment. QE Labs develops and commercializes aerial solar solutions for the PV industry to support its clients.
Together they will provide a drone inspection service that can scan solar installations using drone-based imaging in a fraction of the time required for ground-based imaging.  Using electroluminescent (EL) imaging, PVEL reports that this method can image up to 10,000 modules in a single night (in ideal conditions). This volume of imaging can create a comprehensive visual representation of the health of an entire array in days instead of weeks
EL imaging is an inspection method that can reveal defects and microcracks of solar cells inside a PV module. It is widely used as a tool for quality control in PV manufacturing. For years, PVEL has used a manual daytime EL tester to inspect more than 2GW of underperforming or damaged PV systems. Currently EL imaging is only conducted on a sampling basis due to the speed and cost limitations of manual inspection technologies. With the agreement with QE-Labs, PVEL will expand its field testing services to perform faster inspection of large-scale solar assets.
“We are impressed with QE-Labs’ technology, which completed the world’s largest EL inspection in Singapore with a much faster and more cost-effective solution than what is available in the market today.” said Jenya Meydbray, CEO of PVEL.
The new partnership will provide US project developers, asset owners and investors with a comprehensive testing service that will help ensure quality assurance and quality control of solar PV power plants across their 25-year lifecycle. Using EL imaging, drone inspections can identify damaged or underperforming modules for insurance or warranty claims, perform technical due diligence prior to business transactions, complete site-acceptance testing, and detect early failures before the defect liability period (DLP) ends, including excessive light induced degraded (LID) PV modules. The service can also be used for basic annual inspections of solar assets.
“With established success in our home market, we are ready to deploy our autonomous drone solution in more regional markets to support the growth of the global PV industry. This collaboration with PVEL is QE-Labs’ first step towards global expansion based on our drone-enabled Data-as-a-Service business model,” said Dr. WANG Yan, CEO of QE-Labs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/30/us-solar-manufacturers-request-tax-credits-in-letter-to-congress/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 30, 2022",US solar manufacturers request tax credits in letter to Congress,"A letter was sent to Congress, signed by over 100 companies throughout the US solar manufacturing supply chain, to request long-term solar manufacturing tax credits in the federal budget reconciliation bill. The letter said tax credits would grow supply chains, strengthen energy resiliency, and create manufacturing and production jobs.
The letter goes on to say the United States has the tools and natural resources to manufacture equipment that will help it achieve carbon reduction commitments made by the White House. The letter states, “From the minerals and raw materials to millions of tons of intermediate components like steel – as well as in manufacturing of final stage products throughout the energy supply chain, domestic production and manufacturing is poised to grow significantly with passage of these provisions.”
The letter was addressed to President Biden, Sen. Charles Schumer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Ron Wyden, and Rep. Richard Neal.
“Passage of the energy tax provisions would allow domestic production and manufacturing to advance U.S. leadership in the trillion-dollar global clean energy market. With these policies in place, we can invest in production and manufacturing in the United States. The provisions will not just grow existing producers, it will lead to repatriating manufacturing jobs and sectors, the restarting of idled facilities, and producers and factories filling orders and supplying equipment for power plants and energy production facilities nationwide.”
Trying again
Last December, the Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the Build Back Better infrastructure bill, which had up-front incentives for the domestic manufacturing of solar PV wafers, cells, modules, trackers, and inverters. The bill was then shut down by Sen. Joe Manchin, who pulled his must-have vote in face of unanimous opposition from Republicans.
Included in the bill were incentives for the manufacture of thin film PV or crystalline PV cells. The incentive would pay $0.04 per watt DC capacity of the cell. PV wafers would be offered $12 per square meter, and solar-grade polysilicon is offered $3 per kilogram U.S.-made solar modules are offered an incentive of $0.07 per watt.
Trackers were also incentivized in the bill. Structural fasteners would qualify for $2.28 per kilogram, longitudinal purlins $0.87 per kilogram, and structural fasteners $2.28 per kilogram.
Microinverters, with capacity of 650 W or less can receive $0.11 per watt, while other residential inverters with 20 kW capacity or less are offered $0.065 per watt. Commercial inverters that range between 20 kW and 170 kW would be eligible for an incentive of two cents per watt. Utility-scale inverters with capacity between 170 kW and 1 MW of capacity would be offered an upfront incentive of $0.015/W if BBB is passed, and central inverters greater than 1 MW in capacity would be eligible for an incentive of $0.025/W.
Last November, Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing is working its way through the legislature, too. Ossoff’s bill would offer tax credits for several steps along the PV supply chain, including for the domestic manufacture of modules, cells, and solar-grade polysilicon, as well as trackers and inverters. The incentives would be available through 2028 with a phase-down over the following two years. On November 19th the bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, and it next faces review by the Senate.

The manufacturer said the result was confirmed by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH).
“Longi’s R&D team has developed a p-type wafer processing solution for HJT cells and combined it with interface passivation technology to achieve an open-circuit voltage of 747.6mV for p-type HJT cells,” the manufacturer stated. “It should be noted that the processing of the low-cost p-HJT cell solution applied in this record has not yet been fully optimized and Longi is convinced that this technology route still has great potential for further development.”
Longi had achieved an efficiency of 25.19% for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July and, a month earlier, a 25.21% efficiency for an n-type TOPCon device. It has also reached a 26.3% efficiency for its n-type HJT cell.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/30/ferc-commissioner-phillipss-views-on-how-to-improve-transmission-interconnection/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 30, 2022","FERC Commissioner Phillips’s views on how to improve transmission, interconnection","With renewable generation expected to reach 35-50% by 2030, “there is a clear need for substantial transmission buildout to accommodate new generation,” said Commissioner Willie Phillips in a policy forum last week hosted by the American Council on Renewable Energy. Phillips is the most recently appointed commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Grid regions MISO and SPP had estimated that transmission projects along the “seam” between their regions could enable as much as 53GW of new low-cost generation, he said.
Across regions, because transmission needs are “going unaddressed” in the regional transmission planning process, interconnection studies for generators are increasingly identifying large and costly network upgrades. “Some argue,” he said, that because of the serial nature of many interconnection queues, the next generator in line “can get stuck with an expensive bill, while those in front or behind are able to get a free ride.”
“This has led to an epidemic of generators suffering from sticker shock and dropping out of the queue, triggering re-studies and shifting costs to the next generator. Wash, rinse, repeat. Because of this only around 20% of generators in the queue actually get interconnected in the end. This of course incentivizes developers to submit many different speculative proposals into the queue to increase their chances of being the lucky one to have lower costs.”
Yet many transmission providers, Phillips said, are moving in the “right direction” by transitioning from a first come, first served, serial approach to a “first ready, first served cluster approach.” FERC is “going around to every region,” he said. “We’re looking for best practices.”
“I think we need to start looking at what projects are actually ready to have shovels in the ground. And then we can incentivize properly, the developers and everyone in the system to make sure that those projects get selected, that those projects get built.” That would be his plan if he were “king for a day,” he said, to appreciative laughter.
On transmission, Phillips said he believes “strongly” that “we can use grid-enhancing technologies to squeeze more capacity out of our energy delivery system.” He believes these technologies will yield cost savings for consumers, and provide “a way to rapidly ramp up the capacity on a system.”
Noting that some transmission systems are 60 years old, he said that “reconductoring,” or replacing existing transmission lines with new wires that have greater capacity, “makes so much sense.” He also wanted to investigate dynamic line ratings, he said.
Phillips said that more distributed generation can especially benefit environmental justice communities, adding that it was “important” that transmission systems can accommodate new distributed resource systems such as microgrids.
Regarding cybersecurity, Phillips said he supports a FERC initiative to direct NERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, to develop new critical infrastructure protection standards that would require internal network security monitoring.
Commissioner Phillips previously served as the chairman of the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia. He noted that his views do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Commission or his fellow Commissioners.
