The law would allow ratepayers, including individuals, nonprofits, businesses, and governments to subscribe to a portion of a solar facility’s generating capacity in return for credits on their utility bills. 
The “Homegrown Solar Act” would cap eligible project sizes at 6 MW. Utility Georgia Power would credit a customer’s bill based on the utility’s total aggregate retail rate on a per-customer-class basis, less the commission-approved distribution cost components. It places protections on discriminatory fees for participating community solar customers. 
Community solar extends local, distributed solar access to a set of customers that may otherwise not be a good fit for rooftop solar. The Department of Energy said community solar customers can expect to see about 10% to 20% savings on utility bills. 
Georgia Power said in a hearing that it is “adamantly opposed” to the bill, calling it “a solution in search of a problem.” 
The utility cited the fact that Georgia is a top ten state in terms of solar installation capacity. However, Georgia ranks in the bottom ten for distributed solar like rooftop residential, commercial and industrial, and community solar.

These distributed forms of solar have been found to have benefits in reducing transmission needs, limiting land use, and increasing resilience to extreme weather events. They also provide customers with an alternative to purchasing power from an otherwise monopolized market. 
Georgia Power cited its opposition due to a “cost shift,” arguing that community solar customers would unjustly cause rates to rise for non-solar customers. However, national studies have shown that this “cost shift” is negligible at current levels of distributed solar deployment, and that there may even be system cost benefits to non-solar customers. 
Plus, if Georgia Power can prove there is a cost shift created by the program, there is language in the bill that allows the utility to assess a fee. 
Georgia Power issued warnings in January that it may reach an electricity capacity shortfall as soon as Winter 2025. Its response was a request for the operation of three new oil and gas projects totaling 1.4 GW, and to extend the life of operational coal plants in Mississippi. Instead, Georgia could follow a state like New York, which has quickly added 2 GW of community solar, with the market first ramping up in 2019.
However, it stands to reason that Georgia Power could more cost-effectively prevent a shortage by lifting its opposition to the community solar bill. Solar is also now the most cost-effective new generation source in most markets and most conditions in the United States. On average, new-build solar costs 29% less than the next-cheapest fossil fuel alternative. 
“We’re trying to help with the energy crisis, candidly,” said Steve Butler, Georgia Solar Energy Industries Association. “This is something our state could use right now and as quick as possible.” 
Bills are introduced in both the state Senate and House. The bills must clear one chamber by February 29 to have a clear path to the Governor’s desk for approval.

The Solar + Farms survey is looking for responses from those with experience in agrivoltaics and attitudes towards solar energy projects sited on farmland. All respondents will have the option to remain anonymous and no individual or company will be identified in the results.
Developed in partnership with the National Farmers Union (NFU), the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association (NRECA), and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), this initiative will examine the sentiments surrounding the development of agrivoltaics projects from various perspectives. 
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) said that there is nearly 6 GW of agrivoltaic generation capacity operating in the United States, ranging from solar panels on grazing pasture to crop fields, and that number will likely rise sharply as the potential for agrivoltaics is understood.
The organizers will randomly select 25 respondents who will receive a $100 Visa Gift Card once the survey closes. 
Take the survey here.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/21/tax-credit-transferability-attracting-billions-to-grid-scale-solar-and-batteries/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-21,Tax credit transferability attracting billions to grid-scale solar and batteries,"U.S. utility-scale solar had a record installation year in 2023 and is forecast to nearly double its record year in 2024. Solar and batteries are dominating the project queues. Solar represents 58% of expected capacity additions in 2024, and batteries take second place with 23% of the mix. This represents a record 36.4 GW of solar (up from 18.4 GW in 2023) and 14.3 GW of battery energy storage.
To build all this capacity, projects need financing, often well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Recent transactions this month illustrate how the new tax credit rules in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 are beginning to ramp up utility-scale deployment momentum.
Historically, many projects are financed by tax equity deals. This was the case for Strata Clean Energy, which recently received $559 million in financing for a 1 GWh battery energy storage project in Arizona.
The 255 MW / 1,020 MWh Scatter Wash battery storage project is expected to be operational by April 2025. It is expected to store enough electricity to power 50,000 Arizona homes during peak summer demand.
J.P. Morgan led as a lead arranger, administrative, depository and collateral agent, and Nomura served alongside as lead arranger and joint bookrunner. The financing was further supported by U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance and CoBank and The Korea Development Bank and Norddeutsche Landesbank as joint lead arrangers. U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance served as primary tax equity investor.
However, projects are now increasingly turning to a new source of funding made possible by IRA: the tax credit transfer market. Under the transferability rule, entities can sell their tax credits to a third party.
American Clean Power (ACP) estimates the new IRA-created transfer market will supplement traditional tax equity and attract an additional $10 billion in 2024.
“While the IRA provides new tax credit monetization options through transferable tax credits and direct pay, tax equity is expected to remain the most common and preferred option for project sponsors because it monetizes both the tax credits and other tax benefits, such as tax depreciation,” said ACP.
“The IRA creates an attractive alternative to tax equity by allowing these credits to be bought and sold for cash,” said law firm Clifton Larson and Allen (CLA). “Companies hungry for tax savings may now choose to tap into a burgeoning tax credit marketplace rather than work with a sponsor to fund a long-term renewables deal.”
CLA said transferability is a powerful planning tool to explore for companies looking for tax savings without a long-term commitment to a project sponsor.
Two recent large-scale projects in the U.S. have secured financing via the transferability mechanism.
Lightsource bp secured $348 million in financing for two utility-scale projects in Texas. The projects will add 288 MW of capacity to the ERCOT grid, generating enough electricity for about 50,000 homes. Both are scheduled to come online in 2024.
Arevon Energy announced a successful close of $350 million from Blackstone Credit and Insurance. The funds will support a 200 MW / 800 MWh battery project in Grand Terrace, California that is slated to reach commercial operations in Q2 2024. It is comprised of Tesla Megapack 2 XL, and Tesla has been contracted to provide operations and maintenance for the project.
Blackstone’s preferred equity investment in the project was simplified to eliminate the need for traditional tax equity financing. The financing includes a commitment from Stifel Financial Corp. to buy investment tax credits and is supported with a $164 million debt facility which was secured with Coordinating Lead Arrangers Cobank ACB, Helaba, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.
“Condor represents not only our commitment to developing assets that deliver grid resilience but also our team’s adeptness in navigating complex, hybrid financing arrangements. Along with our partners, we remain focused on pioneering climate finance solutions that promote a sustainable clean energy future,” said Daniel Murphy, director of project finance, Arevon.

This is an increase of 11 GW from its output in 2023.
GameChange Solar confirmed that U.S.-produced content of its solar trackers will be 70% as a standard for its customers, with over 85% available upon request.
Since 2012, the company has had a network of over 30 manufacturing locations across 16 states including Michigan, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky, where it produces torque tubes, posts, controllers, module mounting equipment such as purlins and SpeedClamps, bearings, stamped parts, and other tracker components.
Last year GameChange launched the 1P-2Row Genius Tracker, which it said cuts costs and speeds installation by having one controller manage two rows. The 1P-2Row Genius Tracker comes standard with preassembled components including the elimination of all washers.
In 2022 the company announced the MaxDensity system, which is a fixed-tilt racking system for ground-mounted projects. It has a 5-degree or 10-degree east-west landscape configuration. The system is designed to maximize the number of modules packed onto a site, with a ground coverage ratio of up to 98%. The company reports that it can be installed in blocks of up to 7 MW, in configurations of up to 12,000 modules.
To date the company reports it has delivered over 26 GW of solar tracker and fixed tilt systems. For example, Catalyze, a national independent power producer, completed two solar projects in Lancaster, New York that use GameChange trackers. The installations, one of which is a community solar project, sit on a 197-acre decommissioned landfill in Erie County, New York.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/21/sustainable-module-prices-unlikely-to-fall-further/,"COST AND PRICES,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-21,‘Sustainable’ module prices unlikely to fall further,"From pv magazine Global
With a global PV oversupply cycle in full swing and price declines of more than 40% having rocked the market in 2023, it appears likely that significant reductions should not be expected to continue this year. Solar manufacturing advisory Exawatt reported that while inventory levels remain high, further cost reductions would likely represent manufacturers selling below cost.
Exawatt presented some of its price and cost analysis in a webinar last week. During the event, the head of PV for Exawatt, Alex Barrows, said that there remains little scope for significant cost reductions from solar module manufacturers in the near term.
 
“Our fundamental cost modelling allows us to look at where ‘sustainable pricing’ can go. In the near term it looks like spot prices have largely stabilized. Potential oversupply could push prices down even further, but ‘sustainable’ cost reductions in the medium term look fairly difficult,” said Barrows.
The Exawatt analyst noted that with materials and consumables comprising approximately 80% of PV module production cost, there is little room for further cost reduction in the short term. As such, prices will have to stabilize if manufacturers are to avoid selling at a loss.

Barrows observed that prices for polysilicon, the primary raw material in crystalline silicon module production, are relatively close to the cost of production at present. He said with prices at USD7.5kg for the polysilicon used for p-type ingot and wafer production and USD9 for poly used for n-type – and production costs averaging USD6.5/kg, there is little headroom for further declines.
“There’s a little bit of room for further cost reductions but not much,” said Barrows.
Rami Fedda, the co-founder of wholesaler of Solar Juice, noted that polysilicon prices have turned a corner – after a period of massive declines. Fedda said that poly prices had increased “for the first time in many months. This is usually the first sign of where panel prices are heading.”
Fedda made the call in Solar Juice’s first video news update for the year, posted today, in which he predicted module prices would stabilize in the second quarter of 2024. He added that the annual production shutdown in China over the Lunar New Year of two weeks, might be extended to three to four weeks, given the oversupply market dynamic.
While module buyers very well may welcome cheaper modules being available, Exawatt’s Barrows warned that distressed manufacturers may sacrifice quality in an attempt to cut costs.
“If you’re a module buyer, one of the key things to look out for is that module suppliers will be at risk of exiting the market this year. And they will be under a lot of pressure to cut costs by reducing the quality of materials they are using – backsheets, encapsulants, junction boxes.
“Low cost [could mean] potentially lower quality options,” Barrows warned.
The Exawatt team hosted the webinar last week to promote its subscriber Solar Technology and Cost Service, that it delivers along with quality assurance providers PVEL. Exawatt was acquired by commodity business intelligence provider CRU in April 2023.

The capital will go toward completing the construction of Ascend Elements’ Apex 1 cathode precursor (pCam) manufacturing plant in Hopkinsville, Ky., . The facility is expected to begin operation at the end of 2025 and will produce repurposed pCam and cathode active materials (CAM) for up to 750,000 EVs annually. 
The majority of global pCam and CAM are produced in China from finite, mined metals. However, Ascend Elements reports that it generates these materials from black mass, a dark, powdery mixture of metals, including lithium, cobalt and nickel. 
Ascend Elements patented the hydro-to-cathode direct precursor synthesis process leeches out impurities from a spent battery and keeps the valuable metals in a solution, as opposed to procuring the necessary metals out of a spent battery. Ascend Elements’ says its method reduces costs associated with pCam and CAM recovery by 50% and greenhouse gas emissions by 90%.

A study published in ScienceDirect, found that battery cells with recycled anode and cathode materials had the best lifecycle result, enabling 4,200 and 11,6000 cycles at 80% and 70% capacity retention, respectively. Researchers report that the durability and performance of battery cells with recycled anode and cathode materials perform 33% and 53% better than cells made from state-of-the-art commercial anode and cathode matter. 
“Ascend Elements’ Hydro-to-Cathode technology provides a sustainable option for production of critical battery materials, championing circularity in an industry that is poised to scale significantly,” said Aruna Ramsamy, a managing director at Just Climate. 
Ascent Elements says it can also deliver intermediate commodity metals for producing battery materials or use in other applications through its lithium-ion battery recycling process. They include cobalt sulfate, manganese sulfate, nickel sulfate, and lithium carbonate. 
“With its first pCAM facility in construction in the United States, Ascend Elements has the potential to unlock the supply of critical battery materials to accelerate the roll out of electric vehicles,” said Ramsamy. 
Climate change solution investor Just Climate, venture capital firm Clearvision Ventures and global investment firm IRONGREY are the primary financiers. 
The $162 million adds to the $542 million Ascend Elements raised last year, receiving equity investments from Decarbonization Partners, a venture capital and growth equity platform launched by BlackRock and Temasek that supports proven decarbonization technologies. The Qatar Investment Authority also provided funds and the Department of Energy provided two grants totaling $480 million. 
“This diverse group of leading climate investors and industry partners underscores the confidence that the market has placed in our business,” said Mike O’Kronley, CEO of Ascent Elements.

Heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVACR) and water heating products provider Rheem recently launched a new heat pump for residential applications.
“The RD17AZ is ideal for when installation locations are constrained,” the manufacturer said. “But is also perfect for any system or replacement option where an efficient, streamlined look is desired.”
The heat pump uses R-410a as a refrigerant and has a size ranging from 2 tons to 5 tons. The heat pump’s number of tons doesn’t refer to its weight but to the tons of heat a home needs.
The new product measures 1,020 mm x 92 mm x 42 mm. It has reportedly a seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER2) of up to 19 and a heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF2) of up to 8.5. It features a rated power of 7.0 kW to 17.6 kW and a cooling capacity spanning from 6.7 kW to 15.5 kW.
The manufacturer also said the heat pump uses a 7 mm condenser coil that reduces refrigerant requirements up to 15%. Sound levels are indicated at 58 dB. “Inverter driven, variable speed, twin rotary compressor technology features fully variable cooling and heating operation between 45% to 100% of capacity,” it further explained.
The system also relies on built-in Bluetooth connectivity through which users can receive alerts on their smartphones with the EcoNet app developed by Rheem itself.
“RD17AZ was rated as 2024’s most efficient, even in cold climates, and works with nearly any HVAC system option or as a universal replacement with minimal alterations required,” the company said.
