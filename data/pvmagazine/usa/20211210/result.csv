The tax credit agreement sets minimum employment and wage requirements for the company, all milestones that must be met for a minimum of three years:
Infinity Energy Inc is currently a solar panel installation company located in Rocklin, California. They also install roofing, and work with residential building contractors on new construction. pv magazine USA has reached out to Infinity Energy seeking additional information about their proposed hardware.
 

 
Several other clean energy companies were given tax credits in Califrnia’s GoBiz program, as well. EnerVenue received a $25 million credit to create at least 1,692 full-time jobs, developing and manufacturing super high-capacity nickel hydrogen batteries. 
VinFast received a $20 million credit to establish its United States headquarters in California. The Vietnamese electric SUV manufacturer says it will make over $200 million in capital investments while creating at least 1065 new full-time jobs.

Last week, New York City announced that new ARC solar-powered EV charging systems had been installed, bringing their total to 89 units. The station is projected to deliver up to 265 electric miles in a day, and can distribute power to as many as six electric vehicles at once.
In September, the State of California awarded WattEV a $5 million grant to support the buildout of a 12 electric truck, 4 MW charging station in Bakersfield, California, to be powered by an onsite solar plus storage facility.
WattEV said it expects to break ground at the Bakersfield facility in October. The initial buildout will cost in excess of $10 million, and is expected to take two years to construct. It’s estimated that reaching the company’s goal of 40 charging stations will cost more than $30 million.
And for those who would prefer to take their solar panels along with them as they travel, several companies are already integrating solar directly into their yachts and road vehicles.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/10/construction-and-solar-industries-gain-from-collaboration-on-building-integrated-photovoltaics/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Construction and solar industries gain from collaboration on building-integrated photovoltaics,"Reaching consensus on what building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is and what makes it different from conventional rooftop PV is one of the challenges that the emerging BIPV industry has to deal with if it wants to move from niche to mainstream.
With this in mind, a group of experts from the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) put together a report that seeks to bring together piecemeal developments from different regions into a clear set of standards, and clearly defined functions for different products, in terms of their roles as both construction materials and energy generators.
The report is titled Categorization of BIPV applications; and is available on the IEA PVPS website. “By taking into account the main technical subsystems of the multifunctional building skin, the main features in terms of function, performance, morphological, structural and energy-related aspects are organized into five levels from application categories to materials,” state the report’s authors.
The five categories defined in the report stem from those outlined in the IEC standard 63092-1, Photovoltaics in buildings – Part 2: Requirements for building-integrated photovoltaic systems. The IEC’s categories define different types of BIPV system, based on area of integration and accessibility from the inside of the building. IEA PVPS further breaks these down into ‘system’ – representing the entire construction unit, ‘module’ for the active elements in energy and construction, ‘component’ for the parts making up these elements, and ‘material’ for the basic material.
At system level, the report notes three main types of BIPV system, classified as roof, façade and external integrated devices. They further break each of these down into subsections – ‘roof’ for example is split into discontinuous roofing, continuous roofing and atrium/skylight. The report’s module level category is then divided into three, based on the transparency of the element.
By clearly defining the different system elements in this way, the report hopes to bring together the interests of both PV system designers and architects – one of the key challenges to the development of BIPV. “We aspire that this paper will be able to provide a first milestone to encourage an integrated perspective and an interdisciplinary effort at the core of the BIPV field and that it will overcome some current obstacles that are still obstructing effective exchange of innovation and cooperation among all the stakeholders,” stated the authors.

Computer simulation has sped up this process, but modeling has been limited in its data granularity.
While prevailing computer models only show the power output of a given configuration, a new model co-developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Google can show how a change in each parameter changes the output. The findings were published in Computer Physics Communications.
“It tells you directly what happens to the efficiency if we make this layer a little bit thicker, or what happens to the efficiency if we, for example, change the property of the material,” said Giuseppe Romano, research scientist at MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies. “Our tool can identify a unique set of material parameters that has been hidden so far because it is very complex to run those simulations.”
The tool can simulate different layering and thickness, different doping levels on each layer, and help direct decision-making around these parameters. The research team said the tool is open-source and ready for improvements, including connecting it to optimization algorithms and machine-learning.
Currently, the simulator is a one-dimensional version of a solar cell, so the next step for the tool is the development of 2D and 3D models. Romano said the one-dimensional model can cover most cells under production, but tandem cells are not able to be simulated wholly by the tool and can only be approximated.
Romano said the research team is excited about the program now being open-source, as anyone in the field can build new capabilities.

Shaw Renewable Investments’ 80 MW Elektron Solar project achieves commercial operation.
The project is set to be constructed by D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments in Tooele County, just west of Salt Lake City, on land leased from the State of Utah’s School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration. Salt Lake City’s municipal government is one of three local governments and six total customers purchasing the electricity generated. The other customers include the Park City municipal government, the Summit County municipal government, Utah Valley University and two ski resorts: Deer Valley Resort and Park City Mountain.
The project was originally developed and permitted by ERE, a joint venture among affiliates of Enyo and MAP Energy. The project is expected to support 100 full-time jobs throughout the course of construction. Construction began on the project in October, and it has not yet been specified when in 2023 it will commence operation.
Elektron Solar was selected through a Rocky Mountain Power request for proposals, organized by the six customers previously listed. This process was initiated under Utah’s Schedule 34 Renewable Energy Tariff, which allows large Rocky Mountain Power customers to work through the utility to source renewable energy to meet each organizations’ clean energy goals and power needs.
The state of Utah is no stranger to large utility-scale solar development, as the Solar Energy Industries Association outlines that the majority of the state’s nearly 2.5 GW of installed solar to date have come from such installations.
In October 2020, the Utah Public Service Commission made a decision on the value of the rooftop solar in the state, lowering the net metering export rate from the average of 9.2¢/kWh, instead to summer and winter rates of 5.969 cents/kWh  and 5.639 cents/kWh respectively. This decision seems to have stalled the state’s already niche rooftop solar industry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/10/in-underserved-communities-solar-referrals-work-best/,"MARKETING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 10, 2021","In underserved communities, solar referrals work best","Customer acquisition costs have been rising in the residential solar industry, as the customer profile shifts from early adopters, technophiles, and pragmatists to a larger inclusion of the general population. Take GRID Alternatives of California, for example, which spends about $1,200 per install on customer acquisition alone.
One area that solar adoption has lagged is in low- to moderate-income (LMI) families, or those that are defined as earning less than 80% of the median family income for the area. Program disqualification due to a complex set of eligibility requirements is one of the main causes of these families losing interest in looking into solar, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). However, NREL discovered that many qualified customers are losing interest, as well.
NREL, along with the Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), partnered with California’s GRID Alternatives to break down what happens to how solar leads get “lost.”
With an aggregation of multiple datasets of solar the solar lead lifecycle in California through 2018, NREL was able to analyze the outcome of different marketing strategies.
It found that referrals are pivotal to adoption. Not only was a referred customer more likely to install solar, they were also more likely to refer more connections in their own networks.
Based on the results, NREL recommended that state solar programs be designed with referral mechanisms, saving time and resources on converting prospective solar adopters. It also recommended a loosening of qualification requirements so that more households may be eligible. 
NREL plans to discuss strategies from scaling up solar in LMI communities in a webinar on December 22nd.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/10/standard-solar-completes-3-3-mw-solar-project-for-virginia-schools/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Standard Solar completes 3.3 MW solar project for Virginia schools,"Isle of Wight County Schools in Virginia are expected to save on energy costs over the next 20 years through the recently completed 3.3 MW solar project, which is designed to offset nearly 50% of the total electricity needs of seven of its schools. Standard Solar, Inc. owns and operates the systems and provided engineering, design expertise and construction oversight.
The system is installed on the rooftops of six of the county’s schools. The combined arrays are projected to produce an estimated 4,252 MWh of clean energy each year, offsetting carbon emissions of 7.6 million miles driven by an average car. The installation is on both standing seam and flat rooftops using Seraphim Energy modules and SolarEdge inverters.
“This project does more than help the environment; it saves the school system money so they can focus on providing a more outstanding educational experience for their students,” said John Finnerty, Director of Business Development, Standard Solar. “We’re proud to have put our solar project development and funding expertise and our deep knowledge of helping education institutions utilize renewables without utilizing capital budgets to work for Isle of Wight County Schools.”
Not only will the solar installation save the school system money, but it provides visible sustainability and energy management messages to students, parents, staff and visitors.
This project portfolio was made possible due to the Virginia Clean Economy Act. Superintendent Dr. Jim Thornton sees the project as “a shining example of the potential of the Virginia Clean Economy Act at work, making solar accessible and affordable for schools throughout Dominion Energy’s territory.”
According to a report by Generation180, 89 Virginia schools had installed solar as of the close of 2019. That number tripled between 2017 and 2019 and moves Isle of Wight County Schools to the front of the class.

The exported panels will be manufactured at the company’s factory in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which currently has an annual production capacity of 110 MW, though the company has not yet stated if it intends to increase production capacity alongside this specific expansion.
Generally, Desert Technologies plans to bring 1 GW of cell and module capacity online by the end of 2023, and to expand this to 3 GW by 2026, depending on market growth in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. Though the company had previously planned to reach 500 MW of capacity by the end of 2020, that goals was was pushed back by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Desert Technologies CEO Nabih Cherradi still sees 1 GW by 2023 as an achievable target.
To date, Desert Technologies’ solar panels has been installed at 42 projects in 2022 countries, with most of those projects being located in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Those 42 projects comprise 200 MW of installed capacity.
According to the announcement, this American expansion is part of a larger strategy to expand geographically and “achieve tangible improvements in exports.”
