Both storage systems will use Powin’s 100MW/200 MWh, two-hour dispatch Centipede modular battery systems and StackOS battery management software system.
Angelo Solar (195 MW) and Storage (200 MWh) is a grid scale renewable energy facility under development in Tom Green County, Texas.
In January, Apex announced an environmental attribute purchase agreement (EAPA) with Meta (Facebook) for the full capacity of the Angelo Solar facility, which is expected to generate more than $24 million in tax revenue for the local community and $22 million in landowner payments.
Under an EAPA, a corporate offtake counterparty can purchase the renewable energy credits (RECs) of a power purchase agreement (PPA) project asset.
Both the solar-plus-storage project and the standalone Great Kiskadee Storage project (100 MW|200 MWh) in Hidalgo County, Texas will provide energy arbitrage and ancillary grid services to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)  market, critical for maintaining grid reliability.
Energy arbitrage involves purchasing more electricity during off-peak periods and storing that electricity and discharging it during peak periods. Ancillary grid services are functions that help grid operators maintain a reliable electricity system. Ancillary services maintain the proper flow and direction of electricity, address imbalances between supply and demand, and help the system recover after a power system event.
The Angelo and Great Kiskadee storage projects are expected to begin commercial operations in late 2023 and 2024. Permitting for Great Kiskadee Storage was filed in December 2020.
The storage systems will store excess solar or wind generation when daily demand is low and discharge when energy usage is high, ensuring adequate power supply while allowing the grid to operate efficiently and flexibly.
“Texas already leads the nation in operating wind and solar capacity; adding battery storage will support ERCOT with grid reliability, encouraging additional renewable development in the Lone Star State,” said Mark Goodwin, president and CEO of Apex. “Battery storage is a crucial component of our nation’s energy transition, and Apex is investing accordingly, with 11.6 GW of utility-scale storage in our development portfolio.”
“With visibility and control down to the battery cell level, our platform can respond to changing grid conditions in real-time,” said Geoff Brown, chief executive officer of Powin. “As these new storage projects are deployed, ERCOT customers in the region will have the assurance of a climate-resilient grid backed by Powin’s technology.”
Lone Star resistance
Recently, the Texas senate voted 21-9 in favor of SB 624, a bill that would place significant permitting restrictions and fines on solar and wind energy projects. A companion bill now heads to its House for approval.
(Read: “Texas Senate approves tight permit restrictions on solar and wind”)
Currently, Texas is the largest wind energy producer in the U.S. and is close to taking over as the number one state for solar, leapfrogging California. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) expects the state to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, building on the 16 GW that is active to date.
SB 624 singles out solar and wind facilities, requiring them to obtain a permit from the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of Texas, while leaving out fossil fuels from the requirement. Governor Greg Abbott, who has long shown an affinity for fossil fuels, has appointed all the PUC members, who now would act as gatekeepers for any renewable energy project.
Additionally, SB 624 assigns a new yearly fee to be paid by renewable energy developers. It would also require developers to pull a permit any time significant changes need to be made to existing projects. Under the law, each new project would be required to undergo a new environmental impact study.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/09/scientists-warn-of-heat-induced-failure-risks-in-hjt-glass-backsheet-pv-modules/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 9, 2023",Scientists warn of heat-induced failure risks in HJT glass-backsheet PV modules,"From pv magazine global
A research team from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has investigated failure modes in heterojunction (HJT) solar modules with glass-backsheet configurations.
“We have identified four failure modes in the silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet module which has the potential to result in a power loss of up to 50% following damp heat testing,” researcher Chandany Sen told pv magazine. “We sought to understand the possible underlying causes of each failure mode and how to quickly detect them at the cell level.”
The scientists conducted their experiment on bifacial half-cut n-type silicon HJT solar cells sourced from industrial production lines of unidentified manufacturers. The products were divided into three groups: modules with encapsulated cells; modules with encapsulated cell precursors; and non-encapsulated cells. For the first two groups, the researchers used ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant.
“All samples featured an n-type wafer, intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) passivation layers on both sides, and phosphorus-doped (n-a-Si:H) and boron-doped (p-a-Si:H) hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers on the front and rear sides, respectively, followed by indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) layer deposited on both sides,” they said.
All devices underwent a damp heat test at 85°C and 85% relative humidity (RH) for durations between 500 hours and 4000 hours.
Through this testing, the academics identified four failure modes for the encapsulated cells, resulting in power losses ranging from 5% to 50%. The first failure type consisted of cell darkening in localized points, and the second was represented by darkening around the interconnection of busbars and ribbon wires. The third failure mode involved intense darkening between the interconnected regions of busbars and ribbon wires, while the fourth showed darkening on the interconnected region of busbars and ribbon wires.
According to the group’s analysis, the first failure type was attributable to surface contamination, which may have occurred during handling or characterization before module encapsulation. As for the second and third groups, the scientists attributed the failures to the involvement of soldering flux.
“The direct impact of flux and lead (Pb) solder in causing contact degradation after DH testing was also observed in other work,” they said. “It is essential to highlight that, in some cases, the usage of a different Ag paste also resulted in a Type-3 failure.”
For the fourth group, the researchers indicated that the failures likely originated from the byproduct of EVA used for encapsulation.
“Although the experimental design in this work cannot determine exactly how each failure mode occurred after DH testing, it demonstrates plausible situations that could happen in the industry environment and lead to the actual failure modes observed,” they concluded.
Sen said that comprehending and mitigating these failure modes, preferably at the solar cell level, will be crucial to realizing the low-levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) potential of HJT. She said that while glass-glass modules are frequently employed for HJT solar cells due to their reduced susceptibility to moisture ingress, similar failure modes are likely to occur in these modules over more extended periods.
The research team presented its findings in the study “Four failure modes in silicon heterojunction glass-backsheet modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

The nationwide solar industry survey was comprised of nearly 500 participants, of which 62% were from residential and small commercial installation businesses, 6% were commercial installers, 6% were operations and maintenance companies, 4.5% electricians, 4% utility-scale installers, and 17.4% listed as other participants. 
Increased electricity prices were listed as the top reason customers are looking for solar, as 66% of respondents said prices are driving demand. Additionally, 62% of respondents said the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to improve their business.
Notably, 61% of respondents said pv magazine is their top solar industry news source. This makes pv magazine the number one trade publication, followed by Solar Power World (53%), state-level trade industry groups (40%) and Solar Builder (19%).
Additionally, 63% of respondents listed solar industry conferences as their most trusted source of news, many of which cited pv magazine as featured media partner. Meet this author at the upcoming RE+ Southeast event in Atlanta, and the CleanPower conference in New Orleans.
Respondents said top panel brands they procure include Qcells (66%), REC (41%), Canadian Solar (30%), Silfab Solar (25%) and JinkoSolar (20%).
The top inverter brands include Enphase Energy (74%) SolarEdge Technologies (60%), Sol-Ark (24%), SMA (23%), Fronius (14%) and Generac (13%).
Enphase was also the top pick for energy storage systems (58%), followed by Tesla, SolarEdge, Generac, and LG Chem, all hovering around 25% of respondents.
“Enphase post-install customer service is the best. Panel brands are mostly dictated by availability from our distributor,” said Ellen Castle, a survey respondent from A1A Solar Contracting.
Installers are split on how much growth they expect in 2023. About 37% said they expect to sell slightly more solar, while 36% expect much more. About 16% of installers said they expect to sell the same amount of solar in 2023 as 2022, while 11% expect a dip in sales.
Installers continue to alter their offerings as demand for new technologies emerges. About 15% of installed systems were oversized to meet the future demands of an electric vehicle charging at home. Over 80% of residential installers said they now offer battery energy storage, while 67% said they offer EV charging ports. About 40% of residential installers said they offer electrician services, and 28% of installers also perform roofing work.
Respondents said 21% of solar jobs included energy storage, while California, Florida, and Texas have battery attachment rates closer to 30%. Increased electricity prices, more frequent power outages, and shifting net metering policy are expected to drive up battery adoption further.
In the finance category, the largest group of customers are opting for solar-specific loans (44%), followed closely by cash purchases (42%), and power purchase agreements or leases (10%). Mosaic was listed as the top loan platform (20%), followed by Sunlight Financial (17%) and Goodleap (12%).
When asked about the biggest barriers to success, participants listed the high cost of financing as the greatest concern (42%), followed by customer acquisition (42%), difficulty hiring enough employees (38%), inflation (33%), and permitting and interconnection rules and cost (31%).
Respondents say the effects of inflation are leading to increased operational costs (70%), higher prices leading to solar demand (66%), and higher wages for workers (63%).
As solar businesses struggle to find employees, respondents listed finding trained installers as the greatest skill in need (71%). This was followed by trained electricians (67%) and construction workers (51%).
Respondents reported that 11% of their employees were NABCEP-certified. Interestingly, 42% of installers said they require installation workers to obtain Continuing Education Units (CEUs) each year, and 74% said they cover the costs of CEUs.
When asked about ongoing supply chain issues, respondents were split. About 34% of respondents said they experienced better supply chain conditions in 2022 than 2021, while 26% said it was about the same, and 41% said component supply issues are worse than the previous year. As international goods were in short supply, 42% of respondents said they turned to sourcing domestically produced solar components.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/09/federal-agents-raid-jinkosolar-factory-in-florida/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 9, 2023",Federal agents raid JinkoSolar factory in Florida,"A solar panel manufacturing facility run by major provider JinkoSolar is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, according to local news outlets. 
Agents from Homeland Security, the FBI, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol entered the Jacksonville, Fla. Facility after executing a search warrant. Employees were sent home, and agents from the three agencies were seen on-scene at the facility. 
“That’s part of an ongoing federal investigation,” said Homeland Security spokesman Mike Meares. 
The 400 MW, 283,652 square-foot production facility reached operations in 2018, employing 270 people. The site expected to nearly double its capacity following a recently announced $52 million private investment and a $2.3 million economic development grant from the city of Jacksonville.
JinkoSolar offered this statement to pv magazine:
“JinkoSolar is committed to operating in accordance with the highest ethical standards and adhering to the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates, including the United States. Jinko, through external counsel, is engaging constructively with relevant agencies to understand the nature of the inquiry, and the company’s business operations are running normally, including in Jacksonville.”
As a solar component supplier based in China, JinkoSolar and its competitors have faced pressure from U.S. enforcement of trade law. Goods shipped from the Xinjiang province in China are subject to enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which requires documentation to show the components have no connection to forced labor. Other major suppliers, including Longi, Trina Solar, and Canadian solar have had components detained under UFLPA. 
Suppliers are also dealing with navigating the antidumping and countervailing (AD/CVD) investigation, which was launched as solar suppliers from China were alleged of dodging tariffs by circumventing them through Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia. JinkoSolar’s operations in Malaysia were found to not be in violation of AD/CVD laws. 
Goods found in violation of antidumping laws can be retroactively assessed with 50% to 250% tariffs. This looming threat of tariffs has been damaging to the U.S. solar component supply chain over the last year, slowing project installations. 
As a result, President Joe Biden placed a two-year pause on tariffs related to the AD/CVD case, and now the move is facing pressure. The U.S. Senate voted to lift the moratorium, reinstating tariffs, though President Biden has expressed he will veto the resolution. If the Senate can achieve a two-thirds majority, it can override Biden’s veto. 
A recent report by Solarbe ranked JinkoSolar as the largest solar panel supplier in the world. The company delivered 13 GW of panels in Q1 2023, 50% of which were the N-type Tiger Neo panel. The quarter represented a growth of 72.7% over the previous year’s Q1.

The project is expected to generate 203 GWh per year, or enough to power approximately 20,000 homes.
The Aspen Solar and Energy Storage project is sited within the traditional territory of the Nlaka’pamux and Syilx Nation peoples.
Aspen Solar has an agreement-in-principle with the Lower Nicola Indian Band, which will appoint a representative to be part of the Aspen Solar project team. Currently in the design stages, Aspen Solar will connect to an existing BC Hydro transmission line. The provincial utility company delivers electricity to 95% of the population of British Columbia and serves over five million people.
According to the initial plan developed by Canadian Solar, the project is compliant with the British Columbia Clean Energy Act, which states its goal “to generate at least 93% of the electricity in British Columbia from clean or renewable resources and to build the infrastructure necessary to transmit that electricity.”  The act also states that power development should create jobs and “foster the development of Indigenous nations and rural communities through the use and development of clean or renewable resources.” The government of British Columbia’s plan, called CleanBC, calls for reducing climate-changing emissions by 40% by 2030.
The current design for Aspen Solar calls for the installation of 620 Watt solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers. The modules will be connected in series to 4.2 MW (AC) inverter transformers. The project will include a battery energy storage system (BESS), which will store excess energy for use during peak evening, nighttime load hours, or for emergency use.
The planned BESS is intended to help the region cope during times when hydroelectric production is down due to recurring drought conditions. In addition, Canadian Solar pointed out in its preliminary plan that the time when the solar resource is the greatest is complementary to the winter seasonal peaking profiles of hydro and wind power, providing energy security and resilience to the region.
The initial project plan was approved by the BC Environmental Assessment Office on May 2. A 30-day public comment period must be held within 90 days of the approval.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/09/silicon-ranch-plans-to-appeal-ruling-in-100-mw-solar-property-damage-case/,"INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GEORGIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 9, 2023",Silicon Ranch plans to appeal ruling in 100 MW solar property damage case,"A Georgia jury has awarded Shaun and Amie Harris $135.5 million in damages to their property in Stewart County, Georgia, reportedly created from silt and sediment erosion from a 100 MW utility-scale solar project constructed by developer Silicon Ranch, engineering contractor Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives (IEA) and an IEA affiliate.
U.S. District Court Judge Clay D. Land issued a May 5 order ruling that Nashville-based Silicon Ranch and IEA are liable for damages.
According to the lawsuit, Silicon Ranch has developed more than 160 solar facilities across the country, many of which were built by IEA. At Lumpkin Solar, IEA cleared and mass-graded about 1,000 acres of timberland, farmland and land near the Harris property, which had previously been used for recreational hunting and fishing. The solar developers had not taken adequate measures for erosion and sediment control, according to press release from the plaintiffs’ counsel James E. Butler, Jr., of Butler Prather LLP.
The companies “created, operated and maintained a nuisance … that caused sedimentation to pollute plaintiffs’ wetlands, streams and lake. The court further finds that this nuisance has continued for approximately two years unabated,” Judge Land said in the court order.
In a statement to pv magazine USA, a Silicon Ranch spokeswoman said, “as the long-term owner of this facility, Silicon Ranch remains committed to the continued success of Stewart County and the surrounding region. While we sincerely regret the unintentional damage to our neighbor’s property, Silicon Ranch does not believe the verdict in this trial is supported by the facts in this case.We plan to appeal.”
Silicon Ranch hired IEA to design and construct the Lumpkin solar facility through its subsidiary, IEA Constructors. IEA’s scope of work included the installation of solar modules and the full balance of system EPC construction, including all civil, mechanical and electrical work.
“We relied on our contractor to carry out this scope of work in compliance with applicable law and in keeping with industry best management practices, as specified by the appropriate regulatory bodies in the state of Georgia,” Silicon Ranch said.
Lumpkin Solar is a 100 MW utility solar project located on 850 acres in Stewart County, Georgia. The facility entered commercial operation in December 2021 in partnership with electric cooperative Walton Electric Membership Corporation and IEA. Meta was the offtake counterparty for the solar project.
H&L Farms LLC, on behalf of Shaun and Amie Harris, filed a lawsuit against Silicon Ranch and IEA on August 6, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.
The jury panel returned a verdict of $10.5 million in damages. It found that Silicon Ranch, IEA and an IEA subsidiary, IEA Constructors, LLC, acted with specific intent to harm. The jury administered $25 million in punitive damages to Silicon Ranch, and $50 million in punitive damages to IEA and its affiliated company, respectively.
According to court filings, H&L Farms purchased a 1,630 acre property from Kawikee Refuge, LLC on March 16, 2021. The Harris’ home is adjacent to the 100 MW solar site.
Cozen O’Connor represented Silicon Ranch in the lawsuit, while Drew Eckl & Farnham represented IEA.
Following publication, Infrastructure & Energy Alternatives responded with comment on the Lumpkin Solar lawsuit. “These are important legal issues that we will address with the court at the proper time, and we look forward to the opportunity to do so,” an IEA spokeswoman told pv magazine USA.
