The Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California is LEED certified and has a 2.4MW rooftop solar system that was completed in 2014 at a cost of $5.7 million. The system was installed by Borrego Solar and is owned and managed by the Anaheim Public Utilities. At the time of the installation, it was the largest city-owned, convention center, roof-mounted system in North America. It currently provides about 17% of the convention center’s energy, and when not being used by the center, the electricity is goes to nearby neighbors.
According to Mark Brownrigg, Solar Advantage Rebate Program Manager with Anaheim Public Utilities, the main incentive to construct this system was to add to the utilities’ renewable portfolio standard. Senate Bill X1-2, which was enacted into law in April 2011, required that Anaheim Public Utilities provide 33% of retail energy needs with renewable energy sources by 2020.  Brownrigg said that this solar PV system contributes 1.5% toward this goal.
The Anaheim Convention Center has about 550,000 square feet of available rooftop on four exhibit halls. Solar is now covering about 300,000 square feet on three halls, or about 55%. The expansive roofs offer Anaheim Public Utilities a great opportunity to fulfil some of the state-mandated Renewable Portfolio Standard goals now, with expansion potential in the future. Brownrigg said that the utility is “researching the feasibility of building more distributed generation facilities in our utility district, which may include expansion of the solar PV system located at the Anaheim Convention Center sometime in the future.”

Borrego Solar was able to complete the installation in the four months they had budgeted for the project. The greatest challenge was the fact that the convention center has a full schedule of trade shows, so Borrego’s project management team had regular meetings with convention center staff to coordinate the work around events taking place in the exhibit halls. Managing a crew of up to 60 at a time was no small task, but with regular communications and flexibility, they kept from interfering with the operations of the convention center, while staying on task and completing on time.
In its first year of operation, the installation generated 2.52 GW of energy, or 17% of the Convention Center’s energy needs.
The installation uses Sunlink Core RMS racking for the nearly 8000 Yingli solar panels (300W). Two Advanced Energy 500NX inverters provide the power electronics.
The Anaheim Convention Center is a model of sustainability, not only for its rooftop solar, but because it has implemented a range of initiatives including an on-site recycling program, farm to fork culinary program, an on-site composting facility and a rooftop garden.
A kiosk with monitoring information is on display in the lobby of the convention center, letting convention center visitors view graphical representations of the amount of energy being generated by the rooftop installation.  In terms of the environmental benefits, the annual carbon dioxide offset is 4.9 million pounds, and the amount of clean energy generated is equivalent to removing 526 passenger vehicles from the road or planting 2050 acres of trees annually. The system is expected to generate 108.3 million kWh through 30 years of production.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/19/the-rise-of-made-in-usa-solar/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2022",A new era of made-in-USA solar,"In February 2021, US President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order calling for the establishment of resilient American supply chains intended to, in part, advance the fight against climate change. To achieve the current goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, the US Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that solar energy would need to grow from 4% of electricity supply today to 40%.
This kind of growth will increase the demand for everything along the solar supply chain, from polysilicon through to modules. With both goals in parallel, the desire to foster a domestic supply chain and the necessity to ramp up renewables, the question begs: to what extent can the domestic US solar supply chain be expanded to meet clean energy goals?
China’s dominance
The solar supply chain has long been reliant on products from China, or from Chinese subsidiaries in Southeast Asia. As of 2021, China was responsible for manufacturing a dominant share of the solar supply chain, according to statistics from the US Department of Energy.
As a manufacturer, China has a mixed reputation in terms of its environmental and social credentials, as much of its electricity generation utilizes coal, and there have been credible accusations of human rights violations in a region where some solar manufacturing is located. Given this and various other trade disputes, the United States has also had an unpredictable and somewhat fraught trade relationship with China.
Securing a domestic supply chain to support the United States’ clean energy transition has become increasingly important since the start of the global energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the Sydney Energy Forum in July, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm cautioned against “relying too much on one entity for our source of fuel.”
Granholm described the transition to renewables as “the greatest peace plan of all” because countries cannot be “held hostage” over access to the sun or wind. “They have not ever been weaponized, nor will they be,” she said.
Polysilicon problem
The solar industry is experiencing a critical shortage in polysilicon and prices have hit highs not seen since 2011, due in part to a major manufacturer in Xinjiang closing unexpectedly for repairs. The Xinjiang region in western China is the origin of nearly 50% of the world’s supply of polysilicon, and it is currently under scrutiny for allegations of forced labor.
The United States has domestic polysilicon production capacity; however, as of 2021 it was not being used for solar applications – but that may be changing. In March 2022, Hanwha Solutions announced that it was increasing efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products.
Hanwha, the South Korean company that owns module maker Q Cells, launched this effort by becoming the largest shareholder REC Silicon, a major US-based manufacturer of polysilicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to take a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha is acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at approximately $44 million. This investment will help American manufacturers secure the raw material critical to the solar supply chain.
While developments in polysilicon production are promising, crystalline silicon ingot, wafer, and cell production in the United States remains nonexistent. However, the United States is home to a small but growing number of solar module manufacturers.
Q Cells and JinkoSolar, both with manufacturing operations in China, have established operations in the United States. With its headquarters in Switzerland and production in Germany, Meyer Burger announced in December 2021 its intention to set up a module assembly facility in Goodyear, Arizona. Mission Solar, and Solaria are also crystalline silicon PV manufacturers that originated and operate in the United States. And Silfab produces modules in Washington and Toronto, Canada.
Racking, tracking
Mounting structures are composed mostly of heavy steel components, and while the steel is relatively inexpensive, shipping costs can make up a significant portion of the finished product. Therefore, it is most cost effective to source products near to where they will be used. Most of the leading racking companies in the US marketplace manufacture exclusively in the U.S. including Unirac, PV Racking, ProSolar, Quick Mount PV, Oatey, DPW Solar, and Tamarack Solar. IronRidge manufactures, in part, in the United States.
The two largest tracker vendors, both globally and in the United States, are the US firms Nextracker and Array Technologies – collectively representing 70% of 2020 U.S. tracker shipments, and 46% of 2020 global tracker shipments. Based in San Jose, California, Nextracker was originally a U.S. company, but was acquired in 2015 by Singapore-based Flex.
Power electronics
Inverters and power electronics are an example of where the global supply chain comes into play, as many components are typically manufactured in separate locations around the world. According to the DOE’s “Solar Photovoltaic Supply Chain Deep Dive Assessment,” published in February 2022, most of the European and Chinese companies manufacture domestically, but many inverter manufacturers produce products abroad, particularly those that manufacture module level-power electronics (MLPE).
Among MLPE producers, SolarEdge, headquartered in Israel, has production facilities in Hungary, China, and Vietnam. The second leading MLPE producer, Enphase, is headquartered in the United States, and has production facilities in China and Mexico.
Interestingly, the inverter supply chain varies by inverter type, with U.S. utility-scale inverters largely supplied by European and Japanese companies, and residential inverters coming from U.S. and a large number of other foreign countries.
More American-made
A recent Wood Mackenzie report estimated that with supportive policies, an additional 20 GW of US manufacturing could be added. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was signed into law in August and is the most significant clean energy legislation in US history.
The IRA contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures, including over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes clean energy vehicles. The bill provides the support needed to achieve American manufacturing independence and clean energy security as we move toward a carbon-free future. 
Thin-film PV production
Cadmium tellurium (CdTe) thin-film PV technology was developed in the United States and makes up about 20% of the modules installed in the nation. CdTe has become the dominant source of modules in utility-scale projects, which make up 55% of total solar installs in the United States.
The US Department of Energy (DOE) recently launched the $20 million Cadmium Telluride Accelerator Consortium, which has a goal of making CdTe solar cells less expensive and more efficient, and to develop new markets for solar products.
First Solar is often touted as the lone US solar manufacturing success story, at least operating at gigawatt-scale. Founded in 1999, the company has had a manufacturing presence in Ohio since 2002 when it produced 1.5 MW of modules and employed 150 people. Since then, it has invested over $2 billion in expanding its Ohio manufacturing facilities.
In 2019 First Solar commissioned a second US factory, thus establishing itself as having one of the largest solar manufacturing footprints in the Western Hemisphere. Now a third factory is under construction. Representing an investment of $680 million, it will bring First Solar’s Ohio manufacturing capacity to 6 GW. The new “smart factory” will use artificial intelligence and Internet of Things connectivity, enabling the three-factory operation to have the capacity to produce on average one module roughly every 2.75 seconds.
Toledo Solar is another US manufacturer of CdTe modules. pv magazine USA spoke with founder, Aaron Bates, who noted several advantages to CdTe in the utility market beginning with that the degradation level is much lower than polysilicon modules. CdTe modules also perform better in high temperatures, and they’re highly recyclable. Bates credits First Solar for pioneering CdTe module recycling.

Queensland-headquartered redox-flow battery specialist Redflow and clean energy project solutions firm Empower Energies have signed a Letter of Intent to develop integrated solar and zinc-bromine flow battery solutions for the North American commercial and industrial (C&I), remote community micro grid, and utility markets.
Redflow said the energy storage solution architecture was developed through the two companies’ joint engagement with a large US-listed corporate which is interested in deploying solar and flow-battery storage technology at one of its commercial campuses.
Redflow chief commercial officer Mark Higgins believes the co-developed solution, featuring the company’s 10 kWh zinc-bromine flow battery module which can be combined to provide commercial and utility scale battery solutions, will not only serve the large US-based corporate well but also meet the needs of a variety of customer segments across North America.
“The integrated solution we’ve developed in partnership with Empower Energies represents a unique, innovative, and stress-tested alternative to the status quo solar and lithium-ion solution,” he said.
“Our integrated offering provides a safer, rugged, more sustainable and cost competitive alternative to lithium-ion batteries and solar, and our batteries don’t materially degrade over their useful life, unlike lithium-ion.
“The uniquely safe zinc bromine chemistry has no risk of thermal runaway, making our solution better to deploy in urban and suburban environments where safety is a paramount consideration. Also, our hibernation mode enables our batteries to be used for back-up power and resilience deployments in a very cost-effective manner versus lithium.”
Patrick Corr, chief strategy officer at Empower which has completed more than 200 MW of clean energy projects in the US and has more than 800 MW of solar and storage projects currently in development, said its partnership with Redflow would provide a viable alternative to lithium-ion technology for North American customers.
“We’ve found that our integrated solar and flow battery solution is of particular interest to certain C&I customers looking for energy shifting, peak shaving and other daily cycling applications for their corporate campuses, reducing energy costs and enabling on-site carbon reduction safely,” he said.
The collaboration with Empower comes after Redflow earlier this year unveiled its third-generation zinc-bromine module energy storage offering.
Redflow said the new Gen3 battery represents a major advancement over the company’s Gen2.5 battery, incorporating a new stack design, updated electronics with increased functionality, a new tank design and cooling system.
The new product implements a single 10 kWh electrode stack while the design includes a bi-directional DC-DC converter built into the battery control module, allowing flexibility of energy flow of 0-60 volts. The individual modules measure 861mm x 747mm x 400Wmm and weigh in at 240kg with electrolyte. The scalable design means it can be adapted for a wide range of applications, from small commercial installations to multi-MWh storage systems.
“The launch of our Gen3 battery is a monumental milestone in Redflow’s growth strategy,” said Higgins, who is president of the company’s North American operations. “The combination of our new Energy Pod products with the Gen3 battery provides the platform for Redflow to capitalise on the demand for large-scale, medium to long-duration energy storage systems that we’re seeing emerge around the world.
“We see huge potential for Redflow’s technology in the US and other markets like Australia.”
