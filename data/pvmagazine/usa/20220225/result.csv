The project is the 4.69MW/4MWh Lawsbrook Solar + Storage project, and it’s housed on the W.R. Grace Superfund Site, an area formerly used for gravel extraction and acquired by EDF Renewables in 2018. The project also operates under Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Targets (SMART) program, which provides incentives for solar and storage projects.
Created in 2016 the SMART program is one of the pillars that the state will use to achieve its Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, in addition to its recently codified 2030 and 2050 goals for a statewide clean energy economy.
“The Acton Water Solar + Storage project is the first of two projects that EDF Renewables has had the privilege to partner with the Acton Water District on,” said associate director of business development for EDF Renewables, Peter Bay. “We are thrilled to see the project come to fruition, despite numerous permitting and interconnection challenges, and begin conveying benefits to the District and Town of Plymouth.” 
The Lawsbrook project is part of Standard Solar’s expanding portfolio in Massachusetts. The company currently owns and maintains nearly 20MW of renewable assets in Massachusetts and 280MW of commercial and community solar projects throughout the United States.
“Adding this solar+storage project to our existing portfolio in Massachusetts underscores our rapid growth, said Director of Business Development for Standard Solar, Eric Partyka. “It’s always significant when we connect with a great partner like EDF Renewables and acquire projects that are helping a town like Plymouth and the Acton Water District to capitalize on the multiple benefits of a solar and storage system.”
Standard solar also recently acquired a 7MW community solar project in Trenton, ME. This acquisition adds to the company’s existing 50 MW portfolio in Maine.
The project, Trenton’s first large-scale community solar installation, is also part of the state’s Net Energy Billing program, and will bring a 15-25% energy savings to nine leading Maine businesses who have subscribed, sharing the benefits without having to connect to it or invest in its development. NEB, overseen by the Maine Public Utilities Commission, enables businesses and municipalities to receive financial benefits from clean energy produced by a local solar array.
The project, which is expected to be completed this summer, utilizes bifacial solar modules – double-sided panels that will help the system generate an additional 15% of output from ground reflection, something particularly advantageous given Maine’s snowy winters.
“This newest addition to our ownership portfolio in Maine signifies an important step in our push to bring cleaner energy to business and communities and our nation closer to its decarbonization goals,” said Director of Business Development at Standard Solar, Harry Benson.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/25/on-the-floor-at-the-re-northeast-solar-storage-show/,"INSURANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",On the floor at the RE+ Northeast Solar & Storage,"This week, pv magazine USA visited the RE+ Northeast Solar & Energy Storage show in Boston, Massachusetts. The cozy wintertime show in New England was gifted with short sleeve t-shirt weather. (Of course, New England weather turns quickly, and today we’re looking at 9 inches of snow.)
Let’s move on – to the vendors!
Monarch Vegetation Services’ expertise is in creating and managing pollinator habitats around solar panels. The company was sharing honey made by the bees on their sites, which had been seeded with their pollinator mixes. pv magazine USA wrote about the company back in 2019, and we’re currently looking forward to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory case study covering solar + pollinators, which should be released sometime in the first half of 2022.

Word Rock Drills showed off their drilling products, and in our brief discussion they shared knowledge about the ground conditions of northeastern US regions. They were particularly knowledgeable about what to expect to find in the dirt in south-central upstate New York, and they had specific recommendations for gear matching that soil. They claim that in this region, their $750 bits can drill through around 30,000 ft of soil before needing replacement.

OMG Roofing Products solar mounts were on display as well. The image below shows one of their mounts, which features long screws strong enough to carry wind uplift on their own. The purpose of this product is to allow attachments to a structure with thick layers of insulation and roofing material between solar panels and the important structural components. An OMG representative stood on the hardware to illustrate the force that could be transferred from the unit to the structure without damaging the roofing material.

The Hoffman Solar Rooftop Junction Box – Model RJ-1 – collects wire runs from installed solar panel strings, and provides a protected and waterproofed – NEMA 4X rated – path for wires to enter the residential structure when attic runs are planned. The junction box’s integrated flashing prevents water ingress and simplifies installation. Including the flashing, the box is a full one and a half feet tall. The top flashing is covered by roof shingles in the image below. This piece of hardware connects to your roof with two screws (circled in red).

SolarInsure offers project owners a 30 year warranty on all solar hardware, plus the labor and shipping needed for repairs. The company pays labor at $100 per hour, as well covering up to $300 for a truck roll fee. In our brief conversation, we learned that a residential project can buy their insurance coverage for 10¢ per watt of solar panels installed. A commercial project – up to 2 megawatts of capacity – can buy the same coverage at 8¢.
Additionally, SolarInsure’s 30 year warranty covers all roof penetrations. As a contractor, I appreciate this as a sort of insurance for my own company – knowing the customer is covered by a workmanship’s warranty in the short term, and insurance in the long term. When asked whether commercial rooftops using a ballasted system, making no penetrations, could save on the 8¢ – they said ‘no’.

Savant’s Incharge platform was on display, specifically their 240V AC (2 Pole) Relay Companion Module. The home automation units plug into your existing electric panel, competing with products like the Sonnen battery family, or the Span panel.
When nature calls, professionals in the field can turn to American Innotek. Their outdoor restroom products are lightweight, versatile, and environmentally friendly. Products include leakproof, odorless bags, a briefcase that unfolds into a commode, and a privacy tent that can replace a porta potty. These solutions help keep construction workers on site, and of course, they work equally well at a campsite.

Yotta Energy’s fully integrated distributed energy storage system was on display as well, featuring microinverters and batteries which bolt directly to solar racking. The company recently started rolling out their 1 kWh batteries in California after completing their manufacturing facility and a recent investment round.

Drone Drafting’s showings at the booth included some pretty cool looking screen visualizations, including the thermal analysis seen below. The company has a large footprint in the northeast US region, and is capable of deploying a professional drone team to customer sites. The company offers survey grade CAD files created by their drones – plus a list of additional deliverables.
The company says their tool can deliver sub-inch accuracy on commercial structures. They claim that their orthomosaic images offer a truer image of a site, as they account for lens distortions, camera tilt, and the curvature of the earth.

Last, but not least, was an enthusiastic salesman demonstrating the NavVis VLX system. The unit’s purpose is to capture 3D environments using lidar and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) software. The unit allows a technician to focus on walking a site, while the hardware automatically collects information. This can make for a safer information collection process when on a roof or in a complex structure.
Though specific prices were not available, it was suggested that the unit cost around $70-90,000 (it was compared to a nice electric car).

The contract calls for the Alabama-based utility-scale solar project to be completed by late 2022. OSS will provide full utility-scale EPC services, including construction of a substation. The 800-acre project will be comprised of 350,000 solar panels, producing enough electricity to power the equivalent of 20,000 homes.
Jingoli Power is a Lawrenceville, N.J.-based company led by a team industry veterans. The company offers a full range of EPC, Design-Build, and Design-Build-Own-Operate services, from development and engineering to construction and project management.
“This project is early proof that Jingoli Power’s joint venture with Orbital is well positioned to meet the growing demand for reliable, competitively priced solar generation,” said Karl Miller, Jingoli Power CEO. “I’m especially thrilled that one of our initial joint projects is for Lightsource BP, given our shared track record of safety and excellence in execution.”
OSS’ experience building substations and transmission allows it to bring projects “from concept to completion,” particularly in the state of North Carolina, where is holds an unlimited Public Utilities License. The group is backed by five active construction teams.
London-headquartered Lightsource bp is one of the largest renewable energy developers globally. It recently announced plans to deploy 25GW of solar PV by 2025. This move came after the company secured $1.8 billion in financing from 10 major banks. The company has a significant presence in US development and continues to expand its reach globally.
“We’ve just opened an office in Taiwan, and the likes of Vietnam and Korea will be next. We’ve opened an office in Singapore and we’ve recruited our first three people into Singapore, as the hub to run that Asian operation,” said chief executive Nick Boyle.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/25/cellcube-secures-long-term-supply-of-ultra-high-purity-vanadium-redox-flow-battery-electrolyte/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",CellCube secures long-term supply of vanadium redox flow battery electrolyte,"US Vanadium announced an expanded purchase agreement under which Austrian-based Enerox, which sells vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) systems under its brand name CellCube, can purchase up to 3 million additional liters/year of US Vanadium’s ultra-high-purity electrolyte with a price cap over the next five years. The agreement boosts the initial purchase agreement for 580,000 liters/year of US Vanadium electrolyte, announced in September 2021.
The ultra-high-purity electrolyte helps to increase the performance and efficiency of VRFB battery systems, which are seeing increased use as storage for microgrids. US Vanadium is capable of producing up to 4 million liter/year of the electrolyte  at its Arkansas manufacturing facility. The agreement with Enerox is believed to be one of the largest such procurements of ultra-high-purity electrolyte by a VRFB electrolyte producer outside China, the company reports.
“This agreement reflects today’s rapidly accelerating growth of the vanadium redox flow battery industry and of US Vanadium’s ability to supply VRFB manufacturers with Made-in-America ultra-high-purity electrolyte,” said US Vanadium CEO Mark A. Smith.
With the expansion of the microgrid market in the US, VRFB energy storage systems are in high demand. According to the U.S. Energy Department, VRF technology has several upsides including the potential to store MWh of power in simple designs, the ability to discharge power for up to 12 hours at a time, and the fact that VRF batteries do not present a fire hazard and use no highly reactive or toxic substances, can sit idle for long periods of time without losing storage capacity, and more.  A key CellCube reference, just being installed in the US as part of a resilient and sustainable microgrid, has been the kick-off project for the cooperation with USV. To date CellCube has installed energy storage systems at 130 sites worldwide.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/25/us-targets-5-million-community-solar-households-1-billion-in-savings-by-2025/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022","US targets 5 million community solar households, $1 billion in savings by 2025","The National Community Solar Partnership, a Department of Energy (DOE) program, set an ambitious goal of enabling enough community solar projects to power the equivalent of 5 million households, and achieve $1 billion in combined energy bill savings. This goal aligns with the DOE’s greater target of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and places a focus on ensuring that American citizens can meaningfully access the benefits of the energy transition.
DOE reports that by year’s end 2020, about 3GW of community solar in the US was active, enough to power about 600,000 homes. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3GW installed capacity to 20GW by 2025. DOE estimates customers enrolling in community solar will save an average of about 20% on energy bills.
Barriers
There are some barriers to entry that have kept community solar a relatively small portion of the generation mix. Less than half of the states currently have supportive policies. Many community solar projects face interconnection issues, uncertainty around financing and maintaining subscriber enrollment. Currently, sixteen states have codified community solar into their renewable portfolio standards, requiring grid controllers to interconnect such projects to the grid.
Income level is another significant barrier to adopting solar. Particularly, owning a rooftop solar system can be difficult to have the upfront funds or proper credit score to qualify for. Households earning less than $100k represent 2/3 of all US households but adopted less than half of all residential solar systems in 2018. The contrast is even more stark for those households earning less than $50k per year. Community solar may offer a pathway for Americans that would otherwise not be able to own or lease a system.
Program activities
The National Community Solar Partnership looks to identify and reduce these barriers to hit the topline target. It is increasing its investment in technical experience and capacity building. For 2022, the Partnership will invest $1 million in technical assistance, which is provided on a rolling basis to registered partners.
Currently, there is no federal legislation to support community solar. The Partnership instead will work with states to develop and administer their own policies. This month, the Partnership will launch a States Collaborative to convene and support states in policymaking.
DOE will also launch the Credit Ready Solar Initiative to standardize the process to apply for community solar project financing. Philanthropic dollars may play a role in providing additional lending or grants to cover financing gaps. A Credit Ready Learning Lab will help small or new community solar developers learn about the ins and outs of community solar project funding.
The program is also developing a tool that matches recipients of other federally managed low-income programs with available community solar subscriptions. This tool can both reduce energy costs for program participants and make it easier for developers to connect with potential subscribers.
Finally, the Partnership plans to build awareness and understanding of community solar through a network of community-level promoters. This is particularly important in communities where there is a history of predatory energy providers, said DOE.

Located in Webb County, Texas, the Corazon I Solar plant began operations in August 2021, while the Guajillo storage project is expected to reach an operational stage before the end of 2023.
Corazon I, among the largest projects in Texas, produces more than 500GWh a year, reducing approximately 250kt of CO2 emissions annually. BayWa r.e. acquired Corazon I as an early-stage project in 2019 and the project reached commercial operation in August of 2021.  The North American Development Bank, a syndicate of three other lenders, and developer BayWa r.e. signed a credit agreement for up to $216.1 million to finance the design, construction, and operation of the project, which is located on nearly 2,000 acres of private land.
The Guajillo storage project will use the same interconnection facilities as Corazon I and will support the grid by storing energy when generation is high and delivering it during periods of peak consumption.
“As we focus on our core strategies to grow our footprint in the US market, this deal allows BayWa r.e. to reinvest capital in the company’s development pipeline across the country, including projects in ERCOT,” said Fred Robinson, Chief Executive Officer of BayWa r.e. Solar Projects LLC
BayWa r.e. partnered with local agencies on permitting and establishing a tax structure that will provide more than $30 million in tax revenue over the 35-year project life to support the local community. The electricity and renewable energy credits generated are being sold to a retail energy provider through a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), and in the wholesale electricity market.
In December 2019, Eni New Energy US Inc., a subsidiary of the Italian energy company, Eni,  signed a strategic agreement with Falck Renewables North America Inc. to create a joint platform (Novis Renewables) for developing renewable energy projects in the United States.
