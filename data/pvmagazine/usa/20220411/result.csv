Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Origis has completed 170 projects worldwide totaling more than 4GW to date of developed solar and energy storage capacity. The company also provides financing, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and operations, maintenance, and asset management.
The deal uses First Solar’s agile contracting approach, which means that Origis will benefit from any advances in technology through 2024, when the Cadmium Telluride (CadTel) thin-film modules will be delivered to its projects across the United States.
The thin-film modules to be procured by Origis are manufactured at First Solar’s R&D centers in California and Ohio. First Solar is investing $680 million in expanding America’s domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3GW annually, by building its third US manufacturing facility, in Lake Township, Ohio. The new facility is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023 and when fully operational will bring the company’s Northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6GW.
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. With First Solar’s expansion in the United States and India and optimization of its existing fleet, the First Solar anticipate that its manufacturing capacity will double to 16GW by 2024.
Origis Energy recently announced that it had ordered 400MW of high-efficiency shingled bifacial Performance line solar modules from Maxeon, another US manufacturer,  for use in US utility-scale projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/11/modular-solar-pv-and-tidal-power-desalination-buoys-from-canada/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 11, 2022",Modular solar PV and wave power desalination buoys from Canada,"Desalination is seen as a path forward to ensuring coastal communities have a steady supply of clean drinking water as populations expand. Historically, desalination projects have struggled to scale widely, as the high amount of energy required to remove salt from ocean water creates costs and damages sustainability. 
A Quebec, Canada firm has developed a product to address the energy and environmental concerns of desalination by making a modular, floating buoy that harnesses the power of the sun and waves to turn ocean water into drinkable water. Oneka builds a self-contained, solar-topped device that also harnesses wave power. The two energy sources allow the buoy to draw ocean water in through reverse osmosis, and then convert it to drinkable water.
Oneka said the system benefits from not requiring any land, nor any external sources of electricity. In comparison with a traditional diesel-powered desalination plant, Oneka said its solution can reduce costs by up to 70%.  The buoys are usually placed 0.1 to 2 miles from shore, with a depth of at least 35 feet. The units are not visible from the shore with the naked eye for most sites, said the company.
Waves that are just three-feet high are sufficient for the operation of the system, and the ideal wave sizes range between three to ten feet high. Oneka said the system can last fifteen years, and regular maintenance checkups occur quarterly. Each buoy can pump out 10 cubic meters of fresh water each day, and the modular design allows for easy additions of more buoys. serving increased water demand.
It is estimated that at current growth rates, the desalination industry will contribute 2 billion tons of CO2 emissions per year by 2050, more than twice the emissions of the aviation sector in 2019. A single buoy can abate about 34,000kg of carbon emissions each year, equivalent to the impact of about five to ten cars. 
Oneka said the brine produced by the desalination nodes is environmentally responsible, increasing the ocean water’s salinity by about 30% on average. Each buoy has its own inlet and outlet, allowing for a distributed discharge of salt that can disperse in the ocean quickly. 
The company said its product has applications in coastal communities, oceanfront resorts, and private islands. Its first commercially operating project is located in Fort Pierce, Florida, completed last year. Last June, Oneka secured a CA $5.5 million ($4.36 million US) funding round, and has investors across the globe, including Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, Chile, and Germany.
“The world is running out of clean water and Oneka has a solution. It works, it’s affordable, it’s better for the environment, and it can be scaled from local disaster relief and regional demand all the way to meeting utility needs,” said Jonathan Saari, investment manager at Innovacorp, one of the leading investors in the funding round.
The US Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are pursuing modular, wave ]-based desalination buoys, as well. A five-stage, $3.3 million contest aims to accelerate innovation in small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of producing clean water in disaster and recovery scenarios, as well as in water-scarce coastal and islanded locations. The current NREL model, called HERO WEC, does not utilize solar PV.

In more accessible terms, Nispera’s AI technology allows customers to monitor, analyze, forecast, and optimize the performance and value of renewable energy assets. The company has used its technology to develop an AI-driven utility-scale asset performance management platform that currently has 8 GW of assets under management across 450 wind and solar projects on a global basis.
Following the acquisition, Fluence plans to combine its existing IQ Digital Platform with Nispera’s suite of five applications to deliver a user-centric “manage app” to its customers. Fluence’s IQ Digital Platform is a machine learning-based software that gives recommendations on when and how much to bid into auctions for energy and grid services on an hourly and daily basis, allowing asset operators to make real-time decisions based on historical data and forecasting on metrics like expected energy generation and demand, weather, etc., optimizing revenue.
“Nispera accelerates our plan to grow our existing digital capabilities,” said Fluence’s Chief Digital Officer, Seyed Madaeni. “As we build a comprehensive digital product suite for customers to better understand, control, dispatch, optimize, and maintain their renewable energy and storage assets, Nispera’s use of machine learning and AI will be highly complementary to the advanced applications already being developed at Fluence.”
Nispera’s suite of five applications includes its SaaS product, a predictive maintenance app, an operations and maintenance app, a portfolio management app, and an app that that provides enhanced power generation forecasting services for energy assets.
In November 2021, Fluence ran its initial public offering under which the company, which began as a joint venture between Siemens AG and AES Corp., raised just under one billion dollars.
In March, Fluence announced that it was selected to deliver a 50MW/50MWh energy storage system with advanced grid-forming capabilities for Broken Hill Battery Energy Storage System in Australia. The installation will utilize Fluence’s sixth-generation GridStack energy storage stack technology. Gridstack is designed for demanding, utility-scale, grid applications like transmission and distribution enhancement and frequency regulation and capacity peak power.

Rather than signing on for a share of faraway, centralized renewable energy capacity, which can require more robust transmission infrastructure to deliver, the firm opted for bringing clean energy generation directly to the site of demand.
Three projects will power more than 90% of the operations of three Raymour & Flanigan locations in New Jersey. Its Monmouth Service Center hosts an active 516.6kW system, completed in late 2021. It is expected to generate 633,500kWh in its first year. The other two locations, the Fairfield Showroom and Clearance Center, host two projects with a combined 735.9kW capacity, with an expected delivery of 883,260kWh in the first year of operations. The Fairfield projects are expected to come online in June 2022. The projects are developed by Greenskies Clean Focus.
The three projects are expected to abate 656 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the first year. This is equivalent to taking 233 cars off the road, planting 18,000 tree seedlings, or offsetting the carbon impact of 136 standard US homes.
Raymour & Flanigan is the largest furniture and mattress provider in the northeast, and seventh largest nationally. The Greenskies partnership is the latest in a series of sustainability initiatives taken on by the company. The company said it has an advanced recycling program that allows the company to recycle 99% of its packaging materials. This has led to the avoidance of over 200 million pounds of packaging entering landfills since 2002.
“At Raymour & Flanigan, prioritizing sustainability and green initiatives aligns with our purpose of helping all people enjoy their home, planet Earth,” said Christopher Gaube, Senior Director of Brand Marketing at Raymour & Flanigan. “As an industry leader, we are committed to setting the standard for sustainable practices by offsetting our carbon footprint with renewable energy. We are excited about the completion of these projects as we do our part in building toward a greener future together.”
The furniture retailer join a rising trend in big box stores improving the sustainability of their operations, all while securing a more predictable cost of energy in the long-term. Last month, big box retailer Target announced it activated its first net-zero store. Onsite rooftop solar and solar parking canopies produce enough energy to provide a 10% surplus. More than 25% of Target’s stores are topped with solar PV.
As for Raymour & Flanigan, it appears its solar journey has just begun. “We are excited to continue to support Raymour and Flanigan’s commitment to sustainability by installing solar at additional properties throughout the Northeast,” said Stanley Chin, President and CEO of Greenskies Clean Focus. “These projects are an excellent example of how large-scale retailers can make meaningful gains toward their ESG commitments with renewable energy from on-site solar.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/11/storing-renewables-in-depleted-oil-and-gas-wells/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 11, 2022",Storing renewables in depleted oil and gas wells,"From pv magazine global
Researchers from the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are proposing the use of horizontal gas and oil wells to store renewable energy via compressed natural gas.
The scientists initially considered injecting renewable-powered compressed air into old wells, but they chose natural gas because of its compatibility with existing reservoirs.
“We want to start the program with natural gas because it’s easy and I think the people who own the wells, they’d get on board a lot easier,” said NREL researcher David Young. “Eventually, as you prove out the idea, you gradually shift over to a different gas to run the system. CO2 would work. Nitrogen would work. Hydrogen. If you use CO2 that could also be part of a carbon-capture cycle.”
In particular, the US group recommended hydraulically fractured (“fracked”) projects, which account for about 75% of all newly drilled wells in the United States. “The number of active horizontal wells has jumped from about 9,000 in 2,000 to more than a quarter-million in 2017,” said NREL.
The academics evaluated the potential storage of large-scale renewables capacity as compressed natural gas, to be released to spin an electrical generator when electrical demand is high. They described their findings in “Electrical energy storage using compressed gas in depleted hydraulically fractured wells,” which was recently published in iScience. They referred to their technology as “REpurposed FRAcked wells for Energy Storage” (REFRAES).
NREL
They proposed the use of unconventional shale and tight sandstone dry gas wells that have been fracked and depleted. Renewable energy could be used to compress natural gas for storage in the wells. The heat generated by the compression process could also be stored for later use.
“The ability to predict and control injection and production of natural gas into and from a shale reservoir through a hydraulically fractured well is one of the most important and challenging aspects of the REFRAES concept,” they emphasized, noting that the shale wells must be able to sustain gas flow rates of several million standard cubic feet per day. “The gas injection occurs near the natural reservoir temperature, pressure, and flow rate, so reservoir deterioration is unlikely.”
The proposed energy storage cycle model is expected to be implemented in four phases: an injection phase, a storage phase, an electricity production phase, and a recovery period. During the recovery period, the well is shut in. The research group assumed that each of these phases would be equal in time duration, although the scheme might not be the most efficient way to cycle the reservoir.
The scientists chose two different configuration for short-term or long-term storage. For the first one, the cycle takes 24 hours to complete, with each phase lasting six hours. For the second option, each phase lasts 90 days and the entire cycle takes 360 days. “These are arbitrary storage cycles chosen for convenience. Actual storage and production durations will be market-driven,” they said.
Through their analysis, the scientists found that these storage facilities may achieve a round-trip storage efficiency of between 40% and 70% depending on the natural reservoir temperature. They said renewables stores in wells may also achieve a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) ranging from $70 and 270/MWh, a value which they describe as on par with pumped hydro storage. They also estimated that these facilities may be built at a cost of $1,000 to $3,500 per kilowatt installed.
“The low LCOS values are due to the reuse of existing infrastructure, including a de-risked reservoir, low capital expenditures for additional needed equipment, and utilizing the geothermal energy of the reservoir to maintain the thermodynamic state of the compressed gas,” the scientists concluded. “In all, REFRAES is shown to be a viable technology for energy storage with high RTE, low LCOS, and ability to be expanded in scale to meet grid-scale storage needs.”

While transitioning to electric vehicles is important in achieving B.C.’s net-zero goal by 2050; however, the challenge of recycling or repurposing the batteries remains.
Vancouver-based Moment Energy is addressing that challenge by developing a reliable low-carbon energy storage system from repurposed EV batteries with $320,000 in support from the CleanBC Go Electric Advanced Research and Commercialization (ARC) program. The company is building and testing a 120kW/h battery pack using the Renewable Energy Storage Laboratory at Dalhousie University. When complete, the company will deploy the system in a B.C. off-grid diesel-dependent scuba diving resort to gain real-world performance and environmental data. The project is expected to create and sustain 11 full-time-equivalent jobs in B.C.
“By supporting innovation in clean tech, we are contributing to low-carbon economic recovery, helping realize our decarbonization potential and unlocking the innovation that B.C. has in store,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation.
Based in Port Coquitlam, Moment Energy’s project is one of 17 projects under the second funding call of the ARC program, which invests more than $8 million toward projects that span all transportation modes, from boats to electric bikes and aviation, benefiting eight B.C. municipalities.
The ARC program supports B.C.’s EV sector by providing reliable, targeted support for research and development, commercialization and demonstration of B.C.-based EV technologies, services and products. This round of ARC project funding further leverages more than $18 million in industry and federal government investments and is expected to create and sustain approximately 175 full-time-equivalent jobs.
“This CleanBC project with Moment Energy will reduce the life-cycle environmental footprint of electric vehicles in our province and further our climate progress by finding creative new uses for older batteries to continue providing clean power,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy.
In November of last year, Moment Energy raised a $3.5 million seed round of funding, which co-founder and CEO Edward Chiang said would allow the company to deploy more up-cycled EV batteries to industries in need of clean and reliable energy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/11/dan-shugar-more-maestro-then-midas/,"BUSINESS,INTERVIEW,MARKETS & POLICY,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 11, 2022",Dan Shugar: More Maestro than Midas,"While most nicknames start innocuously enough, they tend to evolve quickly, becoming a core element of a person’s identity and reputation – even if they never asked for the moniker to begin with. Nobody knows this better than Dan Shugar, CEO of Nextracker, the world’s leading tracker vendor, who has gone by a litany of names in his illustrious career in the energy space, including one that carries a much more ominous weight than others: the King Midas of solar.
At face value, the nickname is a testament to Dan’s ability to recognize opportunity and capitalize launching successful, industry-defining companies in the process. His first touch of gold came with Powerlight when it was sold to SunPower in the early days of solar, and his reputation only grew after Nextracker’s 2015 acquisition by Flextronics, which came to the tune of a cool $330 million.
However, anyone familiar with the Midas fable knows the second edge to the nickname, a cautionary tale of money and success’ propensity to corrupt. However, when talking to Shugar and those closest to him, this is where the parallel ends, as, by all accounts, the success of Dan Shugar is but a byproduct of his larger goal: growing the clean energy into the predominant source of power for the US and the world at large.
Image: SEIA
“I think Dan is definitely one of the leaders of the energy transition, and I think he really believes in this transition across all technologies and across all opportunities,” attested Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), who has known Dan since she first started at SEIA in 2017. “I have never gotten a sense that his interest in solar is merely for his own financial gain. He’s incredibly articulate about the importance of the entire industry moving forward, the policies needed, the political strategy that’s needed, the communications that are needed to realize the industry’s full potential.” 
According to Hopper, this was first highlighted to her shortly after she began at SEIA, when the two collaborated on a project to tell the stories of people who work in the solar industry. She reflected that Dan was hyper-focused on humanizing these workers, who were so frequently viewed as just another number in labor statistics.
“It’s not just about the number, the 250,000 people who have been nameless, faceless, and kind of anonymous,” said Hopper. “To him, it was really about spending the time, money and resources needed to tell their stories. That was Dan’s vision.”
And while Hopper has largely known Shugar in roles of advocacy and political action, this drive to illustrate the greater potential of clean energy in a way that empowers others is critical to understanding what has made him and his ventures as successful as they have been.
Longtime friend, business partner, and current President of Nextracker, Howard Wenger, explained that Shugar follows a similar philosophy to Sir Richard Branson’s ABCD mantra: always be connecting dots, an approach which allows him to take on issues dynamically, finding solutions in areas that would otherwise seem entirely disconnected from the issue at hand.
“I think that’s one of the things that makes him a compelling leader and visionary” said Wenger. “He is always connecting the dots.”
Recently, this dot-connecting approach was what led to the development of Nextracker’s newest tracker product: the NX Horizon-XTR, a terrain-following, single-axis tracker built specifically for projects located on sites with sloped, uneven, and challenging terrain. Development of the product was initially triggered by a conversation with one of Nextracker’s oldest customers, Solv Energy, formerly known as Swinerton.
“It’s often the case where we have customers that identify needs,” explained Shugar. “So we had a customer about three and a half years ago, and they said, ‘Hey, your tracker is much more adaptive to terrain than you’re allowing in the specification, and we think there can be a lot of value there.’”
It was a realization that the Nextracker team ran with, kicking off initial R&D into a terrain-following tracker shortly after that initial conversation. Once all of the prerequisite engineering, monitoring, and reliability studies were done, Nextracker began to supply XTR to several dozen projects with longtime partners as a pilot test for the new tech before officially launching the product in March 2022.
The only-increasing scarcity of flat, even land had become a growing issue in the world of project development, with land grading cost estimates sometimes making up more than 5% of total project budget, and that’s before the considerations of wind-blown dust, rainwater erosion, and any other relevant environmental variables are taken into account, which can all further drive up costs.
Yet from one conversation, one observation that an existing product had a previously-overlooked strength, the first step towards conquering that challenge was made.
The ability to impart his dot-connecting mindset on others was attributed by those that pv magazine spoke with to Shugar’s lifelong passion for music. Shugar’s love for music is no industry secret, in fact, one of the three bands he currently plays in, fittingly dubbed “The Interconnectors” was initially formed at a solar energy conference and includes clean energy veteran, Yale Friend, a hardware engineer with Pure Storage. 
In January 2021, Shugar was invited to perform at the Clean Energy for Biden Inaugural Ball, where he put his own spin on Jimi Hendrix’s iconic rendition of the Star Spangled Banner. The video is worth watching for his wardrobe alone.
In a band, especially the jazz and blues that both Shugar plays in and draws influence from, each member has their predefined role – keeping time if you’re the bassist – but within that role, the freedom to improvise, adding their own flavor and unique style, ensuring that no two performances are the same.
“If you listen to old blues or rock, there’s sort of a call and a response that you hear a lot,” said Shugar “If you’re in an improvisational setting, there’s a number of measures for it, and you call that a trading eights. For example, there’s a great trumpet player that I enjoy collaborating with. He’ll play a phrase for eight measures, then I’ll respond to that, and playback. So I love that whole thing about music. And there is, for me, a big analogy there about the company. Great rock bands, they’ve endured for a long period of time and it’s about functional relationships, and those collaborations. With Nextracker, we founded the company in 2013, and all of our co founders are still with the company.”
This ability to improvise and shine in unscripted situations was proven to Hopper during about as high of stakes a situation as is possible, when Shugar joined SEIA and others in testimony before a packed International Trade Commission (ITC) hearing over the Section 201 tariffs in 2017.
“Dan has always been an incredibly clear communicator, especially in a situation like that, where the health and well being of our industry is on the line, and the ability to continue to grow was really in question,” said Hopper. He brought a clarity of purpose, and a clarity of communication, to the press, to the Capitol Hill, to the International Trade Commission, and ultimately, to the US Trade Representative.”
During said hearing, Dan joined representatives from SEIA, as well as other leaders across the solar landscape to provide testimony – all of which had to fit into a 60-minute window – meaning Shugar’s prepared speaking time was boiled down to just a couple of minutes.
After that initial hour, however, the floor was turned over to Trade Commission officials for a Q&A session which ended up being many hours longer than the initial testimony. Not only was this session longer, but the questions asked were not addressed to the group as a whole, rather than individual members, meaning answers had to come largely unprepared and on the fly.
It was here that Hopper remembers Shugar shining.
“What I remember is that Dan was just such a passionate advocate, right? Like the questions don’t necessarily come to a particular person on this panel of 10 or 12 people, and Dan was able to really cogently and clearly explain the answer to whatever question they had, and explain why this move of placing such horrendous tariffs could end the industry.”
Everyone that pv magazine spoke with in preparing this profile cited Shugar’s communication style as a foundational aspect of their relationship with him. As they have experienced, you never have to question where you stand with Dan, a prospect that can be either immensely reassuring or surprisingly intimidating, depending on one’s perspective.
“He has a very direct style that resonates with some, and catches others off guard, but it never ceases to create a dynamic of conversation that you don’t get in normal conversation with other people, which is what makes him really special,” said Troy Lauterbach, who has made his name as Co-founder & CEO of NovaSource, a global O&M provider in commercial, industrial and utility-scale solar, but has also been longtime customer and friend of Shugar’s. 
Lauterbach first met Shugar in 2008, when he was interviewing for a position at SunPower. Formalities aside, Shugar ripped right into Lauterbach from the start (at least as he remembers it), asking him point-blank: “Why would we even hire you? I think there’s probably better people than you out here at this. Why should we take this chance on you?”
As harsh as that may come off over text, Lauterbach attests that what followed those initial, intensely daunting questions was a conversation that launched a lifelong friendship and admiration.
While Shugar has certainly had fun with the Midas moniker, in speaking with those around him, another analogy kept popping up over and over, one founded in his relationships and communications with people, rather than his ability to turn a successful business. Given the way Shugar uses music to connect dots and move a bunch of small pieces as a cohesive unit, to those at Nextracker and in the solar industry at large, he can sometimes feel like a maestro more than a Midas.
“It comes to listening,” explained Shugar. “Listen to the customer, listen to the person you’re collaborating with within the band, listen to ideas other people have in the company. There’s a balance, you know, if you have a lot of experience in a given thing, you want to jump in with both feet, but there’s a pulling back. You have to do to provide space for others to, to contribute their ideas. I used to play a lot more notes than I do now. And so now I try to pull back, give the, other people’s space to express themselves, and then sort of build on these ideas together.”
