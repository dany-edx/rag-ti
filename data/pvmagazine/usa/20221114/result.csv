Even in the past two years there have been considerable improvements. For ground mounts, there are fixed racking systems, single and double axis trackers, and trackers that use air, hydraulics  or motors. More recently, we have seen a racking system that *isn’t* a racking system. In this article, we’ll be discussing the ultra-low-profile PEG system.

PEG is a racking system developed by Jurchen Technology, headquartered in Germany, with offices in California. PEG’s claim to fame comes from its racking system’s low-cost hardware coupled with quick installation time, which results in a very competitive price. The hardware is relatively low priced because there is so little of it. Each solar module requires only 1.1 metal rods, 2 plates, and 2.2 clips, according to documentation from PEG.
Somewhat unintuitively, this ultra-light low-profile racking system was able to meet very aggressive wind codes. PEG recently promoted that its system was certified by the I.F.I. Institut für Industrieaerodynamik GmbH to withstand up to and greater than 185 miles per hour. This certification has already been put to the test, since PEG has been installing a project in the Caribbean, which is known for its beautiful beaches and devastating hurricanes.

Because the company holds its data close to its vest, prospective customers will have to reach out to the company directly to get information regarding their wind certification.
PEG’s high wind speed rating began to pay off just a few weeks ago, as hurricane Ian’s eyewall passed less than 50 miles from their site in Cuba, which was under construction at the time. As the hurricane passed by, wind speeds from the Category 3 storm were at a sustained 125 mph or greater. As the storm continued north, into the very warm Gulf of Mexico, its speed increased. Winds coming from the north eventually reached 155 mph, just 2 mph shy of a category 5.

While no post-storm images are available,  Matthew Lusk, vice president of business development at Jurchen Technology told pv magazine USA that its facility was not damaged. Others were not as lucky. Total damage from the storm ran into the billions of dollars, and killed at least two in Cuba and at least 114 in the United States.
Land on an island is expensive, and for the island nations of the Caribbean, the densely configured hardware with resistance to extremely high winds is a particularly attractive combination.
An analysis by DNV suggests that a PEG system, with its 97% ground coverage ratio, installs 0.74 MW per acre capacity and generates 1,520 kWh/kW/year. While this 1,520 kWh/kW/year value is, of course, lower per panel than we would see from a tracking facility in North America, it is still a very impressive feat for a single acre to fit 0.74 MW. The per-acre capacity of a tracking facility is low by comparison: just 0.2 MW/acre.

The DNV analysis suggests that PEG’s energy dense facilities can generate more than double the electricity per acre than a fixed and single axis tracking system.
In a world where the price of solar modules continues to decline and labor takes over as one of the highest costs of a solar project, it now makes more sense to design for maximum land efficiency, rather than for maximum solar panel efficiency.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/14/the-role-of-solar-in-the-inflation-reduction-act/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022",The role of solar in the Inflation Reduction Act,"From pv magazine 11/2022.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden in August, is the largest climate and energy spending package in U.S. history. The massive bill includes $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is dedicated to renewables and climate resilience.
“This act includes $369 billion to take the most aggressive action ever … ever, ever, ever, in confronting the climate crisis,” said Biden during the bill’s signing.
The IRA mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030 and aims for energy savings for Americans. Biden’s administration said 7.5 million more families will be able install solar on their roofs with a 30% tax credit, saving them approximately $9,000 over the life of the system or at least $300 per year. Families that take advantage of clean energy, efficiency, and electric vehicle tax credits will save more than $1,000 a year, the administration claimed.
IRA spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. The administration said 55 of the largest U.S. corporations paid no taxes in 2020 and the top 1% of earners are estimated to legally avoid $160 million in taxes annually. Closing those get-outs and levying a minimum 15% tax on the most profitable corporations will capture $124 billion in previously lost government revenue over a decade, according to the bill’s authors.
Solar is set to play a central role in decarbonizing and onshoring U.S. energy. By 2030, it is estimated the IRA will drive the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery plants.
“Americans can rest assured that our leaders have acted to lower costs, strengthen American energy independence, and create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs, all while combating the damaging impacts of climate change,” said George Hershman, CEO of utility-scale solar developer SOLV Energy. “With the president’s signature, the solar industry stands ready to invest in our domestic manufacturing capacity, grow the workforce, and rapidly scale our clean energy deployment efforts.”
One of the most significant provisions of the infrastructure law is the long-term extension of the investment tax credit (ITC) which was instrumental in launching the US solar industry. The bill calls for a 10-year extension of 30% of the cost of installed equipment to be tax exempt, falling to 26% in 2033, and 22% in 2034. That 30% credit also applies to energy storage, meaning retrofits of batteries to solar arrays can benefit.
Interconnection costs will be included for projects smaller than 5 MWac. That is particularly beneficial to a US solar market saddled with project soft costs which are among the highest in the world. Residential soft costs can exceed 65%, according to the Department of Energy.
Projects with at least 1 MW of generation capacity must pay attention to employment requirements to receive the full ITC, however. With a default ITC rate of 6%, laborers and mechanics installing the projects must be paid prevailing wages and be part of an electrical apprenticeship program for developers to enjoy another 24%. Those rules will apply from 2023 and violations will bring down Secretary of Labor fines of $5,000 per underpaid laborer or mechanic unless the underpayment is found to be intentional, in which case, the fine doubles.
The IRA includes significant “adders” to raise the ITC beyond 30%. Projects featuring a minimum amount of domestically produced content are eligible for another 10%. To reach that target, all steel and iron must be U.S. made and at least 40% of manufactured goods – solar panels, inverters, electrical gear – must qualify too, with the latter percentage to rise in future. Historically, Made-in-the-USA goods must feature at least 55% domestic content but the bill lists exceptions, permitting imports of materials not made to satisfactory quality or in sufficient numbers in the U.S. Domestic components which would raise project costs by more than a quarter can also be shipped in.
A further 10% of ITC is available to projects in designated “energy communities” – brownfield sites and former fossil fuel production areas. In the latter case, county subdivisions – or “census tracts” – and their immediate neighbors, are eligible as long as there has been coal, oil, or natural gas extraction since 2000.
Biden’s bill also extended the generation-based production tax credit (PTC), previously afforded to wind farms, to include solar for the first time. That clean-energy PTC will be available until the end of 2024 when it will become technology-neutral. Solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, and other eligible projects will bank a tax credit of $0.003 per kilowatt-hour generated, with $0.015 paid to projects built by workers in receipt of a prevailing wage and that met apprenticeship requirements.

The Inflation Reduction Act aims to lift domestic manufacturing in the U.S. through tax credits, grants, loans, government procurement, R&D support, and more, writes Anne Fischer. The global solar supply chain has been dealt repeated blows, from import tariffs and the Uyghur act to pandemic-related manufacturing and shipment delays. Nevertheless, solar still made up 39% of new US electricity generation capacity from January to June. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) predicted a ripple effect of the IRA’s $60 billion for US manufacturing by estimating, in its “Manufacturing Roadmap 2022,” the bill would drive investment in modules, trackers, inverters and racking within three years, and ingot, wafer and cell capacity within five. In the short-term though, other supplies will have to be sourced and SEIA deputy general counsel Amir Yazdi told the RE+ trade show in September, the US must continue to work with allies in a competitive market.


A higher PTC, of $0.026/kWh, is available for projects built before an “act beginning construction deadline” which will occur 60 days after the Internal Revenue Service specifies its wage and apprenticeship requirements.
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership,” said SEIA president Abigail Ross Hopper. “This is a crucial window of opportunity that we cannot miss, and now Congress must seal the deal and pass this legislation.”
As a result of the IRA, researchers from Princeton University, Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research, and Climate Impact Consulting noted – in the REPEAT (Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit) study – solar deployment may accelerate from the 10 GW added in 2020 to 49 GW in 2024 and more than 100 GW by 2030.
Solar investment could reach $321 billion in 2030, up from an anticipated pre-IRA $177 billion. The REPEAT report expects the IRA to drive almost $3.5 trillion in capital investment into new American energy supply over a decade. With annual US energy expenditure expected to fall at least 4% in 2030, the IRA would bring almost $50 billion of savings for households and businesses.
The REPEAT study estimates the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law could cut an extra billion metric tons of US carbon emissions in 2030, on their own representing two-thirds of the reductions needed to meet the goal of halving 2005 emission levels in 2030.
“It really makes me incredibly optimistic,” said Princeton’s Jesse Jenkins, leader of the REPEAT project. “It doesn’t get us all the way there on its own, but it keeps us in the climate fight.”

The Stamford, Connecticut-based developer grew its portfolio over the recent quarter in part due to a recent acquisition of an 88 MW commercial solar portfolio in Arizona, Nevada, Indiana and Pennsylvania, from D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments, and 9 MW of New Jersey assets acquired from a local developer.
Following the transactions, Altus Power operates a project portfolio of approximately 474 MW in 22 states.  Since becoming a public company in December 2021, Altus Power has developed a project pipeline that consists of more than 500 MW of operations acquired by the company and 500 MW of projects under internal development.
While revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $19.4 million were both up year over year, the company wrote a $96.6 million net loss in Q3 22 based on a one-time non-cash loss of $102 million.
The company has developed projects for a number of Fortune 100 and 500 companies such as CBRE and Blackstone Group, both historic investors in the company, as well as Shell and Link Logistics.
Altus shares trade at $7.19 per share today, down 31.4% from $10.48 a year ago, with a $1.1 billion market capitalization.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/14/visualizing-the-remarkable-progress-of-solar-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022",Visualizing the remarkable progress of solar energy,"Solar energy is now in the center stage of the United States’ plans for a decarbonized economy, representing 70% of high-probability utility-scale power capacity planned through 2025.  
Solar’s rise to the top as a key energy resource now seems inevitable, but its fate was not always sealed. The technology contributed a negligible amount of power less than ten years ago, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) did not begin reporting annual net generation of PV until 2014. In that year, solar contributed 27 TWh of electricity to the U.S. grid. Seven short years later, it generated 164 TWh in 2021, multiplying generation six times over. 
The installed capacity of solar has climbed to 77 GW this year, reports EIA, and has 72 GW of high-probability projects queued in late development stages set to come online through 2025. This will effectively double the total installed capacity in three years. 
This progress has been made possible by supportive industrial policy, economies of scale, improved technological efficiencies, and business innovations. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) has fallen through the years, and the benefits of solar and energy storage become more crystalized as the threats of climate change increase with the passing years.
Here are some charts that track the remarkable achievement of the U.S. solar industry, now over 250,000 workers strong, thus far:
In 2015, solar as a portion of all electricity sales was miniscule in many states, with California and Hawaii leading the way with around a 7% contribution.
Only six years later in 2021, solar has made its mark in each state in the U.S., and in markets like California, Nevada, and Hawaii, it has achieved about 20% of all energy sales.
Solar-generated electricity was expensive in 2010. In the West, LCOE was $173 per MWh, and it reached near $400 per MWh in the East.
As of 2021, LCOE has fallen precipitously, with costs in PJM nearly one-tenth the cost from 2010, and West projects averaging costs less than $30 per MWh.
Crystalline silicon solar panels are the most common PV technology used, though there have been promising developments in TOPCon, HJT, perovskites, tandem cells, and other emerging technologies. In the 1970s, solar cells achieved around 15% efficiency. Now, many commercial solar cells range between 21% to 27%, and lab-based emerging technologies have demonstrated efficiencies as high as 47.1%, reaching heights that researchers once thought were impossible.
Looking ahead 
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures and calls for a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. Princeton University released a Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) in collaboration with Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research, and Carbon Impact Consulting, outlining the potential impact of the law.
The impact on the U.S. solar industry could be huge, to say the least. The Princeton report said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The Act would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/14/tva-aims-to-build-100mw-solar-installation-on-retired-coal-site-in-kentucky/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,KENTUCKY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022",TVA aims to build 100 MW solar installation on retired coal site in Kentucky,"TVA is a federally owned electric utility that serves nearly 10 million people in parts of seven southeastern states. Earlier this year the utility released its sustainability goals of targeting up to 10 GW of solar by 2035, and more than 200,000 EVs on TVA roadways by 2028. TVA recently approved a $216 million project to put a 100MW solar plant on top of a capped coal-ash storage site in Kentucky–part of its plan to have about 2.8 GW of solar in TVA operation by 2024.
Repurposing retired fossil sites is just one of its planned actions in its decarbonization efforts, and the utility points to its recent request for proposals for 5GW of clean energy and its pursuit of grid-scale nuclear reactors. The utility was recently criticized, however, for claiming that it needs a new gas unit to replace the coal unit that it plans to retire.
TVA came to that conclusion in a 449-page draft environmental impact statement. The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not to rely on a Tennessee Valley Authority analysis and said that says that instead, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) should evaluate replacing the coal unit with solar, wind, energy efficiency and storage, rather than gas generation.
The utility claims that the proposed $216 million pilot project, pending environmental reviews and regulatory approval, would advance TVA’s clean energy efforts
“The space between execution and aspiration is where innovation lives,” said Jeff Lyash, president and CEO of TVA. “Achieving a net-zero clean energy future is critical to our nation’s energy security goals and requires innovative thinking and exploring new technologies. TVA was created as an innovation company and is uniquely positioned to demonstrate these technologies for the rest of the industry – both in the U.S. and around the world.”
At the same time, TVI is embracing the deployment of nuclear reactors in Canada and the United States, indicating that it had optimized its existing nuclear fleet to provide almost 40% of the region’s carbon-free power. TVA also worked on a grid-scale battery storage project that uses lithium-ion batteries to store energy for use when needed, and it explored clean hydrogen as a means of generating electricity and lowering carbon emissions.
“TVA is outcome-focused and there is no single answer to reducing carbon emissions,” said Lyash. “Our path to a clean energy future may not always be linear, but our end goal is to follow a defined strategy to accelerate the process across the industry and expand carbon-free technologies that will power our nation’s sustainable clean energy economy without impacting reliability, resiliency or affordability.”
Lyash noted that TVA issued a request for proposals for conducting a Valley Decarbonization Study in 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/14/eia-study-finds-high-solar-penetration-states-showed-resiliency-to-major-power-outages/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISASTER RECOVERY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,LOUISIANA,MISSISSIPPI,OREGON,TEXAS,UNITED STATES,WEST VIRGINIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022",EIA study finds high solar penetration states showed resiliency to major power outages,"A newly released study by the US Energy Information Administration showed that while 2021 recorded the third highest rate of total annual electric power outages since 2013, state markets with a high rate of rooftop solar adoption have shown to have the shortest timeframe for recovery from outages and higher grid resiliency.
The EIA study found that increasing solar states such as Florida, Delaware, the District of Columbia and Nevada, experienced outages ranging from 52 minutes to 102 minutes in the most recent year.  That contrasts to states with prohibitive solar and net metering incentives, such as West Virginia, Louisiana and Mississippi, which saw power outages stretch from 19 hours to more than 3 days.
With major outage events, the average utility customer was without power for just under 7.5 hours in 2021, which is an improvement from 2020 at more than 8 hours, a year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic’s disruptions on the electric service market and customer accessibility.

Freak Storm Year
Worth noting is the US experienced a record number or 21 named storms in 2021, the third-most active Atlantic weather season on record. In addition to four major hurricanes in 2021, a winter storm affected the Midwest and Southeast as far south as Texas.
Factors including weather, interference from vegetation near power lines and utility practices caused power interruptions over recent years, while Oregon and Texas, now the 21st and second highest states for solar adoption, experienced significant outages due to both wildfires and extreme winter storms.
Winter Storm Uri from February 2021 saw a multi-day power outage in Texas stretch into weeks as the storm saw the state’s utility system operator, ERCOT, grapple with widespread grid failures across multiple metropolitan regions.  While 4.5 million Texans lost power, an additional half a million customers in Louisiana and Oklahoma also grappled with recovery efforts from winter storm Uri in the southeast.
Power Outage Index Calculation
One metric the EIA uses to measure grid reliability is the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), which measures the total time on average that a customer experiences non-momentary power interruptions in a one-year period. SAIDI is often paired with the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), which measures the frequency of power interruptions.
For utilities that use the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standards, the EIA’s outage data is defined as those non-momentary outages lasting more than five minutes.
The SAIDI of an event is calculated by multiplying the minutes of a power outage by the number of customers affected, divided by the total number of customers in the system.
The SAIFI of a weather event is defined as the number of customers affected by an outage by the total number of customers in the local power system, or the percent of customers affected.
