The program, which does not require manufacturer participation, conducts tests on inverters to develop data that can help mitigate technology risks and quantify product performance.
“Third-party data for inverters is notoriously difficult to obtain from manufacturers,” said C.J. Colavito, VP of engineering at Standard Solar. The Crowd Power PQP is intended to address this data access issue.
The tests largely mirror PVEL’s inverter PQP, which was introduced in 2014. Both programs include safety, reliability, and performance testing under varying environmental and interconnection conditions.

As designed, the PQP will generate data sheet validation for what PVEL said would be more accurate performance and revenue models, reliability evaluations for improved operations and maintenance cost and replacement rate forecast accuracy. It will also provide safety assessments for arc and ground fault detection.
The crowdsourced testing is intended to offer inverter buyers an opportunity to leverage empirical data over the claims of product marketing materials, said PVEL. Ginlong Solis and Chint Power Systems recently submitted 250+ kWh inverters for the traditional PQP, but PVEL said most inverter suppliers do not engage in independent testing that exceeds certification standards.
By contrast, solar module manufacturers more readily take part in PVEL’s PQP. Since 2012, some 50 panel makers have tested their panels with PVEL. Around 25 undergo frequent periodic testing. PVEL said module reliability has improved since the PQP launch. It said that its thermal cycling test has shown an average degradation rate reduction of 70% over that time.

The agreement designates Sungrow to provide the cells, enclosures, cabling, transformers, power converter system (PCS), and all software and controls systems, as well as to provide maintenance services on this tranche of projects, all of which are set to commence construction in 2021 and 2022.
The projects will be specifically supplied with Sungrow’s ST2752UX BESS unit and its PCS SC5000UD-MV inverter.
The supply represents a significant amount of capacity fulfilled for Key Capture, as the 390 MW purchased actually represent a greater battery capacity than Key Capture, which has operated since 2016, has both under construction and in operation, which currently sits at 254 MW.
According to key capture, the company’s installed and under construction capacity is set to increase greatly in the coming years, with more than 3,000 MW of storage projects across the United States in the company’s development pipeline.
“With SK E&S as Key Capture Energy’s new owner and our battery supply locked in through 2022, we look forward to collaborating closely with Sungrow to build and operate lasting and sustainable projects as KCE works to become the leading energy storage company in the United States,” said Co-founder and CEO of Key Capture Energy, Jeff Bishop.

The prize is intended to fund organizations working with disadvantaged communities in clean energy as well as foster connections between DOE and innovators the agency has not previously reached.
Eligible applicants include nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations; state, local, and tribal governments and government entities; for-profit companies; and academic institutions with experience in supporting environmental, climate, and energy justice. The prize is intended to support, create, and identify activities that provide incubation, acceleration, and community-based entrepreneurship and innovation services in climate and clean energy technologies.
In addition, DOE said the prize aims to achieve five goals:
DOE said that teams do not need to have a scientific or engineering background to compete. In Phase One, up to 10 winners will receive an initial cash prize of up to $200,000 each, with the opportunity to receive additional awards. Winners from Phase One will receive in-kind mentorship and other support services. In Phase Two, up to three teams will be awarded cash prizes from a prize pool of $500,000. The prize is open for submissions for Phase One through Feb. 25, 2022.
