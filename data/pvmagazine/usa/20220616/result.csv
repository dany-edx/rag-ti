Through the Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project (ETIPP), DOE experts, national labs, and regional organizations will support projects in communities that often face high energy costs and vulnerable energy infrastructure due to their increased risk of natural disasters caused by climate change. ETIPP further supports the Biden-Administration’s goal of ensuring an equitable transition to a carbon-pollution free future.
“As climate change intensifies, remote and island communities, which experience higher energy costs and may lack the financial resources and expertise to make their energy systems more resilient, are more at risk to extreme weather events,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “DOE will connect 12 more communities with our world-renowned National Labs to execute strategic and locally-tailored clean energy and resilience solutions, driving the nation’s equitable transition to a net-zero economy.”
Remote and island communities often lack the financial resources and the access to experts to plan a clean energy transition. The ETIPP will work with local community leaders, residents, and organizations to help identify what the energy challenges are, and then will provide assistance in establishing a strategy.
The 12 selected communities that were selected through a competitive process are:
“Clean energy availability is one of the keys to unlocking a future of renewable, reliable, and affordable power,” said U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King (ME) in a joint statement. “As home to one of the crown jewels of America’s National Park System, Mount Desert Island has long been a model for environmental stewardship and has made significant strides to preserve Acadia’s natural wonders. We welcome this investment, which will help the community accelerate its plans to increase the resiliency of the local grid and transition to a clean energy future.”
Six regional organizations—Alaska Center for Energy and Power, Coastal Studies Institute, Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, Island Institute, Renewable Energy Alaska Project, and Spark Northwest—will help the selected communities prioritize their energy resilience needs and communicate results throughout their projects. Experts from DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories will work with the communities to conduct technical activities that help decision makers plan resilient upgrades to their energy systems.
Started in 2021, ETIPP’s first participants were composed of 11 communities from Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, and North Carolina. Read about all ETIPP community projects, which are funded by the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/16/to-speed-interconnection-federal-regulators-propose-cluster-studies-and-study-deadlines/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 16, 2022","To speed interconnection, federal regulators propose cluster studies and study deadlines","A proposed rule issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) aims to speed interconnection of utility-scale solar and storage through four key areas of reforms.
More than 1400 GW of generation and storage were waiting in interconnection queues at the end of last year, FERC said in a statement, with the backlogs potentially increasing costs for consumers, and creating reliability issues as “needed new generating facilities” are unable to reach commercial operation in a timely manner.
The draft rule would require transmission providers to adopt a first-ready, first-served cluster study process, with readiness requirements for interconnection customers to remain in the interconnection queue.
First-ready, first-served cluster studies are more efficient than studying interconnection requests one at a time, FERC said. The readiness requirements for project developers involve study deposit amounts, site control, commercial readiness milestones, and withdrawal penalties. The requirements would allow transmission providers to focus on projects that have a greater chance of reaching commercial operation, FERC said.
The draft rule would set firm deadlines for transmission providers to complete interconnection studies, and would establish penalties for missing deadlines. The change would eliminate FERC’s “reasonable efforts” standard for completing the studies. Transmission providers conducting an affected systems study would need to use a standardized and transparent process.
The draft rule would require transmission providers to allow co-located resources, such as solar and storage, to share a single interconnection request. A project developer could add a generating facility to an existing interconnection request if the developer did not request a change to the originally requested interconnection service level.
For solar and wind power, which are “non-synchronous” generators, the draft rule would require the generators to continue providing power and voltage support during grid disturbances.
The proposed rule is a “unanimous action” by the commission, said FERC Chairman Richard Glick. “We are witnessing unprecedented demand for new resources seeking to interconnect to the transmission grid, and queue delays are hindering customers’ access to new, low-cost generation.”
Comments on the proposed rule are due 100 days after its publication in the Federal Register.

The Horizon Solar project is a 200 MW installation with a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with Verizon, which was announced as one of four PPAs between the two companies, as Verizon looks to achieve net zero emissions in the company’s direct operations by 2035.
Construction on the Horizon Solar project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, creating more than 400 construction jobs in that timespan, which Leeward says will be sourced through the local workforce. The project will include solar modules from First Solar and smart solar tracker solutions from NexTracker.
We are pleased to begin construction at our Horizon Solar project,” said Omar Aboudaher, Leeward’s vice president of development. “Today marks another important milestone in the development of the 200 MW Texas solar facility, bringing LRE one step closer to providing clean, renewable energy. We thank the community and officials of Frio County for their support and look forward to a long-term partnership.”
Horizon is Leeward’s second solar installation in Texas, with the other being the company’s 30 MW Barilla Solar project, which it acquired from First Solar in Jan. 2021. In total, Leeward expects to have over 1.2 GW of contracted solar projects in operation by end of 2023 and has approximately 16 GW of solar projects in development and construction.
As for sourcing the components to meet this 16 GW development pipeline, in April, Leeward and First Solar entered into a multi-year framework supply agreement, through which First Solar will provide Leeward with 1 GW of thin-film PV modules for use in Leeward’s US solar development and construction pipeline through 2024.
The deal builds on existing module supply agreements between the two companies, bringing the total supply capacity to  over 3 GW of modules, which are estimated to enable the construction of 18 new solar facilities from 2022 to 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/16/houston-landfill-site-to-host-large-solar-and-energy-storage-system/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 16, 2022",Houston landfill site to host large solar and energy storage system,"A 52 MW solar project is set to be installed on a former landfill site in Houston, Texas, bringing renewable energy closer to the city. Not only does the project make use of land space with limited second-life uses, but it also places electricity generation closer to the demand center of the city, alleviating problems with congestion at the transmission level, a key challenge for the Texas grid.
Most of the project, 50 MW, will be utility-scale electricity, delivered by Centerpoint Energy, and owned and operated by the project developers Wolfe Energy and BQ Energy. The remaining 2 MW will be dedicated as community solar projects.
The project is expected to bring 100 jobs to the local community, create enough power for 5,000 to 10,000 homes with clean, locally generated electricity, and offset 54,432 metric tons of carbon emissions each year, the equivalent of the carbon output of 43,000 gas-powered cars on the road annually.
This April, the project received approval from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to build the array. It is slated to break ground in early 2023 and reach commercial operations in July 2023.
The project will also boost the resilience and reliability of power in the area by adding 150 MWh of battery energy storage. The duration of the energy storage has not been announced, but often batteries range from one to two hours and almost always four or less in the Texas ERCOT grid region.
At the RE+ conference in San Antonio, solar developer 8minute energy said 95% of a 2-hour duration battery’s revenue comes in the first hour of energy dispatch. Most batteries are designed to meet peak energy demand on the Texas grid, rather than the California grid, which has moved to a longer-duration capacity-based energy storage market designed to serve the diurnal cycles of solar generation.
The landfill project was launched in 2017, when the city of Houston joined the C40 Reinventing Cities Competition, a global competition that focuses on transforming underutilized parcels of land into sustainable and resilient urban projects. The city of Houston ran a survey of such parcels and decided the 240-acre former landfill in the Sunnyside community near downtown had great potential for making improvements in both clean energy buildout and environmental justice and economic development goals.
The city issued a request for proposals on how to repurpose the land, and after reviewing the plans, it announced in 2019 that it selected the Sunnyside Energy solar project. The plan called for solar, storage, and an agricultural hub and training center.
Also included in the proposal are plans to create partnerships with the surrounding historically disadvantaged community. House Representative Al Green secured $750,000 in discretionary funds from Congress to create a solar workforce training program at the nearby Sunnyside Community Center.
Houston will lease the land to the Sunnyside Energy group for $1 per year, and the project team will oversee the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the array.
Rocky Mountain Institute said there are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the country, offering an opportunity for solar development. It developed a comprehensive report, “The Future of Landfills is Bright,” designed for elected officials, policymakers, planners, and developers, to learn how landfill solar can be part of a broader clean energy and land-use strategy to achieve ambitious community-wide climate, sustainability, and environmental justice goals.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/16/half-a-penny-for-near-firm-solar-and-trillions-in-renewable-opportunities/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 16, 2022",Half a penny for “near firm” solar and trillions in renewable opportunities,"NextEra, the leading developer of wind, solar and energy storage, in the United States, has put forth their 2022 Investor Conference report. The report is chock-full of great knowledge, and piques our curiosity as to just how much power grid knowledge the firm has hidden away.
Of all the terminology used by NextEra, “near-firm” is this author’s favorite.
NextEra’s description of near-firm “assumes a 4-hour battery to achieve roughly equivalent reliability during peak hours for comparison with dispatchable generation sources.” The technical definition of a near firm solar power plant is one that is coupled to a battery sized at 25% its nameplate capacity, which is capable of providing four hours of energy storage, i.e. 100 MWac solar + 25 MW/100 MWh of energy storage.

This year, the group’s estimated late-2020s cost of near-firm solar power was at $30 to $37 per megawatt hour (or 3-3.7¢/kWh). Last year’s presentation suggested these costs would be 3-4¢/kWh by the middle 2020s.
The energy storage adder for solar power is about 0.4 to 0.6 ¢/kWh, which falls within the range of the 0.4 to 0.9¢/kWh predicted for 2022 in the 2020 Investor Presentation. The half a penny adder also aligns with a market awakening series of bids the company submitted in late 2017 in Colorado.
Considering inflation, it could be that a little panel pricing pressure is acceptable. At the moment, fossil fuels have been driving the majority of global price inflation. NextERA notes that levelized solar costs per kWh have increased by 16%, while fossils have more than doubled, and in some cases, more than quadrupled.

New solar power in 2021 had a 38% price advantage versus new gas fired electricity generation. Today, that price advantage has increased to 48%.
NextEra sees price inflation leading to increasingly expensive renewable energy certificates and electricity prices. The company expects this will lead to even greater demand for renewables.
Looking at the next decade, NextEra already saw the potential for a massive growth in capacity prior to the inflation. The group’s internal analysis, coupled with third party numbers, shows a potential for 30 GW to 50 GW* of wind and solar capacity in the United States to be added from 2022 through 2025.
*All solar capacity values in NextEra presentations are measured as AC (inverter sizing) values. Add ~25-30% to account for modules deployed in DC.

The company expects this value to double through 2026 to 2030, before expanding to 100 GW to 140 GW of new capacity additions annually in the 2031 to 2035 window.
Of this capacity, the company expects that its teams will deploy roughly 22.6 GW to 29.2 GW of wind and solar through the end of 2025. Solar deployments account for 14.3 GWac to 18.5 GWac of that figure, implying that the behemoth company could deploy as much as 24 GWdc of solar module capacity by the middle of this decade.

The company also suggests that they will deploy between 4.9 GW and 6.9 GW of energy storage in that same 2022 to 2025 time period. NextEra tends to deploy four hours of capacity with their energy storage, but that number does vary, and they have not yet released a specific hourly rating.
NextEra said it sees a massive opportunity in decarbonization of the full US economy – not just the power grid. In fact, they are predicting that by 2050, the decarbonization of all sectors of our economy, through the heavy use of hydrogen, will roughly double the nation’s capacity needs.
NextEra has talked about the deployment of hydrogen solutions to corporate and industrial companies in prior presentations. The company notes that their Florida utility – FPL – has an opportunity to deploy 92 GW of solar coupled with 16 GW of hydrogen electrolyzers.

Through 2050, NextEra sees the power sector’s drive towards decarbonization generating an opportunity for 3.55 TW of wind, solar, and storage capacity. In order to supply the hydrogen the company believes is required for supplying broader industries, NextEra believes that an additional 3.5 TW of wind and solar will be needed to make hydrogen green.
This increases potential financial opportunities from approximately $2 trillion to $4 trillion. Over the next 28 years, a deployed capacity of 7,000 GW implies an average of 250 GW each year.

Black Mountain Energy Storage, based in Austin, Texas, developed a +3GW pipeline of utility-scale storage projects in ERCOT territory. The two projects acquired by Recurrent are currently in development, and are in the South Load Zone of the Texas ERCOT market. Each is anticipated to store up to 200 MWh of energy and are expected to reach notice to proceed in 2023 and begin operation in the second quarter of 2024.
The two energy storage installations will be operated as merchant projects, providing dispatchable and reliable power to the ERCOT grid. Recurrent will continue to develop the projects, finalize entitlements and designs, select, and procure equipment, raise project financing, and construct the facilities.
According to Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) latest US Energy Storage Monitor report, the volume of grid-scale energy storage installations in the United States increased four times over that seen in Q1 of 2021, setting a new record in Q1 2022. Overall, the US energy storage market added 955 MW and 2,875 MWh across all segments in the first quarter of 2022.
“ERCOT is one of the fastest growing markets in the world for energy storage, driven by market demand for flexible capacity. We are pleased to accelerate our ERCOT storage pipeline with the acquisition of two projects totaling 400 MWh of storage from Black Mountain Energy Storage,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar. ” We look forward to bringing our storage development, financing and construction experience to bear as we bring these projects to fruition and increase grid reliability for Texans.”
Recurrent Energy functions as Canadian Solar’s US project development arm. With approximately 5 GW of solar and storage projects in development in the United States, Recurrent has developed 2.9 GWh of energy storage projects that are in construction or operation and has an additional pipeline of 15.5 GWh of projects under early to mid-stage development. About a year ago Recurrent received approval from the Bureau of Land Management for the Crimson Solar Project, a $550 million, 350 MW solar energy and similarly sized energy storage project on public lands in California that will deliver power through the Southern California Edison Colorado River Substation.
The transactions were executed through the LevelTen Asset Marketplace, a platform that connects clean energy project developers and financiers, and provides the software, analytics and M&A transaction expertise they need to execute transactions quickly.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/16/as-evs-drive-off-with-li-ion-supply-the-push-to-stationary-storage-alternatives-accelerates/,"BATTERY,EV,GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 16, 2022","As EVs drive off with Li-Ion supply, the push to stationary storage alternatives accelerates","From pv magazine global.
Mining and refinement capacity simply cannot keep up. Experts from mining industry prognosticators to Elon Musk foresee a widening chasm between li-ion supply and demand over the next few years. As that gap expands, expect the stationary renewable storage market to adopt emerging technologies more aligned with the needs of the stational market – and expect organizations to diversify well beyond Li-ion to meet energy demands and advance their renewable transformation goals.
Li-ion batteries are particularly suited to electric vehicle (EV) use cases: Li-ion’s energy density is required to make EVs viable. As EV adoption increases over the next decade, so too will Li-ion costs as lithium supply pressures grow in severity. In short, EVs will eat up Li-ion supply out of necessity, while alternatives already better-suited to stationary use cases carve out their own niche.
Such stationary alternatives aren’t just going to be more affordable, they’ll also be matched to their purpose. As a battery technology, Li-ion has been the standard, but it has limits. Li-ion batteries bring comparatively high operating expenses. They supply power for relatively short durations. They struggle in locations with extreme temperatures – which an ever-increasing swath of the world falls into. They’re also limited in their lifespans, and show environmental and safety issues over the long term.
These challenges leave the future open to alternatives more appropriate to stationary applications. While lead-acid and redox flow batteries struggle with many of the same issues as lithium-ion, other technologies aim to improve on where Li-ion falters.
In my view, there are three energy storage technology categories quickly maturing and with a clear potential to lead the stationary energy storage market into the future.
Metal-hydrogen batteries
Metal-hydrogen batteries differentiate from lithium-ion by bringing similarly-low-cost materials to longer battery life spans (ergo, promising superior long-term cost efficiency). Those lifespans can top 30 years, and do so without Li-ion’s safety or environmental risks.
Metal-hydrogen is a proven technology that particularly excels in extreme conditions: the battery chemistry is newly adapted from orbital spacecraft such as the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope, where metal-hydrogen batteries have now completed more than 200 million cell-hours.
Metal-hydrogen batteries are able to perform 30,000 charge/discharge cycles without degradation, and operate in ambient temperatures ranging from -40° to 60 °C. Because they have no moving parts, they eliminate the need for regular maintenance.
Cost-per-kilowatt-hour cycles for these batteries can reach as little as a couple of pennies. The performance and longevity promise of these batteries will first put them into large-scale stationary renewable energy storage use cases involving harsh climates and remote locations, such as solar plants, wind farms, or micro-grids in deserts or other severe, hard-to-reach environments, but their flexibility portends widespread adoption in a multitude of use cases.
Gravity-assisted batteries
Gravity-assisted batteries leverage towers up to 500 feet that are tethered to systems of cranes, cables, and pulleys that support large bricks of composite materials. Software orchestrating this large and quite-stationary mechanism can elevate the bricks to store energy, and then lower the bricks to send energy out to the grid.
By design, each brick represents an individual store of energy, and multiple bricks can easily be manipulated simultaneously using the puppeteer-like arrangement of pulleys and cranes. In this way, gravity-assisted batteries offer high-speed energy delivery or absorption, with millisecond response times.
The system relies on affordable commodity equipment and offers differentiating benefits to a variety of use cases. These include quickly restoring power to a grid after an outage, providing backup energy, or balancing grid energy—especially that supplied from renewables which deliver energy intermittently.
One drawback to gravity-assisted batteries for some scenarios is that they require a lot of space to operate. While they might not be suited for urban applications, deserts represent a sweet spot for the technology.
Brownfield, Superfund, and old mining or extraction sites have been proposed as ideal locations for gravity-assisted batteries. As the mechanical designs have yet to be proven on a large scale, some uncertainty remains—particularly around the design and cost of O&M. Still, it’s an interesting concept.
Sodium-ion batteries
The future of sodium-ion batteries is more of a direct replacement to lithium-ion. The technology offers competitive improvements across several areas. Sodium-ion uses sustainable and available materials with considerably less of an environmental impact. At the same time, they are also low cost and project to at least match the energy density of lithium-ion through ongoing iteration.
Existing facilities that manufacture li-ion batteries could be converted to produce sodium-ion batteries, making it a seamless drop-in technology upgrade for stationary energy storage.
Because of energy density and performance similarity to lithium-ion, sodium batteries will likely be allocated to e-mobility applications rather than stationary storage, but they represent a potential, viable alternative to lithium-ion nonetheless.
Maturing range of technologies
Li-ion has been a foundational technology, accelerating renewable energy storage to the position it has reached today. That said, Li-ion largely achieved its status as the de facto technology because it was the only one available. Now, a maturing range of technologies has arrived to address needs across an expanding breadth of use cases, and some will serve those applications better than others.
Expect the next decades to witness a more competitive landscape, where the market selects the most powerful and valuable storage technologies for each specific purpose. Use cases will evolve to provide more value with the flexible and simple approaches now available to the market.
