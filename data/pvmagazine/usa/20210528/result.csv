The bill’s approach has many across the industry describing it as shocking and dangerous.
The legislation, Assembly Bill 1139, was written by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, chair of the Assembly’s Appropriations Committee.
The bill includes a laundry list of initiatives that would devalue rooftop solar and distributed energy resources; eliminate 20-year legacy credit rates for NEM 1.0 and 2.0 customers, including schools and farms, which would threaten project economics and payback periods; and introduce a new “grid access” monthly charge that would add $50-$86/month for the typical residential solar user.
“Proposals that roll back NEM really, in turn, roll back the bill savings opportunities for customers who need them the most,” Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy as SunPower, told pv magazine USA.
The amount by which NEM and other distributed energy policies have expanded access and reduce utility bill costs for low- to middle-income Californians cannot be understated. According to Leta, half of all new residential rooftop solar customers in California are in low- and middle-income areas.
Devaluing and undercutting residential solar is also an issue that threatens grid stability in a state known for disruptions and outages.
“The fact that this bill is even being proposed in the California State Legislature is shocking,” said Leta. “There are serious consumer protection issues with the bill, given that it makes changes retroactively on the million-plus rooftop solar customers in the state.”
Previous changes to the state’s NEM have been made prospectively by state regulators, meaning that new customers adhere to the new rules and rates, while existing customers remain with the 20-year rates they had when they first installed their system. That means there is almost no precedent for changing NEM architecture for existing customers because of the risk that doing so can derail the economics of their installation, some of which have been in place for years.
AB 1139 and contains provisions relating to higher-level state energy policy. As it currently stands, any CPUC proceeding or decision regarding NEM must take into consideration the sustainable growth of solar and distributed energy resources, as well as ensuring that any changes to policy or incentives are gradual. AB 1139 would eliminate those provisions.

Utilities are also currently required to account for the grid savings benefits of distributed energy resources when they do their investment planning. AB 1139 would eliminate that provision, too.
The bill also would require the CPUC to make its own decision regarding a NEM successor tariff by February 2022. If this is not accomplished, the bill then would require the CPUC to institute the following measures:
The potential ramifications of AB 1139 extend beyond California. For years, states with nascent solar energy markets looked to California as a model for energy policy and incentive programs. As other states matured, the California models were applied to other aspects of clean energy like energy efficiency measures and electric vehicles.
So, if the state that historically has been used as a model abandons one of the most critical elements of the clean energy transition, the move may give immediate precedent to any state or utility looking to gut rooftop solar’s growth.
More than 100 organizations across California and the country have expressed opposition to the proposed measure. Opponents include the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA), Solar Energy Industries Association, Advanced Energy Economy, Earth Justice, Vote Solar, Environment California, Sierra Club, and the Solar Rights Alliance.
In addition, roughly 22,000 people have emailed their Assembly member asking them to vote against AB 1139. An additional 2,300 have called their Assembly member asking for a no vote, according to data provided by SunPower, the Solar Rights Alliance, and CALSSA.

Solar module producer Longi announced May 26 that the prices of all its wafer products will be raised in June.
The G1 products with the size of 158.75mm were priced at RMB4.79 per piece, with an increase of RMB0.40, 9.1%, compared to the previous value.
The new price for M6 wafers with the size of 166mm increased by RMB0.40 to RMB4.89 per piece.
The 182mm M10 wafers were priced at RMB5.87 per piece, up RMB0.48.
It is the second time that Longi has raised its prices in May, after doing so on May 14.
The silicon branch of the China Nonferrous Metals Association reported that polysilicon reached a price of RMB200-210 per kg, and that the highest price exceeded RMB230 per kg. Major downstream buyers and upstream suppliers are in price negotiations for long-term supply orders for next month.
According to industry sources, many prices for long-term orders have risen to around RMB200 per kilo and even higher. Some buyers have started trying to settle price for July.
Since average supply prices rise sharply, industry observers say wafer prices are estimated to continue growing in June.

The plan calls for retiring 484 MW of coal-fired generating capacity in late 2023. And it said it will use a competitive contracting process to select projects for the planned 350 MW of solar capacity to be added in 2023 and 2024.
Through 2030, the utility said it plans to add 3,200 MW of renewable generation, including both solar and wind. It said this is an increase of 2,700 MW over its 2020 IRP update.
At the end of last year, solar, landfill, and hydroelectric sources lumped together made up less than 1% of the utility’s generating mix. Coal accounted for 37% and wind for around 25%. By 2030, solar is forecast to make up 13% of the utility’s resource mix. That grows to 17% by 2040, according to the IRP.
At the end of last year, solar, landfill, and hydroelectric sources lumped together made up less than 1% of the utility’s generating mix.

The Kansas filing includes the same forecasted generation additions and retirements announced in April. Evergy said its move toward more sustainable energy sources advances the goal to reduce carbon emissions 70% by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels) and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. Achieving those goals will depend on technology, regulatory, and legislative enablers, it said.
The utility identified additional coal-fired capacity that is slated for retirement by 2040:
Evergy said it expects its coal plants will run fewer hours as their energy is displaced by lower-cost renewable resources. However, it said that reliability challenges driven by the extreme weather of February 2021 “demonstrated the value of dispatchable generation with fuel on the ground.”
The utility’s IRP is a triennial filing that sets an implementation plan through 2024 and describes expectations for meeting longer-term energy needs through 2040. Evergy serves around 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri.

Public Service Company of New Mexico submitted a notice of default for part of the San Juan Generating Station replacement plan. The utility warned that it faces potential resource shortfalls and issued a request for proposals for 200 MW of generating capacity to be available by June 2022.
The utility said that its resource outlook is further clouded by market conditions impacted by the California energy crisis in 2020 and illustrated by Texas’ winter storm in February. Those events threw into doubt assumptions that as much as 200 MW of outside resources would be available to meet any shortfall in New Mexico.
PNM VP of generation Tom Fallgren reportedly told a local news outlet, “We needed to raise a red flag that the Rockmont project won’t make the target date.” California-based 8minute Solar is behind the Rockmont project, which the utility reported was in default.
A spokeperson for 8minute Solar told pv magazine USA, “Though the operational date of Rockmont has been pushed out, we remain committed to working alongside our trusted partners at PNM to help New Mexico reach its 100% clean electricity goals.”
The Rockmont project makes up about 14% of the 950 MW of total San Juan replacement power that regulators approved last year.
The utility issued an RFP on May 24 that aims to acquire up to 200 MW of firm, long-term or short-term capacity that can be available on or before June 1, 2022. It issued a second RFP seeking an additional 500 MW of new firm, long-term or short-term capacity to meet load growth needs by June 1, 2023.
IHS Markit and the Procurement Executives Group said that engineering and construction costs rose for a seventh consecutive month in May. The headline Engineering and Construction Cost Index read 78.8 in May. That was 6.3 index points higher than in April. A materials and equipment sub-index recorded a sixth consecutive monthly increase, rising 4.6 points to reach 83.1. A separate subcontractor labor index read 68.6, up 10.3 index points from April.
Within the materials and equipment sub-index, all categories showed price increase. A statement said that index levels fell for two categories, ocean freight costs and fabricated structural steel, remained in expansion territory but fell compared to April. The movement indicated pricing pressures for those categories were less widespread in May.

All other categories experienced increases in index totals from April to May. Copper prices continued to rise, recording the eleventh straight month of price increases with an index figure of 87.5. That was the highest reading for this sub-index since January. Costs of ocean freight from both Europe and Asia to the United States rose for a ninth month in a row, reaching an index figure of 83.3.
“The China containerized freight index has been sitting at a level greater than 1,000 since the fourth quarter of 2020, having last breached the four-digit mark more than five years ago,” said Tal Dickstein, senior economist at IHS Markit.
Continued high volumes along this route indicate that demand remains strong. Dickstein said that markets are entering a seasonally high demand period as well, “meaning tightness will continue over the summer and prices will remain elevated.”
The sub-index for current subcontractor labor costs rose for a fourth straight month, recording an index level of 68.6 in May, a “significant increase” from April’s index figure of 58.3. According to survey responses, labor costs rose for sub-indices representing each region of the United States and Canada.
Six-month headline expectations for future construction costs index totaled 70.4 in May, showing respondents’ expectations of continued price increases into the fourth quarter. The six-month expectations index for the materials and equipment component equaled 69.3 this month; the six-month expectations index for sub-contractor labor recorded a reading of 73.0, as labor costs are expected to continue increasing in all regions of the United States and Canada.
