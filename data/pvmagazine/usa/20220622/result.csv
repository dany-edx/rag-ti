The developer chose Boviet’s Vega Series 550 W PERC ( (passivated emitter and rear cell) )monocrystalline bifacial double-glass PV modules. The developer’s name has not yet been disclosed.
The Vega Series panels feature high-purity monocrystalline wafer technology combined with PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar, and large cell design modules. The 550 W module features 10 busbars, 144 cells, a silver frame, and a transparent backsheet. It holds a module efficiency of 21.1%, and a system voltage of 1000/1500 V DC. It has a maximum power output of 433 W, and is rated to operate between –40 degrees F to 185 degrees F.
Each module measures 90.40 x 44.65 x 1.38 inches and weighs just under 64 lbs. It has a 25-year linear output warranty with 2.5% degradation in the first year and less than 0.6% from the second year until the end of the warranty. It also comes with a standard 12-year product warranty.
The solar modules have been a PVEL top performance product on its scorecard since 2019, and BloombergNEF Tier 1 status since 2017. BloombergNEF’s tiering system for PV module manufacturers is primarily based on bankability, the most important feature of a utility-scale solar module for most developers. 
In May, the company was listed as a “Top Performer” in PV Evolutions Labs’ (PVEL) 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard for the fourth consecutive time.
“We congratulate Boviet Solar for having modules listed in all of the Scorecard’s Top Performer categories,” said Tristan Erion-Lorico PVEL VP of sales and marketing . “PVEL commends Boviet for the strong results they have demonstrated throughout our rigorous testing.”
“Boviet Solar continues to be a reliable source of top-quality PV modules for the American market. This ability to deliver modules despite the uncertainties affecting the US solar industry is critical for our customers and their projects, and it remains a priority for Boviet Solar,” said Sienna Cen, president of Boviet Solar USA.
Shift to new technology
This April, Boviet announced it is developing new module technologies to meet the evolving needs of project developers. It is working on a new N-tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell technology, which it claims is more efficient and stable. It is also working on a second R&D project to integrate N-TOPCon cells into 600W+ modules. The modules will feature advanced casing and will benefit from a low temperature coefficient, low attenuation, and higher double-sided ratios, said Boviet.
In addition, Boviet Solar said it is targeting heterojunction (HJT) cell technology. It said it expects HJT to become the next-generation mainstream technology, with an efficiency rating of 27.5%.
Boviet is not the only company switching to TOPCon. The world’s major solar manufacturers can be expected to switch from industry-standard PERC products to TOPCon technology “within the next few years,” according to one US analyst.
The technological shift prompted by manufacturers nearing PERC’s conversion efficiency threshold of 23.7% – for commercially produced products – is one of the predictions made by Denver-based Clean Energy Associates (CEA) in its survey of the solar manufacturing industry during the last three months of 2021.

The Grandview solar project will now be developed, owned, and operated by Sol Systems, and the company shares that it is currently exploring ways to enable local employment opportunities and additional community benefits alongside the project development and operations activities.
Community engagement will be a critical aspect for the project moving forward, as the projects development has sparked some pushback from local residents, some of whom are concerned about the project’s proximity to residential areas, and others of whom are against the development of renewable energy resources entirely.
“This acquisition builds on Sol Systems’ significant footprint in the Midwest,” said Yuri Horwitz, CEO of Sol Systems. “We are eager to kick-off the construction phase of this project which will bring new clean energy and opportunities to the local community and region.”
The significant footprint that Horwitz references includes a 540MW solar development portfolio in southeast Illinois that Sol Systems recently acquired from Arevon Energy. The portfolio consists of three 180MWdc solar energy projects located across Hamilton, Randolph, Saline, and White counties. Sol Systems will own and operate the portfolio and will work with energy developer Tenaska to develop and construct the projects. Tenaska’s development portfolios include nearly 22 GW of solar, wind, and energy storage projects. 
Upon completion, the portfolio will produce enough solar energy per year to power nearly 77,000 homes and offset the equivalent of nearly 140 thousand passenger vehicles’ emissions. 
To date, Sol has developed and/or financed over 1GW of solar projects valued at more than $1 billion for Fortune 100 companies, municipalities, counties, utilities, universities, and schools and provides services to nearly 18,000 customers across the US.

Renewable Energy Evolution developed, designed, and installed the system, which is one of the largest Illinois Solar for All projects in the city of Chicago. Illinois Solar for All is a program that assists low-income households and non-profit organization use state incentives to go solar.
Terrasmart, the renewable energy arm of Gibraltar Industries, supplied the fixed-tilt racking system for the two surface-lot canopies that make up the 162 kW solar carport. The Terrasmart carport produces solar energy while providing shade for Chicago Urban League visitors.
“We are excited about what this means for environmental justice across our communities in Chicago,” said project lead Andrew Wells, vice president of the Workforce Development Center at the Chicago Urban League. “Our project is bringing greater awareness, inclusion, and access to the clean energy economy for the people of the South Side.”
The solar system highlights the Chicago Urban League’s further commitment to advancing the community’s access to renewable energy. In 2017, the League launched two training programs in solar installation and PV sales through its Workforce Development Center program with solar incentives from Illinois Solar for All. Its annual cohort of 75 trainees has access to renewable energy job fairs, held in partnership with organizations such as the Illinois Solar Energy Association, the Solar Energy Industries Association, and the Coalition for Community Solar Access.
“We are honored to have played a part in such a monumental project,” said Ed McKiernan, president of Terrasmart. “Not only is this the largest PV commercial installation in the city of Chicago, but it’s an important milestone in providing more equitable access to the solar economy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/22/perovskite-solar-module-march-continues-with-30-year-no-thickness-layers-and-speed-testing/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 22, 2022",Perovskite solar module march continues with 30-year “no thickness” layers and speed testing,"Researchers around the world have been ‘tuning out the defects’ of perovskite solar cells, and are now much closer to manufacturing long lasting, cheap, high efficiency (over 30%) modules.
When Covid-19 temporarily subsided in the fall of 2020, a group of Princeton researchers returned to campus to find that one of their experiments on perovskite solar cell layers had run for almost six months with nearly zero loss of efficiency.
 

Cross section of cell showing Cs2PbI2Cl2 2D capping layer atop CsPbI3 perovskite solar cell layer. 
At that moment, the scientists recognized that they had discovered a thin layer that gave their perovskite cells a much longer lifespan, and that they needed to greatly speed up their testing procedures.
In their paper, Accelerated aging of all-inorganic, interface-stabilized perovskite solar cells, the scientists describe a layer so thin – a few atoms – they call it “2D”, and sometimes describe it as having no thickness at all. The layer is placed on the perovskite solar cell, ‘capping’ and protecting the photovoltaic material from breaking down.
The ultra-thin capping layer – Cs2PbI2Cl2 – fits between the charge carrying layer, made of cupric salt mixed with other materials, and the CsPbI3 based perovskite solar cells. The capping layer was estimated at 20 nanometers in thickness.
The scientists noted that in order to maximize the thermal and photostability of their cells, they chose a slightly less efficient, all inorganic perovskite solar cell material combination.

In the images above, the scientists showed the uncapped and capped solar cells as they are tested over periods up to 4,000 hours under different temperatures. The capped solar cell tested at 35° C showed zero efficiency losses after 3,551 hours.
Extrapolating these test results suggests that the perovskite layer, with its capping in place, would last for at least 30 years, retaining more than 80% of its original output under standard outside conditions.
The accelerated testing technique – seemingly very simple – was to blow hot air at increasing temperatures, which would generate additional wear and tear, simulating additional time going on. The perovskite solar cells were aged under continuous illumination from a Philips metal-halide lamp – specifically the Philips MSR 1200 HR.

After the testing, when placing the solar cells under microscopes, you can see the differences after 2,000 hours of testing between capped and uncapped units.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/22/renewables-may-replace-hydro-dams-to-restore-endangered-salmon/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WASHINGTON",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 22, 2022",Renewables may replace hydro dams to restore endangered salmon,"A process launched by Governor Jay Inslee and US Senator Patty Murray, both of Washington, is evaluating breaching four dams in the lower Snake River, and replacing their generating capacity with renewables.
The potential to increase salmon populations in the Snake River basin is the “main factor” prompting interest in breaching the dams, says a draft report commissioned by Governor Inslee’s office. The locations of the four dams, all in southeast Washington, are shown in the image below from Trout Unlimited with the labels 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Building 1.3 GW of solar, 1.4 GW of wind power and 0.2 GW of battery capacity would be the lowest-cost option for replacing the four dams’ annual generation in a way that would balance the region’s substantial remaining hydropower generation. That resource mix would provide high output in late summer, when electrical load is high and hydropower output is low. That’s according to an analysis, cited in the draft report, prepared by the energy consultancy Energy Strategies.
The four dams produce about 11% of the total hydropower generation from 31 federal dams in the Columbia River basin, and about 4% of all generation in the Pacific Northwest, the draft report says.
Salmon recovery
Chinook salmon populations in the Snake River, a major tributary of the Columbia River, have fallen 99% from their historic abundance, from 1.5 million to 15,000, the draft report shows, with similar declines in populations of other fish species. The data were compiled by a task force convened by the US agency NOAA Fisheries and its Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee.

Many runs of Snake River salmon and steelhead “are rapidly reaching the quasi-extinction threshold (QET), or the point at which population levels are so low that the population is uncertain to persist, and the probability of recovery is low without substantial intervention,” says the draft report, citing data reported by the Nez Perce Tribe. The image above presents data illustrating this point.
“The dams’ impact to salmon runs was predicted in advance by tribes and others,” the draft report adds.
The proposal to breach the dams “represents the most significant action considered to date to reverse the cumulative trend toward destruction of tribal resources, the taking of tribal Treaty-protected wealth by non-Indians, and the consequent damaging of tribal peoples,” says a report from the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, which represents four tribes in the area.
The National Congress of American Indians adopted a resolution last year calling for federal funding to restore the lower Snake River by breaching the four lower Snake River dams.
Congressional authorization would be needed for the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the four dams, to pursue breaching the dams, says the draft report for Governor Inslee. The draft report lists five more procedural steps to moving forward with dam breaching: “establishing timelines and milestones for results, agreement on a comprehensive funding strategy, additional analyses to maximize benefits at all stages of the process, continued technological advancements and implementation of a significant infrastructure program.”
A Nez Perce Tribe staff presentation last year reported that 42% of the Snake River Basin spring/summer Chinook salmon populations have natural origin spawner abundance at or below the quasi-extinction threshold of 50 spawning fish, with 77% of the populations predicted to drop below the critical level of 50 spawners by 2025.
Cost and benefits
The draft report for Governor Inslee focuses on the cost to replace the electricity and other services provided by the dams and their reservoirs.
Benefits of recreational fishing that’s been improved by restoring the salmon fisheries in the Columbia River Basin have been estimated at $1 billion in annual revenues, the draft report says. The potential value of improving the Pacific Ocean commercial salmon fishery is not estimated; some of those benefits would flow to tribes due to treaty rights.
Breaching the dams would drain the four reservoirs behind the dams, says the draft report, allowing tribal peoples to return to more than 600 locations, “where they were accustomed to live, fish, and hunt.”
Public comments on the draft report will be accepted through July 11, 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/06/22/construction-complete-on-largest-solar-farm-in-nebraska/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,NEBRASKA",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 22, 2022",Construction complete on largest solar farm in Nebraska,"The City of Norfolk, Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD), and members of the community are celebrating the completion of construction of what is currently the largest solar farm in the state. The 8.5 MW solar installation is paired with NPPD’s first large-scale battery storage system, capable of storing up to 2 MWh. It’s also a pollinator habitat, and it was led by an all-woman development team.
In a state that in 2021 ranked 47th in the country for installed solar and was deriving only .22% of its electricity from solar (according to the Solar Energy Industries Association), this system gives the state a serious boost.
The system is developed and operated by Sol Systems in partnership with EPC firm GenPro Energy Solutions and real estate development firm Mesner Development. With woman comprising only 30% of the solar workforce, having an all-woman development team sets this project apart. Anna Noucas, director of origination, led the competitive RFP process submission and contract negotiations after the project was awarded. Anna’s initial Norfolk team consisted of Jill Rathke, business development associate; Lauren Aycock, project engineer; and Erin Hickok, senior investment analyst. In the development phase, Bridget Callahan, project development manager, led the coordination of site studies and the project’s interconnection process with NPPD. Meg Pieper, pre-construction manager, helped set construction timelines and worked to ensure project goals and needs were communicated .
The project is part of NPPD’s SunWise program, a community solar initiative where customers who sign up to obtain a share will receive an electricity bill credit.
In addition, the site was planted with plants that will enhance pollinator populations. The inclusion and design of the pollinator habitat was completed by performance engineer Juliana Isaac.
Part of NPPD’s community solar program, SunWise, the solar installation will enable Norfolk residents to purchase the energy produced at a fixed price to offset normal retail electricity. Sol Systems and NPPD entered a 30-year power purchase agreement, providing a fixed cost of energy for NPPD and Norfolk residents for decades.
“The Norfolk community solar facility is going into operation, and it is great to officially celebrate the completion of the state’s largest solar facility,” says Brittney Koenig, account manager at NPPD. “Norfolk customers who have signed up for community solar shares began to see a credit on their bill starting in June.”
Sol Systems partnered with Northeast Community College (NECC) and awarded three scholarships to students interested in the school’s Electrical Construction and Control Program. In further partnership with NECC, GenPro established internships for students enrolled in the Electrical Construction and Control Program, providing them with hands-on experience helping to construct the array.
“Sol Systems is proud to be a part of this solar + storage project with NPPD and the City of Norfolk because it fully captures what is at the core of Sol’s mission,” said Anna Toenjes, senior director of business development at Sol Systems. “The project will service this community with clean, renewable energy for decades while creating strong community impact through our scholarship work with NECC. In addition, I am personally proud to have been a part of an all-female team at Sol that led the contract negotiations, development and financing of this solar + storage project.”
