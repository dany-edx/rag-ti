The expansion of a partnership between the developer and the onshored solar module manufacturer is the largest equipment purchase in history for the community solar market. For the companies, the order represents the beginning of bringing U.S.-made clean energy projects to communities both large and small, they said in a joint company statement.
Vice President Kamala Harris commemorated the agreement during brief remarks made today while at Qcells’ Dalton, Ga. facility during a White House webcast.
“I am proud to be in Dalton today to announce the largest community solar order in American history—made possible by the investments our administration has made to expand American manufacturing and increase demand for clean energy,” said Harris.  “When we invest in climate, clean energy, and manufacturing, we invest in America. President Biden and I will continue to fight to create opportunity in every community.”
Kimberly Richardson, Q Cells’ recycling assistant manager at the Dalton, Ga., facility, introduced the vice president during the webcast.  Richardson said it was an honor to welcome a fellow African-American woman to the Georgia facility, in addition to being able to work at a company that is now producing 12,000 solar panels each day, with more jobs to come in the coming years.
Arlington, Va.-based Summit Ridge said its first portfolio of 200 MW of projects using Qcells modules will be installed by the end of 2023. Once complete, the projects will provide enough clean energy to power 140,000 homes and businesses. The agreement between the companies also includes 20 MWh of energy storage, they said.
A majority of panels purchased by the developer will be produced in Georgia. The deal is one of the clearest validations yet of the Inflation Reduction Act’s positive impact on spurring domestic sourced content in concert with a U.S. project developer.
Community solar projects are a method of providing solar to individuals and businesses unable to install solar panels because they rent housing or lack the ability to go solar for other reasons. Typically, multiple customers can subscribe and receive a credit on their utility bill for their share of power produced, just as if the panels were on their own roof.
The 1.2 GW panel agreement builds on the existing relationship between SRE and Qcells, including a recent  partnership to deploy three standalone energy storage projects in New York City that total more than 46 MWh using the Qcells Geli energy management system.
It also comes shortly after Qcells announced plans to invest $2.5 billion to build a fully integrated, silicon-based supply chain in the U.S., making the company the first to do so. When complete, Qcells solar panels — from polysilicon to the finished panel — will be entirely made in the U.S.
“We must continue to find ways to bring affordable electricity to everyday Americans, particularly communities that have historically relied on fossil fuels,” said Steve Raeder, chief executive officer of Summit Ridge. “The IRA has provided important incentives to drive clean energy adoption and meet climate targets, and now the industry needs partnerships like the one between Qcells and Summit Ridge to put policy into practice.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/06/renewables-to-represent-69-of-u-s-capacity-additions-through-mid-century/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 6, 2023",Renewables to represent 69% of U.S. capacity additions through mid-century,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides both near-term and long-term projections for capacity additions across all generation profiles. The technology showing some of the most long-term promise, particularly in light of the $369 billion climate and energy package in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is solar. 
Based on 16 different scenarios, cumulative solar deployment across residential, commercial, and utility scale could range between 536 GW to 1.4 TW by 2050. The IRA may lead to as much as an additional 274 GW of solar deployment over pre-policy projections.
Across all cases, a range of about 700 GW to 1,124 GW of new renewable capacity, from solar, wind and energy storage, will be added over the projection period. Renewables represent about 65% of cumulative additions over the projection period without the IRA. In the reference case, renewables represent 69% of new buildout.
Solar and wind generation together increase from 15% of total generation in 2022 to 39% in the no-IRA case by the end of the projection period. IRA provisions in EIA’s reference case push wind and solar to 56% of electricity generation by 2050.
EIA said energy consumption may rise by as much as 15% by 2050, driving demand for solar buildout. Federal, state, local, and utility carbon reduction goals, as well as a push for corporate solar procurement and consumer interest in clean technologies will all drive demand forward. This demand will be amplified by provisions in the IRA, which include investment tax credits, production tax credits, grants, pilot funding, and more. 
However, these capacity additions and emissions reductions range widely based on assumptions of how the IRA is implemented, and how bonus credits within the legislation are appropriated. Low-case projections for IRA bonus content place renewables buildout in a similar range to a no IRA environment, suggesting that there is still a need for guidance from authorities to evaluate the true effect of the historic legislation. 
EIA’s reference case places cumulative solar deployment at 920 GW by 2050, about 194 GW more than the no IRA case. The administration’s Issues in Focus: Inflation Reduction Act Cases in the AEO2023 takes a deeper dive into the 16 scenarios that may unfold. 
As seen below, in the distributed generation space, EIA expects a strong rise in adoption of residential solar through 2050. Commercial solar is expected to peak out around 80 GW of capacity mid-century, while residential solar will continue to sharply rise towards 160 GW of deployed capacity. EIA projects that over 19.5 million U.S. households will have adopted solar by 2050.
In the reference and high renewables uptake cases, CO2 emissions from the electric power sector decline about 72% to 75% by the end of the projection period below the 2005 levels. This is compared with a 58% reduction in a no IRA case.
Upon passage of the IRA, Nat Kreamer, chief executive officer of Advanced Energy Economy said, “Clean energy manufacturers and developers alike will now have the right financial tools and the policy certainty they need to produce and buy the components that power these innovative technologies here in America. That’s going to translate into millions of family-supporting jobs and billions in energy savings for American households.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/06/historic-new-orleans-opera-house-goes-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,LOUISIANA",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 6, 2023",Historic New Orleans opera house goes solar,"A building steeped in history adds another chapter. The Marigny Opera House in New Orleans, La., also known as the Church of the Arts, has activated its new 32.56 kW solar array.  
Developed by residential and commercial installer Solar Alternatives, the array is comprised of 88 panels across two southeast-facing rooftop seam metal planes. 
A spokesperson for Solar Alternatives told pv magazine USA the developer selected Silfab 370 W solar modules for the installation. The system also includes Enphase IQ8A microinverters, combined in an AC combiner panel. The panels were mounted on a Unirac Solar mount and attached to the roof using S-5! Clamp style attachments, the spokesperson said.
The opera house organization is expected to save $6,200 on utility bills in its first year, leading to more than $257,000 in estimated savings across the 30-year lifetime of the project.
Opened in 1853, the Marigny Opera House began as a Catholic parish church before it was closed in 1997. In 2012, the building underwent a revival, reopening a performance venue for dance, theatre, opera, jazz, classical music, and special events. These performances will now be powered by local, clean energy.
“As a community arts venue and institution, we aim to operate responsibly and sustainably. This solar array will allow the Opera House to save money, become more self-reliant, and set an example in the fight against the climate crisis,” said Evan Hammond, General Manager. “This is the largest step, among some other operational changes, towards the ultimate goal of net-zero operation.”
The opera house is located in a historic district within New Orleans and was therefore subject to extra restrictions and permitting requirements managed by the city’s historic district and landmarks commission.
Solar Alternatives were required to minimize the visibility of the rooftop array from the street and keep the array in continuous rectangular shape. After submitting additional architectural drawings of the design, the project was approved by the historic district commission. 
“The Opera House is a great example of how preservation and clean energy can be compatible and also enhance the financial security of our most valued arts communities. Marigny Opera House has shown its leadership on climate change, renewable energy, and sustainability with this groundbreaking investment,” said Solar Alternatives, Jeffrey Cantin.
Solar Alternatives is a solar power and microgrid design-build firm in the Gulf Coast region. Founded in 2008, the company serves Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.

Qcells will supply 2.5 million solar panels which will eventually generate enough clean electricity to power 140,000 homes and businesses, including households in underserved communities, according to a White House statement.
Community solar results in an average of 10% in annual savings for customers and is a way for renters and those without access to rooftop solar to benefit from clean energy, the White House noted.
Vice President Kamala Harris will commemorate the Summit Ridge-Qcells supply agreement today during a press event at Qcells’ Dalton, Georgia manufacturing facility, with a livestream scheduled to begin at 1:50 p.m. ET.
In January, Qcells announced a $2.5 billion investment in Georgia to build a solar supply chain, the largest clean energy production investment in U.S. history.
The announcement is just one of the many investments we are seeing across Georgia to build our clean energy economy and invest in industries of the future. And the announcement is happening because of the actions the Biden-Harris Administration took to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS and Science Act. This week, ABB and Kia made new clean energy and electric vehicle announcements in Georgia and partially attributed those investments to the Inflation Reduction Act.
Qcells’ total solar panel production capacity in Georgia is expected to reach 8.4 GW by 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/06/tesla-master-plan-projects-3-tw-of-solar-and-6-5-twh-of-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 6, 2023",Tesla Master Plan projects 3 TW of solar and 6.5 TWh of storage,"Tesla has unveiled the third iteration of its Master Plan series, outlining the company’s vision for transitioning the United States and the world toward a sustainable future powered by clean electricity generation sources. The report covers a wide range of topics, including electricity generation, energy storage, transportation, investments, mineral use, heat pumps, electrification of industrial heating, recycling, and the electrification of boats and planes.

The document projects a need for 30 TW of predominantly wind and solar capacity, along with 240 TWh of energy storage. The Master Plan’s bibliography cites numerous data sources, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Fraunhofer, the International Energy Association, and Princeton University’s Net Zero America plan.
The plan envisions a global deployment of 18.3 TW of solar power, 12.1 GW of wind power, and 2.5 TW of electrolyzers. The generation sources will supply 112 TWh of vehicle batteries, 40 TWh of plane and ship batteries, 46.2 TWh of stationary ‘e-chem’ batteries, 41.4 TWh of thermal batteries, and a substantial 642 TWh of hydrogen storage.

For the United States, the report proposes 3 TW of solar generation, which includes 15 million residential rooftops, industrial storage paired with 43 GW of commercial rooftop solar, 1.9 TW of onshore wind, and 64 GW of offshore wind. No new nuclear generation was considered.
In addition to generation resources, the Master Plan estimates a need for 6.5 TWh of 8-hour lithium-ion batteries, 6.9 TWh of industrial thermal storage, and 418 GW of electrolyzers providing 107 TWh of hydrogen storage facilities in the United States. The plan also considers an additional 1.2 TWh of distributed stationary batteries as replacements for over 200 GW of existing backup generator capacity.
Tesla categorizes the required 30 GW of capacity into six areas: repowering the existing grid, EV charging, heat pumps, high-temperature heat, hydrogen, and power for planes and boats. Repowering the grid demands the largest share, with 11 TW of capacity, while both EV and heat pumps require 5 TW each.

The report recommends utilizing the shoulder seasons of spring and fall, when electricity demand is low and solar and wind generation curtailment is more common, to produce and store hydrogen. This approach would align well with the higher consumption periods during summer and winter.
The Master Plan indicates that the total necessary manufacturing capacity for solar panels is 610 GW per year, with an estimated cost of $347.3 million per year per gigawatt of manufactured solar panels, following an initial $212 billion investment to build the factories. The document estimates the total twenty-year investment at $424 billion, resulting in a base cost of about $0.024 per watt.
The company estimated that solar recycling would cost $14 million per year after a $9 billion factory investment.
The document’s implementation relies on the interconnection of the United States’ major power grid regions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/06/promoting-energy-justice-community-solar-and-ev-charging-in-downstate-n-y/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"APRIL 6, 2023","Promoting energy justice, community solar and EV charging in downstate N.Y.","With about 12% of U.S. community solar energy subscribed by low to moderate income households, according to Wood Mackenzie, promoting accessibility to distributed generation resources like community solar and electric vehicle charging was a key topic at Infocast’s New York Energy Summit in Albany, N.Y. this week.  
According to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 33.8% of Bronx and Manhattan borough residents are designated ‘very low-income households,’ while 26% of households designated as ‘low-income.’ Outside of the New York City boroughs, low-income communities drop to the upper single-digits to low teens, for context, showing a massive opportunity for LMI community solar accessibility across the metropolitan region.
NYSERDA defines very low-income as income less than 130% of the federal poverty guidelines set by the Department of Health and Human Services. NYSERDA further defines LMI households as those with incomes at or below the higher of 80% of area median income (AMI), and 80% of state median income (SMI). For context, the threshold for poverty as defined by HHS is an $19,780 income for a two-person household or under $30,000 for a four-person household.
Thomas Roach, Mayor of the City of White Plains, N.Y., whose city has a 10.1% poverty level population, said his focus is getting the power asset choice away from just wealthy communities and fossil fuel generating facilities away from low-income communities in his downstate region, where they have statistically been located, creating a health burden with higher rates of asthma and other conditions in lower income communities.
Speaking during a conference panel titled, “Promoting & Financing Energy Equity,” Roach said bringing community solar and distributed generation projects, energy efficiency solutions and EV charging infrastructure into not just Westchester County but the broader New York City region is critical for building an equitable energy community, and setting New York as an example for other municipalities to aspire to across the country.
David Eisenbud, senior director of origination at DSD Renewables, a community, commercial and industrial solar developer, said his company was successful in securing $1 million per year in new revenue for White Plains from the deployment of 6.8 MW of community solar projects, completed in July 2022 and begun during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The progressive Westchester County city will be able to direct passive revenue towards more proactive solutions such as improving charging infrastructure, parks development and other solutions with revenue shared from the community solar projects, added Roach. About 70% of the non-anchored offtake power was able to be designated for low-to-moderate income communities, as defined by the Inflation Reduction Act LMI standards, Eisenbud said.  Of the rooftop project’s offtake, the city of White Plains takes 40% of the offtake as the anchored customer and the remainder is offered to non-anchored and residential subscribers, he added.
The White Plains portfolio consists of solar canopy, rooftop, and ground-mount installations at four parking garages, Gillie Park, the Ebersole Ice Rink, Gedney Way Recycling Facility, Water Storage Site and the Sanitation Complex. Energy storage systems totaling 1.76 MW / 8 MWh were also installed at the city’s recycling facility and a parking garage.
Concrete jungle constraints
Mayor Roach of White Plains pointed to the downstate New York region’s challenges of deploying new electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the densely populated tri-state area. Con Edison’s grid infrastructure has been modernized over the last decade, but continues to pose barriers for the rapid adoption of new technologies such as EV charging, he noted.
Roach said his municipality is currently working on the deployment of multi-unit housing EV charging. The mayor said White Plains is deploying to 90 to 100 new EV charging ports into garages of low-income buildings. According to Plugshare, the city currently offers EV charging at 32 charging locations in public garages, supermarkets and shopping centers.
Kaitlin Butler, an associate at NY Green Bank, a statewide funding resource for clean energy projects and infrastructure, said public EV charging accessibility as well as clean energy school buses are both key focuses for the downstate region.
The White Plains School District is also the first in the state to test a fleet of five electric school buses which provide stored battery power back into the grid when not in use, using vehicle to grid (V2G) bidirectional charging solutions.
In May 2022, the school district and state of New York released a three-year V2G report in which the Con Edison clean bus project, in partnership with electric bus company Lion Electric, development partner First Priority Group and V2G technology provider Nuvve Holdings, released its findings after a three year pilot project phase. The report noted the EV bus project  achieved a goal of deploying an average 1.4 kW hours per mile power throughput, while 85% of battery capacity from the buses reached the grid during off-peak times.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/06/early-engagement-avoids-perils-of-wyoming-industrial-siting/,"GUEST POST,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,WYOMING",,"APRIL 6, 2023",Early engagement avoids perils of Wyoming industrial siting,"The Wyoming Industrial Development and Siting Act governs the permitting of large-scale projects, including renewable energy projects, data centers, refining, manufacturing, and carbon capture to name a few. Established over 40 years ago, the Act and subsequent regulations created a fairly predictable process:
Predictable now unpredictable
Seems simple, right? But the devil is in the details. Over time, the increasingly difficult and risky part of the process comes after application submittal and before Siting Council approval. During this time, the Siting Division reviews the completeness of the permit application. While similar to many permitting regimes, the Siting Division’s review differs because the Division does not conduct any substantive evaluation of the contents of an application.
The substantive review falls to what the Act calls reviewing agencies. The 19 reviewing agencies receive a copy of the permit application from the Siting Division and can then provide comments. These agencies include Wyoming Game & Fish, the Wyoming Department of Transportation, the Department of Health, the Office of State Lands and Investments, and the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. See id. at § 110(b).
Reviewing agencies have no actual jurisdiction over the permit process but in recent years have exerted great influence and created challenges for project proponents. Critically, the agencies can request the permit applicant take additional measures or provide more or different information. The Siting Division Administrator then determines whether to recommend to the Siting Council that any comments become special permit conditions. Under the Act, special permit conditions become enforceable terms of a permit once approved by the Siting Council and can even prevent construction if the project proponent does not fulfil those conditions.
Agency comments now mandates
By now, you likely wonder, “so what?” Simple. In recent years, the Siting Division has changed from evaluating reviewing agency comments as input to reviewing agency comments as mandatory permit conditions. But the reviewing agencies rarely write their comments in a way that easily translates into a specific condition a project can fulfill. And on several occasions reviewing agencies did not actually want their comments to become conditions. For instance, Wyoming Game & Fish often suggests that construction begin before or halt during certain nesting seasons. But the agency has to this point never wanted a construction halt mandated. Yet the Siting Division has attempted to impose such a halt.
Worse still, the comments converted into proposed conditions can affect critical aspects of a project, ranging from schedule to project cost. For example, the Division has attempted to impose a condition that would have delayed a project’s construction by two years to allow for preconstruction surveys and monitoring for certain wildlife. Had this condition received Siting Council approval, that particular project would have either suffered significant delay or not happened at all because of an inability to complete the project by the time required in the project’s power purchase agreement.
And these are not the only examples. Based on agency comments in recent years, the Siting Division has crafted conditions that imposed additional mitigation measures, more studies of both environmental and socio-economic aspects of a project, and changes to site design. Once approved by the Siting Council, the conditions create cost, time, and schedule burdens for those projects. One such example is a recent wind project that because of special conditions had to conduct additional studies and develop new mitigation plans that may very well delay construction.
Early, ongoing engagement is key
It’s not all doom and gloom. Several lessons have emerged from projects that have successfully and unsuccessfully battled difficult or onerous permit conditions arising from reviewing agency comments.
First, engage early with reviewing agencies. Early and ongoing discussions with agencies like Wyoming Game & Fish have highlighted mitigation measures or studies a project proponent can include in a permit application to preclude potential comments. This proactive engagement allows the agency and applicant to cooperatively craft language for potential permit conditions, which can be critical to overall permit success.
Second, have as much dialogue with the Siting Division as you can. The Siting Division has a small staff and increasing workload. Project proponents who are available to answer questions and talk through reviewing agency comments stand a better chance of heading off harmful permit conditions.
Third, if you have to fight a proposed permit condition, do so before you get to the contested case hearing with the Siting Council. The project applicant will typically have 3 to 4 weeks between the Siting Division Administrator announcing proposed conditions and the date of a contested case hearing. That window represents the last, best chance to eliminate or alter proposed permit conditions through engagement and negotiation with the Siting Division, reviewing agency, or both. The Siting Council disfavors permit applicants using a contested case hearing to argue against proposed permit conditions. The Siting Council has also been reticent to change or alter conditions at this stage. A battle before the Siting Council may need to happen. But it should be a last resort.
Lean into relationships
Finally, cultivating relationships and relying on people who have relationships with the Siting Division and reviewing agencies makes the first three lessons work. Wyoming is a small state where credibility and reputation matter, especially when trying to get access to state agencies. Drawing on a relationship can often open doors and facilitate dialogue that can head off damaging permit conditions at the right stage of the process.
As renewable energy projects, data centers, and carbon capture projects increase in Wyoming, the Industrial Siting Process will take center stage. It seems inevitable that additional scrutiny by reviewing agencies and greater political awareness of the process will follow. This means the challenges with proposed permit conditions are likely to get worse. But drawing on the lessons of past projects should help new project proponents navigate the pitfalls and emerge from the permitting process positioned for success.

Included in the nine bills is the proposal for a performance credit mechanism (PCM), which panelists on an RE+ roundtable discussion agreed was undefined and confusing. Essentially, it enables electricity providers to earn credits by having power available when the power grid is under its greatest strain, and credits would be available to dispatchable energy generators, excluding solar and other renewable sources. The bills go next to the Senate for a vote, possibly as early as Thursday, April 6.
“These bills are part of a package of legislation that could grind renewable energy development in Texas to a halt. That would mean more air pollution threatening our health and higher electric bills. We’re counting on the House to reject these”, said Luke Metzger, executive director for Environment Texas.
In recent years, solar power has come on strong in Texas, despite some pushback at the legislative level. There is currently 16 GW of installed solar, or enough solar capacity to power the equivalent of nearly 2 million Texas homes. Solar also provides jobs for over 10,000 Texans, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that over $19 billion has been invested in in Texas solar through Q3 2022.
Looking to the future, Texas is on track to unseat California as the state with the most solar capacity. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), as much as 36 GW of solar capacity will be added in the next five years, adding on to the 16 GW installed thus far.
While RE+ Texas attendees are optimistic about the future of solar in Texas, building policy to improve resilience is a steady theme throughout the conference. Several sessions referred to the devastation unleashed by winter storm Uri, which caused a deep freeze that resulted in power outages affecting more than 4.5 million people for up to four days.
The outages are considered the cause of most of the 200+ deaths as well as storm damage estimated at approximately $195 billion. The cause was crippled generating units, reduced natural gas production, and frozen wind turbines. The event was a wakeup call for Texas to winterize its infrastructure, and the lessons learned shone a bright light on residential solar-plus-storage.
In the RE+ Texas session, “Reliability & Resilience: How to Have the Best of Both Worlds”, panelists discussed the role of solar and storage in building resiliency and reliability. Steffanie Dohn, director of state and regulatory affairs at SOLV Energy suggests that policy makers take a “more holistic and thoughtful approach,” and that by looking at all of the resources available, determine how to make adjustments to operations. She noted that after winter storm Uri, there was talk of building resilience using renewables, but then many just go back to the comfort of fossil fuels.

The program, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, will make loans and grants to help rural electric co-ops purchase renewable energy, renewable energy systems, and other types of clean energy systems.
USDA said it hopes to begin obligating funds by September, in a presentation to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. “We need potential applicants to start thinking about potential applications now,” the department said in its slide deck. “We are available to answer your questions now and when we publish our notices.”
The Inflation Reduction Act provides for “direct pay” of tax incentives for renewables and storage investments, enabling tax-exempt rural electric co-ops to now access the incentives, said the USDA slide deck. “Direct pay could cover 30-50% of project costs. We expect this to be stackable” with support under the $9.7 billion program.
The USDA program could help finance at least 20 GW of solar, wind and storage, said Uday Varadarajan, a senior principal at the nonprofit RMI, in a webinar hosted by the nonprofit Sierra Club. He said that $9.7 billion in grants would allow rural generation and transmission (G&T) co-operatives to raise an additional $39 billion in debt to invest in renewables and storage “without rate increases or credit downgrades.”
“Even more” clean energy capacity could be leveraged, he said, by also using the direct pay tax incentives and “creative financing structures.” With direct pay tax credits, he said an RMI study showed it is now “practical” for 13 G&T cooperatives to “transition and replace” 70% of current annual emissions from fossil generating units.
Noting that customers of the nation’s rural electric distribution co-operatives are also co-op members, Jeremy Fisher, a senior advisor in the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said on the group’s webinar that co-op members “have the opportunity to help make decisions” for their electricity generation and transmission system. The Sierra Club describes itself as the nation’s largest grassroots environmental organization.
Rural electric distribution co-ops are in turn members of the nation’s 63 G&T cooperatives, which Fisher said provide the vast majority of generation for rural electric distribution co-ops. Distribution co-ops can also add smaller-scale renewable generation and storage to their distribution systems.
Fisher announced a new Sierra Club online tool, the Rural Electric Cooperative Explorer, which he said enables a distribution co-op member to see “what the power supply of your generation and transmission company looks like,” as well as possible clean energy replacement opportunities.
The USDA in its presentation highlighted the department’s web page on Inflation Reduction Act funding for rural development, and a web page to sign up for updates on funding opportunities. The USDA calls the $9.7 billion program the New ERA program, which stands for Empowering Rural America. The department has discussed the program with eligible participants through a tribal consultation and 13 roundtables in recent months, which drew over 1300 attendees.
Rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million people, and operate in 92% of persistent poverty counties, says the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association on its website.
