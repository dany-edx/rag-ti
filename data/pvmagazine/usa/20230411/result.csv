The target sets a goal of 750 MW by year’s end 2027, 1.5 GW through 2030, and 3 GW through 2033. Battery durations were not set in the legislation, however, typical PJM-interconnected storage projects often operate batteries with four-hour durations. The legislation includes electrochemical (battery) storage, thermal storage, virtual power plants, and hydrogen-based storage.
“Getting clean capacity is the next chapter in decarbonization, especially for restructured states,” said Jason Burwen, vice president of energy storage at the American Clean Power Association (ACP).
The target follows with recommendations made by ACP, which suggested the state will require 2.5 GW to 3.6 GW to meet the growing share of renewable energy on the grid. It said that the buildout would lead to a net system cost savings of $74 million to $100 million by 2033. 
Last year, Maryland increased its economy-wide emissions reduction target from 40% to 61% as compared to 2006 levels. It also targets carbon-neutrality by 2045.
“As storage is critical to meeting our nation’s emissions and energy goals, Maryland’s passage of this energy storage bill signals important progress toward building clean energy capacity,” said Moira Cyphers, eastern region state affairs director, ACP.
The state also passed legislation to require the Public Service Commission to develop a cost-effective procurement program for energy storage.
HB 910 now heads to Governor Wes Moore’s desk to be signed into law.
Solar friendly laws
In February, Maryland legislators introduced a bill to boost residential solar adoption. Sponsored by Maryland Senator Brian J. Feldman and Delegate Lily Qi, Senate Bill 664 and House Bill 1239, would increase Maryland’s residential clean energy grant from $1,000 to $5,000 to boost adoption of rooftop solar and create local clean energy jobs.
This bill would fund rooftop solar grants through fees and penalties paid by companies that do not meet the state’s clean energy requirements, minimizing the cost to taxpayers and ensuring those fees are directed toward promoting renewable energy. It would also enhance clean energy incentives for low- and moderate-income residents, as well as those living in overburdened and underserved communities.
“While we’ve seen growth in the utility scale solar market in Maryland since the Maryland Clean Energy Jobs Act passed in 2019, residential solar continues to lag behind despite playing a critical role in meeting the state’s climate goals,” said Ed Merrick, chair of MRSC. “We need to rebuild this industry and do it in a way that includes all Marylanders by leveraging our existing built infrastructure. Incentivizing the installation of residential rooftop solar through the state’s existing grant program will help make clean energy more accessible and affordable for all Maryland residents, regardless of their financial status.”
In June 2022, the state passed a pair of community solar bills. HB 1039 and HB 440 create tax incentives for the development of agrivoltaic community solar projects which serve low- and moderate-income customers on rooftops, brownfields, landfills, and clean fills. 
HB 1039, exempts community solar projects from both county and municipal corporate property taxes, so long as the 50% of the electricity generated by the projects go to serve low- to moderate-income individuals and families at a rate which is at least 20% lower than the base electricity rate that these customers would be paying otherwise.
As it stands, 30% of the pilot program capacity is still set aside for low-to-moderate income customers wishing to participate and another 30% is set aside for project development on brownfield sites.
HB 440 expanded the maximum capacity of a permitted community solar project from 2 MW to 5 MW, while also reducing the land requirements for siting projects. This provision pertains to projects developed on multiple, contiguous lots, rather than opening up new types of land zones for development.
“HB 1039 and HB 440 send a signal to the community solar industry that Maryland welcomes the private sector as a way to inject capital into grid modernization and build a new energy market that can bolster the state’s economy,” said Leslie Elder, Mid-Atlantic director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access. “We thank the Maryland General Assembly for passing these bills and Governor Hogan for his support.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/11/flipping-the-switch-on-the-vanderbilt-i-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TENNESSEE",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 11, 2023",Flipping the switch on the Vanderbilt I Solar Farm,"In 2020, Vanderbilt, located in Nashville, Tennessee, announced two pioneering agreements with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Nashville Electric Service to procure renewable energy from a solar farm being built by Silicon Ranch Corp. The switch has now been flipped on the Vanderbilt I Solar Farm, a 35 MW facility in Bedford County, Tennessee.
Silicon Ranch Corporation, which is also based in Nashville and is one of the nation’s largest independent power producers, developed and funded the project and hired more than 250 workers during construction. The company will also serve as the long-term owner and operator. The project is expected to generate millions of dollars in new tax revenue for Bedford County to support local infrastructure and schools, among other community-identified priorities.
“The Vanderbilt I Solar Farm demonstrates what is possible when we work together with a shared vision for the region, and Silicon Ranch is grateful to Vanderbilt for its leadership and to TVA for its strong support of this meaningful renewable energy investment in Bedford County,” said Matt Kisber, co-founder and chairman of Silicon Ranch.
The solar facility is a significant step by Vanderbilt University toward its goal, announced in 2019, to power its campus entirely through renewable energy and become carbon neutral by 2050. The renewable generation from the Vanderbilt I Solar Farm will offset approximately 70% of Vanderbilt University’s annual Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, or enough to power more than 6,000 homes for one year.
“The Vanderbilt I Solar Farm not only represents a major step toward our own goals at Vanderbilt, but also provides a model of collaborative, forward-thinking solutions that we hope other higher educational institutions will adopt and replicate across this country,” said Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University. “We look forward to the educational and research opportunities this project and our pursuit of carbon neutrality will yield for our faculty and students at Vanderbilt. We thank Silicon Ranch, NES, and TVA for supporting us on this bold journey.”
TVA, serves 10 million people across an 80,000 square mile territory in the southeast U.S., extending beyond its home state borders. The company stated goals of targeting up to 10 GW of solar by 2035, and more than 200,000 EVs on roadways by 2028. The utility expects to have about 2.8 GW of solar in TVA operation by 2024.
Silicon Ranch said that the Vanderbilt I Solar Farm is the result of a landmark agreement as the first project contracted under TVA’s nationally recognized Green Invest program, which matches demand for green power from diverse commercial, industrial, and institutional customers with new utility-scale solar projects located in the Tennessee Valley. TVA said its Green Invest program has led to nearly $3 billion in solar investments since 2018. A large driver of growth in this program is through contracts with large corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook), and others.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/11/50-states-of-solar-incentives-kansas/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,KANSAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 11, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Kansas,"The state of Kansas has installed over 115 MW of solar capacity to date, enough to power roughly 16,000 homes, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). While Kansas only sources a quarter of a percent of its electricity from solar, it gets nearly half of its generation from wind power.
Over the next five years, however, Kansas is expected to add more than 10 times the cumulative solar installed today. SEIA projects 1.6 GW of solar will be added in that short period. This compares with the roughly 8 GW of wind installed today.
Over $216 million of investment in solar has taken place in Kansas, and that number is sure to grow considerably if the state meets SEIA’s 1.6 GW projection. Nearly 1,000 of its residents are employed in the solar industry, and six manufacturers have opened up shop in Kansas.
Incentives
For homeowners shopping for solar in Kansas, there are a few incentives and programs that can make it an attractive investment. First, all residential solar installations in the U.S. qualify for the 30% investment tax credit, eligible for all final installed system costs.
Kansas also offers net metering for residential solar owners. Net metering involves the utility crediting a customer on their utility bill for sending excess solar production to the grid. In Kansas, net metering is offered at a wholesale rate, meaning that exported electricity is credited at about 2.1 cents per kWh, said SolarReviews. This compares with a retail rate of 11.3 cents per kWh for the retail rate of power. Because Kansas residents lose value with exported power, battery energy storage is recommended to capture solar production. The other option is to size a system smaller so that homeowners do not lose value from overproduction.
Solar is also property tax exempt in Kansas. Zillow estimates a purchased solar array can increase home value by 4%, but that increase in property value will not be taxed.
Residents of rural areas in Kansas may be interested in the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants. Available to agricultural producers with at least 50% of their gross income coming from agricultural operations, and small businesses in eligible rural areas with populations less than 50,000, the program funds various renewable energy technologies, including solar. 
The REAP program offers loan guarantees on loans up to 75 % of total eligible project costs, grants for up to 40% of total eligible project costs, and combined grant and loan guarantee funding up to 75% of total eligible project costs. REAP loans approved in Fiscal Year 2023 will receive an 80% loan guarantee. Grants are capped at $1 million for renewable energy and $500,000 for energy efficiency.
Political opposition
Kansas is home to Senator Mike Thompson, who has taken a strong stance against the development of clean energy in his state. In February 2022, Thompson introduced laws that would require solar and wind facilities to be built only on lands zoned for industrial use. About half the state’s 105 counties are rural and unzoned, so the bill could effectively freeze renewable energy growth in the state.
Thompson said the bill is not about slowing renewables, but about transparency. “All I’m trying to do is make it so that (wind and solar developers) have to file something so that neighbors can kind of see what’s going on and understand it,” Thompson said. “Because obviously if you have a 500 or 600-foot turbine that’s going to be placed on your neighbor’s property but it’s 1,500 feet away from your house, which was happening quite a bit, there are health and safety concerns that you want a say over.”
Industry advocates say the bill is an example of government overreach, forcing zoning upon counties that have chosen not to be zoned.
More recently, Sen. Thompson introduced Senate Bill 86, which would force politicians to resign if they are found to have family or financial ties to a solar or wind project of 500 kW or greater in size.
“In some cases,” said Thompson, “it was a family member of the official that had signed the lease, and influence peddling was involved. Think Hunter Biden. We expect government officials to act in the best interest of their constituents, placing personal benefit aside when making important decisions. Even the appearance of impropriety undermines the public trust.”
Notable installation
Major retailer IKEA installed a 730 kW rooftop solar array in Kansas in 2015, marking the largest rooftop installation in the state at that time. The 92,000 square foot array consists of 2,394 panels, producing just under 1 million kWh each year.
For the development, design and installation of the Kansas City-area store’s customized solar power system, IKEA contracted with Chicago-based SoCore Energy a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortune 500 company Edison International.
The project marked that 41st for IKEA in the United States. The retailer has shown a strong commitment to solar adoption, and in 2022 announced it will offer SunPower solar installation packages to customers in select California stores, with potential to expand to other states.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/11/dominion-energy-acquires-utility-scale-pollinator-solar-project-in-virginia/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIRGINIA",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 11, 2023",Dominion Energy acquires utility-scale pollinator solar project in Virginia,"Longroad Energy, a U.S. based renewable energy developer, owner, and operator, announced the sale of its 108 MWdc (83 MWac) Foxhound Solar project to Dominion Energy.
Foxhound has been in development for six years and is expected to produce enough clean energy to power more than 17,000 homes and energy generated will represent approximately 45,000 metric tons of avoided CO2 emissions annually, the equivalent of taking more than 10,000 cars off the road each year.
The project, which is located in Halifax County, Virginia, has reached full notice to proceed and has begun construction. Financial close of the Foxhound acquisition is expected upon mechanical completion of the project which is anticipated for January 2024.
“Foxhound marks Longroad’s first solar project in Virginia and our first greenfield development project in PJM,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy. “We are pleased that Dominion Energy will be acquiring Foxhound to help support the sustainability goals of its key customers and renewable energy objectives set out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act. The project will be an important resource for Halifax County, and we are proud of Foxhound’s certification as Virginia Pollinator-Smart for its biodiversity commitments.”
First Solar is supplying Foxhound with its U.S.-made Series 6+ solar modules. Nextracker is supplying trackers for the project and TMEIC is supplying the solar inverters. During construction the project is projected to employ 150 to 200 workers.
Foxhound is the first utility-scale project to be certified as Virginia Pollinator-Smart, a biodiversity program overseen by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). As part of its certification, the Foxhound project will use native plant species under the solar panels and a pollinator-friendly seed mix around the arrays. The project’s use of pollinator plant species will help support native insect, bird and other wildlife populations while improving soil stabilization and water retention among many other ecosystem services.
“Planting species native to Virginia – whether at our state parks, on a solar energy facility, or in your backyard – helps to preserve the Commonwealth’s special natural heritage and biodiversity,” said Matt Wells, Virginia DCR director. “The benefits of Foxhound’s pollinator habit – both around the array and under the panels – will have a positive impact both on the project and the surrounding area. We commend Longroad Energy’s commitment to supporting biodiversity by being the first utility-scale solar project to achieve Virginia Pollinator-Smart certification.”
In addition to generating property taxes for Halifax County and the State of Virginia, Foxhound has also made a contribution of $200,000 to Halifax County that will be used to support county services like Fire/EMS and other economic development efforts.
An offtaker, yet unnamed, has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement. KeyBank N.A. and HSBC served as lenders. Balch & Bingham served as Longroad’s counsel on the transaction.
Dominion Energy, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, has stated that it is committed to providing reliable, affordable and sustainable energy and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  The utility recently announced that it is seeking both utility-scale projects located in Virginia that are greater than 3 MW as well as distributed projects that are 3 MW or less. The projects will also help the company achieve the requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and its own net zero goals. The VCEA mandates that the state, via a renewable portfolio standard, must derive at least 1% of its generation mix from solar energy.
This article was amended 4/12/23 to remove T-Mobile as the offtaker.

Industrial robotic systems manufacturer Sarcos Technology and Robotics Corp. has developed a solution to automate and streamline the construction of large-scale solar plants.
The Utah-based company recently achieved the final validation of its prototype solution in the Outdoor Autonomous Manipulation of Photovoltaic Panels (O-AMPP) project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office. It did not disclose the exact location of the pilot installation.
“The solar construction industry is facing unprecedented labor shortages while simultaneously facing an increase in demand for solar energy,” said Trent Mostaert, vice president of industrialization at construction engineering company Mortenson, a partner in the O-AMPP project. “We believe the O-AMPP system can address these challenges while improving safety, productivity, and efficiency for our workers. It will also enable solar project developers to scale output and production to the levels needed to achieve the Energy Department’s 2030 and 2050 renewable energy goals.”
The proof-of-concept robotic system consists of an autonomous working vehicle (AWV) featuring Sarcos’ Guardian XM robotic arm and an autonomous delivery vehicle (ADV). The solution uses cameras to identify where the PV panels need to be installed. The robotic arm then autonomously lifts up the panel using a vacuum system and places it approximately where it needs to be clamped to the mounting structure. “The arm then goes into a special mode where the person clamping the panel can easily move that panel however they need, in order to align it and attach it into the panels,” Sarcos explains in a video on its website.
The company did not share details on whether the vacuum system lifting mechanism would lead to mechanical stress on the PV modules. It says that the robotic solution’s benefits include lower soft costs for projects, projection multiplication, improved construction timelines and quality, and a safer worksite that reduces the risk of lifting and fatigue-related injuries.
The O-AMPP project started in 2021 and Sarcos expects to commercialize its solution by 2024. “Achieving this market validation and field test milestone is a mission-critical step on our path to commercializing our robotic solar field construction solution and, ultimately, enhancing safety and productivity in the solar field construction industry,” said Kiva Allgood, CEO of Sarcos.
Array Technologies supplied the tracker system used in the pilot project. Other industry partners included equipment manufacturer JLG Industries, automotive company Pratt Miller, and Mortenson.
