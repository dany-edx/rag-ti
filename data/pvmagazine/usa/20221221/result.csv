https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/21/federal-agency-inaction-may-hamper-residential-solar-loan-access/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 21, 2022",Federal agency inaction may hamper residential solar loan access,"The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warned that an expiration date is approaching for a COVID-19 exemption on solar loans that allows Federally Insured Credit Unions (FICU) to participate in 25-year solar loans.
On December 31, 2022, FICUs will be banned from participating in 25-year solar loans if the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) does not extend the exemption. Sean Gallagher, vice president of regulatory affairs, SEIA, said NCUA has the opportunity to extend the rule or make it permanent.
“If they don’t, it would shrink the pool of financing available to homeowners that want to go solar at a time when the Biden Administration is trying to tame runaway inflation and implement the most influential climate law in history,” said Gallagher.
The loan market in the U.S. solar industry increased 37% over the last year, and a record number of families adopted solar in Q3 2022, reported Wood Mackenzie. Each month more than 20,000 residential customers sign loan agreements, said SEIA. The organization said homeowners see the greatest monthly savings on 25-year loans, which also typically match the installation’s warranty period.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is expected to drive an additional 222 GW of solar capacity, create 200,000 American jobs, and lead to $600 billion in investment in the U.S. economy, but inaction from NCUA could cut off an important source of funding to support those installations, said SEIA. By 2031, U.S. solar installations could offset 492 million metric tons of carbon annually, which represents 32% of U.S. electricity sector emissions in 2021.
“The NCUA’s inaction will hurt the financial health of FICUs, the same banks the NCUA was established to protect. It would also deny credit union members the financial opportunities they have come to expect and cut off an avenue for FICUs to reduce their climate-related financial risks,” said Gallagher.
Gallagher continued that FICU solar loan participation is an important revenue stream that limits exposure to the fossil fuels, a sector that carries the risk of stranded assets and is increasingly less financially attractive amid technology, policy and economic shifts. This is occurring while a growing number of financial institutions, including credit unions, are increasing investments in sustainability-based products and services to mitigate the financial and societal impacts of climate change.
“The NCUA has the power to enable FICUs to fully participate in the solar and storage market. Ongoing access to 25-year solar loan products will help to ensure credit unions remain resilient while maximizing performance and creating new jobs and economic opportunities for credit unions and their members,” said Gallagher. “Inaction at this juncture would be antithetical and a grave mistake.”

Aligned with the vision set out by California’s climate action plan, the Avantus Academy was set up to train and educate young adults from historically under-resourced communities for potential hiring by the state’s clean energy market.
“For too long, access to programs like this has been mostly limited to those at large, well-funded universities and elite institutions,” said Dr. Tom Buttgenbach, founder and chief executive officer of Avantus. “The academy is taking a different approach by partnering with community colleges, high schools and local non-profits right here in Los Angeles.”
Los Angeles is a driving force in the clean energy transition and will continue to grow with private sector investments as well as from local government. According to the California Air Resources Board, the state’s clean energy market is forecast to create 4 million new jobs, whose pay is 30% above California’s median wage on average.
The Avantus Academy is enrolling young adults aged 16 to 24 years living in Los Angeles County. The program offers:
To apply or refer someone to the academy’s flagship cohort starting in the Spring of 2023, visit the platform’s website, www.cleantechacademy.org.
In addition to business development, job training skills and peer-mentoring, the academy will provide 96 hours of work-based learning and project development exercises across the solar energy, wind power, water infrastructure and alternative fuels sectors.
“UNITE-LA is excited to partner with Avantus to provide clean technology career awareness, preparation and training to high school and community college students from historically marginalized communities,” said Alysia Bell, president of UNITE-LA. “The cleantech sector is one of the fastest growing industries in the nation, and California alone is set to add millions of jobs over the next two decades.”
Avantus and UNITE-LA are actively seeking partners to jointly design and execute the Avantus Academy. Partnerships will focus on partnership opportunities including:
To date the academy has received support from local partners the Los Angeles Unified School District, Los Angeles Community College District, California State University, Dominguez Hills and California State University, Los Angeles.
Corporate and community sponsors include Sunrun, Southern California Edison, the Brotherhood Crusade and the Los Angeles Department of Economic Opportunity.
8minute Solar Energy was formed in 2009 and rebranded as Avantus in October. The renewable energy developer has more than 90 projects under development in its pipeline across California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, with a typical project size of 400 MW.
In January, the company closed a $400 million in financing from EIG, an institutional investor in the global energy and infrastructure sectors, to grow its portfolio of solar and storage assets, and to begin to build projects on its own balance sheet.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/21/commerce-clarifies-that-recent-module-manufacturing-ruling-only-applies-to-four-nations/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 21, 2022",Commerce clarifies that recent module manufacturing ruling only applies to four nations,"On December 19, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce released clarification that its recent, nuanced ruling only applies to companies that are manufacturing solar modules in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The opinion was found in a memorandum titled “Clarification of Product Coverage” in reference to Docket Number A-570-979.
The request for clarification, initiated by Maxeon Solar, applies to all businesses based outside of these four countries, including those that use solar wafers and cells originating in China. In short, the clarification reaffirms that companies manufacturing solar panels outside of the four southeast Asian countries were not analyzed in the Department of Commerce’s original ruling, and are not affected by the initial anticircumvention ruling.

The opinion was sought, in part, because companies that were not specifically named in the original ruling, or those that did not provide information to the Department of Commerce during the research period, were looking for explicit answers as to their status. Some companies that had failed to provide information had been given an “adverse facts’ determination, which carries a very high – business killing – import tariff.
Maxeon is a public company with offices around the world. They’ve announced new US capacity, and are currently manufacturing panels in Mexico. They recently won a deal to deliver nearly 1 GW of modules to the Gemini Solar Project.
The Department of Commerce reiterated from their original ruling:
“These circumvention inquiries cover certain solar cells and modules that have been completed in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam, using parts and components from China, as specified below, that are then subsequently exported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam to the United States (inquiry merchandise).”
The document makes it clear that this ruling is specifically focused on solar modules manufactured in these four countries. However, the Department of Commerce notes that the broader, original case from 2012 includes all solar cells made from Chinese solar wafers. That case is still in effect.
One could have expected the Department of Commerce’s clarification to be circumspect, since its initial ruling was very specific.
The department’s ruling on subcomponents seems to have somewhat shifted in its policy, allowing for the import of a new non-tariffed product class. This new class is, apparently, modules built using China-origin solar cells, assembled with at least three subcomponents originating from outside of China. The list of subcomponents includes silver paste, aluminum frames, glass, backsheets, ethylene vinyl acetate sheets, and junction boxes.
This article was amended on 12/22/22 to correctthat statement that Maxeon is primarily Chinese owned.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/21/three-western-states-to-mandate-electric-vehicles-phasing-out-combustion-engine/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,OREGON,WASHINGTON",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 21, 2022","Three western states to mandate electric vehicles, phasing out combustion engines","Advanced Clean Cars II is a set of rules that lay the groundwork for automakers to increase production of zero emission vehicles. In Oregon, the rules go into effect immediately, building on a previous rule scheduled to end in 2025. Automakers will have two years to plan for the first compliance step that comes with model year 2026 passenger vehicles.
The Oregon Department of Transportation has committed to investing $100 million to build more electric vehicle charging stations along major transportation corridors and in rural and underserved areas of the state over the next five years.
“With today’s adoption of the ACC II Rule, all those living in Oregon will benefit from the cleaner air and improved public health outcomes achieved by reducing pollution from transportation. This is especially true for low-income and underrepresented communities across the state who live closest to roadways and have been most often impacted by poor air quality,” said Leah Feldon, interim director of Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality. “The commission’s action puts the state in a position to expand our charging infrastructure and ensure grid reliability. It also incentivizes auto manufacturers to send all electric model options to Oregon.”
Oregon’s DEQ estimates that, by 2040, ACCII rules would reduce 54.1 million metric tons of wheel to wheel carbon emissions, result in $8.7 million dollars in savings in pollution-related healthcare costs, and reduce 7,695 tons of air pollution. The transportation sector makes up about 40% of Oregon’s greenhouse gas emissions, 62% of which come from passenger cars and trucks.
“Adopting strong clean vehicle standards, alongside other states across the country, is one of the most important steps that Oregon can take to improve public health and accomplish our climate goals,” said David Collier, Oregon Sierra Club. 
“This proposed rule will also make new and used electric vehicles more affordable and accessible to communities across Oregon. Oregonians will reduce their dependence on petroleum, gain access to more affordable EVs, substantially save money on fuel, vehicle maintenance and upkeep, reduce toxic air pollution, and make their communities much healthier places to live. DEQ’s rule is both an environmental and economic win for Oregon,” said Collier.
California adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II regulations in September, announcing plans to scale down light-duty passenger car, pickup truck and SUV emissions starting with the 2026 model year through 2035.
The regulations amend the Zero-emission Vehicle Regulation to require an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles, and relies on advanced vehicle technologies, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell electric and plug-in hybrid electric-vehicles, to meet air quality and climate change emissions standards. These amendments support the governor’s 2020 Executive Order N-79-20 that requires all new passenger vehicles sold in California to be zero emissions by 2035. The Low-emission Vehicle Regulations were also amended to include standards for gasoline cars and heavier passenger trucks to continue to reduce smog-forming emissions.
California has the largest zero-emission vehicle market in the nation with more than 16% of new vehicles sold being zero-emissions or plug-in hybrids. The figure below shows the annual zero-emission vehicle requirement. Last week the California Energy Commission approved a nearly $3 billion plan to add 90,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2025, more than doubling the number already in service.

 
In Washington, electric vehicles made up 11% of new vehicle sales in November, up from 6% for November 2021, according to the state’s Department of Licensing. But that is about to change, with the state legislature passing the Clean Cars 2030 bill, which requires that by 2030 all new light-duty vehicles sold or registered in the state be electric, with the exception of emergency vehicles. The bill now goes to Governor Inslee’s desk for his signature. The Clean Cars 2030 bill is similar to the California mandate, but it speeds up adoption by five years. It’s also a bill, as opposed to an executive order, which means that it would become law in the state of Washington.
Yesterday the United States Postal Service announced that it will acquire at least 66,000 battery electric delivery vehicles as a part of its strategy to replace its aging fleet. The Postal Service says its priority is to provide its carriers and communities with safer, more efficient vehicles as soon as possible. The greening of the fleet is part of the U.S. Postal Service’s overall network modernization efforts, which will cost $9.6 billion, paid for in part by the $3 billion appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/21/ascent-solar-nets-50-million-investment-to-manufacture-flexible-thin-film-pv/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,COLORADO",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 21, 2022",Ascent Solar nets $50 million investment to manufacture flexible thin-film PV,"Ascent Solar Technologies, a thin-film solar manufacturer, secured a $50 million equity financing from two institutional investors.  The company said it intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including financing its continued growth, strategic investments in partnerships and capital expenditures. 
Bryan Garnier & Co. acted as sole placement agent and financial advisor to the company on the private placement.  Burr & Forman was counsel to the company on the equity round.
“We are seeing a resurgence of innovative original equipment manufacturer demand for thin-film solar solutions, as well as support by government and ESG-conscious investors alike,” said Jeffrey Max, president and chief executive officer of Ascent. 
The company’s flexible-thin film solar technology is backed by 40 years of research and development and 15 years of manufacturing experience. Its Copper-Indium-Gallium-Selenide (CIGS) solar panels are made for use in environments where mass, performance, and reliability matter, including on space missions, airborne vehicles, agrivoltaic, commercial and industrial uses. Ascent operates a 5 MW research and development center at its corporate headquarters in Thornton, Colorado.
“This capital comes at a terrific time, as we are seeking to expand R&D and production to serve an ever-broader base of industries and use-cases,” Max said.  “With a strong new leadership team in place, when strategic growth or investment opportunities arise, we believe ASTI will be ready to move.”  
One of the advantages of Ascent’s CIGS solar panels is the lightweight material and adaptable to a wide set of use cases. The panels thin film is 52 microns thick, thinner than a human hair at an average 72 microns, leading to a very low weight relative to traditional panels at 68 grams per meter squared. It is also extremely flexible, able to roll to a radius of about 3 millimeters, rolled about as tightly as a pencil. 
The reported power-to-weight ratio of the CIGS panels is 450 W per kg. This exceeds the 370 W per kg reported by an MIT research team that created a new process for printing thin-film solar onto Dyneema fabrics. 
Conventional solar cells are encapsulated in glass and aluminum frames, limiting where they can be installed. A typical Massachusetts rooftop solar installation is about 8 kW, adding about 1,000 pounds to a roof. The MIT-developed Dyneema-affixed solar cell would add only 44 pounds to produce the same amount of power. 
“The metrics used to evaluate a new solar cell technology are typically limited to their power conversion efficiency and their cost in dollars-per-watt. Just as important is integrability — the ease with which the new technology can be adapted. The lightweight solar fabrics enable integrability, providing impetus for the current work. We strive to accelerate solar adoption, given the present urgent need to deploy new carbon-free sources of energy,” said Vladimir Bulović, MIT researcher and author of the report. 
Founded in 2005 and a public company since 2006, Ascent manufactures its thin-film PV product using a process called Monolithic Integration (MI). MI enables modules and arrays to have a specific footprint and power output with custom options for voltage and current. The architecture of the module allows it to continue to operate if damaged and in cloudy or overcast conditions, the company said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/21/researchers-see-aqueous-batteries-as-safe-reliable-and-affordable-alternatives-to-lithium-ion/,"BATTERY,RESEARCH,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 21, 2022","Researchers see aqueous batteries as safe, reliable and affordable alternatives to lithium ion","The proliferation of lithium-ion battery cells, powering everything from smartphones to electric vehicles, is projected to hold its 80% market share of the rechargeable battery market for the foreseeable future. But these batteries are expensive, require raw materials from unstable geopolitical regions, and are not fully removed from fire or explosion risk in extreme conditions.
Battery experts from the University of Houston contend that improvements in aqueous batteries, which use water-based electrolytes, are generally regarded as safe, reliable and affordable alternatives to lithium-ion cells.
“The idea is to develop advanced aqueous batteries that can combine better safety and higher voltage,” said Dr. Yan Yao, the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston. Yao has been leading research on energy storage materials and devices for just over a decade.
In a study published in Nature Reviews Materials, the group said innovations involving materials and chemistries, coupled with other research advances have created new opportunities for an advanced form of aqueous batteries.
Rechargeable aqueous batteries offer some advantages to lithium-ion. Raw materials are abundant and low-cost with minimal requirements for manufacturing environments. The battery chemistry is non-inflammable, requires simple fabrication and provides high power, which determines how long it takes to fully charge and accelerate from 0 to 60 mph.
Aqueous batteries are not without certain drawbacks, too. Cells have a narrow thermodynamic electrochemical stability window, faulty operations that could lead to explosions and, of course, low energy density.
The study contends modern versions made with innovative materials that are in the early stages of commercialization are key developments in the transition to a battery research breakthrough.
According to the researchers, the goal is to widen the window of electrochemical stability, allowing battery chemistry to work across wider voltage ranges and produce more energy, leading to new opportunities.
“How we integrate the different components will have a profound impact in this field,” said Yanliang “Leonard” Liang, research assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at University of Houston. “We must mix and match and try new combinations. Sometimes it will result in improvement in one area but compromises in another.”
Liang, whose research spans everything from solid-state and aqueous batteries to multivalent metal batteries, as well as lithium and sodium batteries, is hopeful that an aqueous battery is achievable thanks to modern tools and new discoveries. “One day, you will have an aqueous battery that has the same voltage as the lithium-ion battery, but it will be safer because it is water-based,” he said.
LiBeyond launch
Yao and Liang recently launched a start-up company, LiBeyond, to scale up and further develop battery technologies developed at the university. The pair envisions applications in electric vehicles and other areas of transportation to help power entire fleets and grid-scale energy storage.
The company is focused on two platforms. The first is a magnesium organic battery system that will compete with lithium battery technologies with fast charging capability targeted for EV applications.
The platform is supported by $4.4 million of ARPA-E funding from February 2022, and includes Toyota North America as a vertical partner with the start-up.
The second platform, which is still in the ideation phase, is a solid-state battery material and solution also tested for EV applications.
Over the last few years, the non-lithium ion battery market has spawned a few noteworthy start-ups.  Based in Somerville, Massachusetts, Form Energy released a long-duration energy storage technology using an “aqueous air battery system” in order to commercially deploy a 1 MW/150 MWh long-duration storage solution.  The stealthy start-up has raised more than $818 million in VC funding to date from TPG’s Rise Fund, GIC, CPPIB, Coatue Management, Energy Impact Partners, NGP Energy Technology Partners, ArcelorMittal, Temasek and Macquarie, among others.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/21/georgia-commission-fails-to-expand-solar-net-metering-program/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,GEORGIA",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 21, 2022",Georgia commission fails to expand solar net metering program,"The Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) voted on Tuesday to raise electric rates, to maintain the cap on net metering, and to impose a $100 interconnection fee for new solar customers.
The new interconnection fee is hard for potential rooftop solar owners to take, but it is half of what was previously proposed.  In October, Georgia Power proposed a $200 interconnection fee, citing a “cost shift” on non-solar customers by rooftop solar customers as the reasoning behind the new proposed interconnection charge. The “cost shift” is a utility anti-rooftop solar concept that utilities use to justify raising rates and increasing profits. The argument is that rooftop solar programs lead to a cross-subsidization of solar customers by those who have not yet adopted the technology.
The PSC commissioners agreed that Georgia Power will pay 6.68 cents per kWh for electricity generated by owners of rooftop solar panels, but only after the solar owners have paid full retail rate for the electricity they’ve used. Previously Georgia Power subtracted the solar-generated electricity from residents’ bills, which is the way net metering works in most states. That plan will be grandfathered for those who already have solar, but new solar users will have to pay their full electric bill first, before seeing payback on their solar generating system.
Georgia Power’s controversial cap of 5,000 net metering customers will remain. A net metering policy was spelled out in Georgia Power’s 2019 rate case, enabling Georgia Public Service Commission to offer net metering with monthly netting to 5,000 rooftop solar customers or 32 MW of capacity, whichever comes first. Georgia allows for net metering on residential systems of up to 10 kW or commercial of up to 100 kW commercial.
The program has been effective at encouraging solar adoption, and as a result the cap of 5,000 customers has been reached in past years. At the beginning of the program, some renewable energy advocates, including Katie Chiles Ottenweller, southeast director at Vote Solar, expressed discontent over the size of the program and predicted that the program would quickly reach capacity.
“We know that GPC will continue to fight fair compensation rates for rooftop solar, but we are particularly disappointed that the PSC let them get away with it,” said Kevin Lucas, senior director of utility regulation and policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “The Commissioners had all the information and data they needed to expand the pilot monthly netting program and spur Georgia’s rooftop solar market, but they simply chose not to do so. Frustratingly, the PSC’s failure to expand the pilot program and only offer a temporary increase for exported energy will keep the state’s rooftop solar sector mired at the bottom of the national rankings.”
Georgia ranks 7th nationally in the SEIA solar deployment tracker, with over 4.3 GW installed to date. The state holds over 4,400 solar jobs, houses 176 solar businesses, and roughly 4% of the state’s total electricity comes from solar energy. Read more about Georgia’s solar policies here.
SEIA intervened in the case alongside Vote Solar and the Georgia Solar Energy Industries Association (GASEIA). The coalition’s joint comments include analysis showing how customers could have saved money under a different rate structure.

“The PSC’s small and temporary increase for exported rooftop solar energy will not encourage any economic development in the Georgia rooftop solar market,” said Allison Kvien, southeast regulatory director at Vote Solar. “Policymakers should be working to expand solar access, not stifle it. As we begin a new legislative session in a few short weeks, we’ll be looking to state legislators to take real action and make Georgia a place where people have the ability and the real, economic option to manage their energy bills through rooftop solar adoption.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/12/21/50-states-of-solar-incentives-wisconsin/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,WISCONSIN",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 21, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Wisconsin ,"The pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives last stop was Louisiana, and now moves into Wisconsin.
Ranked 23th in the nation according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Wisconsin has a relatively low electricity rate, at 16 cents per kWh, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), 21% lower than the national average.  
Wisconsin’s industrial sector, including agriculture, food and beverage product manufacturing, is the state’s largest energy-consuming sector, with industrials representing 31% of the state’s total energy consumption. 
The state’s robust agricultural market ranked it ninth in the nation in fuel ethanol production capacity, producing close to 600 million gallons of ethanol per year from just nine facilities. Coal power continues to dominate, at 42% of the Badger State’s energy mix, but down sizably from a whopping 82% of the portfolio mix in 1997, according to the EIA. 
Nevertheless, the state’s vast industrial network makes Wisconsin’s energy consumption six times the rate of which it produces energy, creating fertile ground for a proactive renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS).  
Wisconsin became the first state to create a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 1999 without restructuring its utility market. In 2006, Act 141 was enacted, which requires the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to revise its integrated resource plan and energy efficiency program every four years, a proactive approach to energy policy in a historic coal and gas state.  
While the state has favorable residential and utility solar regulations for development, community solar access for residents or small businesses has faltered in as utilities continue to block community access to small-solar projects. 
Net metering 
The state’s PSC in 1982 filed an order that required utilities to file tariffs allowing net metering to customers that generate electricity of up to 20 kW per household or business. 
The PSC has no administrative rules for net metering. Customer net excess generation (NEG) is generally credited at the utility’s retail rate for renewables and at the utility’s avoided-cost rate for non-renewable energy.  Generally speaking the NEG credit is carried over to the customer’s next bill and if the NEG credit exceeds $25, then the utility is required to issue a credit to the customer for excess generation.  
The net-metering standard governs solar as well as wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro and various other distributed generation projects.  
Currently Xcel Energy has a 100 kW system size for net metering maximum, and the utility’s Northern States Power Company affiliate uses the NEG standard credit over monthly at the retail rate with customers compensated at the end of the calendar year at avoided cost rate. 
Wisconsin Electric Power (We Energies) has a more proactive 300 kW net metering limit, with NEG credits reconciled monthly at a customer buyback rate of $0.04245 per kWh.  
The state’s third major utility, Madison Gas and Electric also has a 100 kW net metered limit with monthly NEG credit reconciliation that factors in energy, capacity and transmission costs.  
Distributed generation 
On December 9, the Wisconsin PSC approved Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) to purchase solar energy and battery storage power capacity from the Darien Solar Energy Center, a $478 million, 250 MW solar plus 75 MW battery storage facility to be built by Invenergy. 
WEC Energy Group subsidiaries We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service will own the remaining 225 MW of the solar output and 67.5 MW of battery storage from the project, though their purchase arrangement has yet to be approved.  
“The Darien Solar Energy Center is another important step in our ongoing transition to cleaner energy sources, reducing carbon at least 80% by the end of this decade and achieving net-zero carbon electricity by 2050,” said Jeff Keebler, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Madison Gas. 
WEC Energy told the public that the distributed generation project is needed to help meet capacity requirements as the utility retires a 1.39 GW coal-fired power fleet over the next four years.  For its part, Madison Gas is seeking to replace its share of the coal-fired Columbia Energy Center, which is also scheduled to shut down by 2026. 
Over the last two years, Wisconsin has catapulted its solar use, with 1.13 GW of installed capacity as of September 30, as the state brought online a strong 495 MW of solar capacity in 2021.  The state’s utilities are in better position to see more development like Darien Solar, with an impressive 4.25 GW growth pipeline for solar deployments over the next five years. 
Invenergy completed an earlier project, Badger Hollow in Montfort, Wisconsin, which at 300 MW capacity contributed to the uptick in recent solar deployments when it came online in 2021. 
 Community solar 
Unlike its two Midwest neighbors Illinois and Minnesota, Wisconsin still lacks broader policy framework allowing for the community engagement and participation in solar projects at the local level.  With rooftop solar rules allowing net metering, while its trio of public utilities reaps the benefit of a growing solar and storage portfolio, local consumers do not yet have access to community solar. 
Proposed community solar legislation (SB 490 / AB 527) did not pass during a 2021-22 state session.  “We made great progress in educating and building support with various stakeholders and the legislature about this method of delivering solar energy,”  said Jim Boullion, director of government affairs of RENEW Wisconsin.
So far about 16 corporations such as Arcadia, Generac, and local groups have expressed public support of community solar (SB 490) becoming state law in Wisconsin during the next state session, which reconvenes in January 2023. Each of the state’s public utilities have opposed the community solar mandate.  
Landmark installation
The Badger Hollow solar facility in Montfort became the first large-scale utility project to enter commercial operations in Wisconsin in November 2021. Developed also by Invenergy, the 300 MW project provides enough clean energy to power more than 77,100 homes. Local reports say the 1,100-acre site for the project in Iowa County, Wisconsin has co-located hog farming operations, with the project providing tax revenue from the shared leasing of the facility on farmland.
Madison Gas and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS), a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, share a combined 150 MW of the power output from the Badger Hollow facility, while Madison Gas also purchased an additional 50 MW of output of the first 150 MW phase of the project from 2019.  The two utilities also committed to purchasing the 150 MW output from the second phase of the project in 2020.  Badger Hollows features 500,000 solar panels spread across the large acreage.
