New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced the $100 million investment alongside a new executive order establishing an Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. He said the actions will help the environment while moving New Jersey toward 100% clean energy by 2050.
Leveraging proceeds from New Jersey’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Volkswagen Mitigation Trust Funds, the $100 million funding will go toward the following projects:
“Climate change is the single greatest long-term threat currently facing humanity, and our state and economy are uniquely vulnerable to its devastating effects,” said Murphy. He added that the new investments “signify our commitment to environmental justice and equity, while building a cleaner economy that works for all.”
Massachusetts’ Baker-Polito administration announced another expansion of the state’s EV rebate program, Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles (MOR-EV), to now include light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EVs.
The expansion includes $10 million in funding for electric trucks and builds on the administration’s June 2020 announcement to broaden the program to include commercial and nonprofit fleets.
Medium- and heavy-duty truck purchases made on or after Feb. 16 will now be eligible to receive rebates through MOR-EV. Rebate values will vary by vehicle weight rating, ranging from $7,500 for pickup trucks up to $90,000 for tractor trailer trucks.
Rebate values will decline over time, recognizing the anticipated cost declines of the emerging battery-electric and fuel-cell electric truck sector. Rebates will be available for all truck purchases, including private, commercial, and public fleet vehicles.
Gov. Charlie Baker said the rebates are important to help make EVs “more financially viable for residents and businesses.”
He added that the Baker-Polito administration continues to “take action to electrify Massachusetts’ transportation system to combat climate change and meet our ambitious commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.”
Since June 2014, the MOR-EV program has issued over $37 million in rebates, incentivizing the purchase of over 18,000 EVs and reducing the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 45,000 metric tons annually.
Funded with Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative auction proceeds, MOR-EV is administered by the Center for Sustainable Energy on behalf of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources. More program information is available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/18/energyhub-looks-to-make-distributed-resource-management-easier-with-mercury-edge-connect/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",EnergyHub looks to make distributed resource management easier with Mercury Edge Connect,"EnergyHub has released Mercury Edge Connect, a standardized integration framework for connecting distributed energy resource (DER) providers with EnergyHub’s Mercury DERMS platform.
EnergyHub’s Mercury DERMS is a management system platform that allows utilities to take advantage of the DERs at the edge of the grid, communicating with these resources, controlling them, and using them to optimize performance. The platform also allows for the resources to provide a host of grid services, including demand response, flexible capacity, load shifting, voltage and frequency regulation, and reactive power.
The addition of Mercury Edge Connect allows utilities to manage devices from any DER provider to deliver grid services, acting as a single platform for utilities to orchestrate behind-the-meter DERs into virtual resources at scale.
Thus far, National Grid and its Connected Solutions program have been the main testing ground for EnergyHub’s Mercury DERMS. Under this program, customers receive a modest bill discount for allowing National Grid to temporarily lower or turn off their AC systems periodically in the summer in order to relieve grid stress during periods of high demand. The utility can also aggregate residential batteries and discharge their power to the grid to meet demand peaks, without any impact on customers.
According to Matt Johnson, EnergyHub’s vice president of business development, customers may not even know when their battery is being discharged, and National Grid plans for no more than 60 three-hour demand response events over a summer.
EnergyHub said it hopes that Mercury Edge Connect will allow utilities to expand integration and partnerships with manufacturers by creating a standardized framework to integrate with any DER service provider on the market.
“Mercury Edge Connect is fundamental to achieving our mission of enabling utilities to transform complexity at the grid edge into reliable resources for utilities,” said Johnson.
Currently, Sunrun, Tesla, and Vivint Solar have partnered with EnergyHub on the Mercury DERMS platform, though EnergyHub hopes that the functionality brought on by Mercury Edge Connect will help attract more solar companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/18/grid-access-charge-for-solar-customers-proposed-in-missouri/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,COST AND PRICES,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MISSOURI",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Grid access charge for solar customers proposed in Missouri,"The Missouri House Utilities Committee held the first in a series of discussions on proposed fees for residential solar customers.
The fees were introduced as part of HB 539, legislation from Rep. Jeff Knight (R). The bill would require customers using solar panels to pay a fee and would add a grid access fee for customers who sell generated energy back to their utility.
The bill also would require equipment to meet a certain standard and for retail electric suppliers to allow consumers to use the energy they generate whenever they need it.
Knight told the local press, “I’m not against solar; I’m not here to kill jobs. I’m simply here for fairness in the industry.”
He argued that net metering solar customers should be looked upon to help fund the system involved in delivering electric power. He explained the bill as an attempt to establish a cost to grid usage.
Grid access charges are not the only type of fee typically imposed on residential solar customers, but all such fees carry the potential to cripple a region’s distributed solar market. In Missouri, a state with just 281.5 MW of installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), residential solar has been a consistent source of new capacity.

SEIA predicts that the state will add 851 MW in capacity over the next 5 years, a volume that could be hampered if the proposed fees are enacted.
During the bill’s next scheduled hearing, set to take place next week, representatives from Renew Missouri are expected to testify against HB 539. HB 539 has also faced opposition from some of the state’s residential installers, who say that pinning any necessary grid upgrades onto solar customers moves the state in the wrong direction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/18/bidens-doi-revokes-trump-era-attack-on-desert-renewable-energy-conservation-plan/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Biden’s DOI revokes Trump-era attack on Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan,"The Biden administration announced that its U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) will not proceed with an eleventh-hour move by the former Trump administration to undermine the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP).
In 2016, the DOI’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) completed the first phase of the DRECP, focused on 10.8 million acres of public lands in the desert regions of seven California counties. The DOI said the DRECP is a landscape-level plan that streamlines renewable energy development while conserving unique and valuable desert ecosystems and providing outdoor recreation opportunities.
The DRECP is a collaborative effort between the BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and California Energy Commission (CEC).
However, in the final days of Trump’s presidency, his administration’s DOI proposed changes to the plan that the CEC, environmental groups, and other DRECP stakeholders denounced as destructive.
In a statement, Biden’s DOI said the Trump administration moved to scrap the plan, thereby undermining opportunities for renewable energy development and enduring conservation measures. In a Federal Register notice to be published in the coming days, the DOI will formally revoke the BLM’s comment period on the Trump administration’s draft environmental impact statement to amend the DRECP.
Laura Daniel Davis, the DOI’s principal deputy assistant secretary of land and minerals management, said the DRECP represents a years-long and “unprecedented partnership” between the federal government, the State of California, Tribal Nations, and other parties.
She called the Trump administration’s proposal to reopen the plan “unnecessary” and “at odds with balanced land management.”
She added, “We look forward to renewing our partnership with the state to build a clean energy economy that creates jobs, addresses climate change, and conserves public lands for current and future generations.”
Commissioner Karen Douglas said the CEC was “pleased” to hear that the DOI had preserved the DRECP, thus protecting public lands and wildlife while ensuring California can reach its 100% by 2045 renewable energy target.
The Sierra Club also applauded the Biden administration’s choice to keep the DRECP intact.
Jenny Binstock, senior campaign representative for the environmental group’s Our Wild America Campaign in California, said the plan will “continue to serve as a landmark model” for balanced conservation and clean energy development.
As part of a government-wide approach to fighting climate change, President Biden ordered the DOI in late January to help boost responsible renewable energy development on public lands. Citing that directive, the DOI recently advanced a 350 MW solar project proposed for the California desert.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/18/chinas-cheap-electricity-crowds-out-foreign-polysilicon/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,CHINA",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",China’s cheap electricity crowds out foreign polysilicon,"From pv magazine Global
Polysilicon market analyst Johannes Bernreuter said that China imported around 30% less polysilicon in 2020 and cornered 80% of the global market for its domestic manufacturers, fueled by low electricity prices.
Chinese imports of U.S.-made polysilicon slumped in 2020, largely due to heavy customs duties. The 9,227 MT of product moved across the Pacific in 2019 fell to 2,659 MT last year, reflecting the 2019 shuttering of the Moses Lake facility in Washington state owned by Norwegian business REC Silicon.
“South Korea’s polysilicon industry was out-competed by Chinese producers who enjoy extremely low and subsidized electricity rates from coal-fired power plants in the western regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia,” said Bernreuter. He said that Korean players OCI and Hanwha exited the market a year ago, citing electricity prices.
That decision prompted the volume of South Korean polysilicon imported by China to fall from 48,881 metric tons (MT) in 2019 to 15,331 MT last year, according to the analyst. Korean poly had made up more than 70,000 MT of imports by China in 2016 and 2017, before the nation’s third largest manufacturer of the commodity–Hancook Silicon–became insolvent in 2018.
OCI is still supplying the product to China, however, via its Malaysian manufacturing operation, which supplied 23% of Chinese polysilicon imports last year, according to Bernreuter.
With German manufacturer Wacker supplying 50,061 MT of polysilicon to China in 2020–despite running production at 70% capacity from May to July–Bernreuter estimated that German and Malaysian-made product will account for almost 90% of China’s poly imports this year. The amount of polysilicon shipped by Wacker to China slipped last year, from 52,667 MT in 2019.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/18/group-pushes-for-more-solar-and-storage-in-minnesota-resource-plan/,"ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MINNESOTA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Group pushes for more solar and storage in Minnesota resource plan,"Minnesota’s Xcel Energy could save consumers money by accelerating its plans to build 3.5 GW of utility-scale PV, and allowing for 2.6 GW of distributed solar and 1.3 GW of distributed storage, according to a resource plan developed by Vibrant Clean Energy (VCE) and filed with state regulators by the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota.
The so-called “Consumers Plan” ultimately reaches the same 3.5 GW of utility-scale solar by 2035 that Xcel proposed. However, it would start building that capacity now, rather than waiting until 2025 as in Xcel’s plan.
Distributed PV installations would reach 2.6 GW by 2035 in the Consumers Plan, paired with 1.4 GW of seven-hour distributed storage. Xcel’s plan would add 0.6 GW of distributed solar during the same timeframe, including 15 MW per year from 2026 onward. The Consumers Plan also includes 5.7 GW of wind power, more than double the amount in Xcel’s plan.
The difference in approach partly reflects VCE’s modeling, which co-optimized generation and distribution investments. The amounts of distributed solar and storage in the Consumers Plan could “defer distribution system upgrades even as the load increases due to electrification,” the technical report said.
The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is evaluating Xcel’s preferred resource plan through a public process. The Citizens Utility Board advocates for affordable and reliable utility service and clean energy for residential and small business consumers across Minnesota.
The Consumers Plan envisions 1.4 GW of distributed storage. Xcel instead would add 2.6 GW of “firm load supporting resources,” which it also calls “firm peaking,” and which would use technology to be specified later.
The Consumers Plan also calls for “significant new transmission” in Minnesota “to connect the large buildout of wind and solar.” Much of that transmission would be added by upgrading existing transmission pathways. The plan also envisions interstate transmission buildout across 10 states.
The increased amounts of solar and wind power in the Consumers Plan, combined with storage, increased transmission, and continued use of nuclear power, enable early retirement of coal plants, eliminate the need for a proposed 800 MW gas unit, and avoid the need for new fossil units. As a result, “consumers will not be saddled with likely future stranded assets,” said VCE’s report. All totaled, the Consumers Plan projects cumulative savings for the utility of $6.45 billion by 2040.
VCE’s modeling aimed to ensure system reliability and resource adequacy by requiring a 7% load-following reserve at all times while maintaining the North American Electric Reliability Council recommended planning reserve margins. VCE conducted modeling using its WIS:dom-P model, while Xcel used the Strategist and EnCompass models.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/18/sunpower-posts-solid-q4-results-as-tailwinds-and-storage-help-fuel-growth/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",SunPower posts solid Q4 results as tailwinds and storage help fuel growth,"Aided by strong industry tailwinds, SunPower exceeded the top end of its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) guidance to post $412 million in net income and $39 million in adjusted EBITA for the fourth quarter of 2020.
“We see significant opportunity to drive long-term growth through the expansion of our addressable market,” SunPower’s CEO Tom Werner said during a Feb. 17 earnings call.

Storage, digital solutions, and the company’s distributed generation services platform will be key to the company’s long-term growth, he said. Over the next 30 years, SunPower expects the distribution generation solar and storage market to grow to become a $65 billion market.
In January, SunPower announced plans to extend its residential installation business into seven new markets across six states by the end of the second quarter. Markets targeted for the first quarter include Tucson, Ariz.; Fresno and the Greater Central Valley, Calif.; and Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Later this year SunPower will launch in Denver; Raleigh, N.C.; and the Washington DC metro area. The company also said it plans to hire more than 300 field technicians across these cities in 2021 and to complete twice as many installs year over year.
The company also said in January that it would close its solar panel manufacturing plant in Hillsboro, Ore., affecting 170 employees.
During the last quarter of 2020, SunPower de-levered its balance sheet, while also lowering its cost of capital.
On the residential and light commercial customers side, improved pricing, better financing economics, and a shift to higher-margin loan and lease sales increased gross margin to 24% for the quarter.
Strong fourth quarter demand across the company’s retrofit, new homes, and light commercial business lines helped fuel a 35% increase in megawatts recognized, the company said.
Additionally, residential and light commercial customer demand for resiliency and energy management capabilities pushed attach rates for SunPower’s 26 kWh SunVault solar plus storage solution above 20% during the quarter. The company  expects SunVault revenue to hit $100 million in 2021.
“We are managing the supply chain very closely,” said Norm Taffe, executive vice president of products at SunPower, adding that the company doesn’t think that supply chain constraints will limit SunVault’s ability to hit this year’s revenue expectation. Recently opened sales markets outside of California are expected to provide another driver of growth. Starting in the second quarter, the company will be able to “attack our installed base with SunVault,” Taffe said.
SunPower’s fourth quarter commercial and industrial installs rose more than 65% sequentially, accompanied by gross margin expansion and progress on cost control programs.
Demand for the company’s Helix storage solution for commercial and industrial customers also remained high, the company said. In 2020, Helix sales attach rates were above 30%, and the company installed 18 MWh during the year.
SunPower also signed during the quarter its first contracts linked to the California Public Utility Commission’s self-generation incentive program for storage, and it expanded its community solar pipeline to more than 90 MW.
According to SunPower, its combined backlog and pipeline of more than 800 MWh and its high sales attach rate for Helix leave it well placed to capitalize on increased demand for its commercial storage and services solutions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/18/sunrise-brief-li-ion-battery-plant-is-headed-to-tennessee/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Sunrise brief: Li-ion battery plant is headed to Tennessee,"Vehicle battery maker Microvast said it plans to spend $220 million to set up a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility in Clarksville, Tennessee.
Microvast will renovate and expand an existing facility to make battery cells, modules and packs.
Earlier this month, Microvast agreed to merge with Tuscan Holdings Corp. The merger is expected to provide up to $822 million to fund capacity expansion and enable Microvast to meet signed contracts that have a total value of more than $1.5 billion.
Founded in 2006 and based in Houston, Microvast is involved from core battery chemistry (cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator) to battery packs. The U.S. battery manufacturing venture has been in the works since 2019.
MiaSolé Hi-Tech Corp. and European Solliance Solar Research said they achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.5% on a tandem solar cell. The architecture combines two thin-film solar cell technologies: a top rigid semi-transparent perovskite solar cell with a bottom flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) cell. The conversion efficiency was achieved by optimizing the bandgap and the efficiency of both the rigid semi-transparent perovskite top cell and the flexible CIGS bottom cell. The CIGS was roll-to-roll produced on steel foil, with a reported power conversion efficiency of 20.0%.
Trimark Associates said it was selected to provide the SCADA portion of the 1,118 MW, 2,165 MWh Edwards & Sanborn solar-plus-storage project being built by Terra-Gen in Kern County, California. As a subcontractor, Trimark’s scope of work includes meteorological stations, networking equipment, and a dynamic loss compensation (DLC) system to address power purchase agreement requirements. Trimark also will provide metering, including revenue meters. Site construction began in February and is expected to be completed in late 2022.
JinkoSolar Holding Co. said that it signed a solar glass procurement contract with Flat Glass Group Co., securing around 338 million square meters of rolled glass to support production of 59 GW of solar modules for three years from 2021 to 2023.
