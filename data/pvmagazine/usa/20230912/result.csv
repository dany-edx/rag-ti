In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. 
The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).
In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
String inverters generally come with simplified wiring and a centralized location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. Inverters can typically cost 10-20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10-15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from 5-10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.

Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Roth Capital Partners said its industry contacts generally report microinverter failures at a substantially lower rate than string inverters, though the upfront cost is generally a bit higher in microinverters.
Microinverters typically have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components are designed to last for 20-25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
As for inverter providers, a few brands hold dominant market share. In the United States, Enphase the market leader for microinverters, while SolarEdge leads in string inverters. Tesla has been making waves in the residential string inverter space, taking up market share, though it remains to be seen how much of an impact Tesla’s market entry will make, said an industry note from Roth Capital Partners.
(Read: “U.S. solar installers list Qcells, Enphase as top brands“)
A study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, it is recommended to install the device in a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. Installers should avoid areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
It is a best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. Inspections typically cost $200-$300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20-25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next installment of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/12/carrier-launches-new-series-of-high-temperature-heat-pumps-2/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",Carrier launches new series of high-temperature heat pumps,"From pv magazine Global
Carrier has launched a new series of high-temperature heat pumps for applications in industrial sites, commercial settings, public buildings, and district heating systems.
It has developed four new products with capacities ranging from 30 kW to 375 kW, all of which use hydrofluoroolefins as a refrigerant.
“In addition to harnessing heat from ambient air and the ground, the heat pumps capture wasted heat from a wide range of sources, including data centers, leisure facilities, hotels and restaurants, process water, flue gases and sewage systems,” the manufacturer said. “Heat collected can be used for comfort heating and domestic hot water production in large buildings and facilities.”
One of the products, the 410 kW AquaForce 61CA air-source heat pump, can reach a temperature of up to 82 C. The manufacturer said it is a suitable solution for large buildings, as well as local and district heating networks.
The AquaForce 61CW-Z water-source heat pump, meanwhile, offers power ranging from 410 kW to 735 kW. It can achieve a temperature of up to 92 C. The new solution is recommended for district heating networks and industrial process heating systems.
The third product – the AquaForce 61CWD water-source heat pump – has a power range of 110 kW to 540 kW and can reach a temperature of up to 120 C.
“Screw compressors specially designed for the highest temperatures for heavy-duty continuous use,” the company said noting the product is also suitable for industrial process heating.
The smallest product, the AquaSnap 61CG water-source heat pump, has a capacity of 30 kW to 130 kW and can be cascaded to 390 kW. It can reach a temperature of up to 82 C and can be used for heat recovery in hotels, the food-processing sector, and the pharmaceutical industry, while also supporting energy supplies and data centers.
“The units come ready to connect to Abound, Carrier’s cloud-based digital platform that enables real-time, intelligent outcome-based results that make buildings more efficient and responsive,” the manufacturer said. “To minimize operating costs, users can opt for one of Carrier’s BluEdge service options to keep heat pumps operating at peak performance and efficiency throughout their lifecycle.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/12/equity-centered-regulation-is-vital-to-a-clean-energy-future-for-all/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,MASSACHUSETTS,MICHIGAN,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",Equity-centered regulation is vital to a clean energy future for all ,"When it comes to clean energy policy, legislative solutions are often in the spotlight. While legislation has a vital role to play in advancing our energy transition, there is an equally crucial, and often much less visible, path away from fossil fuels and toward a brighter, cleaner future. That path runs directly through state energy regulatory bodies, like public service or utility commissions. Regulation is where some of the most impactful decisions on energy generation, costs, and consumption are made. When approached through a people and justice-first lens, the results can be transformative. When that lens is removed, we run the risk of exacerbating existing power structures that benefit wealthy utility companies over the people they’re tasked with serving. How we choose to show up, and who we make space for at the table, can mean the difference between truly equitable solutions and maintaining the status quo.
One shining example of equity-centered regulation done right comes from Michigan, where Vote Solar and our partners negotiated a landmark settlement with utility giant, DTE Energy. Through a combination of hard-fought negotiations and a public pressure campaign, we secured a settlement that will add 3,800 megawatts of renewable energy to the grid, retire coal seven years ahead of schedule, and direct $38 million toward utility payment assistance programs and energy upgrades for low-income customers. The settlement provisions will lead directly to improved health outcomes for communities who have long borne the brunt of pollution from fossil-fuel facilities. Moreover, fewer families will be forced to make impossible decisions between paying their utility bill and affording other necessities like groceries and medication. According to Will Kenworthy, Vote Solar’s Senior Regulatory Director for the Midwest, the agreement was “one of the biggest regulatory wins” we’ve seen. While there’s always more progress to be made, we’re incredibly proud of the possibility this achievement represents.
This year also brought progress in Minnesota, where we and our partners in the Just Solar Coalition urged the state’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to address entrenched racial and wealth disparities in bill affordability for Xcel Energy customers. While the PUC’s decision didn’t include everything we advocated for, it did include a major finding. In its order, the PUC explicitly acknowledged the importance of justice in setting energy costs: a very rare occurrence that speaks to just how far advocates have been able to shift the needle in our collective understanding of energy justice and equity.
These victories, and many others, were made possible through a combination of regulatory expertise and justice-focused, collaborative partnerships with frontline, community-based organizations. We walked in lockstep every step of the way and showed up as a united front. Most importantly, we respected and relied on one another’s expertise. Without the deep knowledge and lived experience of our frontline partners, our understanding – and thus the energy decisions made – would fall short of serving the very people who are most impacted by them.
Unfortunately, this type of collaboration is still the exception, not the norm. Both community-based organizations and individual members of the public face structural and systemic barriers to participation in making decisions that directly impact them. Regulatory proceedings are often shrouded in technical jargon and unwelcoming to those without advanced knowledge of regulatory policy — not to mention those who primarily speak a language other than English. Even if someone does feel empowered to share their perspective, logistical hurdles like work schedules, transportation, and caregiving responsibilities can stand in the way. For organizations, intervening in a regulatory docket — the formal process of opposing a utility’s proposal — is often time-consuming and expensive.
State energy regulators have both a responsibility and an opportunity to break down these barriers to participation — and fortunately, there’s already a good amount of trusted guidance on how to make that happen. Earlier this year, Vote Solar joined a working group convened by the Massachusetts Attorney General to release recommendations for improving public participation. In speaking to more than 650 Massachusetts residents, our working group learned that even relatively easy-to-implement solutions can make a meaningful difference when it comes to public engagement. For example, providing language interpretation, scheduling public hearings at accessible locations and at varied times of day, and developing education resources in plain, non-technical language could all empower someone to step into a room they’ve previously been locked out of.
Of course, the onus isn’t solely on regulators and other policymakers. Clean energy advocates — especially those of us privileged enough to have adequate staff and financial resources — also have a responsibility to ensure that we’re conscious of who is being consulted, heard, and invited. True energy equity requires that everyone have the opportunity, knowledge, and access to participate fully in the regulatory process. As Vote Solar continues to advance our mission of a resilient world, powered by the sun, our commitment to centering justice has never been more important. We invite, and implore, you to join us.
Sachu Constantine is the executive director of Vote Solar, a national nonprofit working to realize a 100% clean energy future through a solutions-driven, people-first approach.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/12/planes-trains-or-automobiles-which-has-the-lowest-carbon-footprint/,"EV,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023","Planes, trains, or automobiles: Which has the lowest carbon footprint?","Tens of thousands of solar power professionals are journeying across the United States and from around the globe to Las Vegas, Nevada for RE+. For many, both the trip and their overall careers are mission driven by a commitment to emissions reductions. This raises an obvious question: If they must attend the convention, which mode of travel would emit the smallest quantity of carbon?
Three attendees, Christian Roselund, Peter Kelley, and John Fitzgerald Weaver, decided to go by train starting from the East Coast. Along the way they put their heads together, developing their casual debate about ‘low-emission’ travel into a more precise, detailed explanation.
Planes, trains, or automobiles – which has the lowest emissions?
Finding an accurate answer was not easy, but the 60-hour Amtrak journey to the convention allowed for deep reflection and discussion on various energy infrastructures. As the train traversed the landscape, a vast array of energy infrastructure piqued our interests: wind turbines, coal-laden railcars, solar arrays, hydro dams, and electricity substations.

As some readers may expect, calculating emissions is complex. While there are numerous CO2 calculators available, they can yield different results due to varying underlying assumptions. While CO2 emissions can be straightforward to compute, other factors, such as the effects of water vapor, NOx, and black carbon at high altitudes, complicate matters. This led our conversation to its primary challenge: which assumptions should be used?
When assessing the emissions from aviation, the selection of appropriate assumptions is crucial. Although determining a jet’s CO2 emissions is fairly standardized, emissions like water vapor, NOx, and black carbon at high altitudes play a significant role. These elements directly influence ‘radiative forcing,’ the balance between sunlight absorbed by the Earth and energy radiated back to space. Alterations in this balance, driven by these emissions, can impact the Earth’s climate and temperature.
Disclaimer: we are not climate scientists. The effects of non-CO2 emissions on radiative forcing are actively being researched and debated. For a comprehensive comparison of opinions on this matter, consider visiting resources like Toitū Envirocare, which provides insights into how various standards apply Radiative Forcing Index (RFI) multipliers.
It’s worth noting that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) emissions calculator, viewed by many experts we consulted as the industry standard for aviation’s CO2 emissions, doesn’t factor in non-CO2 radiative forcing.

Yet, both the IPCC and governments from countries like the UK and New Zealand account for non-CO2 radiative forcing in aviation emissions. They use a multiplier of 1.9, indicating aviation’s climate impact is nearly double what raw CO2 emissions suggest.
Emissions from Amtrak, though different, still pose a challenge. Ideally, calculating CO2 from a diesel train should be simple. However, Amtrack’s public data doesn’t distinguish between diesel and electric train emissions. After some digging, we found an EPA draft paper that calculated an emissions intensity of 0.28 lbs CO2 per passenger mile for Amtrack’s diesel trains in 2018. A clear and easily accessible disclosure from Amtrak on the emissions of its diesel fleet would provide a significant contribution to the public discourse on travel emissions.
Which carbon footprint is smallest?
Emissions intensity varies widely, and isn’t determined solely by the mode of transportation. A variety of factors come into play, such as the distance traveled and the source of the energy propelling the vehicle. For instance, when considering how far you’re traveling, is your train diesel or electric? The answer could significantly impact the emissions of your journey.
Short-haul flights typically have a higher emissions intensity per mile. This is largely because more energy is expended, and more carbon released, during takeoff than during cruising. Conversely, trains offer a different dynamic. In the U.S., electric trains are primarily found on the Boston to Washington D.C. route, and produce significantly fewer emissions than diesel trains. 
Therefore, traveling by train along Amtrak’s “Northeast Corridor,” is a clear win for the environment, especially if it’s electric. In this region, even raw CO2 emissions from trains tend to be much lower than planes, particularly because the flights are short. According to the EPA analysis cited above, electric trains produce less than half the emissions of a diesel train.
Yet, our 2,961 mile experience painted a different picture. Our journey was a combination of long-distance train travel, served only by diesel engines, and car rides, which combined to create a carbon emissions scenario that surprisingly favored flying. A direct flight from Boston to Las Vegas would have been shorter by almost 600 miles compared to our multi-modal journey. Shockingly, this meant that our choice to avoid flight led to higher CO2 emissions – approximately 366 kilograms per person (kg/p).

Despite this revelation, it wasn’t a complete loss for our eco-conscious choice. Thanks to the absence of jet contrails and their associated water vapor emissions – a major component of non-CO2 radiative forcing – we estimate that our total climate impact was 37% less than if we had flown, even if our CO2 emissions were 28% higher.
We were skeptical of our initial findings, given their counterintuitive nature. To verify, we consulted multiple third-party resources, finally settling on what seemed to be the most detailed calculator, Sweden’s Travel and Climate Initiative. Their estimates closely mirrored ours, with train journeys demonstrating a lesser climate impact by about 15%. Notably, their metrics also incorporate non-CO2 radiative forcing, using a factor of 1.7, which is slightly below the standards adopted in the UK and New Zealand.

But that’s not the end of the story. To truly minimize environmental impact, we must consider other factors. Even the season or the time of a flight can make a substantial difference. Radiative impacts peak in the winter and at night, meaning a daytime flight in the summertime has lower than average flight emission effects. Lastly, always consider the load factor: is a flight running full, or with many empty seats? Every variable plays its role in this complex equation.
Considering the automobile?
Carpooling from Boston, whether in an internal combustion gas engine or an electric vehicle, emerged as the least emission-intensive travel option for this journey. Additionally, driving could be a faster alternative to Amtrak if the team rotated driving responsibilities and continued without extended breaks.
 
According to Google Maps, the most direct route spans 2,715 miles and requires 39 hours of driving time. If a Tesla Model 3 were the vehicle of choice, boasting an efficiency between 3.3 and 4.17 miles per kWh, then the journey would require 724 kWh, assuming an average of 3.75 kWh/mile.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2021 indicated that the power grid generated 0.88 pounds of CO2 per kWh generated, translating to 0.38 kg/kWh. When divided among three carpooling passengers, the result is approximately 93 kg/p of CO2 emissions.
Consequently, emissions for each traveler in the electric vehicle stand at just over 18% of the equivalent emissions from a direct flight and 25% of the emissions from the predominantly diesel-powered train journey.
Potential solutions
Decarbonizing aviation remains a distant goal, but there are tangible steps to reduce train emissions. A significant issue arises from Amtrak’s reliance on diesel locomotives for their long-distance lines outside the Northeast Corridor. The same research that provided the emissions intensity for diesel indicates that Amtrak’s electric trains emit less than half the amount on a per-passenger basis.
As a result, as Amtrak electrifies its lines, per-passenger emissions could decrease by half or even more. As the energy grid integrates more renewables and becomes cleaner, these per-passenger emissions will continue to decline.
Amtrak is already making strides in this direction by introducing the Amtrak Airo trains. These vehicles, capable of operating on both diesel and electricity, boast greater fuel-efficiency and produce 90% fewer particulate emissions in diesel mode.
 

However, Amtrak faces challenges beyond electrification. The duration of certain journeys, such as the 60 hours from Boston to Flagstaff, is absurd. For example; the Lakeshore Limited, which was the initial segment of the journey for John and Christian, averages a speed of 46 mph despite the fact that the train reached 86 mph on smoother sections of track.
A significant factor hindering speed and efficiency is the state of the tracks. Outside the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak utilizes tracks owned and maintained by freight companies, such as CSX & BNSF. These entities maintain tracks primarily for freight purposes, often neglecting the requirements for passenger travel.
The lack of maintenance has even spurred railroad workers’ unions to advocate for federal government intervention, suggesting the nationalization of these tracks. Such a move could lead to track upgrades or, alternatively, compel these companies to elevate their track standards for more efficient and smoother passenger travel. Without such improvements, advanced features of the new Airo, like its ability to reach speeds of up to 125 mph, might remain underutilized.
In the end, Amtrak’s challenges require external intervention. Both politicians and Amtrak’s management will need external encouragement to enhance the appeal of train travel as an alternative for flying.

High-profile speakers graced the stage at a slick opening event.
The mood at the ceremony was ebullient, given the investment surge currently underway in the United States on the back of the Investment Reduction Act (IRA). Senator Ossoff noted, in his opening address, that “more than $100 billion in private capital,” has be attracted since the passage of the IRA, with announcements of “at least 51 solar manufacturing facilities across the US” having been made.
But it was the message delivered by the celebrity speakers that was perhaps most powerful.
Actor and comedian Kal Penn, who had served in the Obama administration as the President’s Liaison to Young Americans, argued that the advocacy of young people had played an important role in the IRA’s realization in delivering impetus to political leaders to take action on climate change. And that they have an ongoing and important place in America’s clean energy rollout.
Van Jones, another Obama administration alumni, activist lawyer, author, and CNN host, doubled down on the message of inclusion. He argued forcefully that people of color and underprivileged communities must be included in clean energy adoption, production, and installation both for the impact it would have and for the positive contribution it can make to the solar and storage industries.
“We’re not looking for pity, we’re looking for partners to help you clean up,” said Jones. He noted that black communities can be powerful allies to the clean technology community.
“We have seriously cultural firepower,” said Jones. “The black church is an incredible galvanizer,” he noted, adding that black communities can contribute financially, as customers, and provide scale and political cover as the energy transition accelerates.
“It ain’t charity, we are powerful people with a lot of potential, purchasing power, political power who are looking for partners.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, the President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said that RE+ is expected to attract 35,000 participants in 2023. 13,000 exhibitors are participating at the event.
Ross Hopper launched SEIA’s “Solar and Storage Workplace Survey” at the RE+ opening. The survey hopes to “identify equity and opportunity gaps,” in the solar and storage workforce and contribute to inclusive practices as solar and energy storage surges in America.
RE+ is being held at the Venetian Expo and Caesar’s Forum Ballroom, September 11-14. The pv magazine USA team has produced a special edition of the magazine as a guide to the event.
