Applicants will be randomly selected to become subscribers to solar energy produced by the utility’s PV.
Low-income customers who subscribe to the program are guaranteed energy bill savings, said Duke.
“Our customers want affordable, clean energy options, and we believe larger-scale solar is the most cost-effective way to advance the benefits of solar on our entire system,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president.
The program launch follows shortly after the passing of Florida’s House Bill 741, which is considered anti-rooftop solar legislation. Very few polled Florida voters, regardless of political party or age demographics, are in support of the law, which will pass unless Governor Ron DeSantis vetoes it. In fact, 86% of  polled voters are opposed to it, and only 3% voiced support. Rooftop solar is seen as a way to decentralize power distribution and protect land resources from development.
Community solar offers an option to be connected with a carbon-free energy source for those who do not have a suitable roof space for PV. Generally, community solar projects are smaller than utility-scale plants, and are attached at the local distribution level, rather than to large-scale high voltage transmission infrastructure. This program, the Clean Energy Connection, supports the development and construction of Duke Energy Florida-owned solar, said the utility.
“Community solar” appears to be broadly defined in this instance, where the utility company remains sole owner-operator of the assets. In a recent report, the Rocky Mountain Institute offered a framework for the next generation of community solar projects that would be designed to support resilience and cost savings for community stakeholders.
Under the program, customers can subscribe to kilowatt blocks of power, which are charged at $8.35/kW. The utility said a customer with an average usage of 1,000kWh a month could subscribe to about 5kW to cover their energy needs.
Duke said it anticipates the program to be allocated as follows: 486.85 MW to large commercial and industrial customers, 74.9 MW to local government customers, 161.25 MW to residential and small business customers and 26 MW to low-income customers. Each MW represents electrical power equal to 1 million watts, referring to the output capacity of the solar facility.
For low-income subscribers, Duke set aside 26MW, enough to power between 10,000-20,000 homes. The utility said that customers who participate in government subsidy programs or Duke Energy’s low-income energy efficiency program, Neighborhood Energy Saver, will have guaranteed energy bill savings.
Duke said the program is designed to provide participating customers with a seven-year full payback, with bill credits first exceeding subscription fees around three to five years. If the customer remains in the program for seven years, the annual bill credits are projected to be more than the subscription costs, said the utility.
Duke Energy Florida has invested more than $2 billion in solar and expects to have 1.5GW of emission-free generation and 5 million PV modules installed by 2024. Currently, the company has over 400MW of solar assets in operation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/15/50-states-of-solar-incentives-new-hampshire/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,NEW HAMPSHIRE",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 15, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: New Hampshire,"The state of New Hampshire has no stated clean energy goals, despite being surrounded by two states with serious commitments. Massachusetts Climate Action Law calls for net-zero by 2050. Maine recently increased its renewable portfolio standard to 80% by 2030 and set a goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. This sharp contrast with its neighbors is a theme that carries through many state policies. However, the state’s clean energy market gets a boost from informed and environmentally aware organizations and individual residents, many of whom have – slowly but surely– pushed through changes in clean energy policies.
High electric bills are the impetus for many New Englanders to go solar, as New England states have some of the highest electric rates in the country. While New Hampshire’s rates are not the highest of the six-state region, they recently experienced a sharp increase. In 2022, for example, according to EIA data, residential electric rates were $21.26, up from $18.93 in 2021. Commercial rates also saw a spike, jumping from $15.40 in 2021 up to $17.54 this year.
Tax credits and exemptions
For those who seize the opportunity to go solar in New Hampshire, the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is currently 26% of system costs but looking for further incentives gets tricky. For starters, there is no property tax exemption offered by the state. Instead, RSA 72: 61-72 permits cities and towns to offer exemptions from local property taxes for certain renewable energy installations, meaning that those who go solar have to check on whether their individual town has issued either a full or partial exemption. Because property taxes are so high in New Hampshire (third highest in the country) exemptions are important for homeowners going solar.
State incentives and credits
The renewable energy fund was created by the legislature (RSA 362F) to help promote renewable energy initiatives in New Hampshire. The fund supports initiatives through rebate and grant programs. Feeding the fund is New Hampshire’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requires that 25% of the electric energy supplied in the state must be from renewable fuels and resources. Electricity providers who cannot purchase enough renewable energy or who cannot get it at a reasonable price are allowed to meet this requirement by making an alternative compliance payment to the renewable energy fund.
As for a state rebate for going solar, the State of New Hampshire’s Public Utilities Commission has a Residential Renewable Electric Generation Incentive Program that offers $0.20 per watt, up to a maximum of $1,000 or 30% of the total system cost, whichever is less.
In June of 2017 the New Hampshire PUC updated its net metering policy to enable small customer-generators (100kW or less) to net meter their distributed generation resources. According to the docket, “Those customer-generators will receive monthly excess export credits equal to the value of kWh charges for energy service and transmission service at 100 percent and distribution service at 25 percent, while paying nonbypassable charges, such as the system benefits charge, stranded cost recovery charge, other similar surcharges, and the state electricity consumption tax, on the full amount of their electricity imports from the electric grid”.
NH PUC has a renewable energy certificate (REC) program that uses the regional generation information system of energy certificates administered by ISO-New England and the New England Power Pool.  However, RECs in NH are worth far less than in neighboring states. Recent REC prices have been about $30 per MWh, whereas a REC in Massachusetts is currently valued at about $300 per MWh.
New Hampshire gives a nod toward low- to middle-income residents with the Low-Income Community Solar Act (SB 165) of 2019 that expanded the original Clean Energy Jobs and Opportunity Act. It requires the NH PUC to authorize at least two new LMI community solar projects per utility territory each year starting in 2020. According to the 2020 Cost and Benefits Report, “When operational, the projects, as proposed, will generate an estimated 600,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually and provide direct benefits to 123 LMI households, plus 21 non-LMI households”.
Community power
Senate bill 286 went into effect in 2019, allowing for community power, also known as municipal aggregation, which lets towns provide electricity to its residents and businesses on a competitive basis. Electricity is distributed through one of the four traditional utilities in NH– Eversource, Liberty Utilities, NH Electric Cooperative, and Unitil—and towns may choose to purchase power generated by solar, wind, or other attributes. Towns may also choose to construct a local energy project to provide the power to its Community Power program.
Six towns in New Hampshire have committed to the Sierra Club’s Ready for 100 campaign, a movement that aims to get towns to commit 100% clean, renewable energy. Hanover was the first town in the country to sign on, committing in 2017 to a goal of powering the entire community with 100% renewable energy for electricity by 2030 (heat & transportation by 2050).
Solar opportunity
With a total of only 164.8MW of solar installed in the state, New Hampshire is currently ranked 40th in the country for installed solar (down from 36th last year), and only 1.8% of the state’s electricity currently comes from solar.

The growth projection is even more bleak with only 427MW projected over the next five years, or a ranking of 42nd in the country. Let’s say that another way: Only eight states are expected to install less solar than New Hampshire through 2028. There are currently about 55 solar companies in New Hampshire, with a total of approximately 1,000 jobs in the industry.
To find out how to advance solar in New Hampshire and seize the clean energy opportunity, pv magazine spoke with Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire, a non-profit that provides services and resources to support the clean energy and tech communities. Evans-Brown indicated that step one in advancing clean energy in NH would be to expand the renewable portfolio standard. “We’ll keep trying to get policy wins every year and those will necessarily for a while be small, but with small incremental steps, we’ll get it done,” he said. For many years the largest solar arrays in the state were 1 and 2MW facilities, the most recent of which is own by the New Hampshire Electric Coop and located in Moultonborough. The good news is that the tide may be turning, with a few much larger facilities planned in the state. For example, the Chariot Solar 50MW project was recently approved to be built by NextEra Energy on an approximately 200-acre site in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, and expected to be operational next year.
This is the third article in the 50 states of solar incentives series, which began with Maine and then took a look at Connecticut.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/15/three-year-commercial-solar-project-payback-period-expected-through-roof-mount-cost-reductions/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RACKING,CALIFORNIA",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 15, 2022",Three year commercial solar project payback period expected through roof mount cost reductions,"Solar Atmospheres, a California-based provider of state-of-the-art vacuum thermal processing services, now hosts among the largest commercial solar + energy storage system in the state on its roof:  a 772kW PV solar system and a 1,561kW/3,122kWh Tesla battery storage system, installed by SunGreen Systems.
Due to the two federal tax incentives the project will receive, additional state-sponsored incentives, and the avoidance of a roof retrofit, Solar Atmospheres expects a full return on investment within 30-36 months.
The project utilizes S-5! mounting products, and S-5! used the opportunity to prepare a case study, outlining the unique challenges resented by the project and how each was overcome. First and foremost, the project footprint is located on twin 20,000+ square foot metal buildings with American Buildings Long Span III trapezoidal, exposed-fastened metal roofing. As for the site’s energy needs, the buildings feature more than 60 furnaces for vacuum heat treating and brazing services.
While 60 standard, single-sized furnaces would provide a more predictable energy load, the 60 stoves in Solar Atmospheres’ buildings range from lab-size research and development furnaces to the largest commercial vacuum furnace, which measures in at a whopping 48 feet long, with a 150,000-pound capacity. According to S-5! the site experiences very high energy demands and energy charges, so Solar Atmospheres requested the largest solar system the building could handle. 
While SunGreen Systems worked on the PV installation, the company brought on one of its partners, Stem, to propose a combined solar and Tesla battery storage system to shave the demand and arbitrage energy.
In developing the solar system with a mind for putting panels wherever they’d fit, SunGreen Systems turned to S-5!, as the company’s products, in this case the PVKIT solar solution and RibBracket III, provided design flexibility in attachment locations. In addition, the lightweight solutions allowed Solar Atmospheres to avoid costly retrofits. The relationship between pv systems and metal roofs is one that S-5! knows well, and SunGreen Systems demonstrated to Solar Atmospheres the solution via a sample kit provided by S-5!. This presentation enabled Solar Atmospheres to find the right clamp for the project by seeing first-hand the factory-installed gaskets that would preserve the building’s integrity.
S-5! also worked with  SunGreen Systems’ installation crew to demonstrate best practices for rail-less installation, including advance module preparation while other crew members completed the electrical work.  S-5!’s PVKIT mounting utilizes clamps designed to grab and attach onto metal roofs, both at the edge and across the surface. The kit’s pre-assembled components enable installers to attach PV modules to the metal roof’s structural seams or ribs vs. a traditional rail mounting system.
In total, the installation exists over a 52,500 ft2 project footprint, made up of the two rooftops and a 40’ x 150’ carport. Of the installation’s 772kW of capacity,  570kW are contained on the two roofs. The installation is made up of 1,494 United Renewable Energy 380W panels and 14 Tesla Powerpacks.

Senator Markey challenged ISO-NE for proposing to delay the elimination of a rule that “puts fossil fuel generation ahead of cleaner, cheaper alternatives.” The rule is called the minimum offer price rule, or MOPR, but it “actually stands for something else,” Markey said. “It stands for minimizing our potential for renewables, in Massachusetts and all across New England.”
Senator Markey joined with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to send a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, asking the commission to use its existing regulatory authority to reject ISO-NE’s proposal to extend the MOPR rule.
Senator Markey said MOPR sets an “artificially high price” to participate in wholesale electricity auctions “that prevents lower cost providers” of renewables and storage from “out-competing the more expensive fossil fuel power generators.”
The Senator noted that the International Panel on Climate Change has called for peak global emissions no later than 2025, followed by rapid reductions. “Current policies put our warming trends closer to three degrees Celsius. In Fahrenheit, that’s the difference between a 95 degree day and a 101 degree day. But ISO New England says we have to go slow. The difference is this: you have to think about manageable oceans, or 11 feet of sea level rise by the end of this century.”
The letter by the three Senators says that “three New England natural gas plant operators” developed the proposal to keep the MOPR rule for another two years.
“Our energy system is not is not an old boys club and shouldn’t be run like one,” said Amy Boyd, policy director at the nonprofit Acadia Center, speaking after Senator Markey. “We need a modern approach to regional energy management that at a bare minimum gives new clean energy the same access to the capacity market that fossil fuels receive.”
The Alliance of Business Leadership’s president Jen Benson also spoke at the press conference, saying “When you lower the cost of energy, families have more dollars to put into the economy and so do businesses.”
Senator Markey appealed to state pride in his speech, saying “We’re not just the Bay State, we’re the brain state. We have to be leading on these issues, not a laggard.”  He noted that Massachusetts now gets 20% of its electricity from solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/15/speeding-perovskite-solar-cell-development-with-machine-learning/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 15, 2022",Speeding perovskite solar cell development with machine learning,"Perovskites are studied across the globe as a potential alternative to silicon-based solar PV. There is a wide array of materials that are considered perovskites, and they are identified by their specific atomic crystal lattice structure. The cells produced by perovskites are thinner, lighter versions of their silicon counterparts, and can be produced rapidly at room temperature, rather than at the energy-intensive high temperatures needed to produce crystalline silicon cells.
However, taking this technology from the lab to the field requires further improvements. MIT and Stanford researchers are actively working on these improvements, and they’re using the help of artificial intelligence to get there.
Already, the researchers’ efforts have led to the production of a perovskite cell capable of converting energy with 18.5% efficiency, which could compete with conventional technologies. However, scaling this technology is held back by the manufacturing process, which, for most perovskites made today, requires a spin-coating technique. This technique is not viable on a large scale, said the researchers.
The MIT and Stanford team conceived of a new method that involves creating a rolled sheet that would be sprayed or ink-jetted with perovskite materials, allowing for a rapid throughput.
“The real breakthrough with this platform is that it would allow us to scale in a way that no other material has allowed us to do. Even materials like silicon require a much longer timeframe because of the processing that’s done. Whereas you can think of this like spray painting,” said Nicholas Rolston, a Stanford doctoral graduate.
There are many variables to this new process, so many that it would be impossible to test them all without the aid of machine learning, said the researchers. By entering inputs like temperature, humidity, processing path speed, spray nozzle distance, curing methods, and more, the computer model can provide insights much faster than manual testing could ever achieve.
The experimenters can program the model to drive towards a certain goal, like power output of manufacturing throughput. Backed by the Department of Energy, the research is now being spread among active perovskites developers. The code is available for free and open source on GitHub.
 “The primary goal was to accelerate the process, so it required less time, less experiments, and less human hours to develop something that is usable right away, for free, for industry,” said Zhe Liu, research assistant, MIT.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/15/batteries-help-solar-connect-pricing-still-strong/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 15, 2022","Batteries help solar connect, pricing still strong","If you follow solar, you know that interconnection – costs. Time frames and viability are chief among project development challenges.
Government researchers studying the costs of adding batteries to save upgrades to the power grid when installing solar power have released data suggesting that in today’s wholesale market, small scale solar-plus-storage can’t compete financially with standalone solar. However, when just a few hundred thousand dollars of interconnection costs are introduced, the viability begins to tilt toward batteries.
The document — produced by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) – Use of Operating Agreements and Energy Storage to Reduce Photovoltaic Interconnection Costs, offers policy makers an opportunity to financially model how much incentives could cost when deploying distribution level solar-plus-storage.

To reach this conclusion, NREL started with a 3.3MWdc solar plant with interconnection costs ranging up to $650,000. The report also considered a 1.3MWdc solar project, as an example of an alternative facility that would not require interconnection upgrades. Energy storage and curtailment were also introduced, to determine the project with the best financial viability.
The financial model includes making use of the Federal Investment Tax Credit.
The analysis determines that even when interconnection costs are removed, and when operating in wholesale markets, the net present value of a project that adds batteries is less than systems smaller in size, with no batteries, no upgrade costs, and no output rules.
This result is unsurprising for anyone who deals in these markets, since distribution level wholesale market solar-plus-energy storage projects are pretty much unheard of.

The document’s research was released in two complementary publications. The first is a Technical and Economic Analysis, and the second is a Conceptual Framework.
The techno-economic analysis’ purpose is to:
Two requirements of the study are that there must be no annual electricity generation violations (i.e., more local solar than local demand), and that the analysis must use technology that is currently available.
An example of a violation that might be outputting more electricity from the solar+battery facility local load at high noon. In the case of the solar-plus-storage system, the battery would absorb the daytime solar and pump it out later to avoid violations.

NREL modeled a 3.3MWdc project, and based on meeting the technical requirements, came up with four options to adjust the solar power project:
The revenue for these four designs was projected as:

The capex costs of these five systems was suggested to be between $980,000 and $2.82 million, after accounting for the U.S. Federal Investment Tax Credit.
The analysis concludes that with some combinations of decreasing battery pricing, or increasing interconnection costs, small scale solar-plus-storage might compete in the wholesale energy market. In most markets, however, distribution level assets don’t compete in wholesale markets —  they’re usually connected directly to existing buildings, or selling into special programs (like community solar).
Without a doubt, integrating storage on distribution circuits and giving even a small amount of financial support would cut down grid upgrades and greatly increase highly distributed resistance, which could be just enough to make this market viable.

The roadmap, submitted by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the New York State Department of Public Service to the PSC, provides a strategy to expand the state’s already successful NY-Sun initiative into one of the largest and most inclusive solar programs of its kind in the nation.
“This roadmap to expand the NY-Sun initiative into a nation-leading blueprint for the development of distributed solar meets the moment to supercharge our economy and advance our climate goals,” said Governor Hochul.
The framework includes an investment of $1.5 billion in ratepayer-funded incentives to extend the NY-Sun program and continue the reduction in project cost and incentives observed in the last ten years. The public investment is expected to trigger approximately $4.4 billion in private investment to bring awarded projects to fruition, for a total of $5.9 billion in expected investment over the mid- to late-2020s. As many as 6,000 additional solar jobs will be created across the state, including new wage requirements for solar projects between 1- to 5MW.
The program expansion will also deliver at least 35% of the benefits, with a goal of 40%, from the investments to disadvantaged communities and low- to moderate-income New Yorkers.
Expanding the state’s solar goal is expected to have an average bill impact for New York customers of less than 1%, or approximately $0.71 per month for the average residence.
“This comprehensive expansion means more families and businesses, especially those in communities that have been historically underserved, will have access to clean, affordable solar electricity, while ensuring the workers who build these projects get fair wages. Reaching 10 gigawatts will leverage $9 billion in private investment and create thousands of family-sustaining solar jobs, demonstrating the tremendous benefits the state’s clean energy transition is bringing to New Yorkers under Governor Hochul’s leadership,” said Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
The new framework builds on New York’s investments in clean energy. The state is currently ranked 11th in the country for solar installations with nearly 607,000 homes powered by the sun. The state gets 3.14% of its electricity from solar, and prior to passage of this plan, was projected to add another 4,877MW of solar over the next five years. The state has made investments of over $33 billion in 102 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce buildings emissions, $1.8 billion to scale up solar, more than $1 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $1.6 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. Combined, these investments are supporting nearly 158,000 jobs in New York’s clean energy sector in 2020, a 2,100% growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011 and a commitment to develop 9,000MW of offshore wind by 2035. Under the Climate Act, New York will build on this progress and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85% from 1990 levels by 2050, and advance progress toward the state’s 2025 energy efficiency target of reducing on-site energy consumption by 185 trillion BTUs of end-use energy savings.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/15/nrels-eight-storage-projections-through-2050/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 15, 2022",NREL’s eight storage projections through 2050,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) presents eight “key learnings” in a new report, often in the form of projections. Below is a condensed version.
Battery deployments in the US will boost storage capacity to 200GW and 1200GWh in 2050 in the reference case, as shown in the image above. Pumped hydro storage capacity will not increase.
Lithium-ion batteries will continue to have the highest market share “for some time,” as system costs for 4-hour storage, including all system components and installation, fall to $200 perkWh capacity by 2030, and continue to decline. Other technologies “could have new opportunities” if they can compete with battery prices.
The ability to provide firm capacity—which is the greatest value of storage—depends on the fit between storage duration and the duration of the region’s net peak load. Firm capacity enables storage to meet demand during system peak times and to replace gas turbines.
“Time shifting,” or saving energy for discharge at times of high demand, provides a smaller but still significant portion of the value of storage. Providing operating reserves adds minimal value, due to “saturation” of reserve requirements from storage deployed for other reasons. The value of deferring transmission by adding storage was not estimated, as it is “difficult to isolate, and very regionally specific.”
Given the “largely untapped potential flexibility in end-use electricity demand,” storage faces competition from grid flexibility options such as time-varying retail rates and industrial demand response.
Storage and solar power are complementary, as increased deployment of PV shortens the peak net load period, so that shorter-duration storage, at lower cost, can pair with PV to provide firm capacity. The lower costs to provide firm capacity translate to increased storage deployments.
Driving a trend in the opposite direction, as storage deployments increase, the net peak loads become wider, requiring longer-duration storage to provide the same level of firm capacity. As a result, storage durations “will likely increase” as storage deployments increase. As shown in the image above, deployment of 6-hour batteries would start around 2034 in a reference case, and deployment of 8-hour batteries would start around 2040. This dynamic “presents opportunities” for emerging technologies capable of longer durations, “or even for the next generation of existing technologies” such as pumped storage hydropower.
Customer adoption of building-level storage will increase as storage costs decline and if the value of backup power is perceived to be higher. Overall, the customer adoption potential will be lower than the economic potential due to long payback periods. At low battery costs and very low PV costs, distributed storage could reach 82GWh by 2050.
Seasonal storage technologies become “especially important” for 100% clean energy systems, for storing excess generation in the spring and fall and shifting energy supply to the summer and winter. More than 400GW of seasonal storage capacity, such as combustion turbines fueled by renewably derived hydrogen, would be needed for 100% clean energy.
The report concludes by listing remaining uncertainties that “could alter the trajectories for storage growth and evolution.” The report briefly describes each of the six previous NREL studies on which it is based.

Boston-based PolyJoule, a spin-off of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), recently unveiled a new battery technology based on its own proprietary conductive polymers and other organic, non-metallic materials.
“Our batteries are designed to suit the needs of stationary power applications where safety, lifetime, levelized costs, and environmental footprints are key decision drivers,” the company said in a statement. “PolyJoule’s conductive polymer cells span the performance curve between traditional lead-acid batteries and modern lithium-ion cells, while enhancing service life and reducing balance of plant costs, due to their no-HVAC thermal management design.”
According to the manufacturer, the battery cells were tested to perform for 12,000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge. The device is based on a standard, two-electrode electrochemical cell containing the conductive polymers, a carbon-graphene hybrid, and a non-flammable liquid electrolyte. Alternating anodes and cathodes are interwoven and then connected in parallel to form a cell.
The battery may be used for utility and industrial applications such as power conditioning, peak shaving, frequency regulation, hybrid power energy storage, and high-power datacenter backup, the company said.
According to the MIT Technology Review, the battery packs are up to five times larger than lithium-ion systems of the same capacity and don’t require active temperature control. The product is being offered in power strings which the company said can rapidly discharge power, up to 1 MW, in less than 10 seconds and be recharged in less than five minutes.
Each power string measures 2.2 m x 0.8 m x 3.4 m and weighs 1,590 kg. Its nominal voltage is 528 V and the voltage range is 158 V to 972 V. The manufacturer ensures continuous operation at temperatures between -40 C and 50 C with minimal capacity loss.
