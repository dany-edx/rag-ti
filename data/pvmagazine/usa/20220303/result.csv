The company took a major step in that direction, signing a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions.
The PPA is attached to the Pisgah Ridge Solar project, a Texas ERCOT located 250MW facility that broke ground recently. The project is expected to be completed this year, providing 200 to 300 construction jobs.
Each year, the Pisgah Ridge Solar project will generate approximately 200,000MWh  of electricity for Meijer. The decarbonization of Meijer’s operations due to the PPA would be equivalent to taking 20,000 vehicles off the road, or the carbon sequestration of 125,000 acres of forests.
“Meijer has made significant progress over the years to integrate sustainability into our daily operations. We’re committed to these ongoing efforts and a project like this brings us closer to our industry leading sustainability goals,” said president and CEO Rick Keyes.
Schneider Electric advised Meijer in project selection and negotiations. “The need for organizations to take immediate action to decarbonize is at an all-time high, and we are excited to see organizations like Meijer leading the charge to include renewable energy as a part of their long-term strategy,” said Steve Wilhite, president of Schneider Electric’s sustainability business.
Pisgah Ridge, once completed, will be the largest Duke-owned utility-scale solar project. Charles River Laboratories is another corporate offtaker on the project, signed on for 102MW for 15 years. Meijer splits the rest with one other corporation, not yet revealed. Engineering and construction will be performed by Moss & Associates.
Major utility Duke Energy recently announced plans to phase out coal use by 2035. Duke aims for 50% carbon reductions by 2030 and zero-carbon by 2050. Its subsidiary Duke Energy Sustainability Solutions operates 500MW of solar and a 36MW battery storage facility in Texas. Duke Energy said it plans to double its enterprise-wide renewable portfolio from 8 GW to 16 GW by the end of 2025.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/03/cold-weather-ev-bus-from-canada/,"BATTERY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 3, 2022",Cold weather EV bus from Canada,"Canada’s Letenda has unveiled a new electric vehicle (EV) bus designed to perform in cold weather conditions, called the Electrip. This 30-foot bus is built with 222-296kWh Cummins lithium-ion batteries and can charge in two hours with a 150kW DC charger.
The Cummins batteries are controlled by an onboard battery management system that is web-connected for fleet management. Letenda said the bus is “highly efficient” but has not yet released a range. The battery management system features liquid cooling.
The Electrip doesn’t just swap out a diesel engine for electric batteries, it also makes changes to bus design for a more comfortable passenger experience, said Letenda. Due to a low-profile electric drivetrain, the bus has a low floor and high ceilings.
The wheels on the bus are moved to the ends of the vehicle, allowing for tighter turn radiuses and more onboard space. Unlike an ordinary bus, the rear wheels can be turned in the opposite direction to further tighten the turning radius.
The bus is highly insulated for efficiency in warm and cold climates. It has heated surfaces on the windshield and windows, and radiant floor heating for passenger comfort.
The Alternative Fuels Data Center estimates transit buses average about 3.3 mpg. They outperform cars by measure of passenger-mile per gallon but are yet another opportunity for decarbonization. Beyond carbon mitigation, electric buses add additional benefits, like vehicle-to-grid or vehicle-to-vehicle charging services. These services can ease strain on the electric grid and make for a more efficient energy ecosystem.

In a joint venture with Riverstone Credit Partners and Summit Partners Credit Advisors, R3 Renewables plans to develop over 3.3GW of solar PV and 1.6GW of battery storage capacity over the next five years.
Peabody Energy said the sites are in close proximity to grid interconnection points, and the size of the portfolio has the potential for the development of the largest solar and battery storage projects in Indiana and Illinois.
Developing solar on former mining lands is increasing clean energy use in many states, including Kentucky, where the 200MW Martin County Solar Project is being constructed on 1,200 acres of the former Martiki coal mine site, and construction is set to employ displaced coal workers. In 2019, The Nature Conservancy developed a Roadmap for Solar on Mine Lands, which reports that there are up to 400,000 acres of former mine lands and other brownfields that could be suitable for large-scale solar across central Appalachia. If this land area were harnessed for solar development, it could double the total solar capacity installed in the US to date, according to the 2019 report.
Jim Grech, president and CEO of Peabody made it clear that the company is not abandoning coal for renewables. “We are pleased to announce this new joint venture as part of Peabody’s commitment to be the coal producer of choice, creating additional value from our existing assets, supporting our own and our customers’ ESG ambitions and providing added economic benefits for the communities in which we work and live,” said Grech.
John Jones has been appointed CEO of  R3 Renewables, having worked in the independent power industry for 30 years including senior roles at renewable industry leaders GE EFS, Lincoln Clean Energy (now Ørsted North America Onshore) and Invenergy. d the world.

The report looks at 2.3 million residential solar adopters across the country in 2020, representing 82% of all US systems. The report is intended to serve as a reference for policy makers, industry stakeholders, and researchers.
Key findings
Solar adopters span all income ranges, but generally have a higher-than-average income (Figure 1). Nationally, solar adopters’ median household income was $115,000 in 2020, compared to the US median of $63,000. That disparity is partly related to home ownership, and also to the fact that roughly half of residential solar adopters were in California, a relatively high-income state. Looking at solar adopter income by county, the incomes were 58% higher than the median income of all households in the same county, or 23% higher if comparing only to owner-occupied households (OO-HHs) (Figure 1, right).
Lawrence Berkeley Lab
The study showed that the disparity between solar-adopter incomes and the general population has been narrowing over time: Between 2010 and 2020, median solar-adopter incomes in the US fell on an absolute basis from $138k to $115k (see Figure 2, left). The drop reflects the fact that the solar market is deepening, by appealing to less affluent households, and it is broadening into less affluent states. See figure 2, right. which shows an increasing share of the market moving into low- and middle-income states, since 2016.
 
LBL
Solar adopters differ from the broader US population in that they tend to be white, middle aged, English speaking, have business or financial jobs, are more educated, have higher credit scores, and be more likely to live in rural areas (see Figure 3). Some of this characterization has to do with the fact that the dominant share of the US residential solar market is in California, and that state’s demographic makeup is different that of other states.
Not surprisingly, the study found that those who go the solar-plus-storage route have consistently higher incomes.
LBL
The report also describes income differences across system ownership models, installers, system sizes, both stand-alone and paired solar-plus-storage systems, and systems on multi- vs. single-family buildings. This latest update includes data on systems installed through 2020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/03/the-opportunities-and-challenges-presented-by-large-format-modules/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 3, 2022",The opportunities and challenges presented by large-format modules,"No longer the new kids on the block, large-format solar modules (LFMs) have become the industry standard for new, utility-scale solar installations, with the conversation now shifting to what the optimal wafer size is: 210mm or 182mm.
And while manufacturers, developers, and EPCs have an extra year of experience under their belts working with and installing LFMs, that year was by no means a normal one, and some difficulties in switching to the new standard persist.
As was true in 2020, a significant portion of the effort to optimize and standardize LFMs’ place in the solar industry has fallen on the tracker manufacturers whose products house these panels.
To gain a better perspective on what has changed in the past year, pv magazine sat down with representatives from some of the industry’s leading tracker manufacturers, Trina Solar, NEXTracker, and Array Technologies to discuss the common themes of availability, optimization, and standardization.
Settling on size
Potentially the greatest selling point of LFMs is the drastic reduction in project costs achievable by the simple idea of purchasing fewer, more powerful solar modules. Fewer modules means fewer trackers, fewer inverters, fewer components overall, and generally decreased project labor times.

Yet, so long as variances in cell size and general LFM form factor exist, tracker manufacturers have to make sure they’re capable of mounting all of these form factors onto their products, meaning they have to devote valuable production capacity to each little variance from module to module, as well as devoting time and resources to testing the effects that these small changes bring.
“What’s really important to us is the locations and the dimensions of actually mounting onto the module,” explained Array Technologies’ Senior Product Manager for PV Module Interfaces, Jim Sorensen.
“What we want to do is we want to have a gap between the modules. And if the whole dimension varies from the edge of the module to where the hole is – where we mount that module in order to maintain that gap, and to prevent modules from touching – it becomes really important.”
Sorensen explained that the variance then becomes an issue of supply chain complexity –  not an area any manufacturer wants to stress in the current environment. The variances mean that manufacturers have to keep diverse product inventory, meaning that both production and storage capacity, as well as component supply, become much more strained and more paramount of a concern, eventually reflected in higher tracker prices and overall levelized cost of electricity.
While all three companies are, in practice, technology and form agnostic, representatives from each expressed that one of the fastest ways to drive down levelized cost of energy (LCOE) would be through standardization. All three have shown a high regard and support for the 210mm cell size, being included in Trina’s 2021 White Paper on Tracker Compatibility for Trina Solar 210 Vertex Modules, yet all assert that it isn’t a conversation of favoritism, rather one of consistency.
Those who spoke with pv magazine all shared optimism that some sort of standardization is coming, hoping that the industry-wide benefits will outweigh specific manufacturer preferences.
Last May, Trina participated in a seminar on the standardization of module sizes, organized by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, alongside other industry stalwarts like Risen Energy, Canadian Solar, and Tongwei.

During the seminar, all parties present agreed on the overall dimensions of modules, technical specifications of mounting holes, and smaller details like cell spacing and design reference standards, a significant step forward toward greater standardization. 
All parties also share the belief that standardization will greatly reduce BOS costs and LCOE, and deliver the convenience and maximum value of ultra-high power modules and solutions.
“When we think back to 156mm or 158mm cells, at that time, pretty much all the modules were also standardized, in size, in length and width, in distance between mounting holes, etc.,” said Mireia Beltrá, product marketing manager with Trina. “That broke up after this era.” 
“I think we have found an optimum on the size,” said Beltrá, a popular sentiment, considering that any further increase in size would require three-person installation crews as well as greater reinforcement of mounting systems, both of which would contribute to increased LCOE.
Trina has publicly thrown support behind the 210mm module and its standard form factor, as the company currently manufactures 210mm Vertex 670W, 600W and 550W bifacial dual-glass modules.
Shipping and supply
Standardized or not, the LCOE decreases that LFMs are able to provide aren’t just reflected in more watts per tracker and reduced hardware costs. The technology has also been able to provide significant decreases in project soft costs; the expenses that can’t be fixed through traditional technology improvements. 
Though soft costs have traditionally been the bane of residential and commercial solar, their effects are felt in large-scale installations, too, and represent a significant barrier toward realizing optimized LCOE.
One of the major soft cost reductions made possible by LFMs is an up to 12% reduction in overall transportation costs.

According to Beltrá, the size and form factor of Trina’s LFM offerings has allowed the company to change the way that they package the modules, now storing modules vertically in transit, rather than horizontally. 
Specifically, with the Vertex 670W module, Trina is able to fit 10 to 15% more kilowatts of modules per standard shipping container. Just by providing a more optimized fit within containers, Trina has realized an average transportation cost reduction of between 10to12%.
Comparable to a 540W module, Trina is able to fit one extra module per standard pallet, loading up each pallet with 32 modules, rather than 31. Not as many pallets of 670W modules fit in a shipping container (18) as would 540W modules (20), but the overall wattage contained in each container is still higher, at 373,860W for the 670W modules and 334,800 for the 540W modules.
These cost optimizations may take some time to even be seen, however, as the availability of shipping containers has been a major challenge throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, and backups and delays at ports have been a significant issue for the past 24 months.
As was outlined in the May edition of pv magazine, the per unit cost of shipping modules has quadrupled from a steady recent average of around $0.005/Wp watt peak to $0.02/Wp in 2021.
Not only have shipping costs increased for all products, but availability has become an issue, as modules languish in ports. According to NEXTracker’s Director of Global Sales Engineering, Nick Price, production slowdowns and shipping delays have made it difficult for developers to even source the modules they’ve built their projects around.
“We’re seeing a lot more [projects] right now that are actually going in with 182mm,” Price said. “210mm is still a little bit on the horizon for us. We have projects that are designed for 210mm, but as far as the delivery and installation of 210mm, it has not really hit the ground yet, from what I’ve seen.”
Of course these availability constraints are temporary and are not exclusive to LFMs, but time lost on project construction is money lost and, according to Price, has led to situations where an entire project is all but completed; a generation skeleton waiting for modules.
“Because we’re a self-powered tracker, we can commission the whole site prior to any modules landing,” Price said. “We can do everything self-powered, including our communication systems and our network communication systems. So we can have full scale rows ready to go and hit the ground as soon as the modules get delivered.”
A Future for Small Format 
While LFMs have rightly supplanted themselves as the module standard, that doesn’t mean that their smaller counterparts have been entirely invalidated. Both Sorensen and Price outlined that usage scenarios still exist for smaller-format modules, and hope that their production doesn’t cease outright.
“I struggle with how it’s gonna work down the line,” Price said. “I mean, there’s got to be some module manufacturer who has the foresight, that there’s enough volume to keep producing, you know, the kind of two meter by one meter, smaller form factor. There’s going to be O&M issues down the line where these things need to be replaced, regardless of the projects that are being built right now. 5-10 years from now, there’s going to be module breakage, there’s going to continue to be issues. So how do you figure out how to replace those long term?” 
According to Price, most of the module manufacturers that NEXTracker works alongside haven’t been too keen to keep producing smaller-format modules, nor have they been reserving production for any issues down the line.
This could change, however, as there is one usage scenario where smaller modules really show their strength: projects installed in areas particularly prone to extended, intense wind loads.
Larger modules take wind and snow pressures and turn them into higher forces levied against the module and the tracker structure. This factor has required additional reinforcement of tracker mounting systems, and, in some cases, the installation of additional hardware to support the module. As these components are added, the LCOE savings presented by LFMs decrease. 
“We talk about large format modules as reducing structure costs and total LCOE costs,” explained Sorensen. “One component of that is wind speed and wind pressures. What we’re finding is that projects in the mainstream, definitely, you get that benefit, but as you get to higher higher wind pressures that benefit kind of goes away.”
Sorensen believes that there’s enough of a market in high-wind areas to justify the continued production of smaller-format modules, especially as hurricane-prone states like Florida and Louisiana continue to grow their solar profiles.
