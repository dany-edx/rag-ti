https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/24/national-labs-identify-priorities-in-modernizing-u-s-electricity-markets/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 24, 2021",National labs identify priorities in modernizing U.S. electricity markets,"As the U.S. electric grid reinvents itself, a collaboration between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and several top national laboratories is underway to provide research insights that will inform grid markets, investments, and planning. 
A three-year project, organized as part of the Grid Modernization Initiative, the research aims to provide foundational technical assistance to the seven U.S. independent system operators (ISOs) and regional transmission organizations (RTOs) that regulate about 70% of electricity sales in the country.
The first of a series of reports, released this May, identified gaps and research priorities related to evolving competitive wholesale energy markets. The paper lays out a broad research agenda for market designs that are of high priority for the next 2-10 years. 
The researchers worked closely with ISO and RTO representatives to understand current market design challenges and opportunities to develop a ranked priority list of relevant topic areas. The topics of highest priority were reliability services and operational flexibility, followed by emerging technologies.
The study team is currently executing three parallel tasks to address the ISO/RTO-prioritized tasks of flexibility and operational reliability, resource adequacy, and market mechanisms that support resource investments.  
According to the paper, the rapid growth of emerging technologies, including battery storage and hybrid resources, offshore wind, distributed energy resources, and demand-side flexibility creates a new set of characteristics different from conventional generation modes, and the ability of the current electricity market structures to ensure both long-term and operational reliability is unclear. 
Essential reliability services (ERS) requirements often shift under new technologies, but these technologies also have often under-utilized capabilities to provide ERS themselves. Market rule changes could enable these technologies to participate in providing the full range of ERS. Also, the development of new methods to calculate the contribution of these emerging technologies will be instrumental in the long-term planning process. 
The ISO/RTO group also shared the view that system resources must be appropriately incentivized to provide grid services and operational flexibility needed to maintain system reliability in an economically efficient manner. Specifically, they advocate for the development of market products for new reliability services, deliverability of capacity products, adjustments to existing ERS, and potential implementation of multi-day markets for energy-limited resources. 
In addition, a key challenge over longer horizons is providing incentives that ensure revenue sufficiency for resources needed to guarantee long-term reliability, while also providing efficient price signals for market exit. The report calls for well-designed scarcity and shortage pricing, especially in systems with high penetration of zero-marginal-cost resources. 
The report is the first in a series of collaborations with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Argonne National Laboratory, Electric Power Research Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Johns Hopkins University.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/24/import-action-ratchets-up-risks-for-u-s-solar-companies/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 24, 2021",Import action ratchets up risks for U.S. solar companies,"Price increases of anywhere from $0.005 to $0.02 a Watt, a months-long drop in the volume of modules shipped to the U.S., and further project delays and postponements may follow in the wake of U.S. Custom and Border Patrol action in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labor being in the solar supply chain in the Xinjiang region of China.
Action taken June 24 by the Biden administration included a “Withhold Release Order” by the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) against Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Withhold Release Order instructs personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
(Read “Labor Department updates forced labor list to target polysilicon from region in China.”)
The action could have a broad impact as Hoshine supplies much of China’s polysilicon industry, which, in turn, manufactures wafers and solar modules that are widely distributed.
The administration’s action will challenge U.S. importers to prove to CBP that imported goods do not contain material from Hoshine or its subsidiaries.
“It’s incredibly hard to prove a negative,” especially if an importer operates with something less than a vertically integrated supply chain, said Richard Mojica, an attorney with Miller & Chevalier. He spoke during a webinar organized by Roth Capital Partners.

The fact that action was directed toward a specific entity and not the entire Chinese region was taken by many as indicating a measured response to calls for the administration to take action in response to ongoing forced labor allegations.
Even so, Nathan Picarsic, co-founder of Horizon Advisory, said that the action is a “pretty clear signal” that CPB and the Biden administration are treating the forced labor issue strategically.
(Read “Border action ordered for solar components made by Chinese manufacturer.“)
Elise Shibles, an attorney with Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said that CBP likely has identified manufacturers who it believes  have a connection to Hoshine. Those companies will need to document and verify their supply chain in order to disprove any connection. The enforcement action took effect June 23.
In taking its WRO action, CBP said it had identified around $150 million worth of product imported into the U.S. over the past two years that drew its attention. While that volume is a tiny percentage of the multi-billion-dollar U.S. solar market, the scope could grow with time.
Mojica said that CBP may undertake a survey of companies to get a better sense of the solar industry’s supply chain, and may use data analytics to determine which products are subject to the WRO. Data analytics could rely on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, also known as the Harmonized System of tariff nomenclature, which is a system of names and numbers to classify traded products.
Andy Klump, CEO and founder of Clean Energy Associates, said during the webinar that he estimated that the cost impact could be anywhere from half a cent to 2 cents a Watt. Residential and commercial and industrial projects are likely to see most of the expected price increase. And utility-scale projects could face further delays. Already this year, large-scale solar projects have been impacted by price inflation for everything from steel to polysilicon.
Klump said that although the possible price increases “sound like a lot,” they are small in comparison to other recent price hikes related to ocean freight rates and polysilicon. He said that there also could be “less product coming to the U.S.” for a time, perhaps extending for several months. And he said that smaller and mid-sized importers are likely to have a harder time complying with CBP requirements.
Picarsic warned that if the trade tensions remain, then China could target a big-name player in the U.S. market to set an example. He said the Chinese government views human rights scrutiny as politically motivated, which moves the dispute from one based on economics to one focused on geopolitics. “It increases the risk of retaliation,” he said.
Some escalation may already be in play. Earlier in June, the Chinese government passed measures authorizing it to punish companies that comply with U.S. sanctions. That could create legal jeopardy for U.S. companies that find themselves having to comply with Customs and Border Patrol mandates.
“No one wants trouble with the government,” Klump said during the webinar. “Suppliers are in a tricky position.”

Under the pilot, LineVision’s Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-powered V3 monitoring system will be installed across power lines in the greater Sacramento region for SMUD. The pilot project will focus primarily on power lines originating from the Upper American River Project hydropower stations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Lake Tahoe, which generates nearly 700 MW and accounts for nearly 20% of SMUD’s customer demand in an average water year.
The V3 monitor uses thermal sensing and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to “look out” at the span of the line, predict the dynamic line rating, and determine sway, temperature, and other variables that impact the safety and performance of the line. Each V3 monitor contains an electromagnetic field radiation sensor for collecting real-time data on the line’s electrical properties, while the optical sensor tracks each conductor’s position.
Additionally, the V3 monitor does not make contact with the lines, so utilities don’t have to shut down power to install and manage the system.
The pilot project will monitor transmission assets to identify if additional capacity is available during certain times of the year and will allow SMUD to proactively alleviate renewable energy bottlenecks on the system. Alleviating renewable energy bottlenecks is one of the foundational goals of LineVision, with a source close to the company telling pv magazine back in January that up to 40% of renewables aren’t getting onto the grid because utilities don’t understand what their line ratings are.
It’s been estimated that such bottlenecks cause $8 billion in losses annually across the nation’s electric grid.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/24/border-action-ordered-for-solar-components-made-by-chinese-manufacturer/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 24, 2021",Border action ordered for solar components made by Chinese manufacturer,"U.S. customs and border protection agents have been directed to immediately begin detaining products imported to the U.S. that are made by or that include components made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co.  and its subsidiaries over forced labor allegations.
Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Troy Miller announced the action in a press briefing on June 24. The action was taken under Section 1307 of the Tariff Act. Section 1307 prohibits the importation of merchandise mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced or indentured labor, including forced child labor. Such merchandise is subject to exclusion and seizure, and may lead to criminal investigation of the imported goods.
Miller said the CBP action followed an investigation into production processes that offered a “reasonable indication” of forced labor being used by Hoshine. He said the investigation revealed evidence of “intimidation and threats” and “restriction of movement” toward workers.
“We’re going to root out forced labor wherever it exists,” said Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in announcing the action.
(Read “Labor Department updates forced labor list to target polysilicon from region in China.”
Earlier enforcement action for non-solar-related goods from the conflict region targeted 1,200 U.S.-bound shipments worth around $400 million. Miller said that importers who are in violation of the import restrictions could face monetary penalties.
In a related action, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security added five Chinese entities to the Entity List for “accepting or utilizing forced labor” in what it said was “the implementation of the People’s Republic of China’s campaign of repression against Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.”
The action targets these entities’ ability to access commodities, software, and technology subject to the Export Administration Regulations. The action is part of a government-wide effort to take “strong action” against China’s ongoing campaign of repression against Muslim minority groups.
The entities  are:
The Commerce Department said the Entity List rule supplements similar designations in October 2019, June 2020, and July 2020. It said that actions have added 53 parties specifically implicated in human rights abuses of ethnic minorities from Xinjiang, and 15 of these which were implicated in human rights abuses related to forced labor of ethnic minorities from Xinjiang.

Every two years, the Bureau publishes its “List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor” that the bureau has reason to believe are produced by child labor or forced labor in violation of international standards, as directed by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 and subsequent reauthorizations.
For the first time outside of that two-year cycle, the department updated the list to include polysilicon, which is used predominantly in the production of solar panels.
The Bureau said “This extraordinary measure is a response to the severity of the ongoing human rights abuses connected to the country’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.”  It said that conditions of forced labor “following coercion or detention in the so called ‘re-education camps’ are ongoing.” It said the measure also supports an effort by the U.S. government to address China’s state-sponsored forced labor and broader human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minority groups in Xinjiang.
“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.
In addition, the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection issued a Withhold Release Order prohibiting silica-based products from Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd in Xinjiang from entering the U.S. market. In addition, the Department of Commerce has updated its Entity List with new entities connected to forced labor and polysilicon production in Xinjiang.
(Read “Biden administration targets four Chinese companies with import bans over forced labor allegations.“)
The ninth edition of the department’s list, published last September, contained other products from China that have links to forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or by Uyghur workers transferred to other parts of China: cotton, garments, footwear, electronics, gloves, hair products, textiles, thread/yarn and tomato products.
With today’s announcement of the update to the ninth edition, the list now includes 156 goods from 77 countries.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/24/sol-systems-ceo-lays-out-a-path-to-grow-both-renewable-energy-use-and-u-s-manufacturing/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MARKETS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 24, 2021",Sol Systems’ CEO lays out a path to grow both renewable energy use and U.S. manufacturing,"In his annual letter, Yuri Horwitz, CEO of Sol Systems, says that he expects an effort to “on-shore” everything from raw materials to finished products as an “historic expansion of solar and storage” is set to “exponentially increase” demand.
As one example, the executive points to First Solar’s recently announced plan to increase U.S. module manufacturing by over 3 GW.
In his letter, Horwitz says that he expects the Biden administration to incentivize what he says will be “the wholesale reorganization of supply lines” (including lithium, cobalt, graphite, and other rare earth materials) within the battery market and fund new research and development into battery and alternative energy technology.
He says this will lead to more mining in the United States, but also more processing, almost all of which is currently done in China.
Washington, D.C.-based Sol Systems was founded in 2008 and has developed or financed more than 1 GW of solar projects valued at more than $1 billion for Fortune 100 companies, municipalities, counties, utilities, universities, and schools.
Horwitz is a co-founder of the company and previously was an attorney at Alston & Bird, where he worked on developing and financing solar and wind facilities.
Horwitz says that his company supports Biden administration goals to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030, and lays out a trio of priorities that he says will “prove instrumental” to success.
First, “immediately reduce tariffs that do little to end a trade war with China.” He says taking this step would improve the United States’ ability to compete within the global solar energy market. He says that since 2018, more than 60,000 renewable energy jobs and nearly $20 billion have been lost due to solar import tariffs. Cutting solar import tariffs would reduce the costs of solar modules by at least 20%, “driving significant clean energy investment and jobs growth throughout the U.S.” He says an effective tool to incentivize domestic production is to use tax cuts or low-interest loans.
Second, he calls on utilities, the federal government, and industry to work together to invest in and rebuild the nation’s aging transmission and distribution infrastructure. He says that the same utilities that will benefit from a 10-20% increase in load from electric cars are “economically aligned with the renewable energy industry” in retrofitting and rebuilding the grid in a more efficient, equitable, and sustainable way.
Third, he joins others in calling for implementation of a national market-based renewable portfolio standard (RPS) or a clean energy standard (CES). Today, 37 states have an RPS and a national RPS has support within Congress, too. He says that as Congress and the administration begin to transition to a clean energy economy, “accuracy, credibility, and tested solutions will be critical” to the success of meeting national energy goals.
Horwitz says that renewable energy development and operations create a “generational opportunity” to drive long-term investment and jobs in communities that have historically been left behind, as well as those communities that will be impacted by the transition to renewable and clean energy.
He lays out three approaches to more fully involve those communities.
First, he says that the industry has a “very real opportunity” to better attract, retain, and promote both minorities and women. Current industry leaders can do that by collaborating on best practices, mentoring, and focusing on community impact and investment.
Second, he says that many of the largest customers and investors in the world are focused on developing and implementing structures and strategies that benefit under-resourced communities, communities of color, and those communities that have been disproportionately impacted by climate change or otherwise left behind. He says that solar developers and operators have a responsibility to “lean in with these customers and investors” to develop renewable energy assets more thoughtfully. He notes that Sol recently worked with the University of Illinois on a zero-waste project and designed a Power Purchase and Community Investment Agreement with Microsoft.
Third, he says the industry must work with “adjacent organizations” that are focused on these priorities. Driving diversity into the renewable and clean energy industry requires an integrated approach that creates “temporal pathways for support and success.”
Pathways must begin early with high school students, then college students, then within the industry and in parallel industries, he says. His company supports the Urban Alliance in its work with urban high-school students, as well as CELI’s EDICT initiative, a program that pairs BIPOC college students with opportunities in the renewable and clean energy industry.

Travers Solar represents CIP’s first investment in Canada and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2022.
Jinko Solar Canada will supply the monocrystalline bifacial solar panels and PCL Construction will be responsible for construction. Amazon signed a corporate power purchase agreement to off-take up to 400 MW from the project.
CIP, on behalf of the Copenhagen Infrastructure IV (CI IV) fund, will fund the construction and operation. Greengate has retained an ongoing economic interest in the project and will continue to manage local stakeholder relations throughout its construction and operation.
Florida Power & Light said that crews installed the first battery storage components at the FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be one the largest solar-powered battery storage facilities in the world.
The center is expected to begin serving customers later this year. With 409 MW of output and 900 MWh of capacity, the energy storage system will be able to power the equivalent of 329,000 homes for more than two hours.
The newly installed storage container is the first of 132 units that will ultimately be installed onsite. Each unit weighs approximately 38 tons, is roughly 36 feet long by 11 feet in height and width and will hold roughly 400 battery modules. The battery modules will store energy produced by the neighboring FPL Manatee Solar Energy Center.
Canadian Solar said it secured a €50 million ($60 million) bilateral corporate facility with Banco Santander to support the company’s project development pipeline in the Europe, Middle East and Africa.
This is the second facility between Canadian Solar’s European unit and Santander over the past year. The new facility is composed of a term loan and a revolving credit facility of equal amounts. This structure provides Canadian Solar with a flexible financial instrument to execute growth plans as well as manage short term cash needs at favorable terms.
As of the first quarter of 2021, Canadian Solar had a nearly 4 GW solar development pipeline in EMEA, specifically in Italy, Spain, the U.K., France, Poland, Netherlands, Israel, and South Africa. The company also has more that 1 GWh of storage projects in EMEA.

The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies and what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
The news agency quoted China’s foreign ministry spokesman as saying China will take “all necessary measures” to protect its companies’ rights and interests.
(Read “SEIA has a ‘strong sense’ that U.S. solar supply chains are shifting, but hard numbers are scarce.”)
The three other companies added to the U.S. economic list include Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp.; Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a unit of Shanghai-based manufacturer East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co., part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd.

The Commerce Department said the companies and XPCC “have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in” Xinjiang.
John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the Solar Energy Industries Association said,  “The news of enforcement action on solar products coming from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is not unexpected and we fully support the Biden administration’s efforts to address any forced labor in the solar supply chain.”
He said the U.S. lacks transparency into supply chains in the Xinjiang region, and “there is too much risk in operating there.”
Smirnow said that for that reason, last October SEIA began calling on solar companies to leave the region. In April, the trade group released a traceability protocol to help ensure there is not forced labor in the supply chain.
“SEIA will continue to work with the administration and our partners to stand against forced labor and build a clean energy future we can all be proud of,” Smirnow said.
Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said “Forced labor has no place in the clean energy transition. Today’s announcement is consistent with longstanding U.S. law, and we fully support the Biden administration’s enforcement action.”
At least some of the companies listed by the Commerce Department are manufacturers of monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon used in solar panel production.
Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said in a note to clients that the move could have a “significant negative impact on the whole U.S. solar industry.” He said that Hoshine is an annual supplier of around 800,000 MT of a raw material needed for polysilicon production.
Shen said that module imports may now need to prove that there is no content from Hoshine in order to enter the U.S. “Access to solar modules in the U.S., in our view, could be severely limited by this order as we believe isolating and tracing through the supply chain could present a significant challenge.”
Adding to pressure on the Biden administration, members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China. The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee.
Reuters said that Hoshine Silicon Industry said on an investor platform that it backed the Chinese foreign ministry’s reaction, adding that the firm does not export industrial silicon to the United States directly and that the impact on its business would be limited.
Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co. sent the news agency an email saying the company has “zero tolerance” towards forced labor, and that it does not sell directly to U.S. companies, or buy from the United States, and there would not be “a significant impact on the company’s business.”
Last September under the Trump administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued five Withhold Release Orders (WRO) on products from the Xinjiang region. Products included hair products, apparel, cotton, and some computer parts.
Th Biden administration may have had no choice but to act on the ongoing allegations of forced labor in the solar supply chain, said Mark D. Herlach, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Eversheds Sutherland. “No one wants to be in a position of not responding to forced labor,” he told pv magazine in an interview.
In a note to clients, the firm said that possible sanctions could have implications on purchasers of panels. Implications could include direct legal jeopardy, financing challenges, supply chain disruptions, and reputational risk. The note said that reputational concerns, for example, have led major brands such as Calvin Klein, Gap, H&M, IKEA, Patagonia, and Tommy Hilfiger to stop buying cotton sourced from Xinjiang.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/24/solar-101-the-brains-behind-the-beauty-of-your-solar-power-system/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 24, 2021",Solar 101: The brains behind the beauty of your solar power system,"Even though solar panels get all the attention due to their good looks, it’s the inverters that hold all the brains in our Solar 101 series.
Solar panels generate an electric current by collecting photons from sunlight to excite electrons, pushing them into a circuit. The inverter then converts the electric field from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) so that the electricity is compatible with your appliances and the electric grid.
Besides this basic function, residential inverters these days perform a few additional functions. Recent innovations allow inverters to maximize electricity generation in complex sunlight installations. And now, inverters can even tell you how each individual solar panel is performing.

The other function required of inverters in the United States – found in Article 690 of the National Electric Code – is “rapid shutdown.” This function guarantees that your solar panels are no longer exporting electricity when the inverter detects that the solar panel system has been shut down for any reason.
This protocol was put in place after a fire in New Jersey was allowed to burn because firefighters were unable to determine whether or not the solar panels on the warehouse were still live.
Two solar inverter manufacturers, Enphase and SolarEdge, now dominate the residential solar market, in part due to this rapid shutdown requirement.
While rapid shutdown technology is offered by other manufacturers – SMA, Tigo, as well as newcomer Generac – they make up a smaller part of the market, at 10-15% cumulatively.
The two dominant companies have very different inverter approaches – microinverters and optimizers – that meet the rapid shutdown requirements.
As mentioned earlier, the key feature of module-level power electronics – optimizers and microinverters – is that they maximize electricity generation on strings of solar panels that may receive different amounts of sunlight due to shade or because of the angle of the roof. These modules give your installation company significantly more flexibility when it comes to laying out your system.
Enphase offers microinverters, which means that their product places a small inverter behind every solar panel on your rooftop. These units connect to other Enphase hardware to create a family of components that power your home.
Placing inverters behind your solar panels means that the electricity is immediately converted from DC into AC on your roof.
SolarEdge’s approach connects multiple panels to a central inverter with smart modules called “optimizers.” Instead of converting the electricity from DC to AC, these units constantly monitor and adjust for the maximum power point of each panel, keeping them at a consistent DC voltage while varying the current.
Solar panels are generally wired on a string in series. That means each panel depends on its neighbor to work.
Both micro-inverters and optimizers are designed to keep the solar system running even in the event of a panel failure. Before these “smart modules” were introduced, a single failure in a series of panels would knock out an entire string of 10 or more panels.
Enphase’s ability to keep a system running even after massive amounts of damage during a hurricane caught the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
One downside to this new technology, however, is that it adds an additional piece of electronics to every solar module.
A second issue is that additional modules require additional connections between your rooftop gear. Connections are typically where solar issues arise, whether between the solar panels and racking system (as noted in the linked hurricane article above), or among the electrical gear, as occurred when Tesla was sued by Walmart.

Inevitably, these electronic components have to do their job in harsh, hot, full sunlight conditions for decades on end. Thermal cycling and stress contributes to equipment failures, and can also loosen connections and mounts.
One last point about microinverters and optimizers – they cost a little more, however, they seem to pay for themselves.
The extra components roughly double the price of a standard residential solar inverter. The increased price has been offset by broadly declining solar prices and increasing efficiencies of solar panels. Generally speaking, there is still a net premium for a microinverter system.

Because these components are still new to the market, their true long term life cycle is unknown. Both manufacturers, SolarEdge and Enphase, offer 25 years warranties for their hardware. Both companies were founded in 2006, meaning their first modules are no more than 15 years old now.
Eventually, solar inverters on your home and business might run the power grid. So, take your time to research what works best for you, and your roof.
pv magazine USA’s favorite operations and maintenance contributor has sounded the alarm: paying close attention to these connections is imperative.
In a subsequent Solar 101 article, we focus on system operations and maintenance, and will talk about how to keep these connections safe over the decades they need to run.
