The Oval Office event was Biden’s first major action to tackle global warming as he brings the largest team of climate change experts ever into the White House. During his presidential campaign, Biden had laid out plans to roll back a number of the Trump administration’s environmental and energy policies.
Former President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, a nonbinding global accord to address the threat of climate change, in 2017. Trump argued the U.S. commitments were unfair, unnecessary, and costly.
Absent action on the federal level, a coalition of state governors and local leaders worked to support the international deal’s goals.
Following Biden’s executive order, clean energy groups applauded the United States’ planned return to the Paris Agreement and said they’re looking forward to working with the new administration to combat climate change.
Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, commended Biden’s “commitment to move America beyond climate denial on his very first day in office.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the industry “stands ready to help America meet its commitments in the Paris Agreement.”
President Biden also signed an executive order revoking the existing presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.
The cross-border oil pipeline project between Canada and the United States has faced strong opposition from environmental and Indigenous groups for years. Former president Barack Obama rejected the project. In 2017, however, Trump issued a presidential permit to help move the stalled project forward, citing energy independence and job creation.
In a statement, Keystone XL developer TC Energy Corp. called Biden’s plan to scrap the permit “very disappointing.” The Canadian company claimed the decision could lead to thousands of job losses, adding that the firm is assessing its options and suspending the project.
In the lead-up to Biden’s inauguration, TC Energy announced plans to make the Keystone project the “first pipeline to be fully powered by renewable energy.” As part of the initiative, the company said its commitment would spur up to $1.7 billion in investment and create 1.6 GW of renewables.
According to a Reuters report, Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently signaled his continued support for the Keystone pipeline, telling reporters, “Our government is making sure that Canada’s views are heard and considered.”
Environmental groups have praised Biden.
Catherine Collentine, associate director of the Sierra Club’s Dirty Fuels Campaign, called the Keystone Xl rejection “a huge and hard-fought victory for our communities, clean water, and climate.”
Mitchell Bernard, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Biden’s “swift and decisive” actions on the pipeline and Paris Agreement make “the United States once more part of the global climate solution—not the problem.”
The White House climate team is led by Gina McCarthy, former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The new climate team includes the following:

In Wisconsin, Alliant Energy has donated $90,000 in community solar blocks to the Habitat for Humanity of Fond du Lac County. The donation, totaling 240 blocks from the utility’s 1 MW Fond du Lac project, will aid local families.
Katie Karls, executive director of the region’s nonprofit housing group, said the organization plans to use the solar blocks to “reduce the electric bills for people living in our Habitat homes, which will really help out the residents with their monthly budgets and give them more dollars to provide for their families.”
Alliant Energy launched the Fond du Lac community solar project in early December. The company expects to start construction on the project this spring and complete it by year’s end.
The community solar program gives the utility’s Wisconsin customers the chance to share the benefits of solar power without having to install solar panels on their property.
When customers purchase solar blocks, they’ll receive credits on their monthly electric bills. The credits will begin once the facility is in service and last for 20 years.
So far, more than one-fifth of the project’s blocks have been purchased or donated.
According to Alliant Energy, the community solar program is part of the utility’s Clean Energy Vision and helps position the company to achieve its goal to attain net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions by 2050.
Utilities, municipalities, and other parties across the United States are increasingly embracing community solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/20/court-strikes-down-trump-emission-policy-on-his-final-day-in-office/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 20, 2021",Court strikes down Trump emission policy on his final day in office,"On the final day of Donald Trump’s presidency, a federal appeals court struck down a policy that was set to undo Obama-era emission reduction efforts. The court ruled the  2019 Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE) was  “legally flawed.”
ACE replaced President Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce U.S. power sector emissions by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. Instead, ACE looked to lower power sector emissions by 11 million tons, roughly 0.7% and 1.55%, by 2030.
In addition to a lower overall emission reduction goal, the policy encouraged fossil fuel combustion by calling for changes to coal-fired power plants that included operating them in a more efficient manner and potentially upgrading equipment.
One study found that ACE would cause 28% of model coal plants increase their emissions by 2030 more than a scenario with no policy at all. An EPA regulatory impact assessment found that the additional pollution attributable to ACE could cause between 460 and 1,400 additional deaths per year by 2030.
ACE was originally authored by coal-lobbyist-turned-EPA-Administrator, Andrew Wheeler.
While the removal of ACE marks the first of the Trump-era climate and energy policies to fall, a successor rule might be quickly introduced.
Neither ACE nor Obama’s Clean Power Plan were effectively implemented. ACE was challenged by 23 Attorneys General plus numerous environmental and clean energy groups. The Clean Power Plan never took effect due to a number of state-initiated lawsuits.
It is unlikely that the Biden Administration will look to reinstate the Clean Power Plan. Instead, it will likely call upon the Environmental Protection Agency to draft an updated standard. That responsibility will fall to Michael Regan, currently serving as the secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality of North Carolina, who has been picked by Biden to head EPA.
One core principle of the climate plan that Biden campaigned on includes ensuring that the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050. He  also pledged to institute a standard of 100% clean electricity by 2035.
These goals are likely be met with opposition if they make their way into proposed legislation or rulemaking. However, one luxury that the Biden Administration will have that the Obama Administration lacked is greater public and industry support for emission reduction and renewable energy. Since 2015, multiple states as well as investor-owned utilities have established their own standards for emission reduction and clean energy deployment.

Trina said it will supply the 120 MW Sunflower Solar Park in the Dominican Republic with 268,200 430/450 W double-glass modules.
Not just one of the largest in the region, the Sunflower Solar Park will also be the largest solar installation in the Dominican Republic upon completion.
The project is being developed by Dominican power producer Empresa Generadora de Electricidad Haina SA, better known as EGE Haina, and is being built by Spanish builder Elecnor SA under an engineering, procurement, and construction contract with EGE Haina.
Specifically, the project will utilize Trina’s TSM-DEG17M modules, chosen by EGE Haina for the modules’ 20.4% maximum efficiency, long life cycle, and ability to withstand extreme environments, according to Haina director of development, Jose A. Rodriguez.
Alongside the Trina modules, the project will also utilize trackers, though the specific style of tracker and manufacturer have not yet been shared.
The project is being constructed in the municipality of Yaguate, San Cristobal province, and is set to begin commercial operations in March.

Regulators would be better able than the legislature to craft a new system that benefits all ratepayers, according to lawmakers who sit on the Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions standing committee.
Published reports said that the bill, Senate File 16, would reform what supporters claim is an imbalanced system that subsidizes independent electricity generators at the expense of other ratepayers.
If passed, the legislation would no longer require utilities to pay customers for generating excess electricity. It also would grandfather in net metering customers who have installed wind or solar systems before July 1, 2022.
The state’s current net metering policy is capped at 25 kW, which is sufficient for most residential and commercial customers in the state. Past efforts to increase this limit were met with strong opposition. Any credit left at the end of the calendar year by a net metering customer is purchased at the utility company’s avoided cost, which is about 25% of retail cost.
Supporters of Senate File 16 argue that net metering customers receive a subsidy under the present system and shift costs on to other ratepayers.
“It’s the position of our company that a subsidy does exist,” Jon Cox, a spokesman for Rocky Mountain Power, the state’s largest utility, was quoted as saying. He said the company could buy more affordable utility-scale solar and wind energy in the open market, rather than from net metering customers.
The Office of Consumer Advocates and utilities like Rocky Mountain Power and Black Hills Energy reportedly expressed support for the legislation.
Opponents argued that the subsidy, when it does exist, is small, and that residents who invest in clean energy should be encouraged, not deterred, by the state.
Steff Kessler, a senior conservation advocate at the Wyoming Outdoor Council, was quoted as saying that the bill would “essentially kill” small-scale solar in Wyoming. She asked the committee to table the bill and research the issue more deeply.

Dominion Energy said that one of its subsidiaries has acquired the 150 MW Hardin solar generating facility in Ohio from Chicago-based Invenergy.
Facebook will take the electricity generated at the facility as well as the renewable energy credits under a long-term agreement signed prior to the project’s construction.
This marks Dominion Energy’s first solar energy investment in Ohio. Dominion owns solar arrays in nine other states. Dominion Energy closed on the acquisition in 2020, and construction activities were completed in December.
FirstEnergy Corp. is issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to buy 137,000 Solar Photovoltaic Alternative Energy Credits (SPAECs) annually over a two-year period on behalf of three FirstEnergy Pennsylvania utilities: Pennsylvania Power Co., Pennsylvania Electric Co., and Metropolitan Edison Co.
The RFP process will be conducted by The Brattle Group and will take place in January and February, with qualifying applications due by Feb. 9, 2021, and bids due by March 3, 2021.
Bidders may offer to sell tranches of SPAECs, where each tranche represents a commitment to sell 500 SPAECs annually over a two-year period with deliveries beginning in 2021. Based on the RFP results, FirstEnergy’s Pennsylvania utilities will enter into separate agreement with winning suppliers to buy the SPAECs.
Further information about the SPAEC RFP is available on FirstEnergy’s website.
The Government of Canada has launched Requests for Proposal to buy new clean electricity in the province of Alberta to power federal operations there.
Canada also will buy Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) from new clean energy generation in Canada, a move intended to enable Canada to attribute its energy consumption as clean in regions where new clean renewable sources are not yet available.

The government’s combined electricity consumption includes roughly 532,000 MWh annually from greenhouse gas-emitting sources of electricity. Federal buildings in Alberta consume 31% of that total. Another 23% is consumed elsewhere in Canada where local clean electricity initiatives will not be available in the near term.
Together, the contracts issued through the RFP will help Canada cut its greenhouse gas footprint by around 133 kilotonnes or 56% of total real property emissions in Alberta. The contracts also are expected to displace on the order of 41 kilotonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity use in the rest of Canada.
The approach will use one or more Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with clean electricity generators. These PPAs will secure renewable electricity by using funds that the government already spends on utility bills.
The Government of Canada’s Clean Electricity Initiative plans to use 100% clean electricity by 2022, where available.
EDF Renewables North America announced the completion and commercial operation of the Maverick 1 (173.4 MW) and Maverick 4 (135.9 MW) Solar Projects in California.
Maverick 1 provides 125 MW of electricity to Southern California Edison under a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Maverick 4 supplies 100 MW energy and renewable attributes to Shell Energy North America under a 15-year PPA.
The two projects are part of the Palen Solar project and are located adjacent to each other in Riverside County, on land administered by the Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The BLM designated this area as a Solar Energy Zone (SEZ) and Development Focus Area. Both projects consist of horizontal single-axis tracking solar photovoltaic technology.
The facility was originally submitted in 2007 as a concentrating solar power plant by Solar Millennium, who went bankrupt before final approval. Brightsource Energy bought the rights to the project at auction in 2013, but the company and partner Abengoa Solar abandoned the state proceeding in that year. In late 2015 EDF Renewable Energy acquired Abengoa’s interest in the project and resubmitted it for consideration.
EDF Renewables’ Asset Optimization group will perform operations and maintenance services for the life of the project. The group will provide NERC compliance support, remote monitoring, and balance-of-plant management to maximize power production.
Stocks have their dead cat bounce. In 2021, we may be talking about a dead coal bounce.
In its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that generation from natural gas-fired power plants in the U.S. will fall by about 8% in 2021. The drop would be the first annual decline in natural gas-fired generation since 2017.
Forecast generation from coal-fired power plants will increase by 14% in 2021. That followed a 20% decline in 2020. EIA forecasts that generation from non-hydropower renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, will grow by 18% in 2021, expected to be the fastest annual growth rate since 2010.
In 2020, natural gas prices were the lowest in decades as the nominal price of natural gas delivered to electric generators averaged $2.37 per million British thermal units (Btu). For 2021, EIA forecasts that price will rise by 41% to $3.35 per million Btu, about where it was in 2017. In contrast, EIA expects nominal coal prices to rise 6%.
The large expected rise in natural gas prices is the primary driver in EIA’s forecast. EIA said it expects about 36% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2021 will be fueled by natural gas, down from 39% in 2020. The forecast coal-fired generation share in 2021 rises to 22% from 20% last year.
EIA said that “significant growth” in electricity-generating capacity from renewable energy sources in 2021 is also likely to affect the mix of fuels used for power generation. Developers are scheduled to add 15.4 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity this year, which would be a record high.
An additional 12.2 GW of wind capacity is scheduled to come online in 2021, following 21 GW of wind capacity that was added last year. Much of this new renewable generating capacity will be located in areas that have relied on natural gas as a primary fuel for power generation in recent years, such as in Texas.
