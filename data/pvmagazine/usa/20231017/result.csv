The $213 billion invested represents a 37% leap over 2021/2022 investments of $155 billion. Clean investment continues to strongly increase each year. In 2018/2019, total investments reached $81 billion, and it has climbed each year since. 
Domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies has become an increased focus in recent years, and rich tax credits and incentives have served as an attracting force. Manufacturing investments totaled $39 billion in 2022/2023, more than doubling the $17 billion invested in the previous report period. 
Over the past two years, combined investment announcements in clean energy and electric vehicle manufacturing totaled $137 billion, a fivefold increase over the previous two years. Rhodium Group estimates that $37 billion of the total announcements over the past two years has already been invested. Over the last three quarters, batteries and zero-emission vehicles have represented the largest segment of actual manufacturing investments, followed by solar manufacturing announcements. 
“Investment in clean energy production and manufacturing is surging. New jobs and revenue are bringing opportunity and optimism to rural communities across the country. America’s manufacturing centers are competing to meet new clean energy demand with a new domestic wind, solar or storage manufacturing facility announced every four days,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of American Clean Power (ACP). 
Should currently announced manufacturing facilities reach operation, ACP estimates a nearly ninefold increase in solar module production and a more than fifteenfold increase in grid-scale battery storage, along with significant increases in production output for solar cells, polysilicon, ingots and wafers, as well as wind components. The report indicates that if the anticipated manufacturing facilities reach operation, U.S. solar module production could grow to 62 GW. 
As for energy production and industrial investments in clean technologies, the report said over $257 billion in new investments have been announced over the last two years. This represents a 75% increase over the previous two years for investment in clean energy production, carbon dioxide capture or removal, and other forms of industrial decarbonization.
“The majority of these announcements have focused on the complementary technologies of solar PV and grid-connected storage, while announced investment in new wind projects declined by half over the same period,” said the report.
Only $63 billion of the $257 billion in announcements has occurred, which the report attributes to relatively long project lead times for large energy generation projects. Solar represented the largest energy and industry investment category in Q2 2023, attracting $8.62 billion. This was followed by storage with $4.08 billion, and wind with $2.03 billion.
Retail investment in clean energy is on the rise as well. American businesses and households invested $113 billion last year in zero emission vehicles, heat pumps and distributed energy like rooftop solar and energy storage. The fastest growth for this category was in zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV), which climbed 46% and reached $70 billion in retail investment.
“Purchase and installations of residential and commercial rooftop solar systems, other distributed renewables, fuel cells and battery storage has increased robustly as well, while heat pump installations slowed last year after four years of meaningful growth,” said the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/17/solar-power-purchase-agreement-prices-rise-21-year-over-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",Solar power purchase agreement prices rise 21% year over year,"Many large solar projects sell their electricity generation via power purchase agreements (PPA), long-term agreements that typically span about 25 years. LevelTen Energy maintains a large PPA marketplace, and its most recent quarterly report noted an uptick for PPA prices in the United States.
LevelTen said developers are facing rising costs across the board, from financing, to interconnection, to labor and supplies, which has tempered the boost from federal tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
North American PPA prices continued a trend of stabilization in the third quarter of 2023, rising 4% over Q2 prices. Current P25 PPA prices represent a 21% increase year-over-year from 2022 prices.
A P25 price is the 25th percentile of all PPA prices. LevelTen reports its P25 data based on the prices that developers are offering for PPA contracts, not transacted PPA prices.
The report attributed this quarter’s 4% increase in solar PPA prices to increases in independent system operators like PJM Interconnection, Southwest Power Pool  (SPP), and ISO-New England. While price increases in the recent quarter were mold mild in some previous quarters, the cumulative impact of price increases are making it more difficult for corporate buyers to secure CFO approval, it said.
“Developers are looking to find ways to provide buyers with some pricing relief, but this is exceedingly difficult amid a wide array of development and financing challenges,” said Gia Clark, senior director of strategic accounts, LevenTen Energy. “Expectations of a prolonged high interest rate environment are pushing developers’ costs up across the board, with energy players of all sizes feeling the heat.”
Prices in the Texas ERCOT region decreased this quarter, drawing back 4%. In Q2, threats from anti-renewables bills led developers to include risk premiums in their prices. Those regulatory threats have since diminished, and average prices have come back down in response.
In PJM, solar PPA prices increased 12% in-quarter. PJM’s solar P25 prices have now risen 31% year-over-year. Permitting challenges, a lack of construction companies available in the region, and a projected increase to PJM electricity prices over the next 10 to 15 years are driving higher prices. A lack of transmission to deliver clean energy to areas with high demand is also driving congestion and basis risks, thereby driving up prices.
“We are clearly in the midst of our energy transition, with significant adjustments occurring in the market each quarter. If corporations want to support clean energy development and ultimately have more PPA options to choose from, they should really be getting creative and looking at purchasing tax credits now,” said Clark.
Clark said that industry headwinds and the overall higher cost of capital and interest rates make it unlikely for PPA prices to go down substantially any time soon. At the same time, buyer demand for PPAs remain high due to corporate goals of decarbonization.
“Buyers know the cost of not decarbonizing will, in the long run, cost far more than procuring now,” said Clark.
Clark said buyers and sellers will need to continue embracing a partnership approach, meeting in the middle to continue closing deals.
“The energy transition is here. Being creative in how both buyers and sellers work together is going to be critical as we navigate through the next few years,” Clark said.

The 81 MW Scotford project is expected to be the largest behind-the-meter solar project in Canada. Additionally, the 101 MW Saddlebrook project includes the future addition of a flow battery energy storage system, projected to be one of the first of its kind in North America.
The projects are currently under construction and are providing hundreds of local jobs. Both projects are expected to complete construction by the fourth quarter of 2023.
The Saddlebrook project will be owned and operated by an energy infrastructure company, with operations in natural gas, oil and power industries. The project is partially supported by $10 million in funding from Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), through their Best Challenge, a funding opportunity launched in 2019 that is awarding $100 million for projects worth a combined value of $600 million. Projects range from new solar opportunities in coal-impacted communities to electrification of transportation to energy storage and more.
Once complete, the electricity produced by the Saddlebrook project will feed into the Alberta Interconnected Electric System (AIES) through a new 138 kV substation located on the project land. In total, the project is expected to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 73,600 tons of carbon dioxide per year, or the equivalent of taking nearly 16,000 cars off the road.
Alltrade is constructing the Saddlebrook Solar Project in a joint venture partnership with SkyFire Energy, a solar contractor serving Western Canada.
The 81 MW Scotford project is expected to power a global oil producer’s refinery complex, which supports the fossil fuel company in achieving its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The project is expected to contribute approximately $200,000 a year on a levelized basis to the Strathcona County local government and school system.
“We are excited to be able to work alongside our longtime partners at Alltrade in Canada again to both support fossil fuel companies in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions as well as deliver more renewable energy to local communities,” said Ken Mack, Head of Flexrack by Qcells.
Flexrack by Qcells offers custom-designed, fixed tilt ground mount and single-axis solar tracking systems in the commercial and utility-scale solar mounting industries. The company has completed over 4 GW of solar racking installations in over 40 U.S. states, 9 Canadian provinces and across the globe. One of its notable projects is the 1.3 MW Jimmy Carter Sumpter project in Plains, Georgia.
Alltrade provides EPC services, specializing in ground mount solar. The company has 1 GW of utility-scale project experience in Canada.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/17/mit-scientists-develop-concentrated-solar-power-system-to-produce-hydrogen/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",MIT scientists develop concentrated solar power system to produce hydrogen,"MIT researchers have developed a new CSP system to produce green hydrogen. The system, which is currently in the conceptual stage, aims to use up to 40% of solar heat for green fuel generation – a significant improvement from previous systems, which only achieved a 7% utilization rate.
“The increase in efficiency could drive down the system’s overall cost, making solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) a potentially scalable, affordable option to help decarbonize the transportation industry,” the scientists said. “It is a big step toward realizing solar-made fuels.”
Similar to other STCH designs, the conceptual system can be built around an existing CSP plant, absorbing the receiver’s heat and directing it to split water and produce hydrogen. However, there is a novel two-step thermochemical reaction at the heart of the new system.
“In the first step, water in the form of steam is exposed to a metal. This causes the metal to grab oxygen from steam, leaving hydrogen behind,” the scientists said. “Once hydrogen is separated, the oxidized (or rusted) metal is reheated in a vacuum, which acts to reverse the rusting process and regenerate the metal. With the oxygen removed, the metal can be cooled and exposed to steam again to produce more hydrogen. This process can be repeated hundreds of times.”
The efficiency of this process is related to its train-like design, with box-shaped reactors running on a circular track. Each reactor in the train would house the metal repeatedly going through different thermochemical stations.
“Each reactor would first pass through a hot station, where it would be exposed to the sun’s heat at temperatures of up to 1,500 C. This extreme heat would effectively pull oxygen out of a reactor’s metal,” the group said. “That metal would then be in a ‘reduced’ state – ready to grab oxygen from steam. For this to happen, the reactor would move to a cooler station at temperatures around 1,000 C, where it would be exposed to steam to produce hydrogen.”
Another improvement in the system is its ability to recover most of the heat used in the process. It does so by allowing reactors on opposite sides of the circular train-like track to exchange heat through thermal radiation. In addition, a second set of reactors circle around the first train, moving in the opposite direction and operating in cooler temperatures. This allows the evacuation of oxygen from the hotter inner train, without the need for energy-consuming mechanical pumps.
“When fully implemented, this system would be housed in a little building in the middle of a solar field,” said researcher Aniket Patankar. “Inside the building, there could be one or more trains each having about 50 reactors. And we think this could be a modular system, where you can add reactors to a conveyor belt, to scale up hydrogen production.”
The research team said it will build a prototype of the system in the coming year.
“We’re thinking of hydrogen as the fuel of the future, and there’s a need to generate it cheaply and at scale,” said the study’s lead author, Ahmed Ghoniem.

The company reports that the transactions will support construction and operations of the portfolio and include construction financing, term financing, letters of credit, and tax equity investments, in partnership with 11 leading industry lenders and investors.
The recent financing includes $707 million for the 250 MW Sierra Estrella Energy Storage facility in Avondale, Arizona, which is expected to be the largest standalone battery facility in Arizona once online. This financing is in addition to initial funding of $903 million.
“Over the last year, Plus Power has raised an unparalleled amount of capital for standalone storage projects from a wide range of leading energy project finance banks and investors,” said Josh Goldstein, chief financial officer of Plus Power. “This capital will support the ongoing buildout of the largest and most diverse portfolio of standalone storage projects in the U.S. The scale highlights our first-mover advantage in bringing high-quality projects to market as well as the tremendous work by our fantastic team.”
The Sierra Estrella facility is one of two battery storage projects the Salt River Project (SRP) announced in fall of 2022 with Plus Power, with both projects scheduled to come online by summer of 2024. The other, a 90 MW / 360 MWh project is called Superstition Energy Storage, which is planned for Gilbert, Ariz.
Norddeutsche Landesbank and Société Générale acted as coordinating lead arrangers while Mizuho, U.S. Bank, Bank of America, CoBank, and Siemens Financial Services, Inc. were joint lead arrangers.
The financing for the SRP facilities includes:
The completed transactions were financings totaling $884 million to support construction of 700 MW of batteries on the ERCOT grid in Texas in the Ebony, Anemoi and Rodeo Ranch energy storage projects. Plus Power reports that while the Ebony and Anemoi projects are expected to operate as merchant resources in the ERCOT wholesale market, Plus Power executed an innovative hedge for Goldman Sachs’ commodities group for a portion of the Rodeo Ranch Energy Storage facility. The three storage facilities are expected to be operational next summer and are designed to bring stability to the ERCOT grid during high demand.
The financing for these projects brings Plus Power’s current ERCOT portfolio to 1.57 GWh. Deutsche Bank and First Citizens Bank were the coordinating lead arrangers, with First Citizens Bank as the administrative agent and Siemens Financial Services, Inc. acting as the joint lead arranger.
The financing for the three ERCOT projects includes:
Plus Power expects the Ebony and Anemoi projects to operate as merchant resources in the ERCOT wholesale market, while the company reportedly executed an innovative hedge for Goldman Sachs’ commodities group for a portion of the Rodeo Ranch Energy Storage facility.
“These financings demonstrate Nord/LB’s commitment to the battery energy storage sector as the bank continues to play a prominent role financing strategic assets to support the energy transition as part of the broader mission to achieve a net neutral, carbon free grid,” said Sondra Martinez, managing director, Nord/LB. “We look forward to continuing the strong relationship with Plus Power to support both our company’s goals of decarbonizing the energy grid with high-quality projects.”
Plus Power currently has a growing portfolio of large-scale lithium-ion battery systems in more than 25 states and Canada, and the company reports that it is executing on 10 GW of interconnection capacity now in transmission interconnection queues.

Four-plus-hour energy storage accounts for less than 10% of the cumulative 9 GW of energy storage deployed in the United States in the 2010-22 period. However, this type of technology is likely to assume a more important and versatile role on the grid in the years to come, according to NREL’s new publication.
NREL’s earlier studies identified economic opportunities for hundreds of gigawatts of six to 10-hour storage even without new policies targeted at reducing carbon emissions.
“Longer-duration energy storage may lead to better grid resilience,” said Paul Denholm, NREL model engineering senior research fellow and lead author. “There’s an upside to developing and deploying greater storage, whether that value is in the ability to store more renewable energy or meeting winter energy demand.”
Historically, four-hour storage has been well-suited to providing capacity during summer peaks, and its ability to serve summer peaks is enhanced with greater deployments of solar energy.
As a result, several wholesale market regions have adopted a fixed “four-hour capacity rule” that fully compensates storage with at least four hours of duration and has no additional capacity revenues for longer durations. That means that a six-hour battery does not receive any more revenue than a four-hour one.
“This rule, along with limited additional energy arbitrage value for longer durations and the cost structure of Li-ion batteries, has created a disincentive for durations beyond 4 hours. Based in part on this rule, in 2021 and 2022, about 40% of storage capacity installed was exactly 4 hours of duration, and less than 6% had durations of greater than 4 hours,” NREL writes in its new publication.
However, the addition of solar, extreme weather conditions and building heating electrification are changing the equation and peak demand is becoming more significant in the winter than in the summer, as already seen in the Southeast and Texas.
“Energy storage could help meet increasing winter demand,” Denholm said. “Increased storage can also support transmission and resilience, further increasing the value of developing energy storage with more than four hours of capacity.”
Various technologies – such as thermal storage or next-generation compressed-air energy storage – have the potential to reach cost parity with lithium-ion batteries and longer service lifetimes. However, the new technologies must compete with the established lithium-ion, which had a decades-long head-start, and will require deployment at scale.
“We have promising technologies that, with development, can meet winter demand peaks and compete with lithium-ion technology,” Denholm said. “Reliability of the grid is the goal – greater storage can help us get there.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/17/solar-panel-waste-is-not-a-significant-problem/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",Solar panel waste is not a significant problem,"From pv magazine global
The fastest energy change in history is underway. New solar PV generation capacity is being deployed faster than everything else put together. The price of PV continues to fall, and PV is essentially unconstrained. Thus, solar PV is growing to dominate not just electricity production, but also all forms of energy production, via the electrification of nearly everything.
How much waste?
Typical electricity consumption in advanced economies is 7-12 MWh per person per year. This will need to double to accommodate the electrification of transport, heating and industry. In some countries, additional electricity will be required to decarbonize the chemical industry: metals, ammonia, plastics, synthetic jet fuel, etc. Most of this electricity will come from solar, with limited support from wind and hydro.
For illustrative purposes, we can take an average per capita solar electricity generation of 20 MWh per year in an affluent fully decarbonized country. Assuming a typical DC capacity factor of 16% (rooftop and ground-mounted), then each person needs 15 kW of solar panels with an area of about 70 m2.
The panel lifetime is 20-30 years, and so about 3 m2 of solar panel waste per person per year is generated, with a mass of about 30 kg. This is small compared with the solid municipal waste stream in the USA of about 900 kg per person per year, and very small compared with CO2-equivalent emissions in the USA of 19,000 kg per person per year.
How much of the PV modules is recycled?
The aluminum frame and electrical cables of retiring solar panels are normally recovered because of their value.
Most of the rest of the panel is glass, which is not toxic and the raw materials of which are inexhaustible. The mass of glass in 3 m2 of solar panel is about 20 kg. This compares with the current U.S. glass waste stream of 30 kg per person per year. Thus, if entirely discarded as landfill, solar panels would increase the glass waste stream, by two thirds, which is significant but far from overwhelming. The high quality of discarded low-iron solar glass may find specialist applications, including as starting material for new generations of solar panels, and in the road sign paint industry.
The solar panels also contain about 1.2 kg of silicon which is a non-toxic and extremely abundant material (n. 2 in the Earth’s crust). The balance of the panel comprises thin layers of protective plastic and a small mass of conductive metals such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al) and silver (Ag) that may be recovered and recycled, depending on sufficient volumes to justify investments in recycling equipment.
A growing market in developing countries is the reuse, or second life, of solar panels. Many utility-scale solar power plants are replacing their 15% efficient panels with 22% efficient bifacial double-glass panels. The same trucks that deliver the new panels take back the retiring panels, which are then sorted and sent for a second life in low-power applications elsewhere.
During the early growth of an industry, the logistics to deal with retiring products might not initially keep up. This currently applies to both lithium batteries and solar panels. However, the pace of adoption of both technologies means that this will change quickly. The mature lead-acid battery industry provides a good example of high collection rates.
As the PV industry grows and matures, businesses will develop for sustainably managing end-of-life solar panels. The amount of PV materials to be recycled will remain comfortably below existing waste and recycling streams and hence no special disposal and recycling technology or logistics is required. Managing retiring solar panels will not be a limitation on the replacement of fossil fuels by solar.
How much avoided CO2?
Importantly, the 3 m2 of solar panels per person that is recycled each year has generated 20 MWh of electricity over its lifetime and displaced 20 tonnes of CO2 emissions. This is about 1000 times larger than the waste in the panels, and its avoidance is a spectacular environmental gain.
The waste stream of a wind turbine is similarly small compared with the CO2 displaced during its lifetime. Images of retiring turbine blades and solar panels being buried that periodically circulate on the web in shock articles fail to point out the 1000 larger mass of CO2 emissions that the turbines and panels have avoided.
