Chase published the prediction in an article surveying the current state of solar, and its future prospects, for sustainable energy journal Joule which was also published on the ScienceDirect website.
The article, View from the Solar Industry: We Don’t Need COP26 to Shine, But What Should We Worry About? included Bloomberg’s estimate for the volume of solar which will have been installed worldwide in 2030, with the analyst having estimated 183GW of photovoltaics were installed last year and this year will bring “comfortably more than 200GW.”
Chase cited the polysilicon shortage which drove up solar panel prices last year as one possible headwind, although the solar analyst expects the situation to ease with the arrival of new poly manufacturing capacity this year.
Shortages of land and grid connection points in some of the biggest solar markets could also pose problems for PV although Chase points out the industry’s biggest developers don’t seem to have been significantly slowed by those hurdles yet, with the solar expert adding: “Solar and wind deployment could not now be stopped if we wanted to.”
In terms of how much renewables are needed to hit a net zero world in mid century – with Chase remarking upon how much faster the scale of solar capacity is growing than that of wind – BloombergNEF’s renewables-focused “green” scenario would require 5.3TW of solar this decade – with 1TW of it to power green hydrogen production – and 19.7TW by 2050.
Alternative routes mapped by the analyst lean on the nuclear and carbon capture, use and storage technologies which, as yet, are not developing with sufficient speed, and Chase sounded a positive note to readers daunted by the scale of the job required by remarking, in relation to historic forecasts for clean energy roll-out: “As analysts, we are far better at seeing problems in each country than we are at imagining transformative change to world energy systems.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/10/commonbond-enters-the-solar-finance-market-looking-to-help-installers-grow-their-business/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022","CommonBond enters the solar finance market, looking to help installers grow their business","CommonBond, a financial technology company which uses modularly-designed financial service tools to provide customers affordable, transparent, and simple ways to pay their loans. announced that it has launched a new solar financing business.
Within the new venture, the company hopes to be able to lowers costs for both installers and homeowners, and promises increased sales velocity for installers.
As for why solar and why now, CommonBond Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, David Klein told pv magazine it was the next natural evolution for serving its existing customer base.
In 2019, CommonBond completed market research which showed that 77% of its customers have a house or intend to buy one within three years of refinancing their student loan with the company. This realization had those within the company exploring opportunities presented by homes and their contained elements, like energy efficiency upgrades or HVAC systems. Around this time, the company also started forming relationships with solar installers, which led to an interesting discovery.
“We had some relationships with solar installers,” said Klein. “So we were hearing about a few pain points. One: they wanted to make sure that they were optimizing for their own economics. Two: they wanted to make sure that the financing function that they’re plugging in to their sales cycle is not just cost effective, but also timely, automated, and simplified in a way that actually increases sales velocity, including an easier experience for the installer sales agent in the field and the homeowner that they’re interfacing with.”
There are three ways installers work with CommonBond to increase sales velocity and deliver service to their customers:
Having an existing customer base interested in solar, knowing of solutions they could provide to common installer pain points, seeing that solar system costs have been trending down significantly since the start of the last decade, and recognizing increased climate and energy consciousness across consumers all combined to make the move into solar a no-brainer for CommonBond.
And while most in the financial services field for solar focus on the value they can bring to the homeowner, Klein believes that CommonBond can also help installers. The platform promises faster project approvals, higher rates of approvals, and competitive rates, all aspects installers look for when choosing a financial services partner, and there’s another aspect CommonBond is focusing on.
“There are a lot of installers who are so busy growing and so focused on the installations, we’ve found that many of them don’t have a lot of data and analytics making visible what’s going on in the business,” said Klein. “We’re finding that many installers, most actually, have this need, that is currently being unmet in general.”
It’s a term that Klein refers to as “growth instrumentation”, the service of feeding installer data in real time to arm them with insights and visibility into their business. Those insights enable them to make better decisions quicker on anything related to cost, budgeting, overarching business and funnel management.
CommonBond initially launched its Solar financing business in “stealth mode” in Q3 2021 and the company claims that it is on pace to do $1 billion of Solar originations in 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/10/next-gen-concentrated-solar-power-under-development/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",Next-gen concentrated solar power under development,"Concentrated solar power (CSP) uses mirrors called heliostats to direct sunlight into a collection tower, storing heat energy in abundant mediums like rocks, sand, or molten salt for highly available energy dispatch. High-heat and available energy is a key element in many machine and industrial processes, so the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Department of Energy (DOE) are working on the next generation of CSP facilities.
The Gen3 CSP program targets an energy cost of 5 cents per kWh. DOE has identified opportunities in three material pathways: storing heat in sand-like particles, in liquids like molten salt, and in gases, such as the technology developed by Brayton Energy. DOE selected particle-based storage as the main method for its funding, but also opened the door for NREL to run a two-year liquid molten salt research program.
Challenges and breakthroughs
NREL’s Craig Turchi, a leader in thermal energy science and technology, said molten salts are a desirable option for heat transfer and storage as they are easy to work with and can be pumped through pipes and heat exchangers. However, there are some practical challenges, which Turchi’s team is currently working on overcoming.
Though molten salts are easy to move, they are also corrosive to their holding tanks and pipes. Turchi said, “We actually solved that problem by and large. NREL and partners did a lot of great science on the salt chemistry—how to purify it, how to make it relatively noncorrosive if you control the chemistry, and we demonstrated that in the lab.”
The next hurdle was finding the right kinds of salts for the Gen3 CSP liquid path. Commercial systems often use nitrate salts, but NREL said these begin to degrade at higher temperatures. NREL targets high temperatures for more efficient energy conversion, so it settled on chloride salts for their higher level of stability under extreme temperatures.
Another challenge is keeping the storage tank hot. The molten salts used freeze at 400°C, so extra insulation is needed. Turchi added, “Our design is a steel tank, but whereas the current tanks are insulated on the outside, our proposed tank was insulated on the inside to protect the steel.” DOE awarded NREL $2 million to build a prototype tank, which is being built on NREL’s Golden, Colorado campus.
Kerry Rippy, an NREL expert in inorganic chemistry, and her team explored electrochemical methods to further remove corrosive impurities in molten chloride salt. She is also developing electrochemical sensors to be placed inside storage tanks to monitor the purity of the salts during experimentation.
“There are multiple potential avenues for this research to be valuable. It can be beneficial for solar fuel synthesis; it could enable high-temperature fuel cells, and the nuclear industry is also really interested in this research,” said Rippy.
“The nuclear industry is developing a number of ‘Gen4’ reactors of its own, some of which use molten chloride salts,” said Turchi.
Decarbonized industrial processes
Solar PV and energy storage are excellent in providing reliable electricity, but some industrial processes require high-heat or large amounts of available energy. This has led to developments in CSP, and in other technologies, which are already being met with commercial success.

Recently, startup company Rondo Energy closed a $22 million Series A funding round to scale its renewable energy heat batteries. The membrane-based battery stores solar and wind energy in solids at temperatures over 1200°C. The company said it plans to begin manufacturing and delivering systems to customers later this year.
In November, Heliogen partnered with Bloom Energy to create green hydrogen fuel. Heliogen’s CSP creates heat, steam, and electricity from concentrated sunlight. It was paired with Bloom’s solid-oxide, high-temperature electrolyzer to make the fuel. The company said hydrogen can be made 45% more efficiently than low-temperature PEM and alkaline electrolyzers. Electricity dictates nearly 80% of the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis. The CSP method reduces the need for electricity, using heat to aid its operations.

The funds come as part of the $7.5 billion approved for EV charging as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Even considering a rise in EV use, about one third of emissions come from transportation today. This deployment plan aligns with White House goals to decarbonize the economy in the face of climate change.

The network of chargers will be built in “Alternative Fuel Corridors”, some 165,000 miles of national highway spanning 49 states. The plan, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, “is going to help ensure that America leads the world on electric vehicles,” said Joe Biden in a speech this week to promote EV infrastructure in the US.
It’s estimated that there are about 41,000 public charging stations in the US. This number needs to expand rapidly, as roughly 24% of new vehicles sold by 2030 are likely to be fully electric. An Australian company, Tritium, seeks to help meet that need as it is setting up a manufacturing facility in Tennessee. The facility is expected to create 500 permanent jobs and will have a production capacity of 30,000 chargers each year.
President Biden said the program could save an average driver up to $1,000 per year on gasoline by switching to a cheaper-to-charge EV.
States are due to submit their EV infrastructure plans to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation by August 1st and the plans will be approved by the Federal Highway Administration will make approvals by September 30th.
Officials said the other $2.5 billion earmarked for EV charging will be given guidance as part of the larger bipartisan infrastructure plan later this year. In December, the Biden administration committed to changing its fleet of 600,000 federal vehicles to EVs by 2035.
“China has been leading the race up to now, but this is about to change,” Biden said. “Because America is building convenient, reliable, equitable national public charging networks. So wherever you live, charging an electric vehicle will be quick and easy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/10/the-u-s-army-commits-to-using-100-clean-electricity-by-2030/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",The U.S. Army commits to using 100% clean electricity by 2030,"The United States Army Climate Strategy opens with a quote from Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III: “We face all kinds of threats in our line of work, but few of them truly deserve to be called existential. The climate crisis does. Climate change is making the world more unsafe and we need to act.”
Within a broad range of actions to preserve the Army’s warfighting capabilities, and also lead by example, are several related to renewable energy.
By 2030, the Army is “committed” to using “100% carbon-pollution-free electricity” at its installations, by building new renewable energy projects and purchasing clean electricity. As an example, the document shows a solar canopy that shades most of the vehicles at Fort Hunter Liggett in California, which is one of six pilot sites to become net-zero energy.
By 2035 the Army aims to install a microgrid on every installation, with investments in “onsite, backup” renewable generation and large-scale battery storage. The Army will pursue enough renewable generation and battery capacity to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all its installations by 2040.
The Army aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all Army buildings 50% by 2032, compared to a 2005 baseline. Light-duty non-tactical vehicles would be electric vehicles by 2027, and all non-tactical vehicles would be EVs by 2035.
To preserve its acquisition capabilities, by 2025 the Army aims to analyze all its supply chain Tier 1 sources and contracts for climate change risks and vulnerabilities. By 2028, the Army aims to develop plans, policies, and contracts to ensure supply chain resilience.
To update its training, the Army aims to incorporate climate change topics in leader development and workforce training, “no later than 2028.”
“For today’s Soldiers operating in extreme temperature environments, fighting wildfires, and supporting hurricane recovery, climate change isn’t a distant future, it is a reality,” said Secretary of the Army Christine E. Wormuth, in a foreword to the document.
As an example of the hurricane recovery work of the Army National Guard, the document notes that soldiers assigned to the Louisiana Army National Guard transported flood relief supplies in southeast Louisiana, after more than 30 inches of rainfall caused severe flooding there, as part of a mobilization of more than 1,000 personnel.
After stating that “the Army will continue to lead by example,” the strategy document adds in boldface that “The Army’s core purpose remains unchanged: to deploy, fight, and win the nation’s wars by providing ready, prompt, and sustained land dominance as part of the Joint Force.”

TotalEnergies currently holds close to 500MW worldwide in distributed energy generation, and this acquisition will extend that footprint to the US. It will also allow TotalEnergies to develop over 100MW of additional capacity per year.
The sale comes as no surprise as the company announced last November that it would consider divesting the commercial operation, revealing that its C&I projects had contributed an $8 million loss to its third-quarter earnings. SunPower had also previously announced that it would focus on its residential business.
“With this acquisition, TotalEnergies is further investing to grow its distributed generation activity in the U.S. and support its B2B customers in meeting their sustainable development goals. It is a new milestone in our renewable development in the country, where we are targeting 4 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2025”, said Vincent Stoquart, senior vice president Renewables for TotalEnergies. “This will also give SunPower additional resources to focus on the growing residential market.”
“The sale enables SunPower to focus on creating a superior residential experience, increase our investment in product and digital innovation, and reach more homeowners,” said Peter Faricy, CEO of SunPower.
The acquisition has been approved by both companies and is expected to close early Q2, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. TotalEnergies reports that its majority ownership stake in SunPower will remain at 50.83%.

The company recently completed community solar portfolios near 30MW of combined capacity in Colorado and Minnesota.
In Colorado, Denver-based Pivot Energy and Nautilus completed a 13MW community solar portfolio, which is made up of seven projects located in Crowley, Weld, and Logan Counties. The installations, now fully operational, provide energy to an estimated 1,700 households and 12 commercial subscribers, including the Town of Breckenridge. The projects are in the Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy utility territories. It is estimated that over the 20-year lifetime of the projects, the portfolio will avoid carbon emissions equivalent to taking nearly 185,000 cars off the road for a year. This is Nautilus’ first entry into Colorado.

The solar subscriptions to the Colorado portfolio are managed through Pivot Energy’s SunCentral platform, which uses proprietary cloud-based software to provide subscribers with seamless bill payments, energy production monitoring, and downloadable financial reports. At this time, Pivot is still accepting subscriber applications from interested parties.
Nautilus also recently announced the acquisition of up to twelve community solar projects in Minnesota totaling 16.8MW of solar capacity, on behalf of its subsidiary Nautilus US Power Holdco, LLC, and Sunrise Energy Ventures. Nautilus is the long-term owner of the projects and responsible for overseeing construction, maintaining their long-term performance, and acquiring and managing customer subscriptions.
The projects, located in Blue Earth, Sherburne, Wabsha, Winona, Sibley, Wright, Pope, and Meeker Counties, are in various stages of development with the first several projects expected to be operational by the end of 2022. Once completed, the projects will provide a clean energy option to 4,200 households in Minnesota within the Xcel Energy electric utility territory. Any residential Xcel Energy utility customer in Minnesota located in the same or adjacent county to a project may subscribe through Nautilus with no upfront cost, no long-term commitment and no cancellation fees,Nautilus reports.
These projects were developed by SEV as part of Xcel Minnesota’s Solar *Rewards Community solar program, which has allowed for more than 825MWac of completed projects since the start of the program.
In related news,  Xcel Energy committed to add 2.5GW of solar by 2030.

The portfolio’s three 6.7MW projects are Greenbacker’s first assets in Washington, and all of the projects, which have been dubbed Camas, Penstemon, and Urtica, are located in Kittitas County, southeast of Seattle. While each installation is still under development, Greenbacker shares that they are all expected to reach commercial operation in 2022, and each project has a long-term power supply agreement in place.
“We’re thrilled to enter a new market with three projects that will deliver cheaper clean power to consumers,” said Charles Wheeler, CEO of GREC. “This expansion is the result of a successful long-term collaboration with the solar development experts at TUUSSO. We’ve been involved with the portfolio since the planning stage, and today we’re very pleased to include it in our fleet of renewables projects driving a clean energy future in the state of Washington.”
Earlier this week, Greenbacker announced that it purchased a 16.3MW operational solar portfolio from developer ECA Solar and Alliance Fund II, a sustainable infrastructure fund. The portfolio, located entirely in Massachusetts, comprises 16 rooftop solar projects with each installation ranging in capacity from 0.3MW to 4.2MW.
According to Greenbacker, this week’s additions bring the company’s fleet of sustainable infrastructure projects to approximately 2.6GW of generating capacity, with that figure also including projects that have yet to reach construction.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/10/the-nature-conservancy-releases-map-to-help-site-renewables/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 10, 2022",The Nature Conservancy releases map to help site renewables,"With up to 75% of the nation’s large renewable energy projects expected to be developed in the central region of the US by 2050, the Site Renewables Right map, released today by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), is intended to help companies, state agencies, and communities quickly plan, permit, and purchase renewable energy in ways that helps conserve natural areas. The map is intended to be used early on in the development process to inform due diligence analyses by power purchasers and to support application of state and federal renewable energy siting guidance.
The new analysis combines more than 100 GIS layers of wildlife habitat and land use data across 19 states, from Ohio to Wyoming, and estimates at least 120,000 square miles have potential for low-conflict renewable energy siting in the central US.  A cursory evaluation of wildlife and habitats data along with basic land use requirements for PV solar facilities, as summarized in TNC’s methods paper, indicates the potential for low-impact solar development in the central US is significantly greater than the stated figures for wind. A higher average power density and smaller projected land use requirements suggests that solar buildout will be less geographically constrained, with low-impact solar development opportunities found across the region. For example, within TNC’s 19-state study area approximately 283GW of technical solar potential exists on current and formerly contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites alone (USEPA 2018).
“Like any type of development, solar and wind facilities can harm wildlife and habitat if not sited properly. Site Renewables Right provides a way for companies and communities to assess those impacts. It encourages the right conversations to avoid project delays and impacts to the very same wildlife and natural areas we are trying to protect from climate change,” said Nathan Cummins, Director of Renewable Energy Programs, The Nature Conservancy’s Great Plains Division.
The central US is “home on the range”, known for its natural great plains that support abundant wildlife. The Nature Conservancy supports transitioning to a carbon-free future, while protecting our natural areas. Thus identifying places where renewables will have the least impact is the goal of the Site Renewables Right map. The Solar PV map features habitat areas for the following:
• Whooping crane stopover sites (with 400 m avoidance buffer; cf. Baasch et al. 2019)
• Threatened and endangered species
• Water and wetland features (no buffers)
• Protected and managed lands
• Intact natural habitats
• Other areas of biodiversity significance
• Climate resilient lands
“Renewable energy and transmission are critical to reducing emissions and slowing global temperature rise to ensure a cleaner future for both people and wildlife,” stated Garry George, Director, Clean Energy Initiative, National Audubon Society. “The Site Renewables Right tool plays an important role in Audubon’s analysis of clean energy planning and individual projects to make sure that conservation and renewables go hand-in-hand.”
Companies such as Xcel Energy are using Site Renewables Right to find areas where renewable energy development is most likely to avoid important natural areas, permitting delays, and cost overruns. “Renewable energy plays a critical role in Xcel Energy’s vision to deliver at least 80% emissions reduction by 2030, and we’re responsibly developing wind and solar resources to protect the environment,” said Jeff West, Senior Director of Environmental at Xcel Energy.
The Nature Conservancy’s Site Wind Right map, a prior version of TNC’s Site Renewables Right map, won the 2021 “Environmental Protection” Good Practices award from Renewable Grid Initiative (RGI), a European organization focused on energy transmission system operators and non-governmental organizations.
