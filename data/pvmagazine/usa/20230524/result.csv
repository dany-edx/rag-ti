As the fifth largest of the fifty states in terms of size, it ranks just 46th by population density. With just under 1.5 GW of installed solar capacity, New Mexico ranks 20th in the U.S., which covers about 6.14% of electricity demand, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The outlook for solar in the state is bright, with SEIA projecting that nearly 4 GW will be added in the next five years, popping the state up to the 12th spot.

Incentives
As in all states in the U.S., solar installations in New Mexico may receive the federal investment tax credit along with a state credit of $1,800.
The state also has a renewable portfolio standard  (RPS) that requires that investor-owned utilities are securing 50% of their capacity through carbon-free renewables by 2030 and 100% by 2045. For rural electric cooperatives, it’s 40% by 2025, 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.
The Public Service Company of New Mexico, owned by investor-owned utility PNM Resources, offers a solar renewable energy certificate  (SREC) program that will award systems under 10 kW $0.0025 for every kWh for the first eight years. Payouts are sent once the credit exceeds $20.
Net metering
With a maximum system capacity 80 MW, residents can receive credit on their next bill at avoided cost rate for excess kWh generated. If customer leaves the utility, unused credits are paid out oat the avoided cost rate.
Community solar
A state policy was passed in April 2022 by the Public Regulation Commission that allows for community solar up to 200 MW, split by utilities. The Public Service Company of New Mexico has 125 MW; Southwestern Public Service has 45 MW; El Paso Electric has 30 MW—all of which last through April 2024. There is also a stipulation that 30% of electricity produced by a community solar facility be earmarked for low-income subscribers. Native American energy authorities and rural electric cooperative projects in the state are not restricted by the cap.
InClime Solutions, a veteran-owned business that vets U.S. renewable energy and energy efficiency incentive programs, recently announced 200 MW of projects selected for inclusion in the next slate of New Mexico’s community solar program out of 1.7 GW of project submissions.
A recent University of New Mexico study found that community solar can provide a major economic stimulus to New Mexico at a time when it is desperately needed. The study found that community solar will:
Landmark solar installations
In June 2022, the Public Service Company of New Mexico announced that it would move forward with four solar-plus-storage projects to replace the 847 MW coal-fired San Juan Generating Station.
The four projects slated to replace the fossil fuel generating station will all be located in Northwest New Mexico. The combined projects comprise 650 MW of solar generation and 300 MW/1.2 GWh of energy storage. Two of the projects have already been approved by state regulators: Arroyo Solar, owned by D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments, which clocks in at 300 MW and 150 MW/600 MWh of storage, and Jicarilla Solar I, developed by Hecate Energy, at 50MW and 20MW/80 MWh.
Commercial solar is also on the rise in New Mexico with Meta, Walmart, and Target all having solar installations in the state. Meta’s 50 MW project in Sandoval County is one of the largest. Public Service Co. of New Mexico and New Mexico Renewable Development LLC entered into an agreement in 2019 to build the solar array to provide electricity for a Meta (Facebook) data center.

Since the SEIA report was published, Toyota has added 30 MW of solar to Alabama operations and now will add 100 MW(ac) of solar for its Kentucky-based operations.
Toyota Motor North America signed a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) this week with developer Savion for the offtake of a 100 MW brownfield solar project to be built on a reclaimed coal mine in Martin County, Kentucky.
Located on the border of Kentucky and West Virginia in Pilgrim, Ky., the Martiki Coal Mine is a 1,200 acre former mountaintop coal mine that was closed in the 1990s. The brownfield site has clear access to light from the sun, making it an ideal location for reclamation and the installation of solar panels. Construction on the project is anticipated to begin mid-year, with commercial operation on track for 2024.
Toyota’s 100 MW initial procurement will be used primarily to help reduce the company’s carbon footprint across its North America operations, supplementing the environmental stewardship in Kentucky, where Toyota’s largest vehicle manufacturing plant in the world is located. The new project procurement is in line with Toyota’s plans to make all its North American manufacturing operations carbon neutral by 2035.
“It is important that renewable power is more available to large-scale U.S. energy buyers, and converting brownfields like this offers a path forward for former energy communities to take advantage of the infrastructure they already have with transmission lines while providing clean energy to the grid,” said David Absher, senior manager of environmental sustainability, Toyota Motor North America.
According to the developer’s website, the Martin County solar site has the potential to be expanded to 200 MW in the next few years, with the initial 100 MW providing enough power for 33,000 Kentuckyan homes. The project is ideally situated nearby an existing 138 kV American Electric Power (AEP) power substation, the Inez Substation, making grid interconnection easy for the utility solar project.
Siting and permitting for the Martin County Solar facility kicked off in February 2020 and the project later received a $231 million industrial bond from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority and $600,000 of sales tax incentives from the Kentucky Enterprise Initiative Act. Once complete, the project will provide Martin County about $300,000 per year in tax revenue.
At peak construction, the developer will employ 300 construction workers.
Savion is developing the project with the support of local partner Edelen Renewables, a Lexington, Ky.-based developer of renewable energy projects in former coal, oil and gas drilling and resource-producing regions from Texas to Kentucky. In addition to a recent partnership with Arcadia and the American Farmland Trust to deploy 500 MW of community solar, Edelen also works with Fortune 50 companies to site the development of renewable energy projects such as Martin County, Ky.
At the time of the project’s December 2021 permitting approval, Savion had five coal mines sited for development in Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia with about 550 MW of solar development potential over the next few years, representing more than $500 million of capital commitment projects.
Reclaimed coal sites present unique challenges to brownfield solar development which include:
In early April, the Internal Revenue Service issued guidance on “energy communities” as defined by the federal Inflation Reduction Act. These communities could be in former coal country where people are experiencing high rates of unemployment due to the closing of mines. Read more about what an energy community is here.
The IRA includes a 30% investment tax credit for the cost of developing renewable energy resources. Another 10% adder is applied to projects installed in energy communities, which have now been defined by the IRS:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/24/community-solar-dg-market-gives-rise-to-automated-market-system-for-procurement/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SOFTWARE,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 24, 2023","Community solar, DG market gives rise to automated market system for procurement","The proliferation of community solar in 23 U.S. states, with requests for proposals for hundreds of MW of projects, has required a systematic approach to ordering modules and battery storage systems. With state backlogs for projects colocated on small acreages with 5 MW on average of power capacity, a 21-year old solar developer has launched an online marketplace that provides real-time and forward-looking pricing metrics that factors in the dynamics of a long-term power asset.  
Anza Renewables, a marketplace for small-scale utility, community solar and distributed generation projects including storage,was spun out of Borrego, with the intention of bringing to the industry the proprietary optimization process that was first used internally by Borrego engineering and procurement teams for its own  development projects. Earlier this month Anza announced its separation from Borrego and a fund raise from Energy Capital Partners’ (ECP) Energy Transition Opportunities Fund, Angeleno Group, and other investors. 
Anza sees itself as a Kayak.com-type of resource for developers looking to book equipment and save capital in real-time based on market pricing curves and commodity sways, Mike Hall, co-founder and chief executive officer of Anza RE, told pv magazine USA. 
Currently developers only have the tools to compare modules based on price, but they want to compare by project value, Hall said. Anza’s marketplace and search engine will compare these factors to provide value-added metrics, he added.  
Before Anza, project developers would typically participate in a request for proposal (RFP) and book module orders for panels in a multi-hundred MW portfolio, Hall said. At that point, the buyer would lock-in a price that could be several weeks out of date, using a conventional sales approach where phone calls and weeks pass before a procurement is made, he said. 
The distributed generation market’s maturity starting in 2015-16 created a topsy-turvy market with “hundreds of IPP buyers” participating in an out-dated system without forward-pricing mechanisms or showing long-term value in projects that were being developed in new states for that type of asset class, he said.  
On the supply side, more than 40 Tier I module suppliers had ballooned in the U.S., making it difficult to connect buyers and sellers for projects, Hall recalls. Many Asian vendors selling into the U.S. DG market had a difficult time as well connecting with buyers, he added.  
And using a conventional sales route, with consultants from a myriad of developers calling the same resale party such as Greentech Renewables, independent power producers (IPPs) often lost out on net present value, Hall said.
Now more than 150 companies such as Renewable Properties currently use Anza’s one-stop solar and storage marketplace, supporting rapid and optimal purchasing decisions. 
The company’s proprietary technology engine behind a digital platform is a cost and performance modeling software that identifies the most optimized components based on customer-provided project details. 
To date, Anza has transacted over 2 GW worth of solar modules on its software platform which connects buyers and vendors, and also provides periodic market reports showing pricing metrics, Hall said. 
Anza’s marketplace sells primarily solar modules and battery systems for storage projects, as well as some interconnected inverter components primarily for storage, Hall said.  
Further clarity from the federal Inflation Reduction Act with respect to the onshoring of U.S. solar and storage components could spur the company to feature more integral components to the DG system in years to come, he said. But for now the company is primarily focused on solar modules and DG battery systems for active procurement, Hall said.
Project developers can start to see cost savings using Anza following their first order, while real value is seen by the time a project enters construction. “The Anza platform is good at providing 6 quarters of forward pricing metrics, while the system is constantly sending project updates for pricing metrics,” Hall said, comparing the system to travel marketplace Kayak.com, where users receive recommendations for booking travel in real-time or waiting a matter of weeks or a month.  
In addition to pricing metrics, Anza’s system is also showing users module improvements from vendors in real-time as well to illustrate not just cost savings, but project improvements on the technical side as well, Hall said.  
As a software provider and electronic vendor, Anza generates revenue by receiving a “very small percentage of each transaction users maker,” Hall said about the procurement platform. Potential buyers can post project size, location and various data points onto the the platform for free and Anza generates sales from connecting the buyer with active vendors. 
Anza’s marketplace was devised after the Covid-19 pandemic,and following the 2021 separation of Borrego into a development business, operations and maintenance business, Hall and the developer’s founders saw a niche opportunity on the procurement side of the business to fill in an out-dated business model with a real-time, online marketplace.  
Mike Hall and brother Aaron Hall formed Borrego in 2002. And in July 2022, the San Diego-based developer, EPC and O&M provider of large-scale solar and  storage projects completed a corporate spin-off and sale of its development business to Energy Capital Partners (ECP). The new development company was subsequently renamed New Leaf Energy and continued to be operated by ECP. Borrego continued to be run by Hall as an O&M provider with about 2.5 GW of projects under management.
Anza is exhibiting at Booth #3914 at the CleanPower Conference & Exhibition 2023, a national power and renewable energy industry conference taking place from May 23 to 25 at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/24/first-solar-files-suit-against-toledo-solar-for-false-and-deceptive-practices/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,OHIO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 24, 2023",First Solar files suit against Toledo Solar for false and deceptive practices,"First Solar filed a lawsuit today against Toledo Solar, a thin-film solar module manufacturer, which—like First Solar–is based in Ohio.
According to the court filing, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, Toledo Solar sold Malayasian-made First Solar solar modules under the Toledo name, claiming they were made in America. The filing states that the action is in violation of the Lanham Act and the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act “for false designation of origin and passing off goods of another.”
First Solar claims that Toledo Solar falsely represented that Toledo Solar manufactured solar modules that in fact were manufactured by First Solar. The filing states Toledo falsely claimed that it manufactured the solar modules that Toledo had provided for installation on the Ohio Governor’s mansion in Columbus; that Toledo falsely represent that the modules were made by Toledo in Ohio, and that Toledo advertised on social media that it manufactured certain solar modules in Ohio.
The reportedly nefarious practice was discovered in the summer of 2022 when First Solar employees went to the Ohio Governor’s mansion to remove 20-year old solar modules for decommissioning. There the employee saw modules in Toledo Solar boxes that had the familiar First Solar imprint and serial numbers on the side. Toledo Solar and new serial numbers had also been etched into the modules. First Solar’s junction boxes had also been changed.
First Solar reports that the solar modules were actually manufactured by First Solar at its manufacturing facility in Malaysia, and that by these actions put First Solar at liability and reputational risk. The filing also notes that past customers of Toledo Solar may also have been deceived.
On a conference call, a First Solar spokesperson stated:
We were disappointed to learn that Toledo Solar has modified, marketed, and sold First Solar’s CadTel (Cadmium Telluride) solar panels as its own, and have filed a complaint against the company for deceptive trade practices. Given our role as a solar industry leader with a track record in championing domestic solar manufacturing, we have taken this action after careful consideration of the seriousness of the matter. Our intent is to address and ultimately resolve the issue by having Toledo Solar notify all purchasers of any First Solar panels that it has sold as its own, and to prevent it from making further false claims and selling any additional First Solar panels it may have in stock.
Prior to filing the lawsuit, First Solar did some of its own investigating by ordering 200 Toledo solar modules from a retail distributor. The modules were delivered in February 2023, and included a label indicating that they were manufactured by Toledo Solar and Made in the USA. Toledo Solar provided a notarized certificate of origin verifying that the modules it consigned to the distributor for sale were “the products of the United States of America.” What they found was that, like the modules provided by Toledo Solar for the Governor’s mansion, the modules included First Solar’s manufacturing serial numbers showing they were manufactured by First Solar in Malaysia. In addition, they included First Solar’s junction boxes.
According to the filing, First Solar is seeking:
In the meantime, First Solar said it will replace the modules on the Governor’s mansion with its own product at no charge to the State of Ohio.
First Solar is represented by Squire Patton Boggs LLP of Cleveland, Ohio.
pv magazine USA reached out to Toledo Solar for comment, but at press time had not received a response.

This award resulted from the All-Source RFP conducted by APS in May of 2022 in which APS sought approximately 1 GW to 1.5 GW of resources, including up to 600 MW to 800 MW of renewable resources to meet the needs identified through the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission. APS’s IRP indicates a need for additional flexible capacity resources to meet reliability requirements in the summertime, when electricity needs are highest in Arizona.
The Scatter Wash Energy Storage project is the combination of Deer Valley and Scatter Wash projects, and it is currently in development stages near the Deer Valley Airport in Arizona. Strata Clean Energy plans to create a 400 MW/1,600 MWh-capable battery storage site that would house enough energy to power at least 350,000 homes for one hour. When completed in 2024, the site will connect to the APS grid.
In the tolling agreement, Strata will continue to own the Scatter Wash storage facility and APS, the buyer, will pay for the electricity used to charge the energy storage system. APS will receive the right to charge/discharge the system for energy as needed, and Strata will receive a capacity payment.
“We believe that APS will continue to be a leader in battery energy storage and that our experienced Scottsdale-based team is well positioned to help move the state towards achieving its clean-energy objectives with projects like Scatter Wash. We have a large pipeline of additional clean energy projects in the Western United States and world-class execution capabilities,” said Josh Rogol, President of Strata Clean Energy.
Strata Clean Energy and its affiliates are a vertically integrated solar and storage development, engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and operations & maintenance (O&M) company, with more than 170 projects in operation, over 7 GW of solar and 28 GWh of storage in development, and 4.2 GW under management across the U.S.  In 2022, Strata acquired Arizona-based Crossover Energy Partners and is currently hiring for additional local positions in its Scottsdale office.
APS is Arizona’s largest and longest-serving electric company, serving more than 1.3 million commercial and residential customers in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties. The electric company has a commitment to 100% clean energy by 2050.
