Recently, advocacy and protest in California delayed the much-maligned NEM 3.0 proposal, and now a similar fight has come to the Sunshine State in the east.
Two bills are proposed and have made their way through the state legislatures. House Bill 741, which may be decided on as soon as today, and Senate Bill 1024, which has moved its way through the legislative process, are believed to pose existential threats to rooftop solar in Florida.
Both bills have broad language that call for the phase-out of paying solar customers for excess generation that they export to the grid. The bills also leave room open for fixed monthly charges, only for solar customers, a policy structure that many have described as a “tax on the sun.” As grid and rate design expert Dr. Ahmad Faruqui put it, “Why should someone buying carrots at the grocery store have to pay more because they also grow carrots at home?”
What’s at stake?
If Florida’s rooftop solar industry is to fold, with it would go $18.3 billion in economic activity, reports the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association. Over $3.3 billion in tax revenues would be lost.
Also at stake is 40,000 Floridian jobs and $3.2 billion in household income to Florida workers, according to Conservatives for Clean Energy. Indeed, conservatives in the state of Florida recognize that this issue affects both sides of the aisle, and is a matter of personal choice and freedom, as a Mason Dixon poll showed that 74% of Republicans want net metering to remain intact. In agreement with their Republican colleagues, 94% of Democrat survey responders said they support net metering.

The same Mason Dixon poll found that a majority of Floridians, about 68%, think that utilities should make it easier to install rooftop solar, not harder.
Katie Ottenweller, southeast director of advocacy group Vote Solar said in a webinar that utilities, which are essentially offered a monopoly by law, are also bound by law to serve the public interest. Ottenweller said this proposal does not serve the public, and she is encouraging Florida voters to use their voice to fight for personal choice.
FLASEIA.org has guides, talking points, and a directory of contacts for those who are interested in fighting the bills. The organization recommends contacting your representatives, as there is still time for this bill to be delayed and altered.

If the bill is passed, FLASEIA, Vote Solar, and other groups said they will then elevate the issue to Governor Ron Desantis to ask for his veto.
Cost shift
Founded on the idea of the “cost shift,” the bills are pitched as a protection for non-solar customers from raised rates through cross-subsidizing solar customers.
Sixteen state-level studies, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, have disproven the cost-shift argument, as has a national study, completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Berkeley found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar.
The Berkeley study found that cost pressures from net metering don’t start making a tangible effect until solar penetration reaches 10%. Florida is nowhere near this figure, with 0.86% of households currently topped with solar. Read more about the “cost shift” and a utility-funded coalition that disseminates the idea here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/02/three-non-profits-receive-nrel-support-to-help-bipoc-houses-of-worship-to-go-solar/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 2, 2022",Three non-profits receive NREL support to help BIPOC houses of worship to go solar,"RE-volv, Green The Church, and Interfaith Power & Light are partnering to increase solar adoption by houses of worship led by Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) by strengthening existing partnerships and scaling successful efforts, and they hope that their work becomes a blueprint that will help other communities transition to clean energy.
The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is supporting these nonprofits financial, analytical, and facilitation help as part of the third round of the Solar Energy Innovation Network (SEIN). The focus of the third round of the SEIN is to help underserved communities overcome barriers to equitable adoption of solar, including funding, as nonprofits face particular barriers to accessing solar financing.
“We selected teams that are experimenting with creative, promising ideas to use solar power in underserved communities across the United States,” said Eric Lockhart, who leads the Innovation Network at NREL.
The team aims to streamline the process by identifying promising locations, presenting proposals, financing the solar projects, and engaging the local community. The partnership also plans to help congregants and community members go solar at home and deliver solar workforce development opportunities to the community.
To date, the benefits of clean energy are not equally benefiting all Americans. We know there are large racial and ethnic disparities around where solar installations occur in America. Through this partnership, we’ll not only be able to assist BIPOC-led houses of worship by lowering their electricity bills, allowing them to improve the critical services they offer to their community, but these projects will raise awareness and visibility of solar, hopefully compelling others in the community to go solar, multiplying the impact of each project, said Andreas Karelas, Executive Director of RE-volv.
In terms of funding, houses of worship and nonprofits nationwide are unable to make use of the federal investment tax credits for solar, and may have a harder time demonstrating creditworthiness to traditional solar financiers. This initiative will enable BIPOC-led houses of worship go solar for zero down, while benefiting from saving substantially on their electricity bills.
“Black churches and faith buildings all over the country must be retrofitted and stewarded, and we do not want to assign that task to others,” said Rev. Dr. Ambrose Carroll, founder of Green The Church. “Green The Church is committed to facilitating and supporting community-driven solar projects and ensuring that such projects are accountable to and co-created with the communities most impacted by them.”
Over the next 18 months, RE-volv, Green The Church, and Interfaith Power & Light will work collaboratively with the seven other SEIN teams to share lessons learned and help create a blueprint for equitable solar deployment nationwide.

The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), publishers of this year’s edition, has issued a call for participation.
The confidential, voluntary survey is in two parts: The first part was prepared by the US Department of Energy (DOE) and will survey all energy industries. After completing this, solar and storage companies will receive a link to a shorter follow-up survey with questions specific to this sector.
Click here to participate.
The survey addresses businesses that research, develop, manufacture, install, or work with products that generate, distribute, or save energy. Eligible organizations include those involved in fossil and renewable energy production, energy efficiency products and services, motor vehicles, solar, wind, fossil, other energy sources, and energy-related products and services.  Those who work for a clean energy firm should be receiving an email from the US Department of Energy with a link to fill out the survey. (If not, click on the link above.) Individual responses will not be published–it will be aggregated with other responses received to develop the survey results.
The survey is voluntary and can take up to 45 minutes (including any necessary preparation). Strong participation will help determine how investments of time and money should be made to support the industry and prepare the present and future labor pool.
The National Solar Jobs Census has been published every year since 2010 (first published by The Solar Foundation), and is considered the definitive measure of solar energy industry employment in the United States. The report charts the growth of the solar workforce alongside the rise of solar energy as a major contributor to the US energy supply and the economy.
This report tracks solar jobs data nationwide and in all 50 states. It features in-depth analysis on jobs by market segment, demographics, and workforce development trends. The most recent report, which was published last spring, was a collaborative effort between Solar Energy Industries Association, The Solar Foundation, and Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). Primary data collection and analysis is performed by BW Research Partnership, an independent energy employment research firm. Following its merger with The Solar Foundation, IREC will publish the next edition of the Solar Jobs Census in early 2022. Previous editions of the report can be found below.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/02/arizona-senate-controls-the-fate-of-phoenix-anti-solar-rate/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ARIZONA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 2, 2022",Arizona Senate controls the fate of Phoenix anti-solar rate,"In a court decision that gave hope that Phoenix-area utility Salt River Project’s anti-solar rates would soon be abolished, a federal appeals court ruled that the utility is subject to federal antitrust laws. The utility’s rates increased costs for rooftop solar customers by 65%, and resulted in a decrease in rooftop solar applications of 50-96%, the court found.
But now, the Arizona legislature is poised to rescind the state’s law favoring competition in electricity generation and supply, a law that was central to the appeals court’s antitrust finding. In a bipartisan vote, the Arizona House of Representatives last week passed a bill to end that competition, and the Arizona Senate is ready to vote on a bill that could do the same.
Arizona SEIA, the state affiliate of the national solar association SEIA, has opposed both bills. If they become law, SRP’s anti-solar rate would “very likely” be allowed to stand, the group said in a letter to state legislators.
That’s because, as the appeals court said, if Arizona law aimed to displace competition in electricity generation and supply, SRP, as a political subdivision of the State of Arizona, could be entitled to “state-action immunity.” SRP was established by state law as an agricultural improvement district.
Arizona SEIA’s letter said that customers choose solar for many reasons, such as favoring clean energy, resiliency, or saving money. “No matter why you might favor rooftop solar, it is a choice that each family should get to make for themselves, and the utilities should not be able to put their thumbs on the scale to make it so burdensome to adopt that families are prevented from making the decision.”
Vote Solar and free market advocates have also registered their opposition to the bill.
The Arizona House bill, HB 2101, passed by a bipartisan vote of 37-21. The Arizona Senate bill, SB 1631, has passed in committee and is ready for a floor vote.
Arizona is one of the sunniest states in the US, and has the nation’s fourth-highest amount of small-scale PV relative to its population.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/02/new-york-town-plans-floating-solar-demonstration-project/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 2, 2022",New York town plans floating-solar demonstration project,"Not many towns or cities in the US can claim to be powered 100% by renewable energy, but soon one town can make that claim, as it is planned to be powered by a solar array floating on a municipal reservoir.
In Cohoes, New York, a working-class community of 17,000 residents, the town turned to its own reservoir as a way to power its municipal buildings with renewable energy. Siting solar on the 10-acre reservoir is unusual, but it turned out to be the best approach for a town lacking suitable land or rooftops for solar. The only challenge was cost: $6 million. Because municipalities cannot access the same tax incentives as private companies when developing renewable energy, the city would need to make the case for state, federal, and foundation funding.
Theresa Bourgeois, director of operations for the city and  Joe Seman-Graves, city planner, had done enough research to know that floating solar was a tested technology and that the reservoir was a suitable size to hold enough panels to power all Cohoes city-owned buildings and streetlights. In the course of that research, they discovered an NREL report that gave them the pitch that they needed to secure funding.  The report, “Floating Photovoltaic Systems: Assessing the Technical Potential of Photovoltaic Systems on Man-Made Water Bodies in the Continental United States” includes data about potential US “floatovoltaic” sites, including each reservoir’s estimated size, proximity to electric transmission, ownership status, and current use.

“We used the basic results in that study to provide information to Congress, to our representatives, to the public, showing that we have a viable option,” Bourgeois said.
In making their pitch, Bourgeois and Seman-Graves referenced the fact that there are 492 reservoirs that could potentially support floating solar. With their idea beginning to look like it might be a model for powering other communities with clean energy, the project won support of state and federal officials. However, the Cohoes team realized that key data was missing from the NREL report and that was the potential for floating solar that is in proximity to lower-income communities. By bringing this to NREL’s attention, they suggested a visualization that breaks the data into congressional districts and economic factors, which would help show the economic incentive for any town.
The request was shared with John Erickson, director of research operations at IDEA, whose first goal was to visualize NREL’s data overlaid with LMI maps.

“Plotting the two data sets together was an eye-opener,” Erickson said. “Right away the possibilities for low-cost clean energy become clear.”
Erickson collaborated with Bourgeois and Seman-Graves to create the Floating Solar Explorer. The exploration tool is available online and includes a map of all the suitable reservoirs identified by NREL, as well as congressional district-scale LMI information layered over New York.
The 3.2MW floating solar demonstration project in Cohoes will cost about $5.9 million, with federal funding of $4.788 million and a non-federal share of $1.209 million. This project is a demonstration of the technology of floating solar, but also a model for how other municipalities can invest in their own energy infrastructure. While the cost is close to $6 million, the Cohoes floating solar installation is expected to erase around $500,000 in annual electricity costs—with 40% of the generated electricity remaining for civic use.

This is the fourth green bond issued by Verizon since 2019, for a total of $4 billion.
Verizon made use of its second green bond, which was issued in 2020, by entering into a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) with Lightsource bp. This investment enabled the construction of the 173MW Bellflower solar farm near Indianapolis. The project is expected to be operational in 2022 and will be part of university research on the benefits of co-locating pollinator habitat and solar installations.
“Working together, we’re reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation for the overall grid while delivering substantial local economic benefits. Adding initiatives to enhance local biodiversity further multiplies solar’s contribution to preserving our planet for future generations,” said Kevin Smith, CEO of Lightsource bp in the Americas.
In 2021, Verizon deepened its commitment to fostering diversity, inclusion and equity in economic opportunities in the capital markets by including a pledge in its Green Financing Framework to only engage underwriters for its green bond transactions that have established clear and impactful commitments in support of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and/or are a diverse-owned firm or have a core mission of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.
The company has partnered with BofA Securities and once again three minority- and women-owned firms as lead underwriters for its fourth green bond: Loop Capital Markets, Ramirez & Co., Inc. and Siebert Williams Shank. Verizon reports that it paid over $20 million in underwriting fees to minority- and women-owned firms in 2021 and over $5 million in fees to such firms in 2022 in connection with its fourth green bond.
“We are all very aware of the urgency and need in pursuing sustainable solutions and we are committed to our ESG strategy, knowing there is still a great deal of work ahead of us. It is my hope that Verizon’s leadership will inspire others to take action as well,” said Matt Ellis, Verizon’s executive vice president and chief financial officer.
