Currently, it is cheaper to toss a panel in the landfill than to reuse or recycle it. But, as the stack of decommissioned panels grows, so too does the opportunity for a circular economy.
The creators of the newly launched SolarRecycle.org recognized this opportunity, and are working to support the flow of information to enable greater rates of solar panel reuse and recycling.
Recycling incentives are poorly aligned at present, but this dynamic appear to be shifting. For example, analysts at NREL have modeled a current average recycling cost of $28 per module, repairs at $65 per module, and landfilling at only $1.38 per module.
Solar panel recycler Cascade Eco Minerals (CEM) told pv magazine that the market has pushed recycling costs down as more panels reach the end of their serviceable lives. It said that the current rate is about $0.35 per pound. That mean a typical 72-cell module weighing 50 lbs. would cost roughly $17.50 to recycle. The company said much of this cost reduction has occurred in the last 12-18 months, and rising economies of scale should continue to shrink costs.
Recycling rates are low right now, but declining costs could lead to a better financial model. NREL said at a $28 price tag, decision-makers would likely landfill their panels at a rate of 80% through 2050. If costs fell to $18 per module, closer to the figure quoted by CEM, recycling rates would increase by about one-third.
SolarRecycle said it aims to speed this maturation process for the solar panel recycling economy by connecting asset owners, operations and maintenance providers, and other players with recycling vendors.
The new website aggregates information on where to donate or sell used equipment, how to recycle, and provides updated state and federal policy related to solar recycling and waste classification. An interactive map highlights service providers by state.
“How many solar companies have piles of used and broken equipment in their warehouse? This website can help connect you with options to sell, donate, or recycle those items and free up your space – and your conscience,” said Kate Collardson, a volunteer with SolarRecycle.org.
As solar panel recycling is still in an early stage, so is SolarRecycle.org. The website-runners said they hope others will add to the site in order to centralize research and resource access.

The investment is intended to support four Grasshopper projects in Massachusetts that include large-scale solar-plus-battery energy storage.
Grasshopper handles acquisition and development, legal and regulatory, corporate financing, project management, and asset management for large-scale renewables projects.
Grasshopper said it has a development pipeline of over $6.5 billion, and is focusing on development opportunities in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. The company also targets international markets, with plans to develop solar in Brazil, Italy, Vietnam, and Australia.

The USCG Petaluma training center is set to have a 5 MW solar, 11.6 MWh energy storage microgrid integrated as part of its $43 million contract. Severe weather events and utility interruptions at the northern California center led USCG to install a microgrid for more stable operations.
As part of the contract, Ameresco will provide energy efficiency and management systems, and planned improvements feature the deployment of new power distribution transformers, smart controls in 10 buildings across campus, LED lighting improvements, installation of new electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and HVAC upgrades.

The contract is expected to create savings of $1.2 million the first year. The project is expected to cut the center’s annual electricity consumption by 8.7 million kWh and its propane use by 50.8 kgal.
“This contract award enables continuity of operations in an environment of unpredictable climate hazards and will increase Training Center Petaluma’s relevance throughout the region, while sustaining our Coast Guard mission ready total workforce,” said Capt. Steven Ramassini, commanding officer for the training campus.
Construction on the project is planned to start in October, and is expected to be complete in the fall of 2023.

The facility doubles testing capacity over PVEL’s Berkeley and South San Francisco locations and will replace both labs when it opens in early 2022.
PVEL said the hail stress sequence was added to the PQP to address concerns from insurers and asset owners about the ability of PV modules to withstand severe hail impacts. To design the hail stress sequence PVEL used data from nearly 1 GW of hail-damaged projects that it has evaluated in the field as well as test results from in-lab experiments.
Development of PVEL’s new hail test was informed by insurance claim and asset performance data from kWh Analytics. PVEL also solicited feedback from asset owners, developers, and insurers.
“As a global industry, we must consider natural catastrophes like hailstorms in the context of a changing climate. It is time to future-proof solar projects around the world for new weather patterns that are difficult to predict yet impossible to ignore,” said Kevin Christy, head of Innovation and Operational Excellence, Americas of Lightsource bp.
He said that for solar assets in central U.S. states, new test protocols are needed that will allow module buyers to “truly understand those products’ limits of durability against potentially damaging hail.” Christy said that over the next decade the installed PV capacity in high-risk states is projected to more than quadruple.

The program is intended to offer companies training and support to analyze their DEIJ practices and offer solutions for improvement. Under the program, companies may accumulate points as they complete activities and improve their DEIJ efforts. They can achieve Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum certification, depending on their accumulated points.
The program was partially born out of a recognition that auditing a business for DEIJ can be a daunting process, especially  without outside support and appropriate tools.

The program launches alongside SEIA’s online learning center, which will offer archived webinar content, and other resources. SEIA asked companies to sign up for the program and begin working through the modules that will help them achieve certification.
“If we reach our goals in the Solar+ Decade, we’re going to have numerous opportunities to hire people from diverse backgrounds,” said Hopper. “As the trade association for one of the fastest-growing industries in America, we’ve long recognized the importance of incorporating DEIJ priorities into all aspects of our work.”
The program was designed by Diversity Certified Professionals and uses an evidence-based approach to improve diversity practices within companies. The program was also designed so that all companies, regardless of their size, geographic footprint or resources, can achieve the highest levels of certification.
The program has been beta-tested by renewable energy companies and national organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Energy (WRISE), American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE), and Black Owned Solar Services (BOSS).
