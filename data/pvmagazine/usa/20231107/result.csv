https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/07/ascent-solar-announces-17-55-efficiency-for-cigs-tech/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Ascent Solar announces 17.55% efficiency for CIGS tech,"Colorado-based PV manufacturer Ascent Solar said its proprietary thin-film PV solutions, based on CIGS, have reached an efficiency of 17.55%, up from 15.5% in previous test results.
The company said that current measurements account for a milestone achievement, as 17% is the minimum efficiency required by many satellite companies.
“The latest efficiency increase can be attributed to the addition of rubidium fluoride to the chemistry, combined with improvements to Ascent’s manufacturing process,” the company said in a statement. “The improvements will result in an increase in specific power in the space environment from 1,900 W/kg to 2,100 W/kg at air mass zero.”
Ascent Solar added that it will soon release a new CIGS module with this efficiency. The Titan panel is said to be optimized for use in space environments. First orders are expected to be shipped in the first quarter of 2024.
“Titan will be the first standardized product specially designed for space with a specific power of 2,100 W/kg, coupled with best-in-class resilience and flexibility features,” the company said. “The Titan module is approximately one square foot in size, 10 grams in weight, and possesses a target output of 17 W. It can be used alone or configured into an array.”
The company said further enhancements to its CIGS PV technology include the incorporation of Zn(O,S), which is a thin film that can be used as a buffer layer in the cell. It is expected to increase efficiency and power as it expands interactions with light in the blue spectrum and counters degradation after light soak.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/07/maine-residents-vote-on-fate-of-two-utilities/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MAINE",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Maine residents vote on fate of two utilities,"In yesterday’s election in Maine, voters had the opportunity to revoke the licenses of the state’s two for-profit, investor-owned utilities. The bill failed to pass, with 69.4% voting against dissolving the utilities.
If passed, the vote would have essentially ceased operations of the utilities and launch Pine Tree Power, a new non-profit utility. The two utilities in question serve just over 800,000 residents combined in a state with a population of 1.3 million.
The two utilities are Central Maine Power and Versant Power, both known for poor customer service and “the worst reliability with our electric grid,” according to Al Cleveland, campaign manager for the group in favor of Pine Tree Power.
Proponents of Pine Tree Power object to the two utilities being owned by “faraway corporations” and they accuse them of “raising rates, threatening our energy security, allowing countless outages…”
Central Maine Power Company (CMP) is the larger of the two for-profit utilities. It operates approximately 23,500 miles of distribution lines and 2,900 miles of transmission lines, serving about 646,000 customers in 346 Maine communities. The utility is owned by Avangrid, a Spanish multinational corporation that owns and operates eight electric and natural gas utilities in New York and New England. It is part of the Iberdrola Group, a Spanish company.
Versant Power was formed after the merger of Bangor Hydro Electric and Maine Public Service in 2014, then called Emera Maine. Versant is now owned by Enmax, an energy company based in Calgary, Alberta. Versant has 6,300 miles of distribution lines and 1,265 miles of transmission, and serves approximately 165,000 Maine customers.
Among the many complaints about the utilities are rate hikes and having the money go elsewhere. In July, for example, the City of Calgary, Versant’s owner, announced the city government would be getting an $82 million 2022 dividend payment from Versant. Shortly thereafter, the utility hiked distribution rates 14%, then announced another rate hike of 12.5% planned for January 2024, according to Pine Tree Power. CMP hiked distribution rates 20% in June, while also sending out disconnection notices to 10% of its customers, Pine Tree contends.
CMP was ranked last in the nation for business customer satisfaction among utilities surveyed in a 2022 J.D. Power study. Versant was not included in the study due to its small size. The study noted that some of CMP’s poor customer service issues include the most power outages of any state, the second longest period with no power, and high electric rates.
While this is the first time the question has been put to voters, it is not the first attempt to vote the utilities out. In 2021 the Maine legislature wanted to put the Pine Tree Power question to vote, but it was vetoed by Governor Mills. Instead, the organization backing Pine Tree Power launched a referendum effort and submitted enough signatures to get the question on the ballot. In anticipation, CMP’s parent company Avangrid reportedly invested $7 million to launch an opposition group called Maine Affordable Energy.
Governor Mills said she opposes Pine Tree Power due to the risks involved. She thinks it may be too costly and that there’s too much uncertainty as to what electric rates would be, and she questions the expertise of the proposed board. She also shared doubts that it will move the state forward on its progress in clean, renewable energy.
A report prepared by London Economics International for the Maine Public Utilities Commission found that the initial startup would be costly, but would eventually result in strong savings for Maine residents. The report estimated that the startup could cost ratepayers as much as $118 million in the first ten years, but then they could save as much as $236 million over a 30-year period as the new non-profit utility took advantage of tax-exempt and low-interest loands.
The bill is supported by climate activist Bill McKibben, Republican Senator Rick Bennett, Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders, along with the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council of Maine.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/07/solestial-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-solar-blanket-wings-for-spacecraft/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Solestial wins NASA contract to develop solar blanket wings for spacecraft,"Tempe, Arizona-based Solestial announced it has been awarded $849,954 for a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The contract entails Solestial developing 50 kW solar array wings outfit with its ultra-thin solar blanket technology.
Solestial develops ultra-thin, low mass, radiation-hardened solar blankets designed for the harsh conditions and restrictive weight requirements of space-based PV. The company said its 20-micron thick cells demonstrate over 20% efficiency.
The SBIR proposal, titled “Next Generation Silicon Based Solar Arrays for Space Stations and Other Permanent Space Infrastructure” adds on to a $149,987 Phase I contract from January 2023. The contracts were made possible through a new pilot program, SBIR Ignite, that funds commercially viable technologies from U.S. startups to support research, development, and economic growth.
The 18-month Phase II contract will support a collaborative development of spacecraft solar wings along with Opterus Research and Development. The contract includes plans for the development of an array and space-based testing.
“The private space stations and lunar bases of tomorrow will require a tremendous amount of power, and currently, there are no affordable and scalable space solar technologies that can accommodate this demand,” said Stan Herasimenka, Solestial co-founder and chief executive officer. “Our affordable and low-mass solar blankets will help to overcome size, cost, and manufacturing limitations to power large-scale spacecraft and surface infrastructure.”
Opterus will integrate Solestial’s solar blankets with its patent pending Retractable-Rollable Mast Array (R-ROMA) deployable solar structure. The R-ROMA is a tensioned solar blanket array with double z-folding panels deployed by a single rollable composite boom. The partnership between Solestial and Opterus will marry the two technologies to overcome the size, cost, and mass limitations of existing solar array technologies.
Solestial stated intent to achieve 50 kW scale and 200 W per kg array-level specific power while reducing costs.
The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) independently validated the ability of Solestial’s ultrathin silicon solar cells to effectively anneal radiation damage under sunlight at 90 C (194 F). This means the cells essentially self-heal under radiation damage.
Solestial’s silicon solar cells open circuit voltage dropped by only 4% and maintained 96% of initial value after being exposed to radiation equivalent to 10 years in low Earth orbit.
The company has been developing its technology for over a decade, beginning its life in Arizona State University. It underwent a $10 million seed funding round in October 2022. The most recent SBIR Ignite contract marks the ninth such award received by the company, bringing total funding from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Air Force to nearly $4 million to date.
Solestial targets a 2025 launch of a manufacturing facility capable of producing 10 MW per year of solar blankets. Read more about pv magazine USA coverage of solar applications in space.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/07/u-s-solar-electricity-generation-to-surpass-hydropower-in-2024/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",U.S. solar electricity generation to surpass hydropower in 2024,"Solar continues to climb the ranks of electricity generation sources as the United States pursues an emissions-free and affordable energy system. Total solar generation has grown 12x since 2013, and utility-scale solar installations are expected to grow 52% this year over 2022 totals.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) released a report that forecasts solar will surpass total electricity generation from hydroelectric dams in 2024. EIA expects solar to produce 14% more electricity next year than hydropower.
Hydroelectric dams have long been a major provider of emissions-free electricity in the United States. Wind-based electricity passed the milestone of providing more electricity than hydropower in 2019, becoming the most-used emissions-free source of electricity at that time.
Solar is now set to pass the milestone next year, said EIA. It has achieved the feat through exponential growth, increasing at an annual growth rate of 44% from 2009 to 2022, while hydroelectric power has remained relatively flat.

Solar represented 54% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the first quarter of 2023, according to Wood Mackenzie. More than 125 GW of solar, both large utility-scale and small-scale projects, have been installed in the U.S. to date. Wood Mackenzie projects that cumulative installations will more than double by 2028 to 375 GW.
Growth in solar is not the only condition closing the gap, however. Hydroelectric dams depend on long-term weather patterns and beneficial hydrologic conditions for their output. Through August this year, weather conditions have led to reduced output.
“During times of high demand or high prices, hydroelectric generators have reservoirs that can store water to be released through dams to generate electricity,” said EIA. “This ability to control the output is limited by long-term hydrologic conditions and other complications associated with water rights and recreational uses. Despite these challenges, hydropower continues to be a key source in the hourly pattern of generation in areas like the Pacific Northwest.”
Hydropower represents roughly 8% of U.S. electricity generation, while solar stands around 7.2%. The top three sources of electricity are natural gas (44%), coal (16.4%), and wind (11.6%).
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said there are 83 GW of “high probability” solar additions in the project pipeline over the next three years, and 214 GW of solar projects in the three-year queue in total. When compared with the 564 GW of natural gas capacity installed and active today, the total solar project pipeline is an impressive ramp-up of growth ahead. Based on FERC’s data, it is possible that solar could surpass natural gas by 2030 as the top electricity source in the United States.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/07/byd-unveils-new-agrivoltaics-module/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,BRAZIL,WORLD",LÍVIA NEVES,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",BYD unveils new agrivoltaics module,"From pv magazine Brazil
Chinese battery and solar module manufacturer BYD has recently developed a bifacial photovoltaic panel for agrivoltaics, a company spokesperson has told pv mazagine.
The company developed the new Bem-te-vi panel at the BYD module factory located in Campinas, near Sao Paulo, Brazil. It has a power output of 340 W to 355 W and a 16.33% power conversion efficiency. It uses 36 half-cut, 23%-efficient monocrystalline PERC cells and features a multi-busbar architecture.
BYD energy spokesperson, Edson Pozzonbon, told pv magazine that the panel also features a transparent backsheet. “The panels can form greenhouses or enclosures, optimizing the use of space and allowing the passage of light to the crops,” he said.
BYD will deploy these new panels at a 100 kW agrivoltaic array at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) in Brazil.
Pozzonbon said commercially the panels will be offered as an “integrated energy solution” alongside inverters, battery storage systems and electric trucks. The sale of the combination package aims to fix the issue of Frankenstein solar systems, he said, which is a “problem” in Brazil. This is when a solar arrangement utilizes different companies’ products and can lead to issues “establishing a connection between different equipment,” Pozzonbon said.
The BYD factory in Campinas reopened in 2022. It was upgraded with production equipment for modules based on multi-busbar, half-cell, and 1/3 cut cells. It has now an annual capacity of 500 MW and produces panels with power outputs ranging from 450 W to 670 W.
The factory opened in 2017 with an annual capacity of 200 MW, with the support of Apex-Brasil, the Brazilian government’s trade and investment promotion agency. Solar projects that feature Brazilian-made components can obtain financing from the Brazilian Development Bank and Banco do Nordeste.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/07/china-expected-to-dominate-solar-manufacturing-through-2026/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,CHINA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",China expected to dominate solar manufacturing through 2026,"The recent report “How will China’s expansion affect global solar module supply chains?” finds that China’s policy support for and investment in manufacturing across the solar supply chain will keep the country on top in terms of capacity through 2026.
China has invested an estimated $130 billion into its solar industry this year, according to the Wood Mackenzie report. With more than 1 TW of wafer, cell and module forecast to come online in the next year, China will have enough capacity to meet global demand through 2032, the report says.
“China’s solar manufacturing expansion has been driven by high margins for polysilicon, technology upgrades and policy support,” said Huaiyan Sun, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie, and author of the report. “And despite strong government initiatives for developing local manufacturing in overseas markets, China will still dominate the global solar supply chain and continue to widen the technology and cost gap with competitors.”
The report forecasts that China will hold more than 80% of the world’s polysilicon, wafer, cell, and module manufacturing capacity from 2023 to 2026. In addition, not only will the country dominate in capacity, its product will come at a lower cost. For example, the report says that a module made in China is half the price of that made in Europe and 65% less than that made in the U.S.
This comes as no surprise because, as noted at the recent pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, building a supply chain takes time. It has been just over a year since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S., which includes $370 billion to support renewable energy build out. Expert panelists noted that they expect the U.S. to be heavy with downstream solar manufacturing, and “we’ll have to continue to rely on imports from foreign partners for polysilicon, ingots and wafers to the U.S.,” said MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing for the American Clean Power Association. Shiao estimated that it can take from three to five years to build new polysilicon manufacturing.
The buildout of U.S. solar manufacturing will begin with modules, which Shiao said is the smart way to go to ensure that we meet the downstream demand, then start to look for more of the upstream part of the supply chain to meet domestic demand. But upstream manufacturing takes time, the panelists agreed.
“Despite considerable module expansion plans, overseas markets still cannot eliminate their dependence on China for wafers and cells in the next three years,” Sun said.
The U.S. isn’t the only region seeking wafer and cell capacity. As seen in the chart below, Europe and the U.S. both have polysilicon and module capacity, but fall far short in wafers and cell. Southeast Asia, on the other hand, has nearly matched capacity for cells and modules, with India not far behind. But India is also experiencing a strong build out in solar manufacturing, thanks to strong government policy in the form of PLI incentives, and the Wood Mac report forecasts that India will overtake Southeast Asia as the second-largest module production region by 2025.

As other regions are slower to ramp up cell production, China will continue to be the leader in capacity, holding an estimated 17 times more cell capacity than the rest of the world.
However, it is not without its challenges. The report notes that China has recently announced the termination of more than 70 GW in capacity due to oversupply and competition. This mainly concerns old production lines that produce lower efficiency P-type and M6 cells. Wood Mac analysts expect P-type cells to decline to just 17% of supply by 2026.
