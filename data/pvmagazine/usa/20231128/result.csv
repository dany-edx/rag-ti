Michigan now becomes the 12th state to enact a 100% clean energy mandate.
Whitmer said the clean energy package is expected to add more than 160,000 Michigan jobs. The state had already experienced a 5% boost in clean energy and transportation jobs last year.
Senate Bill 271 outlines the 100% emissions-free mandate, which directs utilities to generate at least 60% of its electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind. Nuclear power, hydrogen fuel, and natural gas paired with carbon capture are eligible to cover the remaining 40%.
While the high renewables penetration is a desirable outcome in the view of environmental advocates, some have argued that the inclusion of natural gas combined with carbon capture is a detriment due to inefficiency and high cost. Juan Jhong-Chung, co-executive director of the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, said that carbon capture technology does not address air pollution associated with burning natural gas.
“What the bill does is actually redefine what counts as clean energy,” Jhong-Chung said. “It’s repackaging natural gas as a clean energy source. To us, 100% clean energy by 2040 is not going to be 100% clean.”
The bills include several clean energy milestone mandates, including:
“Once Michigan’s bill becomes law, a dozen states will have made 100% clean or renewable electricity commitments,” said Johanna Neumann, a senior director with Environment America. “Environment America and our state organizations will continue to campaign for 100% renewable energy commitments from state governments across the country in years to come.”

Th US-based market research company describes China’s current energy transition trajectory as a virtuous circle in a scenario characterized by falling interest rates, low energy costs, and intense price competition.
Analyst Sharon Feng attributes China’s rapid expansion in solar manufacturing and reduction in solar module costs to its large domestic scale and robust export growth, effectively overcoming cost inflation challenges observed in other markets.
“China’s end-user power prices are less than half those in Europe or Australia and this supports a strong competitive edge in global trade,” said report co-author Alex Whitworth. “The China power market is now larger than that of Europe and the US combined, so if it can succeed in transitioning to a high share of intermittent renewables while maintaining stable prices, that would be a historic achievement.”

PV and wind curtailment in China reached 4% in 2022, down from over 10% before 2020, with analysts suggesting a potential increase in curtailment next year but emphasizing it will stay at manageable levels.
China is expected to install approximately 230 GW of new PV and wind capacity this year, surpassing Europe’s 75 GW and 40 GW in the United States. The country is also projected to achieve a cumulative grid-connected energy storage capacity of 67 GW in 2023, with plans to expand to 300 GW by 2030.
The report notes the role of long-distance transmission lines over 1,000 km, unlocking over 100 GW of renewables development in inland China, and points to the design of around 100 GW of flexible plants to support renewable energy backup.
“China’s investment in renewables and support infrastructure in recent years has outstripped what was going into coal power by a factor of 5 to 1,” said Whitworth.  “The share of coal in power generation has been continuously falling, down 10 percentage points in the last five years to about 55% today. About 80% of the reduction was replaced by renewables and the rest mostly by nuclear power.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/28/utility-scale-solar-projects-secure-billions-in-financing/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 28, 2023",Utility-scale solar projects secure billions in financing,"A record 413 GW of solar is expected to be installed in 2023, climbing high above 2022 totals of about 252 GW. This annual growth of installations is projected to continue through 2030, when 727 GW may be installed globally each year, based on BloombergNEF forecasts.
A large chunk of this unprecedented growth in solar capacity will be carried by large utility-scale solar projects that consist of tens of thousands of solar panels. These projects typically require considerable debt financing to move from development to construction. Once completed, the projects typically sell electricity generation via a power purchase agreement, hauling in a return on the debt financing investment over a 25-year period.
Now, with increased demand for solar in state, federal, and corporate clean energy procurement plans, and lucrative incentives made available to U.S. projects through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), utility-scale solar projects are attracting debt financing in droves. Below are three recent large-scale solar financing developments across North America.
Excelsior Energy – $1.3 billion – Utah
Excelsior Energy Capital announced it closed a $1.3 billion financing package on the Faraday Solar project in Utah. The project was acquired earlier this year from Parasol and Clenera.
Faraday Solar is a 682.5 MW solar facility under an investment-grade long-term power purchase agreement. The project will provide its electricity generation to utility PacifiCorp, who will allocate the power to Meta (Facebook.) The project is currently under construction and is expected to enter operations in the third quarter of 2025.
U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance committed $400 million of tax equity through a solar PTC Partnership. A $460 million loan, a $300 million tax equity bridge loan and $250 million in ancillary facilities were financed with MUFG and Nord/LB acting as coordinating lead Arrangers.
“A project of this size requires an enormous amount of collaboration, and we were pleased to work with a talented group of professionals from the Excelsior team to spearhead it,” said Darren Van’t Hof, director of renewable energy investments, U.S. Bancorp.
Primergy – $300 million – Arkansas
Primergy, a leading developer, owner, operator of solar projects, including the 690 MW Gemini solar project in Nevada, announced it has closed commitments for $300 million in debt finance and tax equity investment for a solar project in Arkansas.
The Prairie Mist project is a 100 MW project in Ashley County, Arkansas. It is expected to be completed in 2024, providing enough power to for the equivalent of about 22,000 homes once operational. The project is expected to create 100 local jobs and contribute $10 million in tax benefits for Ashley County.
The project debt financing includes a tax equity bridge loan, construction/term debt, and a letter of credit facility. The debt facilities are led by a syndicate comprising Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, and SMBC. The Prairie Mist financing also includes a tax equity investment led by an affiliate of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
AES – $368 million – Dominican Republic
AES Dominicana raised $368 million in a loan facility for projects in the Dominican Republic. The local arm of AES will construct three projects with a combined capacity of 240 MW, which are expected to come online in 2024.
Spanish developer TSK was selected as developer for the three Peravia solar projects, which will add 240 MW of capacity when complete. This will add significantly to the 742 MW of active solar capacity in the nation as of the end of 2022.
The funds will also be used to refinance debt accrued for 150 MW of wind and solar assets. Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (Bladex) served as joint lead arranger in collaboration with nter-American Development Bank, JP Morgan and Scotiabank.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/28/solar-surging-58-in-2023-413-gw-of-installations-expected-globally/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 28, 2023","Solar surging 58% in 2023, 413 GW of installations expected globally","BloombergNEF has released its updated solar market outlook for 2023, projecting that 413 GW of module capacity will be installed this year. This capacity is largely driven by China’s contribution of 240 GW, along with strong growth in many other global regions.
The quarterly update was provided via Bloomberg’s podcast “Switched On” in the episode, Solar supply glut crushes margins but buildout booming.

If the world does install 413 GW of solar, we will have witnessed a growth of over 58% from the 260 GW installed in 2022, which itself marked an almost 42% increase from the 183 GW installed in 2021. During this two year period, the world will have experienced 125% growth – indicating that a doubling of deployed annual capacity occurred in around one and a half years.
This capacity growth is driven by several factors. Foremost is China, which plays a dual role: by being expected to install 240 GW of capacity, and secondly, through its massive scaling of manufacturing capacity, which has driven the price of solar modules toward $0.10/W.
In the ‘Switched On’ podcast, Jenny Chase, a solar analyst at BloombergNEF, shed light on the dichotomy in the solar industry. While solar capacity installation is surging worldwide, she pointed out that the financial side of solar panel manufacturing is still a tough business. According to Chase, even as manufacturing capacity expands significantly, profit margins for manufacturers are under severe pressure, with module assembly lines operating at only a 60% capacity factor.
Clean Energy Associates has projected that there will be 1 TW of new annual solar panel manufacturing capacity, particularly TOPCon solar cells, located in China alone by the end of 2024 – with over 800 GW of capacity in place as of now. This milestone of 1 TW in annual manufacturing capacity follows closely after the global deployment of solar modules surpassed 1 TW in the winter of 2022.
If our deployment pace is maintained, the world will be on track to reach its second terawatt of solar installations by 2024, achieving this in less than three years – a stark contrast to the approximately 40 years it took to reach the first terawatt.
Commenting on the low module pricing, Chase said:
Right now your standard solar module, in a free trade market, costs 12.8¢/watt. That’s below where anyone thought it would be. That’s below where the experience curve says it should be. I’m having real difficulty constructing the experience curve in a way that makes any sense. I am so surprised. I think it’s because I’ve been watching it for seventeen years, eighteen years now, that I am so surprised.
Globally, the low module pricing is facilitating more capacity installations. In 2022, the United States actually saw a slowdown in total volume deployed, partly due to high hardware costs. In China, these low prices have aided in driving wind and solar “megabases”, which boast capacities of up to 20 gigawatts.
Chase mentioned that in the U.S., high trade barriers and interconnection capacity have slowed installation volumes by increasing module pricing and delaying connections. However, the Inflation Reduction Act has provided support and is expected to have a broad market impact.

Indian manufacturer Waaree Energies Ltd announced this week it has supplied 850 MW of mono PERC solar PV modules to Acciona Energia’s projects under development in the USA, surpassing 4 GW of panel shipments to the US in 2023. 
Waaree said it has also signed a three-year agreement with Acciona Energia to supply 1.5 GW of n-type TOPCon solar modules for Acciona’s additional US projects from 2024 to 2026. “A total of 2.35 GW of order is to be delivered, out of which Waaree Energies has already delivered 850 MW,” announced the company.
Acciona Energia is a Spain-based renewable energy leader that operates more than 1 GW of solar, wind power, and industrial-scale energy storage projects in the US. 
Waaree supplied 850 MW of solar panels for Acciona’s four major solar projects: 56 MW in Fort Bend (Texas); 129 MW in High Point (Illinois); 288 MW in Union (Ohio); and 375 MW in Red Tailed Hawk Solar (Texas). With these deliveries, Waaree has now supplied more than 4 GW of solar modules to customers in the United States in 2023.  
“Waaree delivered the modules four weeks ahead of schedule, enabling Acciona to meet its project commercial operation date timelines. In line with Waaree’s commitment toward ensuring the appropriate standards of product quality and performance, the solar modules supplied for the projects have undergone internal and third-party quality testing,” stated Waaree.
The U.S. solar market has seen an average annual growth of 24% over the past ten years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and that growth is expected to continue. In the first half of 2023, solar comprised 45% of all new generating capacity. 4.4% of single-family homes in the U.S. have solar PV systems installed, and that is expected to grow to 15% by 2030, per an analysis of government research by USA Facts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/28/los-angeles-looks-to-expand-community-solar-to-lower-income-customers/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 28, 2023",Los Angeles looks to expand community solar to lower-income customers,"The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) has published a study identifying strategies to improve equity for disadvantaged communities, as the utility works to reach 100% clean energy by 2035. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) led the study in partnership with the University of California Los Angeles.
Strategies in eight program and infrastructure areas are identified, including strategies affecting rooftop and community solar:
One strategy for bill equity, replacing solar net metering with “net billing,” would reduce “the cost shift from solar adopters (typically higher income) to non-adopters (typically lower income) that occurs with net metering,” the study says. Under net billing, compensation would be set at the utility’s avoided cost of energy at the time solar power is delivered to the grid. The study says the strategy is “foundational” and “high-impact.”
Three community solar or “shared solar” strategies are also seen as high-impact. The first would establish a reduced subscription rate for shared solar for low- and moderate-income (LMI) customers.
The second would substantially expand shared solar capacity at public and multifamily sites with at least 30 kW of economically viable potential, and allocate 50% of new capacity to LMI subscribers.
The third strategy would develop shared solar on as many as 607 multifamily sites in low-income tracts, as identified by NREL, that have at least 30 kW of economically viable solar potential and are eligible for a 50% investment tax credit.
Strategies in five policy and program areas could also improve equity, including workforce development for green jobs, and service panel upgrades for electrification.
Cynthia McClain-Hill, president of LADWP’s board of commissioners, said that community-based organizations led the steering committee for the two-year study, while an advisory committee included subject-matter experts from across city departments as well as the city’s 15 elected councilmembers.
The study team will need to continue working together, McClain-Hill said, as “leading with equity is our only true, beneficial path to our city’s decarbonized tomorrow.”
LADWP has posted the study, titled “LA100 Equity Strategies.” NREL has posted auxiliary materials related to the study.
NREL previously published the “LA100” study which found that LADWP, the nation’s largest municipal water and power utility, can achieve 100% renewable generation by 2035.
A statement from the National Urban League has defined environmental justice as encompassing equal protection from environmental harm, equal employment in the renewable energy industry, and alleviating energy poverty.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/28/mainstreaming-grid-flexibility-to-make-room-for-renewables/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 28, 2023",Mainstreaming grid flexibility to make room for renewables,"The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift from traditional centralized grid networks to decentralized, distributed energy systems. At the same time, the U.S. is experiencing unprecedented grid load and supply growth shaped by ambitious net zero goals, supported by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and federal energy regulations like FERC Order 2222.
This evolution means we’re seeing huge market development and innovation, shown through massive proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), virtual power plants (VPPs), EVs, microgrids, small-scale renewables, distributed energy storage, and demand response solutions. A critical component for our net zero success and ability to modernize the aging grid infrastructure lies in understanding and embracing the concept of grid flexibility.
Challenging the norm
There has been $278 billion announced in new private clean energy investments, and $70B worth of grants, rebates, and other funding since the passing of the IRA. Despite this being a win for renewables, the surge in clean energy projects planned in the U.S. is outpacing the capabilities of many utilities and system operators (SOs), with a backlog of new interconnection requests hindering the process.
For these new low-carbon technologies to connect to the grid quickly and effectively, upgrades are needed to manage their additional impact (i.e., overloading circuits, voltage and frequency deviation) and variable generation patterns. On top of this, total electricity capacity in the U.S. is projected to double by 2050 to meet increasing electrification of industries, including heat and transportation, which leads to more strain on the grid than ever before.
A strategic and coordinated approach to integrate various clean energy solutions into the grid is vital to making space for the surge of renewables and electrification across the country, which is where “grid flexibility” enters the scene.
Defining grid flexibility
Grid flexibility refers to the ability to adapt quickly to changes in electricity supply and demand. Utilities have to continuously manage fluctuations in power generation and demand; flexible solutions, such as energy storage systems, help ensure renewables and new load can come online, while also reliably keeping the power on. For example, when there’s too much power on the system coming through from wind turbines on a gusty day, large-scale energy users could increase their energy usage.
If there’s not enough power, a storage system or aggregation of EVs can discharge to ensure there’s sufficient power coming through. By optimizing the deployment of renewables and DERs, grid operators can enhance the efficiency and resilience of the grid, reduce emissions, and achieve climate goals. Through embracing flexibility, utilities and system operators can also maximize systems already in place, avoiding costly grid upgrades and expensive gas peaking plants which are operated a small percentage of their potential uptime but will be stranded in an electrified future.
Localizing grid flexibility
Grid flexibility is not a new concept. The broad case for energy efficiency and demand response has been proven for decades now, and hundreds of programs are run across the country. However, the applications, types and sizes of DERs have changed dramatically in recent years.
Localized, rather than system-wide, flexibility is a major missing part of the flex equation. An increasingly electrified and decentralized grid will experience significant locational strains. One application for flexibility, non-wires alternatives (NWAs), has been a part of the U.S. energy grid for many years, but these programs are often inefficient, clunky, and not up to the job. But we can learn from the other countries who have already successfully implemented grid flexibility solutions that are easy-to-administer, open up new revenue streams for businesses, and ensure a smarter, more efficient energy system.
Implementing grid flexibility – U.S. case study:
We’re seeing that grid flexibility can lead to significant cost savings for both utilities and consumers. One great example of leveraging local flexibility for the NWA use case is Con Edison’s Brooklyn Queens Demand Management Program, which included energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed resources strategies that resulted in an estimated net benefit of $94.9 million.  We need to build on these learnings and rethink how we incentivize the development of the grid and our energy infrastructure.
Looking to the future
Momentum is building for grid flexibility in the U.S. as the country aims to decarbonize and strengthen domestic energy security, and it’s clear the time has come to establish a flexible, secure, reliable, and environmentally conscious energy system for generations to come. Successfully achieving flexible, sustainable grids will require a focus on localization, innovative market platforms, and coordination across partners to solidify a clean energy future.

John Bayard is chief commercial officer of Piclo, an independent marketplace for energy flexibility services, enabling system operators to source energy flexibility from flexible service providers during times of high demand or low supply.
