Buyers and suppliers in solar and energy storage convene to explore business solutions, new technologies, policy initiatives, and other market factors. Attendees walk away with new understanding of cutting-edge policy, trends, and know-how.  
The week began with a pre-conference overview of the solar conference, dubbed Solar 101. Industry experts led a half day workshop designed for those who are interested in a crash course on the basics of the solar marketplace.  
The conference continued with remarks from Chandra Farley, chief sustainability officer, City of Atlanta, and Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer of SEIA.  
Farley emphatically showed support for renewables in Atlanta, remarking, “We need 100% renewable energy for 100% of Atlantans.”  
The conference ensued with many networking activities, exhibit hall product and service presentations, and insightful panel discussions, some of which are highlighted below. 
Domestic content 
One such discussion was focused on the incentives contained within the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the guidance rolled out for domestic content requirements. Georgia is home to Sen. Jon Ossoff, who originated the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America (SEMA) bill, which was rolled into the IRA.  
The state is also home to solar module manufacturer and panel participant Qcells, which announced an unprecedented $2.5 billion investment in a vertically integrated manufacturing site. Over 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and finished modules will be produced at the site. 
The discussion focused in part on the Internal Revenue Service guidance for the domestic content requirements to receive an additional 10% tax credit on solar projects. Proponents of a strong domestic supply chain argue that the new guidance fell short of expectations, failing to place high enough standards for what is considered domestic content, particularly by setting lax standards at the subcomponent wafer and cell levels in the supply chain. 
Resilience 
The resilience panel highlighted the damages of Winter Storm Eliot, which much like the Winter Storm Uri in Texas, caused great strain on the grid and led to multi-day widespread outages. The panelist remarked that over 6,000 MW of power was imported from the MISO region at a high cost, and about 30% of natural gas plants and 20% of coal plants failed under the extreme weather conditions.  
Distributed solar-plus-storage and increased transmission infrastructure were suggested as improvements to the system to avoid long widespread blackouts in the future. 
“Diversification, diversification, diversification,” suggested Simon Mahan, executive director, Southern Renewable Energy Association. Mahan said that diversifying electricity generation, transmission and especially local distribution, and geographic regions of development will boost the Southeast’s energy resilience. 
Utility Southern Company senior vice president of government affairs, Noel Black suggested transmission as the key to resilience, calling for a “spider web on a spider web” of wiring. To Black, resilience means to “get through it and get back to it.”  
He said that increased transmission infrastructure would be a boon to solar developers, as it would create more points of interconnection and lower costs by bringing those connection points closer to project sites. 
Carolyn Dougherty, analyst and industry strategy, SEPA suggested starting with a microgrid-based approach to boosting resilience. By equipping key assets like water treatment plants, emergency shelters, and hospitals with solar and energy storage microgrids, the most important resources can stay online during tail events like Winter Storm Eliot. Plus, these assets can operate effectively as power supply during “blue sky” conditions, she said. 
“For some, losing power is a minor inconvenience, for others, like those supported by medical devices, it can mean life or death,” said Dougherty. 
Third-party ownership 
Another panel discussed third-party ownership (TPO) for residential and commercial solar projects in the Southeast. The region has typically lagged the rest of the nation in both power purchase agreements and leases for small-scale solar projects. 
This is due in part to laws across the Southeast that prevent such contracts. The leading solar state in the Southeast, Georgia, is the only state that allows for both solar leases and power purchase agreements. Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama allow neither, something that the panel members suggested should change to rooftop solar adoption. 
The panel remarked on how new incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act could open the door for a more robust TPO market in the Southeast. 
Further panel discussions touched on hot topics like sustainable decommissioning tactics, preparing a diverse and inclusive workforce, and enabling electric mobility in the region.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/18/meta-to-power-idaho-data-center-with-200-mw-rplus-solar-project/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,IDAHO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 18, 2023",Meta to power Idaho data center with 200 MW rPlus solar project,"In its continuing quest to power all of its data centers by renewable energy, social media company Meta has moved into the Gem State of Idaho. The operator of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook turned to a Salt Lake City-based project developer to construct what could become the largest utility solar project in Idaho to support its Boise, Id., data operations, at 200 MW of power capacity.
This week project developer rPlus Energies announced the signing of a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with investor-owned utility Idaho Power to install the 200 MW Pleasant Valley Solar project in Ada County, Idaho. Once completed, the utility solar project would be the largest solar farm in the utility’s service territory.
The developer says Pleasant Valley’s construction is expected to utilize local contractors during the construction stage, bringing significant revenue to the area, benefiting local businesses, and bringing in 220 construction workers. Construction on the facility is expected to begin later this year.
“The sunshine is plentiful in Idaho – and we at rPlus Energies are proud to help the state achieve a commonsense approach to energy independence and utilize the abundant energy source to its full potential,” said Luigi Resta, president and chief executive officer of rPlus Energies.
The developer was awarded the Pleasant Valley Solar PPA through a negotiated process with Meta and Idaho Power. The PPA was made possible by an Energy Services Agreement that will allow Meta access to renewables to support its local operations while power also goes to the utility. Pleasant Valley will deliver clean power into the Idaho Power grid and contribute to Meta’s goal of powering 100% of its operations with clean energy.
The developer has retained Sundt Renewables to provide engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services for the Pleasant Valley project. The EPC has experience in the region, and has contracted with rPlus Energies for 280 MW of utility solar projects in neighboring state Utah.
“Meta is committed to minimizing our environmental footprint in the communities where we live and work, and central to this goal is creating, building and running energy-efficient data centers supported by renewable energy,” said Urvi Parekh, head of renewable energy at Meta. “One of the core factors in selecting Idaho for our new data center location in 2022 was access to renewable energy, and Meta is proud to partner with Idaho Power and rPlus Energies to help bring even more renewable energy to the Treasure Valley grid.”
Pleasant Valley Solar will significantly increase the amount of renewable energy on Idaho Power’s system. The utility is actively procuring renewable energy projects towards its goal of generating 100% clean energy by 2045. According to SEIA, as of Q4 2022, the state famed for its potatoes ranked 29th in the U.S. for solar developments, with just 644 MW of total installations.
“Pleasant Valley will not only become the largest solar project on our system, but it’s also an example of how our proposed Clean Energy Your Way program can help us partner with customers to meet their own clean energy goals,” said Lisa Grow, chief executive officer of Idaho Power.
At the recent Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Finance, Tax and Buyers Seminar in New York, Meta’s Parekh said the social media company is seeing a robust 30% compound annual growth rate for the deployment of renewable energy projects that it pairs with its new data center operations.
As of early 2023, Meta  stands as the largest commercial and industrial purchaser of solar power in the U.S., boasting close to 3.6 GW of installed solar capacity. Parekh also revealed that the company has over 9 GW of capacity awaiting development over the coming years, with projects such as Pleasant Valley Solar representing its growing renewables portfolio.
In late 2022, Resta told pv magazine USA the western states developer is actively working on a 1.2 GW development portfolio amid a broader 13 GW multi-year project pipeline that includes solar, energy storage, wind and pumped hydro storage assets.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/18/flirting-with-fossils-the-faux-crusade-for-responsible-solar/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 18, 2023",Flirting with fossils: the faux crusade for ‘responsible solar’,"Susan Ralston, founder of ‘Citizens for Responsible Solar’ (CRS), dons the guise of a grassroots environmentalist, pitching woo and conspiracy theories to authoritarian conservatives eager to impose science-mangling values on local land owners. While appearances can be deceiving, we have uncovered the true nature of CRS’s self-proclaimed ‘responsible’ solar advocacy. Concealed beneath the organization’s veneer of environmental stewardship lies a network of fossil fuel allies, united in opposition to renewable energy initiatives. Solar developers would do well to familiarize themselves with this group and its affiliates to prepare their defenses in town meetings.
NPR recently profiled Ralston’s CRS. Ralston, a seasoned political operative, may be best known for her 2006 resignation from a White House position as executive assistant to Karl Rove. This resignation was prompted by her close association with former longtime boss Jack Abramoff, a lobbyist who defrauded Native American tribes of tens of millions of dollars. Abramoff’s double-dealing led him to confess to three felonies – conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion- landing him a 48- month jail sentence in 2008. Dozens of additional convictions were made against parties associated with Abramoff as a result of the probes into his felonies.
During all of this, Ralston sought immunity in exchange for testimony during these events against her former boss.
Unsurprisingly, Ralston maintains that CRS hasn’t accepted money from fossil fuel interest groups, yet the true source of CRS’s funding is not publicly available. However, NPR notes that any paperwork that goes to CRS must go through a law firm created by Jason Torchinsky. Bloomberg News describes another Torchinsky associated firm as “a boutique outfit that specializes in advising organizations that want to participate in the electoral process without disclosing who’s paying their bills.”
Given this, along with court rulings such as Citizens United, we may never know the true source of CRS’s funding.
It is known, however, that a prominent GOP donor’s foundation, with significant investments in fossil fuel companies, has transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to Ralston’s Washington DC consulting firm while she was establishing CRS.
CRS has had additional dalliances with the fossil fuel industry as well, as evidenced by its hiring of public relations and consulting firm Shirley & Banister Public Affairs. This group has also worked for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes renewable subsidies and maintains ties with several administration officials who deny climate science.
Spotsylvania Solar Power Energy Center
Between 2018 to 2020, pv magazine USA covered the Spotsylvania Solar Power Energy Center multiple times following its initial tentative approval. Unexpectedly, the facility triggered significant backlash, marking one of the first instances of local solar resistance reaching national prominence.   
Energy & Policy reported that Washington D.C. think tanks, with ample fossil fuel funding and a history of climate denial, were participating in Spotsylvania town meetings. Following pv magazine USA’s coverage of the issue, the magazine received a slew of emphatically worded comments and emails on the topic.
One particularly impassioned local commentator emailed the author directly, claiming to have attended every meeting since January, and challenging the source of our information, dismissing it as the “biggest bull” they’d ever heard. The commentator rejects the idea that opposition was funded with money from fossil fuels, maintaining that “the only Cokes at these meetings were given out by SPower, and that was with pizza” as a ploy to encourage youth participation. Accusations flew at reporters for disseminating misinformation based on second-hand accounts, with the commentator describing the community pushback as “grassroots people” composed of Spotsylvania taxpayers.
As it turns out, CRS was among those assisting locals in developing their arguments. Despite the opposition from CRS, the project began partial operation in July 2021.
As CRS expanded beyond Spotsylvania, multiple groups fighting against solar power plants nationwide encountered them. These groups consistently reported that CRS “guided us in the right direction and then helped us with information”.

Source: NPR
Per the NPR illustration above, CRS has appeared in at least 12 states across the nation.
On Reddit, CRS was identified in Kentucky as “Hardin County Citizens for Responsible Solar.” The local who posted on Reddit observed the now standard arguments presented by the ‘responsible solar’ group.
The arguments included:
Interestingly, in late December 2021, Reddit users were able to determine that this Hardin County group was, in fact, a front for the Washington D.C.-based organization.
In the next article on this subject, we will attempt to define the arguments presented by this group in public meetings, and provide authoritative sources that refute them. This will equip solar developers with the necessary tools to prepare and preempt this nationally coordinated, fossil fuel-driven attack on solar power development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/18/electrification-could-cost-california-up-to-50-billion-if-loads-are-not-managed/,"EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 18, 2023",Electrification could cost California up to $50 billion if loads are not managed,"California utilities would need to spend up to $50 billion on power distribution assets by 2035 to accommodate a high level of distributed energy resources, including electric vehicles and electric heating in buildings, if those resources were unmanaged.
That’s the finding of a Phase 1 study conducted by power software and consultancy Kevala, Inc. for the California Public Utilities Commission, to support the CPUC’s High Distributed Energy Resources (High DER) Grid Planning Rulemaking.
The CPUC said in a cover sheet to the study that “it should be noted” that the study estimates the potential costs of meeting infrastructure needs “exclusively with distribution assets, without considering new real-time dynamic rates and flexible load management strategies.”
The CPUC is pursuing dynamic rates that would increase load flexibility, under a separate rulemaking process.
Kevala proposed to assess in a follow-up Phase 2 study “programmatic enhancements” such as time-of-use rate structures, advanced DER controls, flexible load management, and managed DER growth, among other topics.
The study said that higher peak load due to electrification is the “primary driver” of the modeled need for grid capacity upgrades, which suggests that managing the increase in peak load could limit the distribution grid upgrade costs.
Other findings highlighted by Kevala included:
Kevala’s study also made four recommendations for improving the distribution system planning process.
The CPUC Energy Division staff is conducting a stakeholder review process that will invite formal comments on the Part 1 study and the scope of the forthcoming Part 2 study, Kevala reported.
The CPUC said in its cover sheet “it is critical that we receive stakeholder participation” in reviewing the study, including the study’s proposals for future iterations.
Kevala said California’s three large investor-owned utilities provided “voluminous datasets” that enabled it to perform “high-resolution modeling at a scale not achieved before for the State of California.”
The CPUC said the study is “a starting point to open the discussion on how to reimagine distribution grid planning” for the 21st century “and consider the design and implementation of the distribution system needed to accommodate a High DER grid future.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/18/qcells-builds-pilot-line-for-perovskite-silicon-tandem-pv-cells-in-south-korea/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOUTH KOREA",PETRA HANNEN,"MAY 18, 2023",Qcells builds pilot line for perovskite-silicon tandem PV cells in South Korea,"From pv magazine Germany
In November 2022, Qcells and a group of European research institutes in Thalheim, Germany, started a four-year research project to manufacture highly efficient tandem solar cells and modules.
The group established a pilot manufacturing line in Thalheim through the so-called “Pepperoni” (Pilot line for European production of perovskite-silicon tandem modules on industrial scale) project.
The company’s parent, Hanwha Solutions, has also announced plans to invest $100 million in the deployment of a pilot production line for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells at its factory in Jincheon, South Korea, by the end of 2024.
“This investment in Jincheon will mark an important step in securing technological leadership,” stated Qcells CEO Justin Lee. “With global R&D network spanning from Korea, Germany and the U.S., Qcells will ramp up its efforts to produce high-efficiency advanced tandem cells.”
Earlier this year, Germany’s Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin and Qcells presented a tandem cell with up to 29.3% efficiency rate. The results have been certified by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
The device is based on a silicon bottom cell relying on Hanwha Qcells’ monocrystalline Q.antum half cell technology and a perovskite-based top cell.
“This latest record efficiency result, of 28.7%, is an improvement of almost one percentage point compared with the 2020 record value of 27.8%,” the module maker said in a statement. “This boost in tandem efficiency has been enabled by improvement of both the perovskite and the silicon subcells.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/18/the-domestic-content-guidance-loses-sight-of-the-goal-to-invest-in-american-energy-independence/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BATTERY,GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 18, 2023",The domestic content guidance loses sight of the goal to invest in American energy independence,"Last month, as Vice President Harris toured an expanding solar factory in Georgia, she noted the vital connection between domestic manufacturing and deployment in the fight against climate change, saying “When we invest in climate, clean energy, and U.S.-based manufacturing, we invest in America and her people.” She was right to recognize that as we work to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we must simultaneously invest in our independence from foreign adversaries and create good-paying American jobs. Unfortunately, I believe last week’s domestic content bonus credit guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may have lost sight of this critical goal.
For decades we have tried to break our unhealthy dependence on fossil fuels, whose global price is controlled by authoritarian regimes and whose profits fund aggression, most recently the Russian invasion in Ukraine. Again and again, we have seen this dependence on fragile supply chains result in economic destruction, price gouging of consumers, and job losses. But, as Vice President Harris alluded to, the rapidly expanding solar industry represents a way out of this destructive cycle while providing people with fulfilling careers.
To that end, for the first time a coalition of solar manufacturing companies have gotten together to try to break through the barriers in the way of a robust domestic supply chain: the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition. Our mission is to bring home the manufacturing of the entire panel – from cell to wafer to ingot to polysilicon  – so that we are able to produce the cheapest form of new electricity here at home.
Our coalition worked together with champions in Congress such as Senator Jon Ossoff, Representative Dan Kildee, and Chairman Ron Wyden, to include a new tax incentive in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Section 45X . Also known as the advanced manufacturing production tax credit, this provision was designed to provide the certainty necessary to invest billions of dollars in new factories needed for a domestic solar supply chain. This would allow us to finally return to the solar manufacturing  game and compete with countries such as China that have built up such a tremendous lead.
To ensure sustained scale and success, the domestic content bonus was intended by the Congress to supercharge 45X, providing the necessary demand certainty for those factories to remain open and ensure true American clean energy independence. But for this effort to succeed, we need a domestic content standard that would draw distinctions between panels made entirely here and those with imported components.
As it relates to the guidance recently issued from the U.S. Treasury, a few basic principles about the solar supply chain must be understood.
China produces 97% of the world’s solar wafers – giving them substantial control over not only this critical piece of the supply chain, but the polysilicon that goes into producing the wafer. While the bonus released last week was designed to unlock future cell production in the U.S., a number of core components of the solar value chain were excluded. This will result in continued reliance on Chinese imports, many made without the robust labor and environmental standards we have in the United States.
The simple fact is the guidance issued last week will probably result in the scaling back of planned investments in the core, strategic components of the solar value chain. This likely will, unfortunately, cement China’s dominance over the solar industry and put us right back where we are with oil and gas – a price taker in the global marketplace, dependent on someone else to meet our energy needs.
The Administration must take a holistic view of the IRA when implementing the domestic content bonus so that it supercharges 45X and supports Congress’ key policy goal of reshoring the solar value chain. As long as the U.S. does not have an end-to-end solar manufacturing supply chain of all the strategic components of a solar panel, there is more work to be done. The SEMA Coalition remains committed to work with the Administration and Congress to implement policies that can finish the job of fully reshoring the manufacturing of the solar supply chain and creating good-paying American jobs while strengthening our energy and national security.

Mike Carr is the executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America (SEMA) Coalition. He previously served as the principal deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the senior advisor to the director of energy policy and systems analysis at the U.S. Department of Energy from 2012 to 2015.

The Memphis facility, announced by Nextracker and MSS Steel Tubes  USA, will manufacture Nextracker low-carbon steel components, create 129 jobs and generate millions of dollars in local investment, Nextracker reports. Portuguese industrial company Metalogalva Group and Brazilian steelmaker Soufer Group formed MSS Steel Tubes USA to reconfigure a vacant industrial building to manufacture for Nextracker.
“We chose Memphis for our first U.S. plant to support Nextracker’s utility-scale solar demand across the Southeast,” said António Pedro Antunes, CEO of Metalogalva Group. “Memphis has the transportation, infrastructure, and capable workforce necessary to support a solar manufacturing program like this.”
Nextracker’s dedicated tube mill will support Silicon Ranch’s projects in Kentucky, South Carolina, Virginia, Mississippi, and Georgia. Last year Nextracker and Silicon Ranch announced a 1.5 GW supply agreement, and the two companies are now announcing an additional 3 GW agreement.
The two companies share a commitment to increase domestic supply and to implement lower-carbon production processes. The emphasis on securing American-made products enables the companies to support U.S. manufacturing and job creation, improve the carbon footprint of its supply chain, and reduce volatility and logistics risks.
Products produced by this facility are also expected to qualify for the 10% adder under the new IRS guidelines that state that steel products must be 100% U.S.-made. Nextracker indicated that the facility will be using 100% green, American-made EAF steel by the end of this year. EAF steel is made in electric arc furnaces, a “next-generation” process for steel fabrication, which can lead to electric arc furnace facilities being up to 75% less carbon-intensive than traditional blast furnaces.
“Nextracker’s new Tennessee tube mill not only helps us maintain our 100% track record for successful project delivery but also enables us to support additional investments in American manufacturing while lowering carbon production processes of our supply chain, and reducing volatility and logistics risks, all from our home state,” said Reagan Farr, co-founder and CEO of Silicon Ranch.
“This is what energy security looks like: New U.S. manufacturing jobs using American-made steel to produce affordable clean energy,” said Dan Shugar, Founder and CEO of Nextracker. “Customers want domestic, low-carbon technologies like solar power. We are excited to inaugurate a new dedicated Nextracker manufacturing line in Memphis with MSS Steel Tubes USA, and to continue to team with Silicon Ranch with a new 3 GW multi-year agreement to provide the Tennessee Valley and greater Southeast with our high performing systems.”
Nextracker and MSS Steel Tubes reently dedicated the steel tube line in partnership with Silicon Ranch. The event was attended by Tennessee Commissioner of Economic Development, Stuart McWhorter, Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and David Burritt, CEO of U.S. Steel.

Canadian Solar manufactures solar modules in Canada, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil.
Net revenues of $1.7 billion in Q1 2023 were also a 36% yearly increase from $1.25 billion a year ago, in line with the recent guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for Q1 2023.
“We started off the year strong with 36% year-over-year revenue growth and 750% increase in diluted earnings per share. We continue to leverage our premium brand to capture increased solar and battery storage opportunities, while laying the groundwork for future success with strategic capacity expansion,” said Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and chief executive officer, Canadian Solar.
CSI Solar, which consists of Canadian Solar’s module, battery storage manufacturing, inverters, solar system kits and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) businesses, is planning to list more than 540 million shares on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, an index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The mainly residential storage and inverter business is reportedly close to concluding the IPO by the end of Q2 2023.
“We remain focused on profitable growth and continue to optimize our cost structure through vertical integration. With the imminent IPO of our CSI Solar subsidiary, we will have a new platform to raise investment capital and further strengthen our leading position in solar and battery storage manufacturing,” Qu said.
Recurrent Energy, the integrated company’s project development business, operated a global project development pipeline of 24.6 GW, which includes 1.7 GW of projects in construction, 17.7 GW of early- to mid-stage projects, and 5.2 GW of backlog projects.
At March 31, 2023, Recurrent had 609 MW of operating solar projects and 280 MWh of storage projects, with a net resale value of approximately $700 million for the solar projects. The company saw a 24% decrease in its operating portfolio year-over-year due to project divestments.
Business outlook
For Q2 2023, Canadian Solar expects total revenue of between $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. Total module shipments are expected to be in the range of 8.1 GW to 8.4 GW.
For the full year 2023, the company reiterated its prior outlook for total module shipments of 30 GW to 35 GW. Its battery storage shipments are expected to be in the range of 1.8 GWh to 2.0 GWh.
The company increased its full year revenue guidance to $9.0 billion to $9.5 billion from a prior range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion.
“We expect significant revenue and profit growth in the second quarter driven by both higher volume in solar module shipments and project sales. In the CSI Solar segment, volume growth is picking up while costs continue to come down, albeit partially offset by gradual average selling price (ASP) declines,” Qu said.
Recurrent Energy expects to close “a major project sale” during Q2 2023, which will have a positive impact on profit, Qu added.
Recent highlights
On April 11, Canadian Solar announced CSI Solar’s capacity expansion plans. CSI Solar intends to have 20.4 GW of ingot, 35 GW of wafer, 50 GW of cell and 50 GW of module capacities by the end of 2023 and is expected to have 50.4 GW of ingot, 50 GW of wafer, 60 GW of cell and 75 GW of module capacities by the end of Q1 2024.
On April 10, Canadian Solar announced the rebranding of its wholly-owned global energy subsidiary as Recurrent Energy. Recurrent Energy, previously the company’s North American utility-scale solar and energy storage project developer, will now include all of Canadian Solar’s global development and services businesses.
Canadian Solar, based in Guelph, Ontario, traded at $38.72 per share today, up 35% from $28.76 per share a year ago, with a current $2.5 billion market capitalization.
