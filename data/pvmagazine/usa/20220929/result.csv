Jupiter Power LLC is a U.S.-based developer and operator of utility-scale, battery energy storage systems (BESS). Energy Vault Holdings is a specialist in sustainable, grid-scale energy storage solutions.
“Due to our team’s hard work developing new energy storage projects from California to Maine over the last several years, Jupiter is uniquely positioned to lead now in making the Inflation Reduction Act’s vision of large-scale domestic battery systems manufacturing jobs a reality,” said Andy Bowman, Jupiter Power’s CEO. “We are very pleased to be expanding our relationship with Energy Vault to grow our supply of the equipment the grid critically needs today while also supporting sustainable battery equipment manufacturing here at home.”
The companies plan to collaborate on securing 2.4 GWh of supply chain equipment and services that will be integrated and delivered through Energy Vault’s hardware and software management platform in Jupiter Power’s battery energy storage projects in U.S. electric markets including ERCOT, MISO, CAISO, PJM, NYISO, and ISO-NE. The projects are expected to reach commercial operations in 2024 and 2025.
Under the agreement, Energy Vault will focus on maximizing U.S. localization and deployment of energy storage equipment that will qualify for Domestic Content Bonus Credit. The plan is for Jupiter Power to collaborate in siting new domestic manufacturing facilities, where possible, by using assets secured for future Jupiter Power projects across the country. Again, motivated by bonus credit from the IRA, at least some of the facilities will be in “Energy Communities”, such as brownfield sites, former coal sites and economically disadvantaged areas.
“We are excited to continue our strategic relationship with Jupiter Power, which enables us to leverage our technology platform while maximizing U.S. content for near-term deployments in critical energy storage projects,” said Marco Terruzzin, chief commercial officer, Energy Vault. “Energy Vault is laser focused on its customers’ needs with a commitment to continuous innovation, allowing this agreement to serve as a gateway for realizing the intent of the Inflation Reduction Act in rapidly bringing energy storage localization to the U.S.”
The letter of intent agreement follows previously announced agreements between Jupiter Power and Energy Vault for BESS projects in Texas and California totaling 220 MWh, under which Energy Vault will supply a 100 MW (200 MWh) battery energy storage system at a Jupiter Power Facility near Fort Stockton, Texas, and additionally construct and commission.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/29/utility-scale-developer-to-recycle-95-of-value-of-end-of-life-solar-panels-with-solarcycle/,"SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Utility-scale developer to recycle 95% of value of end-of-life solar panels with SolarCycle,"Silicon Ranch Corporation, developer of solar and energy storage and independent power producer, announced it entered an agreement with SolarCycle to recycle end of life solar modules for re-entry into the supply chain. SolarCycle said it recovers roughly 95% of the value of a panel in its process.
SolarCycle, launched earlier this year, is currently establishing a new panel recycling center, aimed at maximizing material reuse for the creation of a circular economy. The center is expected to open Q4.
Research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that by 2040, for key materials, recycling can meet 25-30% of domestic solar manufacturing needs in the United States. The recycling partnership will help fuel the supply chain by returning glass, silicon, silver, copper aluminum, and other key materials to manufacturing facilities.
NREL said solar panel waste could cumulatively be as high as 1 million metric tons by 2030 and 10 million metric tons be 2050. This represents a looming problem yet to be fully addressed by the industry, but also offers a great opportunity. Rystad Energy estimates that recyclable materials from PV panels at the end of their lifespan will be worth more than $2.7 billion in 2030, up from $170 million this year, and the value may approach $80 billion by 2050.
Rystad estimates peak solar energy implementation in 2035 of 1.4 TW, by which time the recycling industry should be able to supply 8% of the polysilicon, 11% of the aluminum, 2% of the copper, and 21% of the silver needed by recycling solar panels installed in 2020 to meet the material demand. The result will be increased ROI for the solar industry, an enhanced supply chain for materials, as well as a reduction in the need for carbon intensive mining and refinery processes.
Silicon Ranch has a 5 GW portfolio of solar and battery storage systems that are contracted, under construction, or operational across the U.S. and Canada. The company operate more than 145 solar facilities across 15 states. The agreement marks a significant step for SolarCycle, as Silicon Ranch is its first utility-scale customer.
“As the long-term owner of every project in our portfolio, we at Silicon Ranch are deeply committed to our relationships and responsibilities in the communities we serve. These responsibilities include end-of-life equipment management,” said Reagan Farr, Silicon Ranch president and CEO. “This partnership supports our commitments to advance domestic solar manufacturing, a circular solar economy, and economic development opportunities in communities across the country. We encourage others in the industry to join us in this meaningful endeavor.”
NREL said there are a lack of incentives or penalties in the U.S. today to encourage recycling. NREL analysts modeled a current average recycling cost of $28 per module, repairs at $65 per module, and landfills at only $1.38 per module. Used modules could be sold at 36% of new module prices.
Based on those figures, the analysts estimated that over the next 30 years, 80% of modules will be landfilled, 1% reused, and 10% recycled.
The NREL study showed that a reduced recycling cost would add a significant boost in adoption. Lowering the cost per module from $28 to $18, for example, could potentially lead to an increase in the recycling rate by more than one-third by 2050.
Higher material recovery rates also would drive adoption. New processes that recover high value materials like silver, copper, and silicon for reuse could create a recycler cumulative net income of $1.3 billion by 2050, said NREL.
As for Silicon Ranch and SolarCycle, the agreement marks a significant step on the way to bringing U.S. solar panel recycling capacity and efficiency to maturity.
“SolarCycle’s team is taking what we learned in the solar, sustainability, and recycling industries and applying it to our tech-driven recycling solutions. We know that scale matters in order to be able to drive costs down and bring quality up,” said Suvi Sharma, CEO and co-founder of SolarCycle.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/29/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last-2/,"QUALITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. 
The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).
In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
In a string inverter, there is generally less complicated wiring and a centralized location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. Inverters can typically cost 10-20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10-15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from 5-10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.

Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Usually, these inverters have a 20–25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components are designed to last for 20-25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
A study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, residential installer Those Solar Guys recommended choosing a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. It also suggested avoiding installing in areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
Those Solar Guys said it is best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. Inspections typically cost $200-$300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20-25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next installment of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/29/standard-solar-and-scout-clean-energy-acquired-by-brookfield-renewable/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MAINE,MARYLAND,MINNESOTA,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Standard Solar and Scout Clean Energy acquired by Brookfield Renewable,"Brookfield Renewable has agreed to acquire Standard Solar and Scout Clean Energy, helping both renewable energy leaders to move into the next phase of their development.
Brookfield Renewable announced the closing of its acquisition of Standard Solar for consideration of $540 million with the potential to invest an additional $160 million to support the business’ growth initiatives. Standard Solar is a developer, owner and operator of commercial and community distributed solar, with approximately 500 MW of operating and under construction contracted assets. The company also has a development pipeline of almost 2 GW and a presence in high value solar markets in the U.S., such as New York, Maryland, Minnesota and Maine. Standard Solar is also strong in the community solar market, recently completing a 7.1 MW project in New York.
“Through this acquisition, which provides additional large-scale access to capital, Standard Solar is poised for massive growth, enabling us to contribute in an even more significant way to the clean energy transition,” said Scott Wiater, president and CEO of Standard Solar. “We’re looking forward to joining the Brookfield Renewable portfolio, one of the world’s largest renewable energy platforms. Our two companies share a mutual passion for renewables and company cultures that recognize and amplify excellence and equity – we are the ideal match.”
The company has also agreed to acquire Scout Clean Energy for $1 billion with the potential to invest an additional $350 million to support the business’ development activities. Scout’s portfolio includes over 1.2 GW of operating wind assets, including 4 GW managed on behalf of third parties, and a pipeline of over 22 GW of wind, solar and storage projects across 24 states, including almost 2.5 GW of under construction and advanced-stage projects. Last year Scout Clean Energy acquired the $400m Blue Sky Project, which followed closely on the heels of the company’s announced purchase of a 112 MW solar project in Missouri.
“Scout is pleased to be sponsored going forward by an industry-leading partner to help Scout continue to grow our rapidly expanding pipeline of wind, solar and battery storage projects across the United States,” said Michael Rucker, CEO and founder of Scout Clean Energy. “With the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we believe now is the right time for Scout to move into our next phase of expansion with a highly respected and experienced partner, like Brookfield Renewable.”
Both Scout and Standard Solar will continue to operate as independent businesses within the Brookfield Renewable U.S. platform. The transactions will be invested through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I, which has raised $15 billion to invest across a range of transition opportunities.
“We underwrote both transactions without the benefit of the Inflation Reduction Act so the additional incentives now available represent a significant boost to each business,” said Connor Teskey, CEO of Brookfield Renewable. “Our development pipeline in the United States is now close to 60,000 MW and is well diversified across wind, utility-scale solar, distributed generation, and energy storage. Combined with our existing fleet we are well positioned for continued growth as owners and operators of one of the largest diversified clean power businesses in the country.”
The Scout and Standard Solar acquisitions follow a string of recent clean energy investments by Brookfield Renewable in North America during 2022, including a $650 million acquisition of Urban Grid, and the exclusive right to invest up to $750 million on a project by project basis with Entropy, and a joint venture with California Resource Corporation, two leading carbon capture and sequestration platforms in Alberta and California, respectively. Altogether, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund has invested or allocated $3.5 billion for clean energy investments and follow-on capital in North America in 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/29/solis-highlights-backup-and-repowering-solutions-at-re/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,NORTH AMERICA",ECKHART GOURAS,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Solis highlights backup and repowering solutions at RE+,"pv magazine caught up with the U.S. team of the inverter manufacturer Ginlong Technologies (doing business in the U.S. under the “Solis” brand) at the Solis booth at last week’s RE+ trade show in Anaheim, California. According to Terence Parker, Senior Application Engineer at Solis U.S., the ample provision of backup power is becoming an important requirement for many households in the U.S.  Solis now offers a “whole home solution power hub” to provide power to every device in the home in the event of an outage.
Parker is a veteran of the U.S. solar energy market and the Chinese manufacturer provides a wide range of solutions to not only the residential market, but also to the C&I and utility-scale segments. In the residential market, the severe multi-day outage in Texas in February 2021 brought home the need to be more prepared in severe weather events. PV is ideally suited to provide rooftop generation to households, but in cases of grid outages, conventional grid-tied PV systems are not sufficient to provide power to these homes. What is needed is adequate battery storage and an inverter that can island the home from the electricity grid.

But Solis is going even further than that. Parker describes the conventional backup solution that provides power to a critical load panel, with only loads connected to this panel receiving backup power in an outage.  At RE+ Solis presented their “whole home solution power hub” that aggregates Solis inverters to supply not only critical home loads with electricity. Adequate battery storage is obviously required as well and here too modular components can be stacked together to provide the punch in case the grid drops away.
The whole home solution power hub cannot only integrate PV generation, but also other sources of power, including conventional backup generators that fire up when all else fails. In the typical whole home backup system, the conventional generator is connected to the Solis Powerhub, which in turn is connected to the Solis Residential Hybrid Storage Inverter. The power range for this solution goes from 3.8 kW to 11.4 kW. Six inverter models cover this range and all six are referred to as S6-EH1P(3.8-11.4)K-H-US in the Solis product catalog. Each inverter is stackable up to ten inverters in parallel, providing ample power in case of need. Up to 80 kWh of storage capacity can be provided per inverter and the Solis S6 inverter is UL 9540 certified to work with multiple battery brands.
Efficient performance is ensured by a maximum PV input current up to 16A per string along with a high DC to AC ratio of 1.6 for more PV power capacity. A single S6 can generate up to 50A/11.4 kW of continuous backup power and the transfer time is below 10ms for all backed up loads. Finally, DC to DC battery charging provides for optimal utilization of PV generated electricity.
At RE+ Solis also showcased its C&I and utility-scale solutions and here too, Solis provides a wide range of output from 25 kW to 100 kW and for the largest projects 125 kW to 255 kW. Parker pointed to an expansion of this range to 350 kW in the near future as PV power plants in the U.S. continue to gain in size. Parker also points to the unique 75 to 100 kW product that occupies a niche that other inverter manufacturers have not addressed. The S5-GC(75-100)K-US inverter series boasts up to 10 MPPTs with a maximum efficiency of 98.8% (CEC efficiency 98.3%). The MPPT voltage range stands at 180-1000V.
Just as backup power has become an important application in the U.S. and other countries, repowering has emerged as an attractive opportunity in mature PV markets like North America. Inverters need to be swapped out to boost the performance of older plants and Solis’ wide range of highly efficient inverters provides the right recipe to retrofit these older systems with a wide range of operating voltages and input currents. Finally, Solis has developed AI technology to further boost the performance in repowering scenarios.
