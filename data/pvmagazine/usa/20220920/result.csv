Competitors can be individuals of one or multiple organizations, students, university faculty members, small business owners, researchers, or anyone residing in the U.S. who has the desire and drive to transform an idea into solution with impact. Competitors may seek support through members of the American-Made Network, our innovation engine of more than 250 organizations, including world-class experts at the U.S. Department of Energy’s 17 national labs, clean tech accelerators, incubators, universities, facilities, and more.
The program includes three prize competitions, called the Ready!, Set!, and Go! Contests. In the Ready! Contest teams focus on innovative ideas that will address a solar industry technology need, proving that they have developed a great team, a game-changing solution, and a plan. In the Set! Contest, teams begin developing and demonstrating early-stage proofs-of-concept. And in the Go! Contest, teams try to prove that their solutions work, and they must show substantial progress throughout the contests. work and they have made substantial progress over the course of the contests.
In April, the DOE announced the 20 finalist teams chosen after they pitched their concepts for during Set! Demo Day events.
“The innovations we see from competitors in the American-Made Solar Prize each year are incredibly inspiring,” said Garrett Nilsen, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office. “And we need all innovators now more than ever if we’re going to expand solar’s accessibility to Americans and meet our net-zero goals. Congratulations to these teams, and we look forward to seeing where they can take their products.”
The Solar Prize has always placed an emphasis on manufacturing solar innovation, but after four successful rounds focused primarily on tangible technologies, prize administrators saw the need to split the fifth round into two tracks: the Hardware Track and the Software Track. Competitors in the Hardware Track are focused on designing a physical component, manufacturing process, or producible product that benefits the solar industry. Software Track Teams are targeting communications, computation, data systems, information technology, or business models with a software focus that help accelerate solar power implementation. Teams in the Software Track can also opt to participate in the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Contest, which focuses on advancing solar adoption in underserved communities, for additional cash prizes.
The latest round, Round 5, launched last summer and teams submitted their initial concepts in October. The competitor pool was reduced to 40 semifinalists in December, after which teams began work on revising and refining their innovations in preparation for Set! Demo Day, where they shared their progress with expert reviewers. Hardware Track teams were asked to show progress in developing and demonstrating early-stage proofs of concept, while Software Track teams were required to demonstrate minimum viable products.
The 10 Hardware Track finalists were each awarded $100,000 in cash prizes and $75,000 in support vouchers to use at national laboratories and other partner facilities to continue advancing their innovation from proof of concept to prototype. Software Track finalists received $60,000 each, and three teams received an additional $33,333 for winning the optional JEDI Contest. The finalist teams will now move on to compete in the final stage of the competition, the Go! Contest.
Solar Prize Round 5 finalist teams:
Hardware Track
Software Track
The 20 finalists will present their technologies one last time at Go! Demo Day this September. Ultimately, only two teams in each track will win the final prize, each receiving even larger cash prizes and support vouchers to help them bring their technology to market. The Pitch Showcase will take place at RE+ in Anaheim on Sept. 20 from 2 to 3:30 p.m. in the Grid Edge Theater. By pitching their technologies to the solar industry, these final teams compete for part of a $1.4 million prize. The winner will be announced on Sept. 20 from 5 to 6 p.m.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/20/are-we-educating-enough-power-system-engineers-for-the-renewables-transition/,"EMPLOYMENT,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Are we educating enough power system engineers for the renewables transition?,"Seeking to clear backlogs of solar projects awaiting interconnection across the U.S., key industry players have raised the issue of the number of staff working on interconnection studies. The national solar trade group SEIA has called on regional transmission providers and utilities to add staff to “extricate hundreds of gigawatts” of solar projects from interconnection queues.
Two regional grid operators have flagged a shortage of qualified engineers to conduct interconnection studies, and an executive at an engineering consulting firm has said that U.S. universities are not graduating enough power system engineers—that is, electrical engineers whose education included a focus on power grids.
To explore the supply and demand for power system engineers, we interviewed an engineering school leader and two regional grid operators, and accessed survey data and forecasts.
View from Worcester
The electric utility industry is largely beyond a wave of retiring “baby boomer” engineers, as the Center for Energy Workforce Development expects 27% of engineers in the U.S. electric and gas industries to retire in the next 10 years, based on a survey of its utility members. That’s about the long-term average percentage that would be expected for staff members working for 40 years before retirement.
Even so, “a new challenge has emerged,” as the power grid “is becoming more complex, making it more challenging to design and operate,” said Michael Ahern, director of power systems at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in an interview.
Ahern, as leader of the institute’s Academic and Corporate Engagement group, hears concerns from leaders of New England utilities and the region’s grid operator “about their many open positions for power engineers,” he said. Utilities regularly ask for his assistance “with their initiatives to attract additional qualified candidates for open positions,” he added.
WPI offers an undergraduate electrical and computer engineering degree with a focus on power systems, and an online master’s program in power engineering.
National picture
Regarding demand nationwide, Ahern pointed to the Center for Energy Workforce Development’s forecast that U.S. electric and gas utilities will potentially need 6,500 engineers through 2026 to replace those retiring, plus non-retirement attrition.
U.S. universities awarded about 17,000 bachelor’s degrees and 12,000 master’s degrees in electrical engineering or electrical/computer engineering in 2018, according to a report from the American Society for Engineering Education. The report, which tracked 393 bachelor’s programs and 278 graduate programs, does not break out data for degrees with a power engineering specialization.
A master’s degree in electrical engineering with a focus on power systems is typically a prerequisite to begin conducting interconnection studies, according to Kalyan Chilukuri, an executive with engineering consulting firm Electric Power Engineers.
The electric power industry in the U.S. employed 17,800 electrical engineers in 2021, at an average salary of $109,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, slightly higher than the average of $102,000 for all electrical and electronics engineers. The bureau projects that across all industries, total employment for these engineers will rise just 3% over the next 10 years.
Regional grid operator hiring plans
California’s grid operator CAISO employs more than 30 power system engineers, of which about 20 help to perform interconnection studies, said a spokesperson. CAISO expects to hire 3-4 power system engineers in the next 12 months, to replace the same number who retire or resign.
CAISO’s level of staffing enabled the grid operator to complete full interconnection studies for 5 GW of solar projects in 2021. CAISO is now processing a larger cluster of interconnection requests, for which it will release full interconnection studies in late 2023.
The grid operator SPP, serving the central U.S., employs 149 power system engineers, of which eight work exclusively on interconnection studies, said a spokesperson. SPP also works with several consulting firms to help with interconnection studies. SPP expects about 10 power system engineers to retire or resign within the next year, and expects to hire about 30 new engineers, based on vacancy rates and expected growth.
The Texas grid operator ERCOT, which completed full interconnection studies for 14 GW of solar projects last year, did not disclose its power systems engineering staffing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/20/u-s-solar-tariffs-caused-a-year-of-uncertainty-the-nation-could-now-pivot-to-a-domestic-supply-chain/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Solar tariffs caused a year of uncertainty; could a US-based supply chain help?,"Over the last year, the threat of tariffs has been one of the most significant headwinds in the deployment of solar in the United States. While antidumping (AD) and anti-circumvention (CVD) tariffs on solar goods have been paused, supply threats from other international trade enforcement still loom.
About 80% of the US supply of crystalline silicon solar modules come from four Southeast Asian nations: Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. Over the last year, suppliers with operations in these nations have come under investigation for suspected AD/CVD violations by harboring tariff-dodging Chinese solar goods.
The original AD and CVD investigations on imports of crystalline silicon PV products were launched in November 2011. The US International Trade Commission determined that domestic producers were being materially hurt by the imports, and the Commerce Department in December 2012 imposed import tariffs. In 2019, the department extended both import tariff orders.
Tariffs related to AD/CVD violations have historically been high. The current AD rate for Chinese companies found in violation can reach 238.95% of the cost of goods. Dating back to 2012, solar tariffs on Chinese antidumping have ranged from less than 1% to over 100%. In 2017-18, major suppliers Trina Solar were 92.5%, Risen Energy 100.79%, Canadian Solar 95.5%, JinkoSolar 95.5%. With this threat in mind, the US solar industry paid close attention to two major AD/CVD cases that proceeded through the last year.
A-SMACC
The first round of potential tariffs was launched by an anonymous group of players in the US solar industry called the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC). The group filed a petition with the US Department of Commerce, stating that Chinese solar products in violation of tariff law, “hobbled the US industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
The petition alleged Chinese integrated producers started building cell and module assembly plants in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, while continuing “to rely heavily” on Chinese labor, raw materials, and inputs. It said “Chinese producers have developed a circumvention scheme” that involves moving the end of the production process for CSPV products to a third country “for the express purpose of avoiding AD/CVD duties.”
In November 2021, the anonymous A-SMACC petition was thrown out by Commerce. AD/CVD Director Abdelali Elouaradia said that “not disclosing A-SMACC members’ names publicly hampers interested parties from fully commenting on the requests for circumvention inquiries and may hamper them from commenting on certain issues that could arise if commerce were to initiate circumvention inquiries.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the US Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), celebrated commerce’s decision, stating that it “provides a rush of certainty for companies to keep their investments moving, hire more workers and deploy more clean energy.”
Auxin Solar
However, the United States’ market was not in the clear yet, as another major AD/CVD case began in February 2022. This time, a small US-based panel assembler Auxin Solar filed a petition that added Cambodia to the other three nations previously under scrutiny. At the time, Roth Capital Partners said the new petition “cures all the deficiencies” of the A-SMACC filing.
Shortly after the filing, George Hershman, the CEO of Solv Energy, which is among the largest project developers in the United States, said “deployment is frozen.” Solv’s projects can exceed $300 million, so a 50% to 250% tariff would impose between $75 million to $375 million in additional costs. This level of risk is untenable and is the reason why Hershman described the case as “an affront to the solar industry.”
Even before the investigation was accepted by commerce, the chilling effect of potential tariffs was felt, as supply began to dry up and projects were either canceled or delayed. In March 2022, Commerce announced it accepted the petition, and would move forward with the investigation.
The petitioner Auxin Solar celebrated the decision. “For years, Chinese solar producers have refused to fairly price their products in the U.S. and have gone to significant lengths to continue undercutting American manufacturers and workers by establishing circumventing operations in countries not covered by those duties. Fair trade and enforcement of our trade laws are essential to rebuilding the American solar supply chain and making Solar in America again.”
However, a large portion of the US solar industry was quite displeased with the decision to commence. “The solar industry is still reeling from a similar tariff petition that surfaced last year,” said Ross Hopper. “The mere threat of tariffs altered the industry’s growth trajectory and is one of the reasons why we’re now expecting a 19% decline in near-term solar forecasts.”
SEIA later cut its forecast even further, estimating a 46% drop from initial deployment projections for 2022.
Uncertain times
Three months of uncertainty followed the announcement of the commerce investigation, bringing project delays and cancellations, sharply declining module supply, steeply increasing shipping costs, and Covid-19 related production shutdowns in China.
Congressman Scott Peters of California addressed the issue at the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on April 28, delivering the message to Secretary Jennifer Granholm of the Department of Energy (DOE).
“This case could cost us 100,000 American solar jobs and jeopardize our common clean energy goals,” said Peters. “Already 318 projects are being cancelled or delayed, and if the administration decides to impose tariffs, it could cause solar capacity to fall 75 GW short of the pace needed to reach the President’s solar goal.”
On June 5, the Biden administration announced a 24-month tariff exemption, alleviating some of the near-term supply chain pressures and reopening PV panel supply. Commerce is still investigating the case, but no tariffs will be levied under that time frame if violations are found. Projects that were considered all but cancelled have since resumed as a result.
Wood Mackenzie analysis concluded that though this has created clarity for the near-term, tariff implementation is still viewed as “high risk” by tax equity investors despite the two-year pause. The firm said developers should expect to continue seeing high costs of capital and high barriers to entry as a result.
The effect of the investigation was exponential, said Wood Mackenize, as weeks of inactivity led to months in delays. Development firms had already begun reallocating machinery and personnel to non-energy projects, leading to a spike in labor shortages for near term projects.
WoodMac said that resuming talks for canceled and delayed utility-scale solar projects that were pushed to 2023 and 2024 may result in about 30% to 40% of these projects being installed earlier.
Altogether, the analyst increased its guidance for deployment this year, with an expected 1.5 GW boost, about 17%, to utility-scale PV in 2022, and about a 3 GW increase in deployment projections for 2023.
New strategy?
Though the Biden administration pressed pause on solar tariffs for two years, it appears the administration may be targeting a new strategy to reduce the reliance on imported Chinese solar components. Concurrent with the pause on tariffs, the Administration passed the Defense Production Act, a World War II-era law designed to boost domestic manufacture and procurement of goods that are needed on an emergency basis.
Aaron Bates, CEO of US module manufacturer Toledo Solar, said that global supply chains were already brittle, and that even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, concerns were being raised about the sustainability and security of sourcing the vast majority of the components deployed in pursuit of the energy transition from foreign nations.
“Everything we source in our supply chain is within a 300-mile radius of our facility,” said Bates. This kind of supply chain leads to price stability with no tariff risk and low shipping costs, as well as higher transparency and lower carbon intensity than solar goods shipped from China.”
Though China is building massive amounts of solar capacity, the nation also brought online as many as 47 coal plants last year. That’s more coal plants that have been brought online than the rest of the world combined retired last year.
Differences in labor conditions are also relevant when considering a strategy of imports versus made-in-USA products. Last December, the US government unanimously passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) that bans all imports from the Xinjiang region of China, over allegations of forced labor practices. The region supplies 50% of the world’s polysilicon.
The UFLPA places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the region are made with forced labor, and it places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever.
“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.
One way that the US is planting the roots of a new domestic supply chain is through legislation. This August, the landmark bill called the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was signed into law. It contains a record $370 billion in spending for climate and energy. Very significant direct incentives, similar to the ones found in the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America (SEMA) bill, are placed on US-made solar goods across the supply chain. The law is expected to usher in a new decade of rapid solar buildout, buoyed by demand-side incentives, a decade of tax credits, research and development funding, production credits, and incentives designed to address environmental justice.

Scientists at Mälardalen University in Sweden have developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that facilitates the analysis of microclimates in vertical PV projects.
“Models of agrivoltaic (AV) systems will become frequently used for new AV system designs as well as decision-making as you can analyze/predict the microclimatic changes dependent on location and AV system solution,” researcher Sebastian Zainalli told pv magazine.
CFD simulations are used to solve complex equations about the flow of solids and gases through and around bodies, which can be used to analyze microclimates within agrivoltaic systems. The model was built using Solidworks computer-aided design software.
The researchers looked at a vertical agrivoltaic system with 30 bifacial monocrystalline PV modules with an east-west orientation in Västerås, Sweden. The system consists of three rows with 10 meters between them, where pasture grass is grown.
The scientists gathered data on the ambient temperature, global and diffuse horizontal radiation, and wind with four different sensors. They used a thermal camera to measure the temperature of the modules.
The CFD model showed PV module temperate estimation errors in the order of 0 C to 2 C, and ground temperature errors in the order of 0 C to 1 C.
“The vertical bifacial PV module temperature is hard to measure as you cannot easily put a sensor onto the module as it would create hotspots. Therefore, hourly thermal camera readings have been used to get an accurate comparison,” Zainali explained. “The model’s estimation errors are more accurate than the measured vertical bifacial PV module temperature obtained with monofacial reference cells on the rear and front sides due to differences in characteristics compared to the bifacial module.”
They also considered soil temperature to validate the CFD model. They claim the model correctly predicts that soil temperature slowly increases during the day.
“The CFD model had a temperature error of less than 1 C and it could be seen that the increase in temperature is extremely similar to measured data during the day,” said Zainali.
The results also show that the incident solar irradiance estimates from the CFD model are similar to those measured in Västerås, but the model generally underestimates the peak solar irradiance in cloudy weather conditions. The academic also observed a 38% decrease in solar radiation intensity in the ground areas shaded by the vertical PV modules.
“From these validations, we can see that our developed model has similar microclimatic variation as measurements,” Zainali said, noting that the model can be adapted to study other agrivoltaic systems designs and geographical locations. He noted that it is possible to analyze installations with fixed structures and trackers, although the latter adds more complexity to the modeling and therefore requires more time to be studied.
