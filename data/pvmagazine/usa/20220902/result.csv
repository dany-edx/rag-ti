Funds were provided by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and KeyBank N.A. The funding coincides with the one-year anniversary of Arevon’s launch.
The two-year facility has an innovative hybrid borrowing base, consisting of uncalled capital with an additional net asset value component. Stoel Rives represented Arevon as legal counsel and Mayer Brown served as lender counsel.
“The scale of this capital reaffirms Arevon’s place in the finance community as one of the fastest-growing renewable independent power producers in the country,” said Brian Callaway, chief financial officer, Arevon. “Complex financial engineering and access to facilities like this are a key part of our competitive advantage.”
Arevon has 6 GW of renewable energy projects under development or in operation, and 1 GW of storage capacity. The company performs commercial, financial, performance asset management, and construction services.
Earlier this year, the company sold a 540 MW solar development portfolio to Sol Systems. The portfolio consists of three 180 MW projects in southeast Illinois.
“This sale is a continuation of the partnership between Sol Systems and Arevon, which began with our joint venture, Sol Customer Solutions, providing distributed generation solutions to commercial customers.” said Justin Johnson, Arevon’s chief operating officer.
Arevon is also constructing a 300 MW energy storage project in San Diego County, California. Pending permitting approvals, the project in Poway is expected to break ground in 2023. The installation will use the Tesla Megapack.
The company signed a long-term contract under which the Nighthawk storage facility will provide energy and resource adequacy services to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). The project was selected in a competitive request for offers PG&E launched to comply with a June 2021 California Public Utilities Commission order directing load-serving entities like PG&E to procure additional energy resources. The Nighthawk project will connect to the grid at the Sycamore Canyon Substation, which receives renewable energy generated in the desert and distributes it to the San Diego area.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/02/danville-solar-installation-built-on-a-former-general-motors-site-in-illinois/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ILLINOIS",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022",Danville Solar installation built on a former General Motors site in Illinois,"A former brownfield turns green with the completion of the Danville solar system, announced by Ameresco, Inc.,  a cleantech integrator, and Inovateus Solar, a solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company. The project was built on a former General Motors Powertrain Division Plant turned brownfield site. Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company, an independent power producer and green energy investment company, is the owner of the installation.
The 2.62 MW system consists of over 6,600 solar modules and is connected to the Ameren utility grid. The completed project is expected to generate over 3,600,000 kWh of electricity and offset over 1,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, or the equivalent to powering 350 Illinois homes and removing approximately 480 cars from the road.
“We can turn a serious problem into a tremendous opportunity by siting solar on closed landfills,” said Tyler Kanczuzewski, vice president of sustainability at Inovateus. “The Danville Solar project is making productive use of land that might otherwise lie dormant, while avoiding construction in more pristine areas. We’re proud to partner with Ameresco on this project and to help the state of Illinois achieve its clean energy goals.”
This project contributes to Illinois’ Future Energy Jobs Act, which requires that 2,700 MW of solar to be installed in Illinois by 2030 and that 2% of those projects come from brownfield sites. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Illinois has a strong and growing solar market due in part to its renewable portfolio standard that requires that 25% of its energy comes from renewable sources by 2025. The amount of solar capacity installed in Illinois, currently at 1.5 GW, is expected to grow by more than 1,700% over the next five years. Illinois ranks 17th in the country for installed solar.
“We’re proud to have been a partner on this project designed to help meet sustainability goals and offer clean, resilient energy to the surrounding community,” said Louis P. Maltezos, executive vice president, Ameresco. “This installation is a prime example of using innovative cleantech solutions to identify clean energy uses for public land.”
 The Danville solar project began construction in November of 2020 and reached completion in May of 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/02/sunnova-to-develop-solar-and-storage-micro-utility-in-california/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022",Sunnova to develop solar and storage “micro-utility” in California,"Energy-as-a-service provider Sunnova Energy announced it applied with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to develop a novel solution: a “micro-utility.”
The company seeks to develop largely self-sustaining micro utilities by equipping new home communities with solar and storage. Newly constructed homes will be the focus so that Sunnova can work closely with developers to design and implement distributed solar microgrids backed with resilient energy storage.
“Sunnova is breaking new ground by expanding its distributed energy service platform from homes to whole communities.  We see a future where communities, neighborhoods, and businesses can operate independently from the legacy grid with sustainable energy sources that provide uninterrupted power. We believe microgrids address a strong need in the market for more robust energy solutions and better connectivity. The Sunnova Adaptive Community will provide consumers with the ability to produce, share, and deliver power when it’s needed most.” William J Berger, founder and CEO of Sunnova.
The company took formal steps before the CPUC to qualify as a “micro-utility” and to request a certificate to construct and operate microgrids under Section 2780 and Section 1001, respectively, of the California Public Utilities Code.
“SCMC’s application highlights the relief that the existing transmission and distribution system will experience given that most of the power that will be consumed by these communities will be generated locally from renewable resources. We hope the CPUC moves expeditiously to approve our application so that we can begin serving new communities,” said Berger.
Microgrids and the newly conceived micro utility are a new conception of the power grid that recognizes the strengths of the input (solar energy), building the grid in a decentralized, distributed fashion. This leads to increased resilience in adverse conditions, less transmission bottlenecks and congestion costs, decreases land use or “energy sprawl”, lessens utility monopoly control over a territory, and significantly reduces the need for transmission buildout, relying only on the local distribution grid.
In its 2021 to 22 transmission plan, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) announced 23 transmission projects at an estimated cost of $2.9 billion. A significant portion of these costs could be avoided if California instead pivoted to a decentralized model of energy.
Efficiency via sharing
In a report published by the University of Otago in New Zealand, researchers took a demand-driven approach, analyzing a per-minute resolution time series of individual household demand over several neighborhoods that contained these distributed solar and energy storage.

The results found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% for peak shaving.
As an example, if peak shaving occurred for demand above 3 kW per house, deploying batteries individually for 20 houses would require 120 kWh of storage.  By contrast, deploying batteries collectively would only require 7 kWh, the researchers said. Sharing batteries or having one battery per 20 houses would be a less expensive approach to providing these services, they said.
The researchers said the results make a case for coordinated battery deployment at the street or building level for multiple economic benefits. These benefits include the potential reduction in energy storage cost for homeowners (who could buy a smaller unit), benefits to the grid in easing demand and load related strains, and benefits to solar developers who can add another value chain to their operations by facilitating these grid services.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/02/zinc8-to-manufacture-its-first-zinc-air-batteries-in-the-u-s/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022",Zinc8 to manufacture its first zinc-air batteries in the U.S.,"Zinc8 Energy Solutions Inc. announced that the company’s inaugural commercial production facility will be based in Ulster County in New York. Based upon comprehensive analysis done by the company, the recently announced Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) manufacturing production credits provide distinct and direct benefits to Zinc8, influencing its production plans in the United States.
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has developed a proprietary flow battery technology that it claims is able to deliver power in the range from 20 kW to 50 MW that can store and discharge energy durations from 4 to 100 hours. Scalability and higher capacity is achieved with an increase in the size of storage tanks that hold zinc particles. The modular battery can be configured to support a wide array of long-duration applications for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects.
Unlike lithium-ion technology, which requires new stacks to scale, Zinc8 says it has completely decoupled the linkage between energy and power. This means that scaling Zinc8’s technology can be accomplished by simply increasing the size of the fuel tank and quantity of recharged zinc fuel.  According to the manufacturer, the technology promises zero capacity fade over an extensive lifetime, and the batteries are non-flammable, non-toxic and sustainable with stable supply chains for mass production.
The company chose Ulster County in Upstate New York after Senator Chuck Schumer personally called the CEO of Zinc8, Ron MacDonald, to urge the company to expand their operations in New York state and particularly to Ulster County.
The Canadian company was enticed to move to the USA as a result of the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit included in the IRA, which provides incentives to battery manufacturers as well as to critical mineral processing companies. Every eligible battery cell will receive a $35 credit, scaling with the capacity of the battery, with incentives to last at their initial level until 2029, before phasing down from 2030 to a phase out stage beginning in 2032. There is also $10 billion support available for construction of clean energy tech factories, or for retrofitting existing factories with tools and production lines to make clean energy equipment and components.  President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $6 billion incentives to support R&D and production of batteries in the United States, which bolsters the domestic supply chain.
“This represents some direct and beneficial credit opportunities for Zinc8,” adds MacDonald. “It is abundantly clear that with the introduction of the IRA, US policymakers, led by Senator Schumer, are taking real action by introducing incentives that benefit both the climate and the economy. We have received tremendous support both at the federal and state level as we continue to analyze possible sites for our first manufacturing facility.”
Zinc8 signed a letter of intent to move into iPark87, which is the former TechCity campus now being redeveloped as an EPA cleanup site. Senator Schumer said that with Zinc8 as an anchor tenant of iPark87, the Hudson Valley could see up to 500 new, good paying clean energy jobs.
“Zinc8 is the jolt of electricity the Hudson Valley needs, and is proof positive that when you invest in fighting climate change you are investing in creating good-paying jobs, new economic growth, and a brighter future for our communities. As the EPA officially begins cleanup of this once-contaminated asbestos dumping ground, I can think of no better way to usher in a renaissance for Ulster County than by making this the foundation for supercharging the fight against climate change with an investment in clean tech manufacturing,” said Senator Schumer.
In January of this year Zinc8 announced that it would be installing its technology at a New York City housing complex in a trial run by the New York State Energy Research and Development Agency (NYSERDA). The plan is for a 100kW/1.5MWh zinc-air energy storage system (ZESS) to be installed at Fresh Meadows Community Apartments in Queens, New York, to support and enhance the economics of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system currently under construction, along with an existing photovoltaic system.
