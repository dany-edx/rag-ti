Insurance broker Marsh shared this view in a whitepaper, explaining that assessments in renewables do not consistently reflect the risks that might be reasonably insured or retained. 
Marsh said that proper risk assessment can reduce the cost and time required to get to financial close while simultaneously lowering a project’s cost of risk over its lifecycle. 
Often, lenders’ insurance requirements do not match risk realities. Marsh said a lack of acknowledged standards in the space leads to inconsistency and undermining project value. It said that new entrants to the market cause issues, as well. 
“Lenders must often prioritize requirements that are ‘customary,’ ‘market,’ or ‘similar’ for the type of project,” wrote Marsh. “However … they frequently fail to account for critical differences in risk identification and analysis methods employed by project sponsors that have a mature risk management approach. This means that they may inadvertently impede efforts to professionally manage insurable risk; or worse, divert investment capital from projects where risk has been effectively managed to those where it has not.” 
Marsh said that in some instances, cost of insurance could exceed 25% of annual operating and maintenance expenses. Lack of proper modeling and a “one-size-fits-all” approach can lead developers to deploy excessive conservatism in insurance, such as applying the 150% of 1-in-500 year loss standard. The firm offers five ways to more properly evaluate risk for renewable project finance. 
1. Identify credible risk identification and risk analysis techniques 
Changing the scope of lender requirements for insurance limits should start with a list of expected documentation that can demonstrate a standard for insurance limit purchasing. Marsh recommends developers put together a list of secondary characteristics as part of their data-gathering process and leverage the additional information to more accurately model the exposure. 
Marsh also recommended multiple GPS coordinates for large-scale operations to map out actual exposure to catastrophic weather events. And developers should leverage an agent’s or broker’s in-house modeling and analytics team to strengthen the argument for more appropriate insurance limits based on actual exposure instead of relying on peer benchmarking. 
2. Employ an internal certified risk management professional 
Risk managers can support your team internally by offering credible risk identification and risk analysis techniques for the project sponsor to carry out. It allows for better collaboration with independent third parties in the deployment of risk assessment techniques. An internal risk manager can provide an increased level of risk management confidence for all involved during the project financing process by implementing more advanced evaluation models. 
3. Reflect on possible conflicts of interest 
Agent or broker conflicts of interest should be considered in risk management strategy. Marsh said developers should consider the trade-offs of different approaches to remuneration and how each method aligns with the company’s values, goals, and practices. Developers should understand, assess and monitor the perspectives and incentives of each risk advisor on remuneration. Peer feedback and credentials reviews can help in this process. 
4. Consider the importance of insurance sufficiency assessments 
Over the past two years as project volumes have ramped up, there have been significant changes in ownership, staffing levels, and the complexity of risk assessment undertaken by project sponsors. Marsh recommends exploring the increasingly diverse and competitive field of independent and broker-affiliated options. It suggests regularly considering the pro’s and con’s of each and monitoring changes. 
5. Perform annual sensitivity analyses 
Buying more insurance with deductible buy-downs, excess catastrophic risk coverage, and other specialty coverages can make the difference between finding project financiers and having them walk away. Insurance products can improve a project’s attractiveness, when used correctly. The length of a renewable project’s life cycle often means that regular sensitivity reviews will be needed to assess whether the coverage remains adequate and efficient. 
“The way forward depends on creating a roadmap that allows for education, open dialogue, and willingness to change, allowing all stakeholders in renewable energy project financing to close deals more efficiently and with the right amount of insurance being purchased on a per-risk, merit basis,” concluded Marsh in the whitepaper.

The AC output power of the SuperBase V is 3,800 W rated power and 5,000 W peak power, and the company reports that two SuperBase Vs with the same type of battery can be connected to each other with the ZenY cable or the Home Panel to achieve up to 7,600 W of total output power.
The SuperBase V becomes solar powered by connecting solar panel output through an XT 90 port or the AC input. It can be charged with portable solar panels up to 3000 W. Zendure offers its own solar panels, but the SuperBase V is compatible with a wide range of other manufacturers’ solar panels from 12 V to 150 V and the company claims it can be easily integrated into existing solar system.
Zendure reports that the U.S. model of SuperBase V has can switch to battery power with 0 ms of downtime to its AC output port.
The Home Panel connects SuperBase V to the home’s electrical circuits to supply power throughout the house. The Zendure app gives you tools to monitor, manage, and customize energy use. The Home Panel, which should be installed by a licensed electrician, is a transfer switch plus it’s a fast-charging dock for the SuperBase V and features two EV charging outlets. And with up to 12,000W of power distribution, the Home Panel can charge two vehicles at the same time and provide AC power to up to 10 circuits around the house.
Portable level 2 EV charging also supports public power station input, and the SuperBase V paired with a battery pack adds an extra 40 miles to keep drivers moving between pit stops. The EV charging plus is a 14-50 for Type 1 (J1772) connector with 5-15 plug and 6-20 plug adaptor cables; CEE 32 plug for Type 2 (Mennekes) with EU plug, UK plug and AU plug adapter cables.
The unit comes with a variety of hook-ups and 14 ports, including AC, USB-A and USB-C, and a 12V car outlet. It is compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Home systems for monitoring home power use. The Zendure app also provides users with tools to monitor, manage and customize energy use. It comes with safety features such as overcharge protection and short circuit protection.
According to Zendure’s website, pricing starts at $3,299.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/06/all-in-on-the-future-meyer-burger-shifting-to-100-glass-glass-bifacial/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ARIZONA,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 6, 2023",All-in on the future: Meyer Burger shifting to 100% glass-glass bifacial,"Meyer Burger has announced that in the future, they will manufacture only glass-glass bifacial solar modules.
The Swiss manufacturer cites two main reasons for making the switch to glass. First, they wish to create a “unified, leaner and flexible concept for Meyer Burger’s future solar modules.” The group stated that the leaner production and logistics processes will lead to faster scalability of new manufacturing.
In the short term, Burger said that the change will actually slow down manufacturing volume in existing facilities as they transition. The company’s Goodyear manufacturing site in the United States will be glass-glass from its start date next year.
While manufacturing speed and efficiency is of the utmost importance in the solar industry, there is another, more important reason for Meyer Burger’s decision: glass-glass solar modules are a better technology than their plastic backsheeted siblings.

Officially, the manufacturer’s warranty suggests that their “Meyer Burger Glass” solar module will degrade at 0.2% or less per year, for thirty years. That means that a Meyer Burger glass-glass module bought today should be expected to produce at least 93.2% of its original output in the year 2053. In theory, if that degradation rate holds, a glass-glass Meyer Burger panel would still produce 89.2% of its original power rating after 50 years.
However, 0.2% is not the actual degradation value. It’s a safe, conservative number that the manufacturer put in place because the actual value that was found during their accelerated testing seemed too low to warranty.
In online interviews, Meyer Burger’s CEO, Dr. Gunter Erfurt, has suggested that the accelerated testing process found too little degradation to be measured – essentially, zero.
When asked by pv magazine USA, “How close to “zero” degradation was the panel? Erfurt replied:
We will not quantify this, binding for us is the official warranty. But it’s clear that a GG (glass-glass) module does literally not suffer from any mechanical stress. Hence, the remaining degradation issues are heavily reduced. I believe that these modules easily last 50 years with “acceptable” degradation.
The United State’ Department of Energy is seeking a fifty year solar panel via a funding program whose goal is to develop the materials needed to last in the elements. Erfurt noted that while the glass-glass panels could last 50 years, there are still some plastics in the modules that could require further development.
pv magazine USA once speculated on how a fifty year solar panel might affect the valuation of a solar power asset. Calculations showed that a 46% greater discounted cash flow would be projected. Hypothetically, that cash flow could be sold to long term investors.
Because fifty years is such an incredibly long time, one big question sticks out: how do we calculate the value of such a product?
Erfurt shared his thoughts on the subject:
Guaranteeing 50 years does need to make a business case. If a 50 year old decides to buy solar with 50 years of warranty, what is the benefit? Utility customers also don’t care as their business case must fly within the first 10 years. I believe a lower degradation does make sense also without guaranteeing 50 years because of lower LCOE per se as well as the option to “re-use” the module after 30 years in its second life.
Meyer Burger noted that the new all glass product portfolio will be officially presented at the Intersolar Europe show in Munich, in June 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/06/solar-wind-storage-account-for-82-of-new-u-s-capacity-additions/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 6, 2023","Solar, wind, storage account for 82% of new U.S. capacity additions","Looking at the profile of energy infrastructure buildout today offers a vision into the future. It is clear that the U.S. energy grid’s future will be dominantly characterized by renewable energy, as the Energy Information Administration (EIA) shared that solar, wind, and battery energy storage technologies are now 82% of new capacity additions actively planned to come online.
Utility-scale solar is still quite young, as substantial capacity additions did not come online until 2010. Wind began its contributions closer to the turn of the millennia. Now, as of January 2023, 73.5 GW of utility-scale solar is online, about 6% of U.S. generating capacity.
Just over half of planned U.S. generation is solar. If all planned projects come online as expected this year, 2023 will mark the most capacity added to the grid for solar yet.
While there have been bumps along the road, the inevitable energy transition, boosted by the emergence of mission-driven investing, has attracted “an unprecedented wave of investment”, said Andrew Redinger, Managing Director and Group Head of Utility, Power & Renewable Energy for KeyBanc Capital Markets, in a white paper.
Bloomberg NEF reports that global investment in renewables totaled $226 billion in the first half of 2022, an increase of 11% year-over-year from 1H 2021. In the last 24 months, the KeyBanc director said renewable energy in the institutional investment world has gone “from niche to mainstream.”
Battery energy storage is stepping forward out of its nascence now, as grid planners call for more energy storage to make use of intermittent renewable energy generation. In 2023, developers plan to add 8.6 GW of battery energy storage capacity to the grid, doubling total battery power capacity in the U.S. in one year.
While the capacity numbers are impressive, electricity generation is the end result that matters most. Wind and solar made up about 17% of the country’s utility-scale capacity in 2021 but produced only 12% of U.S. electricity. Capacity factors, or the actual electrical energy output over a given period of time to the theoretical maximum electrical energy, are lower in wind and solar than in other technologies like nuclear, so generation can be a better apples-to-apples comparison of the true contribution of a technology.
In 2022, solar photovoltaics made up 4.7% of U.S. electricity generation, an increase of almost 21% over the 2021 total when solar produced 3.9% of US electricity. Total solar generation was up 25%, breaking through 200,000 GWh for the year.
If it were not for ongoing solar panel import difficulties and general inflation, solar’s contribution to electricity generation might have reached 5% in 2022, said John Fitzgerald Weaver, Commercial Solar Guy.
Solar as a percentage of monthly electricity generation ranged from a low of almost 3% in January, to just over 6% in April. April’s production marked a new monthly record for solar generation in the U.S.
Total generation of solar electricity peaked in July, at 21,708 GWh. Over the course of the year, solar production reached  202,256 GWh, and total U.S. electricity generation reached 4,303,980 GWh. Total US electricity generation increased by 3.5% over the 4,157,467 GWh produced in 2021.
In total, emissions free energy sources such as wind, solar photovoltaic and thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, and geothermal, accounted for 37.9% of the total electricity generated in the U.S. This value is barely higher than 2020’s 37.7% – but represents a return to growth after 2021 saw a decrease in emission free electricity to 37%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/06/silicon-anode-battery-producer-files-for-5-gwh-production-facility-in-colorado/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,POLICY,COLORADO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 6, 2023",Silicon anode battery producer files for 5 GWh production facility in Colorado,"Amprius Technologies has signed a letter of intent to build a 775,000 square foot battery manufacturing facility capable of producing 5 GWh of silicon anode-based lithium-ion batteries in the coming years.
To be located in Brighton, Colorado, the facility will become the first large-scale commercial advanced manufacturing center for silicon anode lithium-ion batteries by the time it opens in 2025. The facility will be built in phases, with the first phase starting with an initial 500 MWh of production at the facility which at full scale will produce 5 GWh.
The initial phase of 500 MWh will be funded in part by a $50 million grant received in October 2022 from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains. Amprius is among the first set of companies to announce receipt of funding from the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries, specifically focused on U.S.-based processing of materials and components.
The initial phase of construction at the Brighton, Colo., facility is expected to create over 330 new jobs.
Following an extensive site evaluation spanning three states, Amprius selected Colorado based on its high-volume manufacturing facility. The Brighton location has 1.3 million square feet of existing factory site equipped with electrical infrastructure and structural layout designed for a gigawatt-hour scale lithium-ion battery factory.  The pre-configured site reduces expected build-out costs to the manufacturer.
The Colorado facility is located closer to essential materials and transportation infrastructure, which together limits logistics and operational costs. The site exceeded Amprius’ site requirements and is expected to streamline time-to-market and customer fulfillment.
“We worked closely with the state of Colorado, the Colorado Economic Development Commission, Adams County, and the City of Brighton to align on terms that are mutually beneficial and include a comprehensive incentive proposal,” said Dr. Kang Sun, chief executive officer of Amprius. “Increasing production to meet the substantial market demand for our breakthrough silicon anode lithium-ion technology remains a priority, and we are confident this factory will allow us to scale and effectively serve the electric mobility market.”
To further intensify the focus on product and technology development while scaling up production, the company has formed two business units: Amprius Fab, to be located in Brighton, Colo., will focus on manufacturing of silicon anode batteries, while Amprius Lab, located in Fremont, Calif., will focus on the company’s advanced battery research and development efforts.
To support the company’s bifurcated manufacturing and R&D focus, Jon Bornstein, its current chief operating officer, will take on a new role to head the Amprius Lab as the division’s president. Bornstein has spearheaded Amprius’ silicon anode development and pilot production for over 10 years.
In addition to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act has established the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (PTC).  This PTC applies tax credits of up to $31 billion to the production of cathode and anode materials used in lithium-ion batteries and advanced battery minerals sourced in the U.S.
A tax credit is also included for the production of battery cells and battery modules in the U.S. based on the capacity of the cell up to $35 per kWh, and in the case of a module is based on the capacity of the module up to $10 per kWh. For a sample 75kWh battery pack, a tax credit of up to $2,625 for the manufacturer of the battery cells and up to $750 for the maker of the modules is available, according to an IRA policy note by law firm Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe.
Amprius’ silicon anode battery cell provides a fast charge capability of an 80% charge in just 6 minutes, while its battery packs have been used in aircraft and unmanned aerial systems (drones) as well as satellites of the U.S. Army, Airbus and BAE Systems, among other customers of the company.
 The company was founded in 2008 by Stanford University professor Yi Cui, director of the university’s Precourt Institute for Energy, and Mark Platshon, a venture capitalist. In May 2022, the company announced plans to list as a public company through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp., which closed in September 2022 valued at $939 million.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/06/expanding-solar-finance-and-leverage-warrants-increased-solar-revenue-insurance/,"FINANCE,INSURANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 6, 2023",Expanding solar finance and leverage warrants increased solar revenue insurance,"Bold net zero agendas by commercial, industrial and utility counterparties has pushed the size thresholds of solar project development into a new playing field. And with new larger projects supported by state and federal incentives comes an increased premium for insurance amid an erratic environment prone to catastrophic storms.
Once considered a low-cost investment, the price to build solar assets has increased considerably. To combat rising costs due to inflation, kWh Analytics partnered with project developer Pivot Energy to provide Solar Revenue Put production insurance across the developer’s multiple distributed solar projects totaling 70 MW in six U.S. states.
The Solar Revenue Put is a credit enhancement product designed to help investors improve leverage by mitigating solar production risk. Although the 70 MW portfolio’s project financing closed in April 2022, the developer arranged a post-financing addition via the Solar Revenue Put for an extended 20-year term to enable the developer to increase the loan size helping to cover increased costs that would otherwise be covered by project equity alone.
The Solar Revenue Put was added to improve leverage from the developer’s lender group, which consists of Silicon Valley Bank, Cadence Bank, and Bank United, while Everest is the main carrier for the production coverage.
“Our partnership with kWh Analytics will be a game-changer for our portfolio of community solar assets,” said Bret Labadie, chief financial officer of Pivot Energy. “This insurance product reduces the risk of the portfolio, which enables stronger project returns, and ultimately allows us to more effectively finance more clean energy projects in the future.”
Pivot Energy’s portfolio presented the solar insurer with a new challenge: each of the 36 sites of the 70 MW portfolio had a different configuration, a different tracking system, and different associated risks. Utilizing a large unified database of operating solar assets, the team assessed the risk at the individual project level as well as a diversified portfolio to underwrite the policy, finding the best value and allowing for debt optimization.
kWh Analytics’ Solar Revenue Put is an insurance policy covering solar production to provide protection against downside risk. The policy allows asset owners to achieve more favorable financing terms via additional debt or optimized loan terms.
The additional supplemental insurance coverage protects Pivot Energy’s projects for a 20-year term. The Pivot Energy portfolio brings kWh Analytics’ total assets under management to over $4 billion.
The $190 million financing facility that Pivot Energy in April will support a multi-state portfolio of a then 90 MW distributed generation solar project portfolio comprised of 40 solar projects in six states, representing 80% community solar, and 20% commercial and industrial (C&I) projects. The portfolio includes projects located in New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Colorado, Minnesota and California.
The solar portfolio represented the first that Pivot will build, own, and operate since it was acquired by Energy Capital Partners (ECP) in June 2021. In addition to C&I power purchase agreements, clients include community solar subscriptions for commercial clients, residents, and nearly 1,200 low- to moderate-income households.
Asset data
In December 2022, kWh Analytics shared findings from its operational asset database in a solar generation index report. The study found broad underperformance in the field when compared to forward-looking performance estimates.
On average, projects constructed after 2015 have generated 7% to 13% less electricity than P50 production estimates. P50 means there is a 50% chance in any given year that production will be at least a specific amount. If an array has a P50 production level of 500 kWh, it means that on any given year there is a 50% chance that production will be at least 500 kWh.
The report concluded that as the gap between actual and expected generation grows, underperformance risk jeopardizes investor returns and the industry’s ability to achieve sustainable growth.
Under 10 years of operational data, average lifetime performance ranged from 5% to 10% below initial P50 estimates across seven major U.S. regions. The report also evaluated system performance based on project capacities and mount types and found no underperformance trends isolated to any specific group of projects.
Formed in 2012, kWh Analytics is based in San Francisco and has raised $26.8 million in equity to date. Its most recent raise in February 2022 brought in $20 million in Series B funding from Lacuna Sustainable Investments.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/06/lessons-learned-from-state-community-solar-program-caps/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ILLINOIS,MARYLAND,MASSACHUSETTS,MINNESOTA,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",BRIAN SAVAGE,"MARCH 6, 2023",Lessons learned from state community solar program caps,"Research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) looks at the role state program caps are playing in the community solar market.  Program caps limit the total capacity of community solar that can be installed in a particular utility service territory or the entire state.  In the past, state policymakers used program caps to pilot rapidly growing renewable energy programs.  For example, many states started with caps on net metering in the mid-2010s and increased the caps as distributed PV expanded.
According to the US Department of Energy, community solar refers to “any solar project or purchasing program, within a geographic area, in which the benefits of a solar project flow to multiple customers.”  The community solar market is rapidly growing, making up 6% of total solar installations, or 5.7 GWac in mid-2022.  This is up from 3.4 GWac in 2020 and 0.8 GWac in 2015.
As seen above, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have enacted enabling legislation for community solar as of May 2022 to further this growth.  Seven states have also introduced legislation that would enable or incentivize community solar. At the same time, 19 states and Washington, D.C. included caps on their community solar programs as of May 2022.
Five of the top 10 states use caps with the installed community solar capacity ranging from 10% to 40% of the program cap.  The program caps apply to all solar generation in New York and Massachusetts.
State regulators have used program caps in a variety of different manners and contexts to balance costs and incentivize development while developing best practices in an emerging market. These caps are often heavily negotiated between relevant stakeholders as part of enabling legislation for community solar. Solar developers may prefer more incentives with program caps and a lottery for a few lucrative projects, while others may prefer the certainty and scale that larger, uncapped markets offer.
These community solar caps are applied to suit each state’s individual market and goals. For example, Minnesota chose to have an uncapped community solar market based on the state’s existing NEM policy also being uncapped. While the success of Minnesota’s community solar program is evident, the lessons for other states are less clear. Pressures to add program caps have risen as de facto limits emerged due to long queues, land limitations, lack of subscribers in contiguous counties, the utility’s desire for certainty, and interconnection limits.
The state legislature in Maryland preferred a program cap after seeing the gold rush effect of community solar leading to long application queues in other states. As well, similar pilot program caps had also been used during Maryland’s restructuring of natural gas and electricity markets. The capacity-based program cap has been expanded over time from 196 MW over 3 years in 2017 to 583 MW over 7 years in 2021. As the market matured, Maryland was able to avoid a “boom-bust” cycle of development through program cap revisions and consultation with multiple stakeholders.
New York applied its NEM program cap to cap community solar, along with a funding cap on the incentives available to community solar via the NY-Sun program. A combination of state legislation and broad regulatory discretion from state agencies enabled successful community solar development. For example, the Value or Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) tariffs, also known as the Value Stack, created by the NY State Public Service Commission, compensate when and where distributed sources like solar provide electricity to the grid.  This has helped enable more than 1 GW of deployed community solar and provides important lessons for how states enable agency involvement with community solar.
In Illinois, the state took a different approach through a combination of funding and capacity-based program caps. The Illinois Shines, also known as the Adjustable Block Program, created renewable energy certificate incentives with 25% going toward the development of community solar with benefits also being extended to subscribers. This program initially ended up being more than 10 times over-subscribed by developers putting in applications for 1.8 GW of community solar with only around 164.5 MW being accepted.
The Illinois Shines program later expanded with the aim to deploy 400 MW of community solar projects by 2030. The equity-focused Solar for All program provides grants for building solar with a cap based on limited funding which rose from $30 million in 2016 to $50 million in 2021, with $16.5 additional allocations from alternative compliance and ratepayer funds.
Ten states with community solar program caps use them to set minimum carve-outs for low-moderate income (LMI) households.  For example, Oregon requires 10% of its total community solar capacity to go toward LMI households.  New Jersey requires 51% of its stage 2 pilot program to be set aside for LMI households. Washington D.C. requires all community solar projects to be dedicated to low-income customers.  These measures ensure that community solar is able to democratize access and address trends of inequity in solar penetration. The variety of state program cap applications offers important tools and lessons for the future as interest in community solar continues to rise.
