These LSPVPs are defined here as ground mounted PV generation facilities with at least 1 MW of DC generation capacity.
The study comprises over 1,500 LSPVPs and over 1.8 million home sales across California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, and North Carolina. Together this data represents over 50% of the installed MW capacity of LSPVP in the United States.
The analysis found that the effects of LSPVPs on home sale prices depended on many factors that are not uniform across all solar developments or all states.
As seen above, homes within 0.5 miles of a LSPVP compared to homes 2-4 miles away were found to have a reduction in home sale price of 4% in Minnesota, 5.6% in New Jersey, and 5.8% in North Carolina. No statistically significant effects were measured in California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.
Based on data from all six states, there was a home sale price reduction of 1.5% for these homes within 0.5 miles of a LSPVP compared to those 2-4 miles away. Notably, only LSPVPs developed on previously agricultural land, or near homes in rural areas, and much larger LSPVPs were found to be linked to adverse home sale price impacts within 0.5 miles. This analysis provides precise measurements of correlations determining the precise causation of these is beyond the scope of the study.  Nonetheless, a better understanding of the impacts of LSPVPs, especially in agricultural and rural areas is necessary.
In nearly every state, these impacts have contributed to local opposition.  This results in delays, cancelations, and has led local governments to enact policies to restrict or block renewable energy facilities.  The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School found 121 such local policies and 204 contested renewable energy facilities in a March 2022 report. This represented a 17.5% increase in local laws and a 23.6% increase in contested projects from the report’s Sept. 2021 update.
At least 20 of these contested projects related to local opposition arising from property value depreciation, among other concerns.  This local opposition combined with mixed results from the Berkeley Lab report may point to the need for new strategies for rural, large, or agricultural PV installations. Compensation to neighbors, vegetative shading, setbacks, and co-location of agriculture and solar could help ameliorate negative impacts.
It should be noted this Berkeley report does not consider the ability for personal attitudes or sentiments within neighboring communities to influence property valuations.  Over the long run, broader adoption of PV energy may shift these attitudes as local residents become more accustomed to seeing panels in different settings.  Broader economic benefits like job creation, resilience, and tax revenue for host communities could positively impact home sale prices but was not considered in the study.
The comparative negative impact of fossil fuel factories was also not considered.  For example, a 2011 study published in the Review of Economics and Statistics found that US homes within 2 miles of fossil fuel power plants opened during the 1990s experienced 3% to 7% decreases in housing values and rents, with some evidence of larger decreases within 1 mile, and for large-capacity plants.  While further research is still needed on the varied impacts of LSPVPs across different projects and places, opportunities are apparent for PV stakeholders to better integrate and communicate with local communities about these tradeoffs.
The authors of the Berkeley Lab study will host a webinar covering their results on March 22nd at 12 PM Eastern / 9 AM Pacific. Register at the link below: https://lbnl.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_7c4j1nGnRuKnvbYYmJrXyw

A press release from Illuminate said the acquisition and construction of the facility will cost $220 million. Invenergy notes they made a $600 million investment in the facility.
Invenergy is noted as being the facility’s ‘anchor’ customer. Longi is the world’s largest manufacturer of solar modules. Invenergy has an operating portfolio of 775 MW of solar facilities, and has 6 GW currently under development. Invenergy has developed approximately 10% of the United States’ wind and solar power fleet.
Illuminate says that the construction of the facility will generate 150 jobs. Once it is running, it will require 850 individuals to keep it going. Both single and bifacial solar modules will be manufactured at the site.
Invenergy’s involvement with solar panel manufacturing follows an emerging pattern in the U.S. market. 
According to the Solar Energy Industries of America “Solar & Storage Supply Chain Dashboard,” the total U.S. solar module assembly fleet is above 58 GW. That figure includes proposed facilities, as well as facilities being constructed or expanded, and includes the capacity from Longi.
The recently signed Inflation Reduction Act offers solar panel manufacturers a collection of incentives for manufacturing solar hardware in the United States:
Data from BloombergNEF suggests that in the United States, solar module assembly costs roughly $84 million for each gigawatt of annual manufacturing capacity. The machines assembling modules cost approximately $23 million per gigawatt, and the remaining costs go towards facility construction.
pv magazine’s Vincent Shaw said the machines used in standard Chinese monoPERC manufacturing lines deployed in China cost approximately $8.7 million per gigawatt.
A 10 GW solar panel manufacturing facility built by Longi cost $349 million in 2022, excluding real estate costs.
In 2022, Longi announced a $6.7 billion solar campus that will manufacture 100 GW of solar wafers and 50 GW of solar cells per year

The numbers don’t make for great reading. According to energy analyst Wood Mackenzie, the US solar market declined 16%, year on year, in 2022. Some 20.2 GW of solar was installed in a market that should be undergoing supercharged expansion on the back of generous Inflation Reduction Act subsidies.
By contrast, the European solar marketplace expanded 47% to 41.4 GW last year, according to SolarPower Europe. China’s National Energy Administration also reported exceptional growth in 2022, with 87.4 GW of solar completed, for year-on-year expansion of 60.3%.
There are, however, glimmers of hope for solar in the US. Utility scale deployment rallied in the fourth quarter, achieving 4.3 GW and 11.8 GW for the year – a decline on 2021 but not as catastrophic as some had feared.
“Q4 had a 67% higher buildout compared to Q3, mainly driven by module shipment releases by CBP [US Customs and Border Protection],” says Sylvia Leyva Martinez, a senior research analyst with WoodMac. While detailed information is lacking, investment bank Roth Capital Partners announced, on Feb. 5, that JinkoSolar “continues to see modestly sized, steady releases” of modules detained by US border officials, while Longi is also seeing “modest” module releases. The bank noted releases in some cases were being delayed as CBP lacks sufficient staff to assess and release module shipments in a timely fashion.
Border module detentions are the result of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) signed into law by US President Joe Biden on Dec. 23, 2021. The legislation passed both houses of Congress with only one dissenting vote. The UFLPA restricts the import of goods, “mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China” – due to credible accusations of the use of forced labor involving the Uyghur ethnic minority in the region.
In November 2022, Reuters reported more than 1,000 solar energy component shipments – valued at hundreds of millions of dollars – had been blocked in US ports under UFLPA enforcement. Roughly 4 GW of modules may have been prevented from entering the US last year, according to Philip Shen, MD at Roth Capital, as published in a research note. Some are likely to have been held back by manufacturers, for fear of being seized.
The UFLPA includes a “rebuttable presumption,” ensuring goods from Xinjiang – home to almost half the global solar polysilicon supply chain – are presumed to be made with forced labor. The act places the burden of proof on buyers to show goods have no connection to such practices.
To comply with the UFLPA, companies must provide comprehensive supply chain mapping, a list of all workers, and proof they were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor. “The origins of components and materials used in PV products are not ascertained through a direct identification process,” market intelligence company TrendForce noted in a recent report. “Instead, regulatory agencies often have to rely on product manufacturers and importers to provide supply chain information and sourcing certification.”
UFLPA-related supply constraints are only the latest in a string of trade measures affecting US imports of Chinese modules. The unencumbered supply of solar components has faced a “trade trilemma” for years. The Hoshine withhold-release order (WRO), and the Auxin Solar-instigated Section 201 anti-dumping tariff case (see box below) represent two other threats to the steady supply of solar goods. Those measures began affecting the market in 2021 and 2022, respectively, meaning supply disruption has been a constant for more than two years.
The module supply disruption caused by the Hoshine withhold-release order and the UFLPA has been accompanied by US government anti-dumping proceedings. Allegations of the dumping of Asian-made solar modules were made in a petition from Auxin Solar, a module assembler with operations in California. The petition alleged four Southeast Asian countries – Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia – were harboring Chinese-made goods in violation of anti-circumvention laws. Tariffs on solar goods, enforced under anti-circumvention laws, have historically exceeded 50% to 250%. The uncertainty was temporarily lifted when President Biden, on June 5, placed a 24-month moratorium on solar tariffs on the four nations. The tariff exemption applies to modules imported before June 6, 2024, and installed before December 2024. The moratorium, though, is now under threat. In late January, a small coalition of Democrat and Republican Congress members filed legislation to repeal it. “The Biden administration found, in its own investigation, that China is evading US tariffs on solar imports but has paused action on this matter, which is unacceptable,” said Congressman Dan Kildee, a leading voice in the coalition. Repeal would “help America’s domestic solar manufacturing industry grow to meet our nation’s energy needs,” he said. The repeal petition will expire on March 28, if not passed.
Brian Lynch, director of solar sales at LG Electronics USA, warned pv magazine USA of disrupted supply in 2021. “[If] you’re buying a solar module in the foreseeable future, all of these events will likely impact you, directly or indirectly,” he said.
In June 2021, US Customs and Border Protection released a WRO on the Hoshine Silicon Industry company, a major industrial polysilicon company in Xinjiang. The action was taken under Section 1307 of the Tariff Act, which prohibits the import of merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured – wholly or in part – in any foreign country by forced or indentured labor, including forced child labor. Such goods are subject to exclusion and seizure and may lead to criminal investigation.
Most of the solar imports detained under Section 1307 were held by customs for eight months or more, with major releases announced in February 2022. Shipments containing 100 MW or more of Longi and Trina solar modules were released at that time. Then, as supply pressures from the WRO began to lift, the UFLPA – with higher traceability standards and its “rebuttable presumption” – was introduced.
While solar is undoubtedly a good thing, and rapidly emerging as the key renewable energy for the energy transition and global economy, growth cannot come at the expense of minority populations, environmental sustainability, and human rights. As the industry expands, it can be argued, the maintenance of solar’s social license becomes increasingly important.
Multiple independent investigations have been conducted and published since 2020 into the extent to which forced labor practices have been used in Xinjiang. The most extensive was published in 2021 by Sheffield Hallam University’s Laura T Murphy and Nyrola Elimä.
The “In Broad Daylight, Uyghur Forced Labor and Global Supply Chains” report documented so-called “surplus labor” and “labor transfer” programs announced by Chinese officials and in official media, regarding the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It detailed the expansion of the production of “non-ferrous metals, polysilicon, and mono- and polycrystalline wafers” in the region – an aim targeted by the regional government. Regarding solar, non-ferrous metals means metallurgical-grade silicon, or silicon metal, the feedstock for polysilicon production. The report noted various subsidies which, together with cheap energy and raw materials, make the region attractive to solar feedstock suppliers.
Investigations, and the publication of guidance for the PV industry, have continued since the Sheffield report. In January 2022, US-based asset management company Eventide published “Eradicating Forced Labor from Solar Supply Chains: Eventide’s Approach.” The asset manager is mulling PV investment, says Eventide analyst Reginald Smith, because of its social and environmental benefits. However, the company was troubled by reports of forced labor.
“We wanted to be ‘solutionaries,’” explained Smith during a recent pv magazine webinar, which is to say, solution-focused missionaries. “So we set out to describe a market-based action plan to progressively push forced labor out of the solar supply chain.” The result was methodologies in the report for understanding the “complicated” solar supply chain – Smith’s words – and whether it is “tainted” with forced labor.
The difficulties in ensuring an “untainted” supply chain, according to Eventide, stem from problems tracing the provenance of materials in a solar module. Metallurgical-grade silicon or polysilicon “tainted” by Xinjiang provenance can be blended with other sources in ingot and wafer production, Eventide argues. Smith adds, solar companies can establish and operate supply chains outside Xinjiang, specifically for the US market, while continuing to operate in the region.
“Solar energy buyers are still doing business with those that are involved in the oppression of the Uyghur people,” says Smith. The crux of the matter, the analyst concludes, is investor dollars can be put towards companies with supply chains outside Xinjiang – to the right of Eventide’s “Bifurcation Matrix” – according to the “glide path” the group sets out, below.

The extent to which such actions will affect the situation in Xinjiang is unclear. “The US is not that important a solar market,” says Jenny Chase, head of solar at clean power analyst BloombergNEF. “It is less than a quarter of the Chinese domestic market.” While the Sheffield report and others note Chinese manufacturers supply “over 95%” of global solar wafers, there is sufficient non-Xinjiang polysilicon for the US market.
“There’s enough silicon from outside China for 40 GW [of installations] plus whatever First Solar makes,” says Chase, referring to the US solar manufacturer. First Solar produces cadmium telluride thin-film modules, hermetically sealed from the crystalline silicon supply chain. BloombergNEF forecasts the US market will install slightly less than 30 GW of solar this year.
Polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter, head of Bernreuter Research, says around 12% of global solar polysilicon production came from outside China in 2022 – an historically low level but still 115,000 metric tons (MT) – enough for 45 GW of solar wafers. These producers – Germany’s Wacker, Hemlock Semiconductor, fellow South Korean outfit OCI, and Norway’s REC Silicon – are all expanding capacity or refurbishing mothballed lines – for 65,000 metric tons (MT) more output, sufficient for 25 GW of wafers.
While it will take time for this capacity to come online, Bernreuter notes the “big, fully integrated manufacturers” have put in place more detailed material tracking to verify the non-Xinjiang nature of supply. “Manufacturers are able to track the material flow in their factories, from the incoming polysilicon through to the finished solar module with a, so-called, manufacturing execution system,” says Bernreuter.
As to the silicon metal – a term Bernreuter prefers to metallurgical-grade silicon as the latter “almost breaks your tongue” – the situation is a little more nuanced. It appears non-Chinese producers have made efforts to move supply chains away from Xinjiang, and some from China altogether.
Bernreuter finds Hemlock’s claim it sources silicon metal from North and South America “credible,” and notes OCI “stated they have changed silicon metal sources to other regions in the world and don’t procure silicon metal from Xinjiang any more.” For Wacker, Bernreuter reports that while the company was a Hoshine customer from 2016 to 2020, that detail “has disappeared from the 2021 annual report.” The company has acknowledged procuring silicon metal from China without providing more details. “The fact that the name of Wacker has disappeared from the Hoshine report would point to that they have stopped procuring from Xinjiang but I have no positive evidence of that,” adds Bernreuter.
That the solar supply chain is adjusting to account for the UFLPA and other measures should come as no surprise – a clear signal was sent from the US marketplace and manufacturers responded. BloombergNEF’s Chase concludes “the major companies have now figured out what paperwork they need to file,” to clear US customs.
That supply chains and traceability are evolving as required by the UFLPA is a positive development and evidenced by reports of module releases and the uptick in US installations in the fourth quarter. Bifurcated supply chains, as denoted by Eventide, still exist, although so too do those “untainted” by forced labor accusations.
Slightly more than 20 GW of new solar in 2022 is below the 30 GW required annually under the Biden administration’s decarbonization goals – modeled by the US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). And it is well short of the “up to 60 GW” required annually between 2025 and 2030.
The SETO modeling is based on solar continuing to achieve “aggressive cost reductions,” on the back of supportive policy measures, with demand driven by “large-scale electrification” of the US economy. Realignment of the solar supply chain to add capacity outside Xinjiang, along with the soft costs associated with enhanced traceability, will add to PV’s price. “It won’t be cheap but since when has the US ever been cheap?” asks Chase.
Whether the UFLPA and other measures will have a meaningful impact on alleged forced labor remains unclear. While Bernreuter points to major polysilicon capacity growth outside the region, the industry there continues. “There is a lot of new capacity coming up in Inner Mongolia but also sizable new projects in Xinjiang,” says the analyst.

This decentralized, hurricane proof, energy accessible battery storage solution installation is expected to be able to serve the entire community for up to 10 days of off-grid functionality. The microgrid is owned and managed by a local nonprofit entity, the Community Solar Energy Association of Adjuntas (ACESA), and will provide clean, reliable power to 14 of Adjuntas small businesses, and set a precedent for energy access throughout Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.

Adjuntas is historically one of the hardest-hit communities in Puerto Rico during natural disasters, and this 187 kW microgrid will ensure that the power stays on. The solar power will be stored in a custom built battery storage system (BESS) manufactured by ELM and purpose built for the microgrid, totaling 1.107 MWh. The BESS system includes batteries, inverters, controls, and other equipment, and was contracted and then donated by Rivian. The batteries are expected to provide more than 10 days of off-grid storage for the current size of the system. Meanwhile, the construction will allow for the full PV count to double, while still providing at least 5 days of off-grid storage.
After Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017, the town of Adjuntas was without power for nearly a year. The building that houses Casa Pueblo, a community organization focused on the sustainable development of the region, was the only building in town with power—thanks to its solar installation. Other areas of the town were powered by diesel generators to provide refrigeration, internet access, a phone charging station, and more. Due to the need for more reliable power, business leaders alongside a few community stakeholders formed the nonprofit, ACESA, which owns and operates the microgrid. Energy is sold back to the grid via a power purchase agreement, but approximately 50% of those savings (the final rate to be determined) will be reinvested back into both microgrid maintenance and future community projects.

The community-owned microgrid can serve as an open sourced model for all of Puerto Rico. Additionally, with funds saved from the power purchase agreement, the intent is to bring other homes onto the current microgrid. Ultimately, provided there’s additional philanthropic support, more homes could be plugged into the Adjuntas microgrid.
One of the partners is the Honnold Foundation, founded ten years ago by the rock climber Alex Honnold. The Foundation’s mission is to partner with marginalized communities to expand equitable solar energy access. In the past three years, the Honnold Foundation has helped 48 Partners in over 20 different countries and territories use solar energy to build equity, increase climate resilience, and support communities’ right to self-determination.
The foundation doubled its grantmaking this year to fund $2 million in solar energy projects. In November of 2022, the foundation announced that venture capitalist Peter Levine was providing a multimillion dollar gift over the next three years to launch the Levine Impact Lab in partnership with the Honnold Foundation. The lab intends to offer long-term support to organizations and individual leaders who otherwise might lack access to the best-in-class resources typically reserved for VC-funded startups.
“The repercussions of climate change are felt in every corner of the world with rising temperatures, increased frequencies of natural disasters, food and water insecurity, and economic disruption,” said Honnold. “Meanwhile, communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis are receiving the least amount of support, despite the best efforts of grassroots organizations and community leaders.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/14/technology-toolkit-solar-siting-permitting-and-land-use/,"BUSINESS,INTERVIEW,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RESEARCH,SOFTWARE,NEW YORK,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 14, 2023","Technology toolkit: Solar siting, permitting and land use","pv magazine USA examines technology companies providing software solutions to accelerate and assist the development of distributed generation projects such as community solar and energy storage systems, as well as improve grid transmission reliability and distribution solutions.
Permitting  & due diligence
With an environmental consulting background, “hiking boots and field work” were the nature of the beast for Robin Laine coming out of college at the University of Texas, Austin, examining the environmental impact of power plants in various use cases and local environments, she says.
Over years of research and trekking around performing environmental studies, Laine said “permitting for project development was a very manual, old school process that hasn’t changed much since the Seventies [while] environmental policy framework” hasn’t changed much at all since then.
Laine, who co-founded permitting and due diligence software platform Transect with husband Sam Laine in 2017, told pv magazine USA that the manual process of permitting a solar project traditionally spanned over several months out of a process that would see a project constructed over a few years.  Drawing from cumulative research from her studies, now the permitting of a solar project can be done in a matter of minutes using the Transect platform.
Following the 2014 acquisition by Apex Companies of Southwest Geoscience, where Laine directed its natural resources business, Laine identified numerous inefficiencies for a scalable project development cycle early in the process, pointing to overlap between environmental research and administrative paperwork usually performed by attorneys.
Using environmental data and advances in artificial intelligence, Transect’s automated project permitting system helps developers and utility stakeholders alike find the right site locations for  construction of solar projects and perform various due diligence processes.
Transect’s platform incorporates a four-part process:
Transect, Inc.

Transect’s permitting system is industry agnostic at its core, though Laine said right now it’s seen the most inbound interest for renewable energy project development. Other markets it can serve include commercial real estate and government solutions.
Customers include “Con Edison all the way down to two or three-man development outfits with a truck,” Laine said about Transect’s customer universe.  According to its website, users include OYA Renewables, DSD Renewables, Origis Energy and Recurrent Energy, among others. The company provides its solutions under an annual software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model using a seat-based licensing agreement providing customers unlimited access to Transect’s reports, she added.
Over its five years in business, Transect is now used by developers across all 50 U.S. states, she said, and the company has funded its business plan with a $7.6 million Series A round from April 2022 via Bentley iTwin Ventures, and before that with $2.6 million of early stage growth capital.
At year end 2022, San Antonio, Texas-based Transect had 30 employees and could look to get to 50 to 60 employees in the next couple of years, with a more Series B funding round likely during 2024, she added.
The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022 created a “land race” for community solar and various other DG projects, Laine said, whose development can be accelerated using the Transect platform.
The energy communities piece of the IRA, where new DG projects are deployed in regions with decommissioning baseload power assets such as coal, provide a good use case for Transect’s system in brownfield developments where installations can receive an additional 10% federal credit in addition to the 30% solar ITC and 30% standalone storage credit, among other credits.
“What’s important right now is the way environmental permitting right now is not scalabale at all, [as] the typing up reports as a consultant is really inefficient,” Laine said.  “Now we have IRA goals of developing renewables on a land size the equivalent of South Dakota.”  
Project siting
Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Paces AI launched its geographic information system (GIS)-based project siting software product in August 2022, unintentionally at the same time the landmark Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law.
Founder and chief executive officer James McWalter tells pv magazine USA that the mapping and siting system provides parcel-specific project siting data in real-time to customers, to show the most ideal location for installing utility-scale and community solar projects. Another portion of Paces customers are transmission utility and grid system operator professionals.
Project development is growing quickly but 80% of U.S. renewable projects fail because they are built in the wrong places, costing $17 billion per year in project siting costs, he said.  Paces AI provides siting locations to customers in just a few minutes based on an accumulation of state, regional and interstate power and utility data.
A North Carolina utility solar developer recently found a prospective development site within 3 hours of using Paces Search, saving the developer “thousands of dollars” in consulting work as would have been previously necessary for project siting, McWalter said.
Paces found and combined over 2,000 acres of land with the same landowner for the development of the N.C. utility solar project siting, McWalter said, giving the customer site control on two sites in one-third the time it would have taken using the traditional consultancy route.
The N.C. solar developer has additional active projects and landowner engagement campaigns in Illinois for community solar, he said. With the new IRA Energy Communities definitions, the customer wanted to know which would be eligible for the extra tax credit.
Paces AI’s dashboard now includes search functions covering the various sub-sections of IRA adders, the solar ITC and standalone storage credit, enabling customers to find project sites that stand to see the highest rate of federal incentives over the coming years, McWalter said.
“From site control to notice to proceed (NTP), we allow users to use a single repository of information, handling all the factors data for a project’s success,” said McWalter. Paces can provide customers the top three factors that could impede or hold back the project based on risk factors.
Paces sources data from GIS parcel search engines as well as independent system operator and regional transmission operator databases, while the company also provides source details to all of the data it provides to customers.
McWalter co-founded Paces AI in January 2022 with Charles Bai, a former Facebook AI engineer, after a 15-year career in data science and analytics roles working at FactSet, Respondent and Hello Vera.
Paces has raised $2.8 million from a February 2022 seed funding from Resolute Ventures, Y Combinator, Climate Capital, and UpHonest Capital, among others. The company has about six full-time employees and will look to hire more full-time data and software engineers following another funding round later this year, he said.
Additional assets such as energy storage systems and EV charging infrastructure are also able to be recommended using the Paces platform, McWalter said.
Like Transect, Paces AI also provides a software-as-a-service access to customers using a subscription model.
