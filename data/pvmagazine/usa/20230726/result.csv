Buildings powered by solar energy should not exceed 10 floors in height if they have to achieve a net-zero energy performance.
This is the main conclusion of a study by researchers from the University of Toronto, investigating the technical feasibility of solar-powered high-rise nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs), specifically residential and commercial buildings that have very low primary energy requirements that are to be met to a significant extent by renewable sources.
In such buildings, the total sum of annual energy use is approximately equal to the total sum of the renewable energy produced on-site. “Net-zero energy performance in all-electric buildings will offset the emissions associated with any energy drawn from the electricity grid and hence achieve net-zero emission status,” stated the Canadian researchers.
The scientists pointed out that most net-zero energy buildings are either single-family homes or low-rise buildings, noting the difficulty of high-rise buildings in achieving NZEB status, due to their large floor area-to-surface ratio, which reduces the space available to deploy solar energy systems. “In a survey of 32 nearly zero energy buildings in Europe, only 4 had five or more stories, with the tallest one having seven stories,” they reported.
The group conducted its analysis by using as a main parameter the maximum energy use intensity (EUI), which is calculated in kWh/m2. They investigated different solar system configurations, including both the PV and photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) technologies, evaluating various geographical areas and building geometries.
For their assessment, the academics assumed a 40-floor building with a 40 m2 × 40 m2 floor area, a 3.8 m ceiling height, and a window-to-wall ratio of 50% on all the walls. “To cover a wide range of locations, climates, and solar potentials, 16 metropolises in North America are studied,” they explained, noting that they considered both PV and PVT collectors under two different scenarios.
In the first scenario, the whole roof area is covered with PV systems and all the walls are equipped with building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels. In the second one, all the available areas on the roof and walls are covered with PVT panels. “This study assumes that all the available areas on the roof and the walls, including the north-facing wall, are covered with PV or PVT panels,” the scientists specified, adding that their analysis also does not consider the shadow coming from the urban environment. “This assumption can be impracticable in many cases, especially for the roof, as other systems in a building, for example HVAC, require some of the available areas.”
The analysis showed that, under the first scenario, the maximum EUI permitted for net-zero energy performance ranges from 16.5 kWh/m2 to 24.2 kWh/m2. In the second scenario, the EUI is between 18.6 kWh/m2 and 27.8 kWh/m2. “Switching from PV to PVT collectors improves the EUI by 8 to 44% due to PVT being significantly more efficient,” the academics said. “Changing the building’s orientation to a non-square floor shape improves the EUI by up to 52% in PV and 63% in PVT scenario.”
They concluded that, in order to become NZEBs, buildings should not exceed an EUI of 50 kWh/m2a, which they said corresponds to a maximum of 10 floors.  “Conversely, if an energy intensity reduction to only 75 kWh/m2a can be achieved, the building height should be limited to 5–6 floors if it is to be NZEB,” they added.
Their findings can be found in the paper “Feasibility of achieving net-zero energy performance in high-rise buildings using solar energy,” which was recently published in Energy and Built Environment.

Sungrow Power Supply delivered the PowerTitan series battery energy storage system (BESS) to the project, located within a wind and solar hub in the Lower Colorado River Authority’s transmission network. The PowerTtan is a liquid cooled energy storage system that uses lithium iron phosphate battery cells and a liquid cooling system. Energy from the Revolution project will serve the ERCOT market.
Revolution has been under construction since December 2022 when Mortenson, an EPC contractor, broke ground. The project was energized last month, reached mechanical completion this month and is scheduled to begin operating later this year.
The project was funded with a $200 million credit facility through Aiga Capital Partners, an investment management firm serving North American-based companies in renewable energy, energy storage and other sustainable infrastructure sectors.
According to Mortenson, Revolution is expected to be one of the largest batteries in the U.S. and will begin operation in mid-2023.
“This facility will enable Spearmint to accelerate the construction of our projects currently under development, capitalize on our strong pipeline of development opportunities, and reliably deliver renewable energy to the grid for years to come,” said Andrew Waranch, founder, president, and chief executive officer of Spearmint.
Spearmint is also developing three additional BESS projects, known collectively as Nomadic. The three have a combined capacity of 900 MW / 2,000 MWh. The projects are located in Cooke, Galveston and Brazoria counties and were acquired in March of this year. Spearmint anticipates that the first project within the portfolio will reach notice to proceed in early 2024 and begin commercial operation within 12 to 18 months.

The cloud-based DERMS operates on Microsoft Azure.
The software is intended to enable greater amounts of distributed energy to participate on the grid, responding to periods of extreme weather or heavy electricity demand. PG&E said the software enables faster grid connections.
The platform, called EcoStruxure DERMS, collects and analyzes data for resources like electric vehicles, rooftop solar, battery energy storage, and microgrids. The data then provides grid operators with improved coordination and communication to help demonstrate and unlock the value of flexible grid resources.
Microsoft, Schneider Electric, and PG&E will work collaboratively to achieve a new utility-industry standard for integrating distributed energy resources at scale. The collaboration is an example of Schneider Electric’s “Grid to Prosumer” philosophy.
“A stepwise approach is key in [distributed energy resources] implementation to effectively handle short-term goals and prepare for the long-term vision,” said Schneider Electric.
PG&E serves more than 16 million people across Northern and Central California. The utility has over 700,000 rooftop solar customers and 55,000 battery energy storage customers connected to its grid. This equates to over 500 MW of local, flexible resources ready to efficiently coordinate electricity use.
The utility also has over 1.2 GW of grid-scale energy storage online, and that is expected to reach 1.7 GW by September 2023. It has contracts for more than 3 GW of storage to be deployed over the next few years.
PG&E is preparing the grid to power and support three million EVs on the road in its service area by 2030, with goals of more than two million EVs participating in vehicle-grid-integration initiatives. A DERMS software platform is a ready-made fit for coordinating these resources.
“This methodology empowers utility companies to digitally transform to achieve their sustainability, efficiency, reliability, and flexibility goals,” said Schneider Electric.
The three have identified several initial use cases for the system:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/26/replacing-coal-plant-with-largest-energy-storage-project-in-indiana/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,INDIANA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 26, 2023",Replacing coal plant with largest energy storage project in Indiana,"An Indiana-based utility company, AES Indiana, has submitted a request to build the state’s largest energy storage system at a semi-operational coal facility. The proposed site for the Pike County Energy Storage Project is the Petersburg Generating Facility.
The planned battery will have a peak output of 200 MW, with an “expected output [of] 800 MWh at 80% of discharge level,” according to the filings. This suggests the facility could actually house a 1 GWh battery capacity, with AES Indiana having access to 800 MWh of it. The utility has signed an engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) contract with Fluence, the battery manufacturer that will also lead the construction of the facility.

Source: RFP 2023 documents for Pike County Energy Storage Project
The 200 MW will be divided into two 100 MW units, each with a capacity to last for four hours. Each 100 MW segment will connect to its own 34.5 kW to 345 kW transformers, which will supply the Petersburg Substation through a single 0.6-mile-long, 345 kW transmission line. The project will occupy 26 acres of the Petersburg Generating Station property.
Despite Indiana hosting what is likely to be the country’s largest solar power project at 1.3 GW, its small scale solar sector has faced challenges. The music recently stopped playing when the state built its last net metering project, leaving the 17th most populous state ranking 19th in solar power deployed.

This battery is earmarked to replace capacity from Petersburg Unit 2, which according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, is due for retirement in June 2023. Ben Inskeep, program director at CAC Indiana, t he state’s oldest and largest consumer and environmental advocacy organization, suggested the facility ceased operations on May 31, 2023.
The Petersburg Generating Station started with Unit 1 at 281.6 MW in 1967, added Unit 2 at 523.3 MW in 1969, followed by Unit 3 at 670.9 MW in 1977, and completed with Unit 4 at 670.9 MW in 1986. The new owner, AES, retired Unit 1 in May 2021.
Units 3 and 4 are scheduled to switch from coal to fossil gas in 2025.
As part of their filing, AES Indiana has requested “timely cost recovery via a rate adjustment mechanism [that] is also consistent” with Indiana law. This implies that the project’s cost will be covered in the electricity rates of beneficiaries, with standard state mandated profit margins added atop the project’s costs.

The company expects the project to be online by December 1, 2024, as outlined in their proposed timeline.
AES expects the project to receive at least a 40% tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Energy Community clause. The utility projects that it, along with one or more tax equity partners, will own the facility. The filings indicate that once the tax equity partner achieves its internal rate of return, the utility will have the option to purchase the battery – a transaction typically occurring five years after commissioning, in compliance with the Internal Revenuse Service guidelines related to the Investment Tax Credit.
As the project nears completion, the utility will apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for approval to sell stored energy discharged by the Pike Project facility into the wholesale market. It will also seek authorization to sell capacity and ancillary services to AES Indiana. Upon approval, AES Indiana and Pike County Energy Storage, LLC will formalize a Capacity Agreement and Contract for Differences.
AES Corporation, the parent company of AES Indiana, holds a substantial 34% stake in Fluence, the battery manufacturer involved in the project.

AES Indiana pioneered the first stand alone utility scale energy storage facility in the MISO interconnect region with the 20 MW/20 MWh Harding Street Station Battery Energy Storage System, launched in 2016.

Solar modules are put through a variety of accelerated stress tests to evaluate these parameters. Through comparative test results, project stakeholders can select products best suited for a particular environment, location, or portfolio.
Quality
Hail durability
Top performers: JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Trina Solar
RETC’s hail durability test takes UL and IEC standards testing a step further, exposing solar modules to higher kinetic impact to reflect the risk posed by hail over a 25 or 30 year operating life. In addition to ballistic impact testing, RETC runs thermal cycle and hot-spot tests to reveal potential long-term module degradation.
The top eight performers in this category withstood an effective kinetic energy of 20 Joules or more. These modules effectively demonstrated resistance to a 45 mm (1.8 in.) iceball traveling at a terminal velocity of 30.7 m/s (68.7 mph).
Thresher Test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar Longi Solar, Runergy
The thresher test is a summation of a series of tests that places modules under a variety of vigorous environmental stresses to provide quantitative data behind degradation modes. Power drop, leakage current and visual observations are also made in the test.
The RETC test places backsheets, modules, and connectors through accelerated stresses. Thresher tests include humidity-freeze cycling, thermal cycling, damp heat exposure, static and dynamic load testing, and UV soaking. High performers in this category consistently achieved less than 2% of power degradation.
Performance
LeTID resistance
Top performers: Aptos Solar, Astronergy, JA Solar, Runergy, SEG Solar, Silfab Solar, Solar Space, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Relatively new cell technologies may experience long-term degradation associated with light exposure and elevated temperatures. This phenomenon, called light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID), is tested with a protocol of light soaking, followed by 75 C (167 F) temperature exposure for two 162-hour cycles to identify significant degradation (>5%). Subsequently, test samples are subject to 500 hours of 75 C temperature exposure followed by two additional 162-hour cycles.
Highlighted top performers demonstrated products that less than 0.75% power loss after 486 hours of exposure.
LID resistance
Top performers: Dehui Solar, Longi Solar, Merlin Solar
Light-induced degradation (LID), or power losses from sunlight exposure, affects some PV cell types but not others. PV modules exposed to LID losses rapidly lose performance over the first few hours or days of operation before stabilizing.
RETC notes LID resistance is highly correlated with cell type. Top performers were all monocrystalline silicon panels and experienced an increase in performance or a modest decrease amounting to less than one tenth of one percent.
Module efficiency
Top performers: Auxin Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Meyer Burger, Mission Solar, Qcells, REC Solar, Silfab Solar, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Module efficiency, or the percentage of incident solar energy converted to electrical energy, is a well-known and key metric for solar performance. It is highly correlated with cell technology and module design.
The top 14 highest scoring modules scored efficiencies of 20% or more. An N type TOPCon cell scored the highest at 25.8% efficiency, followed by a monocrystalline silicon module with heterojunction technology, recording a 22.4% efficiency.
PAN file
Top performers: Dehui Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Yingli Solar
The PAN file test is a module characterization test with 22 parameters set by the PVsyst modeling software. Project developers use PVsyst to evaluate potential sites based on energy production and financial performance.
The assuming filed test conditions of a 10 MW utility-scale solar plant in Midland, Texas with fixed tilt ground mounts and 500 kVA central inverters. Top performers in the PAN test achieved a performance ratio in PVsyst of 85% or greater.
Reliability
Damp heat test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
The RETC thresher test includes a damp heat test that exposes modules for 2,000 hours, double the amount required for product certification. The test evaluates a module’s ability to withstand prolonged exposure to humid, high-temperature environments. Taking place inside an environmental chamber, the test exposes modules to a controlled temperature of 85 C (185 F) and a relative humidity of 85% for a set amount of time.
RETC highlighted performers that experienced less than 2% degradation after this exposure.
PID resistance
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Qcells, Runergy
Potential induced degradation (PID) resistance tests rack-mounted modules in an environmental chamber, which controls temperature and humidity, and exposes them to a voltage bias of several hundred volts with respect to the mounting structure. Typically, exposure times range from 96 hours to as much as 500 hours. PID testing characterizes a module’s ability to withstand degradation due to voltage and current leakage resulting from ion mobility between the semiconductor and other elements in module packaging.
Nearly 28% of the test samples experienced less than 1% degradation over the test period. By comparison, less than 9% of modules achieved greater than 5% power loss.
Static and dynamic mechanical load test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
This test exposes modules to 1,000 cycles of +1,000 pascal and –1,000 pascal loads at a frequency of three to seven cycles per minute. Measurements taken after this stress test rate electrical performance.
This year, nearly 47% of the modules that RETC subjected to simulated wind and environmental stresses achieved less than 2% degradation in power. Roughly 17% of the total test samples experienced less than 1% degradation in power after the SDML sequence. RETC notes that the results in this category represent a modest improvement on a year-over-year basis.
Thermal cycling
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Saint Gobain, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Thermal cycle test calls for cycling modules in an environmental chamber between two temperature extremes—85 C (185 F) on the high end and –40 C (–40F)  on the low end. The RETC test runs 600 cycles, three times as much as the 200 required for certification.
Roughly 80% of modules in this test achieved less than 2% power loss, while only 2.4% had power losses of 4% or more.
Overall top performers
“To identify the best of the best, we reviewed and ranked the overall data distributions across all three disciplines: quality, performance, and reliability. The Overall Results Matrix on the right summarizes the results of this analysis, which highlights eight high achievers based on overall highest achievement in manufacturing,” said RETC.
