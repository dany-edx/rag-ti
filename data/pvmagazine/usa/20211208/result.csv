“With some additional testing, our technology would be immediately applicable to real solar installations,” the research corresponding author, Anish Tuteja, told pv magazine. “We plan on doing more extended experiments soon, where the coating will be tested for a couple of years on outdoor solar panels.”
The 50μm coating consists of an optically transparent surface that exhibits both extremely low ice interfacial adhesion and toughness. It was fabricated by using a solution of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil with a weight content of 60wt% to plasticize two common industrial polymer polyvinyl chlorides known as MC2 and MC6, respectively.
The two solutions were tested in a subset of 72-cell panels measuring 2x1m on a grid-tied PV system operated by an Alaskan utility in Fairbanks during the winters of 2019 and 2020. The tilt angle of the installation was set at 45 degrees to facilitate snow dropping, and all 16 modules used for the experiment were equipped with micro-inverters. Both the MC2 and MC6 solutions were applied to the module surface glass and structural frame.
The panels were installed four-up in landscape orientation and each column including coated panels was separated by a column hosting uncoated panels. “Data on snow shedding were collected by a research-grade camera positioned normal[ly] to each array and with a field-of-view sufficient to capture the full array of experimental panels,” the scientists explained. “In a matter of minutes, both the MC2 and MC6 columns showed accelerated snow shedding, relative to the uncoated control column, with snow coverage reduced by around 61% and approximately 32% on MC2 and MC6 [-coated panels], respectively.”
The uncoated panels, by contrast, remained completely covered by snow and ice during the testing period and were able to produce almost zero electricity. Snow removal caused by wind was minimal during testing, as winds with very limited speed were registered.
The scientists found that the MC2 solution achieves the best performance, resulting in an average snow coverage area of only 27.7%, while the MC6 solution was able to achieve an average of 45.4%. The latter was found to have lower mechanical strength, which also brought delamination to the panels. The former maintained its performance and stability over the 77 days of the experiment.
The scientists emphasized that the coating technology is able to shed different types of snow and ice and said it may also be applied to building-integrated PV. “The material costs are expected to be fairly low,” Tuteja told pv magazine. “I would estimate them to be less than $1 per square footage.”
The novel technique is proposed in the paper Facilitating Large-Scale Snow Shedding from In-Field Solar Arrays using Icephobic Surfaces with Low-Interfacial Toughness, published in Advanced Materials Technologies. The research group comprises scientists from the University of Michigan, the University of Alaska, and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/08/national-grid-renewables-closes-financing-for-200-mw-solar-project/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ILLINOIS",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 8, 2021",National Grid Renewables closes financing for 200 MW solar project,"National Grid Renewables announced that it has closed $98 million in tax equity financing from Bank of America to support its Prairie Wolf Solar Project, a 200 MW project that began construction earlier this year in Coles County, Illinois.
According to National Grid Renewables, Bank of America is the sole tax equity investor for the project and the $98 million investment entirely fulfills the tax equity funding requirement for project.
Construction on Prairie Wolf began in February 2021, and the project is expected to achieve commercial operation by the end of this year. Swinerton Renewable Energy is construction the project, and agribusiness giant Cargill has signed up to purchase the energy generated by the plant, under a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement announced in 2020.
The Prairie project is a bit of a unicorn, as far as installations in Illinois go. For starters, the project’s 200 MW of capacity will represent a nearly 33% increase in the state’s total installed capacity once it achieves operation. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports Illinois has installed roughly 685 MW to date.
The project also comes at an unprecedented size for the state, being not only the largest, but also one of just a few utility-scale projects in the state. Of the 685 MW installed thus far, the vast majority have been distributed residential and commercial projects, according to SEIA, with community solar gaining some traction as of late.
Prairie Wolf would mark a notable capacity addition in a difficult 2021 for the state, making up for some of the projects that were stalled as Illinois waited to approve a new solar incentive program.

The company said the financial products arm will expand access to underserved communities through a new line of products with expanded eligibility.
SunPower Financial offers a 0% APR for up to 25 years for qualified residential solar customers. The financing can also be applied to the cost of battery energy storage systems.
The new platform offers a max $150,000 limit for well-qualified customers. Credit requirements have been expanded, and now customers with credit scores of 600+ are eligible to be approved. New products for financing shared roofs, leased land, accessory dwelling units, and mobile homes are available through the platform, as well.
Many major solar installers opt for using a third-party financier, so SunPower’s move to create its own financial institution marks a significant pivot.
A 2021 customer survey run by SunPower showed that high upfront cost for installation was one of the leading reasons for homeowners not installing solar. The same survey found that 60% of homeowners overestimate the cost of purchasing solar when guessing what they might pay.
The survey also showed a strong desire for energy storage, as one in five homeowners said they worry about power outages on a weekly basis, and 88% listed resiliency during power outages as a top reason for going solar.
SunPower Financial will begin its launch in six states, representing about 75% of SunPower’s U.S. home solar market.

(MBUSI) received approval for an 80 MW solar project south of Montgomery, Alabama. The proposed project enters Mercedes Benz into a 15-year contract in which the automaker will receive all renewable energy credits (RECs) from the facility.
The RECs are expected to cover a significant portion of the electric needs of the automaker’s Vance and Bibb County production facilities. Alabama Power will receive the entire electric output generated by the project. The Letohatchee Solar Project is expected to generate more than $9 million in revenues and create about 300 construction jobs. Commercial operation is pegged for March 2024.
“As we ramp up battery production and electric vehicle production in Alabama in 2022, MBUSI is seen as a critical location for the Mercedes-Benz shift toward an emissions-free and software-driven future,” said Michael Goebel, president and CEO of MBUSI.
This project marks another step of growth of utility-scale solar in Alabama under the Renewable Generation Certificate program that was approved by the Public Services Commission (PSC) and reauthorized this year. Earlier in the year, the PSC approved another 80 MW solar project that Wells Fargo Bank, among others, contracted for.
Solar facilities are active in the Anniston Army Depot, Fort Rucker, and in Lafayette, and to date, the PSC has approved about 250 MW under the Renewable Generation Certificate program.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/08/derms-technology-allows-grid-connection-even-when-grid-is-at-full-capacity/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 8, 2021",DERMS technology allows grid connection even when grid is at full capacity,"A U.S. grid interconnection project has the potential to more than double wind and solar generation connections according to energy software provider Smarter Grid Solutions, which has delivered a U.S. grid integration project in partnership with AVANGRID.
The Flexible Interconnect Capacity Solution (FICS) project has connected three new 5 MW PV solar farms in Spencerport, New York to AVANGRID’s electric network using the Strata Grid Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) platform.
The application of the DERMS technology reduces grid integration costs compared to traditional connection costs and, according to the project designers, is believed to be the first-of-its-kind in the United States. The technology allows large-scale producers of renewable energy resources to connect to a power network even if the network is believed to be at full capacity.
Stuart McMahon, principal smart grid engineer at Smarter Grid Solutions, said, “Each of these three solar farms produce five megawatts of electricity – enough to potentially overload existing local grid capacity. In the past, they would have initially been rejected from being able to connect to the grid until structural upgrades were made to increase this capacity and ensure a ‘firm’ interconnection. The costs of these upgrades are commonly the responsibility of the energy resource developer – costing millions of dollars and making many projects commercially and financially unviable.
“Our DERMS technology allows large-scale producers of renewable energy resources like these to more efficiently connect to the electric power grid by removing this risk. The Strata Grid platform supports flexible interconnection agreements by applying real-time control capability to distributed energy resources – as demonstrated at the new solar farms in Spencerport. In a nutshell, it prevents additional renewable energy assets from overloading grid assets and, in doing so, optimizes grid capacity whilst avoiding the upgrades and resulting costs that would be required under a firm interconnection.”
The FICS project is one of AVANGRID’s several efforts to support New York’s Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative, which aims to change the way electrical grids work within the state. The Spencerport solar PV projects were initially approved for a combined 2.6 MW of firm connection. However, using Strata Grid technology, the full 15 MW interconnected.
Flexible interconnection technology has matured in the UK over the past 10 years, with SGS having successfully deployed Strata Grid DERMS technology across multiple utilities, including UK Power Networks, SP Energy Networks and Western Power Distribution. The FICS project may represent a launchpad for faster and larger renewable energy developments across the U.S. and European energy infrastructure markets.
