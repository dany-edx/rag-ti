https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/10/solar-expected-to-be-largest-source-of-u-s-new-generating-capacity-in-2022/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 10, 2022",Solar expected to be largest source of U.S. new generating capacity in 2022,"The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects 46.1 GW of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to be added to the U.S. power grid in 2022. Nearly half (46%) of which will be solar, followed by natural gas (21%) and wind (17%). The data is assembled by the EIA in a series of monthly and annual electric generator surveys, which ask developers to share their planned activation dates for projects in a five-year horizon.
Utility-scale solar Is projected to grow by 21.5 GW this year. The planned capacity marks significant growth from 2021’s 15.5 GW of capacity additions, an estimate based on the 8.7 GW of solar additions through October this year, and scheduled additions for the last two months of 2021 (6.9 GW).
Texas is expected to lead all states in utility-scale development this year, with 6.1 GW on the way, representing 28% of the national total. California is expected to add roughly 4 GW of generating capacity this year.
California’s development could speed up some, as the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a mandate to attach an additional 11.5 GW of renewable energy to the grid by 2025. Community choice aggregators in the state are actively requesting proposals for projects containing solar and long duration energy storage of eight hours or more.
The EIA expects a sharp, 84%, increase in battery energy storage this year, with 5.1 GW of capacity expected to come online. Declining costs, co-deployment with renewable generation, and added value through regional transmission organization markets are driving growth in the technology, said EIA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/10/alencon-expands-its-philly-rd-and-manufacturing-facility/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,PENNSYLVANIA",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 10, 2022",Alencon expands its Philly R&D and manufacturing facility,"Alencon, an optimizer manufacturing company based in Pennsylvania, announced that the company has completed a significant expansion at its manufacturing and research and development headquarters, located in Hatboro, just outside of Philadelphia.
As part of this expansion, Alencon has significantly expanded its R&D lab facilities to support the further improvement of its current products and development of new alternative energy power electronics technologies and products; improved the facility’s energy efficiency; and doubled the company’s staff, with many of the hirings coming during 2021, in anticipation of the expansion.
“The rapid growth of DC-based clean energy sources and loads such as solar, battery energy storage, electric vehicles, and fuel cells have created rapidly increased demand for Alencon’s DC:DC converter products,” said Alencon Systems President, Hanan Fishman. “Alencon is one of very few suppliers of the alternative energy hardware that manufactures its products here in the U.S.”
The upgraded manufacturing and R&D facility includes number of unique features, headlined by a dedicated 1 MW grid connection. Additionally, the facility has a rooftop solar array and over 500 KW of programmable DC power supplies.
Alencon’s R&D facility also includes extensive thermal testing capabilities, allowing the company to perform accelerated life testing under the harshest real-world conditions, ensuring that the products are devloped to meet a lifetime of potential conditions and usages.
The company’s manufacturing facility is a certified UL manufacturing plant that is regularly audited by the nationally recognized testing laboratories that provide UL certification.
Last October, Alencon was awarded its seventh U.S. patent for the company’s Bi-Directional Optimizer for Storage Systems (BOSS). BOSS is designed to enable the granular control of charge and discharge of individual battery racks through a process called galvanic isolation. According to the company, a galvanically isolated DC-DC converter serves the dual purpose of mapping PV voltage to battery voltage while” isolating the differential grounding schemes that could be present.”
Alencon described galvanic isolation as an effective method of breaking ground loops by preventing unwanted current from flowing between two units sharing a ground conductor. This feature is intended to improve battery energy storage system (BESS) safety by allowing batteries to float as intended by their manufacturer while being isolated from the rest of the system.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/10/washington-renewable-energy-advocates-support-community-solar-incentive-bill/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,WASHINGTON",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 10, 2022",Washington renewable energy advocates support community solar incentive bill,"Washington Representatives Sharon Shewmake and Liz Berry introduced legislation that aims to amend the state’s existing Production Incentive Program for renewable energy projects and and establish a new Community Solar Expansion Program.
The legislation, House Bill 1814, plans to expand the opportunities for low-income residents to access renewable energy through an increased focus on installing community solar projects in the state.
From 2017 to 2018, Washington State ran a rooftop solar incentive program, through Washington State University’s (WSU) Energy Program, which provided $110 million to customers who completed residential and commercial solar energy installations. The program led to the installation of nearly 7,500 residential energy systems, 380 commercial energy systems, and more than 100 MW of solar capacity.
While HB 1814 would also be run by WSU’s Energy Program, the focus of the legislation is on community solar, rather than residential rooftop systems, as community solar is generally more accessible to low-income customers who live in multi-family housing or who rent their homes.
The state is also behind on its goal of installing 115 MW of solar under previously-passed legislation, and the hope is that the new incentive program will spur development to meet that goal.
While the legislation makes some tweaks to the application period for the Renewable Energy Production Incentive Program and the incentive rates for certified projects, the core of the legislation centers around establishing new community solar project eligibility requirements under the Community Solar Expansion Program. Projects must be on “preferred sites” to protect natural and working lands. A new public utility tax credit was created, an amount equaling the low-income community solar incentive payments paid by electric utilities under the program.
Within the context of the bill, “preferred sites” refers to rooftops, structures, existing impervious surfaces, landfills, brownfields, previously developed sites, irrigation canals and ponds, stormwater collection ponds, industrial areas, dual-use solar projects that ensure ongoing agricultural operations, and other sites that do not displace critical habitat or productive farmland.
If the legislation were to be passed, beginning July 1, 2022, and through June 30, 2033, owners/administrators of an eligible community solar project would be able to apply to the WSU Extension Energy Program for certification of eligibility to receive a one-time low-income community solar incentive payment from a participating electric utility on behalf of, and for the purpose of providing direct benefits to, the project’s subscribers.
The total incentive payments allowed for community solar projects would be capped at $20 million, of which at least $2 million would be set aside for innovative approaches by nonprofit organizations, and another $2 million to be used for tribal governments.
This proposal has garnered the support of renewable energy advocates across Washington, including the Washington Solar Energy Industry Association (WASEIA). In December, Washington Senator Jeff Wilson introduced his own incentive bill, which focuses on residential incentives, however representatives with WASEIA have confirmed with pv magazine that they and a broad coalition of energy leaders across the state support HB 1814.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/10/rfp-alert-11-5-gw-of-renewables-mandated-by-cpuc/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 10, 2022",RFP Alert: 11.5 GW of renewables mandated by CPUC,"Three community choice aggregators (CCA) Central Coast Community Energy, Silicon Valley Clean Energy, and Sonoma Clean Power jointly issued a request for proposals (RFP) as part of a state mandate for 11,500 MW of decarbonized energy and long-duration energy storage.
The request comes as part of the pursuit to meet the state’s new Mid-Term Reliability procurement mandate, as well as part of an effort to reach each of the CCA’s renewable portfolio standards, emission reduction standards, and reliability requirements. Proposals are due by 5:00PM PST on the last day of 2022.
“With the rapid growth of CCAs in California, the work of fulfilling the state’s climate goals is largely falling on public power providers like Sonoma Clean Power,” said Geof Syphers, CEO of Sonoma Clean Power. “This joint solicitation will help us maintain reliability while the state phases out reliance on nuclear and natural gas power.”
California’s historic procurement mandate set forward by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) order D.21-06-035 was made to respond to extreme weather events and replace power from the Diablo Canyon nuclear facility, planned for decommissioning in 2025.
In accordance, the CPUC issued all load serving entities in the state, including CCAs, to procure 11,500 MW of renewable energy and bring it online by 2026. The issue calls for the three CCAs to procure more than 600 MW of additional net qualifying capacity (NQC) to come online before June 1, 2026. NQC means a power plant must meet the reliability needs of the grid, especially during peak demand hours.
The proposal calls for renewable energy generation sources like solar and wind, and long-duration energy storage with the capability to discharge over at least an eight-hour period.
Currently, the three CCAs represent nearly 900,000 customer accounts and serve more than 11,000 GWh of load. The organizations are locally governed public agencies formed under Joint Power Authorities, aimed at providing clean energy and reducing emissions in their respective regions.
