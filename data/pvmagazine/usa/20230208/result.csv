“The BLM continues to approve responsibly-sited renewable energy projects to help advance clean energy production on public land and meet the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a net-zero economy by 2050,” said Karen Mouritsen, the California State Director of the BLM. “The project will generate good paying union jobs, boost local economies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
The Desert Quartzite solar project will result in capital investment of $1 billion and supply clean power to roughly 120,000 homes. The facility is expected to create more than 900 construction jobs and is expected to reach commercial scale operations by December 2024.
Once complete, the project would likely place among the top 10 largest U.S. utility solar projects based on projects in development through 2024 to 2025, where projects range from 300 MW to 690 MW in total capacity.
Desert Quartzite anticipates using Canadian Solar BiHiKu7 650 watt (DC) bifacial monocrystalline PERC panels, SMA 4.2 MW inverter stations, horizontal single-axis tracking solar photovoltaic (PV) hardware and 150 MW / 600 MWh of battery systems.
The BLM’s Palm Springs-South Coast Field Office granted notice to proceed (NTP) to Desert Quartzite, LLC, a subsidiary of project developer EDF Renewables, to begin construction and operation of the solar project, which includes an on-site sub-station, switchyard, site security, 230 kV generation-tie line, and an operations and maintenance facility.
The federal authority said construction on the solar-plus-storage facility will begin in early February on roughly 3,000 acres of BLM public land. The BLM approved the Desert Quartzite solar project in January 2020 after a 2019 environmental analysis.
The BLM manages vast stretches of public lands that have the potential to make significant contributions to the nation’s renewable energy portfolio. Renewable energy projects on our nation’s public lands support the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, as well as Congress’ direction in the Energy Act of 2020 to permit 25 gigawatts of solar, wind and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025.
Desert Quartzite was initially developed by First Solar in 2019, but the integrated solar company sold its interest in the utility-scale project to EDF Renewables exclusively in March 2020, according to BLM documents.
In September 2021, community choice aggregator Clean Power Associates signed a 15-year power purchase agreement to purchase power from Desert Quartzite upon completion.
Clean Power Alliance is a locally operated electricity provider for 30 cities in southern California and ranks as the state’s fifth largest electricity provider.
In June 2021, CPA directors approved four contracts for 256.5 MW of renewable energy and 163 MW of storage. The contracts included one geothermal facility and three solar plus storage facilities, including Desert Quartzite.
PV Intel examined projects with commercial operations falling within the next three years, encompassing utility projects aimed at being wrapped up in the 2023 or 2024 timeframe since just entering the discussion within the last year. While 2020 to 2021 saw projects top out at 250 MW and 300 MW, the 2022 class of projects to enter the interconnection queue is roughly double the class of prior years, with many projects clocking in at 400 MW to 690 MW. 
According to the Energy Information Association’s database, as of December 2022 the largest operational solar projects (AC) include:

Now that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), containing $369 billion in climate and energy spending, is being implemented, the focus now turns to deployment and growth as solar energy takes center stage in the energy transition.
Since the IRA was passed, over 100,000 energy transition jobs have been created, many of which are manufacturing jobs in solar and battery energy storage. Already over $60 billion in private investments have been announced since the law went into effect in August.
“Over the next several years, these and future investments will lead to nearly one million American jobs and strengthen our domestic supply chain while reducing our dependence on foreign energy,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of American Clean Power Association.
Unemployment in the United States is now the lowest in over 50 years, marking a triumphant rebound from the job losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It currently stands at only 3.4%. Since Biden took office, over 800,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs have been created.
“Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again? For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs,” said President Biden. “Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs. Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies. But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth. We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.”
Annual U.S. energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% by 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and industry.
“By 2032, there will be five times the amount of solar that’s installed today, which is enough electricity to power every home east of the Mississippi River. People in every zip code will be breathing cleaner air and working in stable, family-supporting clean energy careers,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
President Biden went on to celebrate the plan to install 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the country by tens of thousands of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. He pointed to the fact that Americans can save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances. Over 20,000 infrastructure projects have been announced under his presidency, making updates to airports, bridges, transmission lines, and more.
“The renewable growth empowered by the IRA will only occur if we enhance and expand the nation’s electrical transmission network, which is inefficient, balkanized and antiquated in much of the country. We need a 21st century grid that is better able to withstand increasingly frequent severe weather events and can efficiently move power from America’s richest renewable resource areas to the population centers with the greatest electricity demand,” said Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
A report by Princeton University said the Inflation Reduction Act could cut annual emissions in 2030 by an additional 1 billion metric tons. This would represent closing two-thirds of the remaining emissions gap between current policy and the nation’s 2030 target of lowering emissions 50% below 2005 levels.
“It really makes me incredibly optimistic,” said Princeton’s Jesse Jenkins. “It doesn’t get us all the way there on its own, but it keeps us in the climate fight.”
Under the IRA, solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, the Princeton noted.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under the previous policy landscape. The Act may lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the Princeton study.

The funds, provided by Lilium, Applied Ventures, Temasek, and Catalus Capital, are expected to help the startup scale its high-power cells for electric aviation and prototype its fast-charge electric vehicle (EV) cells.
The batteries are developed with lithium-ion cells that have pre-lithiated silicon dominant anodes. Ionblox said the technology leads to a powerful combination of 50% greater energy density and five times more power over lithium-ion batteries, while enabling fast-charge times of 10 minutes. The cell performance has been verified by Idaho National Laboratory.
A rapid charge can power 80% of the battery’s capacity in 10 minutes. For a 300-mile vehicle, this means you can charge 240 miles in the time it would take to stop at a normal gas station. Idaho Labs tests of 12 Ah pouch cells confirmed energy density of 315 Wh/kg. The battery can operate 1,000 charge cycles at the C/3 charge rate while retaining nearly 90% of original capacity.
The company said the breakthroughs in battery capability are particularly well-suited for cutting-edge electric aircraft like Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircrafts (eVTOL), where weight must be minimized, and power output maximized. The large-format pouch cells of up to 50 Ah, which also have applications in ground EVs, are currently being built on Ionblox’s pilot production lines.
“The Ionblox technology enables one of the highest performance cells for eVTOL aircraft existing today,” said Yves Yemsi, chief operating officer at Lilium. Yemsi’s company will work to integrate the new battery tech into its conforming aircraft, the Lilium Jet.
“Test results to date are showing the technology will deliver not only superior energy and power density for the Lilium Jet at launch but also very good aging performance,” said Yemsi. Lilium said it will support continuous improvement and industrialization of the technology.
The battery provider received a development contract from the United States Advanced Battery Consortium to develop low-cost, fast-charge EV batteries. Ionblox is also partnering with Applied Materials for semiconductor equipment supply.
This second Series B round builds on a $24 million investment round in October, 2022. Founded in Fremont, California in 2017, as Zenlabs, Ionblox has more than 40 issued patents for pre-lithiation for all types of silicon-based anodes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/08/battery-supply-chain-state-of-health/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",Battery supply chain state of health,"From pv magazine global
Lithium-ion batteries can store energy from intermittent sources such as solar and wind generation, adding critical flexibility to the increasingly dynamic electric grid. But as the storage industry’s future brightens with new freestanding tax credits brought in by the Inflation Reduction Act, so does the spotlight on global battery supply chains.
The PV industry’s experience presents a cautionary tale: A recent report from the Solar Energy Industries Association found tightening trade regulations, designed to address labor concerns in the PV supply chain, contributed to a 23% decline in U.S. solar installations last year compared with 2021.
Policy shifts
An industry can adapt to such shifting policies, but this takes time, especially with so many moving parts. Anticipating and preparing for the future policy landscape, in tandem with the environmental, social, and corporate governance requirements of end customers, will be critical in realizing the storage industry’s full potential.
While trade policies in the solar supply chain center around a single element – silicon – navigating the upstream lithium-ion battery supply chain is an order of magnitude more complicated. In North America, electric vehicle batteries typically use nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry, whereas stationary storage applications commonly use the less energy-dense lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry.
Both NMC and LFP cells consist of many sub-components, such as the cathode, anode, and electrolyte, each of which have their own extensive material supply chains. Critical materials such as graphite, lithium carbonate, copper, and aluminum all require various levels of mining and processing and may pass through multiple countries before winding up in a utility scale storage facility or electric vehicle. Given that complexity, what can buyers do to prepare for greater scrutiny of their supply chain and to pre-emptively improve accountability?
Code of conduct
Potential regulation and growing consumer consciousness are putting increasing responsibility on battery sellers and buyers to build transparency into how, and with whom, they do business. The first step as a buyer is to clearly define corporate social responsibility policies by developing a code of conduct. This should set clear standards for topics such as labor practices, stakeholder engagement, and environmental impact mitigation. An equivalent code of conduct should also be developed for suppliers. By codifying values and company mission upfront, the appropriate tone for conversations with suppliers can be set.
Businesses without a corporate responsibility program to inform the drafting of codes of conduct should create one. This ensures their approved vendor list is limited to suppliers who align with their organization’s values. Two good resources for this are the ISO 26000 guidance on social responsibility, and the guidebook on responsible sourcing drawn up in 2021 by trade body the US Energy Storage Association.
Once a code of conduct is developed, appropriate language should be incorporated into supply agreements. The terms of supply deals should ensure that the code of conduct is applied to the supplier as well as to its entire supply chain, for all components. The language used must be binding and provide clear remedies if sub-suppliers are not compliant. Additional language, ensuring cooperation on other supply-chain related requests – such as facilities access and supply chain mapping – should also be included.
Supply chain mapping
The mapping of a battery supply chain is critical to identify potential risks, as tracing materials to the mine level clearly identifies all participating suppliers. This level of visibility enables buyers to determine which sub-suppliers may bear greater risk of non-compliance with their code of conduct.
The complexity of the battery supply chain and potential resistance of sub-suppliers to sharing this information makes mapping challenging. To ease identification, it will be helpful to initially focus on sub-components which bear more risk or have limited areas of production, and to pay less attention to those materials that are manufactured globally in great quantities, for example copper and aluminum.
Importance of audits
After negotiating for more transparency and access, and mapping the supply chain, it is important to verify that suppliers are indeed compliant with their contractual obligations. On-site processes and supplier qualification procedures should be reviewed and validated to ensure that the buyer’s code of conduct is being implemented in practice, rather than only on paper.
Before sourcing becomes even more complicated, there is a golden opportunity right now to incorporate more accountability into battery supply chains. Taking proactive measures to align purchasing with company values will pay dividends when new policies inevitably take shape.
This may present unique challenges depending on the size of businesses. A smaller company may have a harder time shifting its suppliers’ practices than a larger one. Ideally, coordination on uniform practices will ultimately utilize the industry’s collective bargaining power to push suppliers towards more transparency. The straightforward steps outlined above, meanwhile, can build resiliency to potential policy changes and meet consumer demand for responsible products.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/08/sodium-aluminum-battery-for-renewables-storage/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",Sodium aluminum battery for renewables storage,"From pv magazine global
Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have designed a molten salt battery based on an anode made of molten sodium (Na) and a cathode made of aluminum (Al) and sodium tetrachloroaluminate (NaAlCl4).
They described the novel battery as a low-cost, grid-scale solution for long-duration renewable energy storage and said the use of NaAlCl4 offers extra accessible capacity hidden in acidic chloroaluminate. They said the proposed battery chemistry relies on the sixth and second most abundant elements on Earth.
“This enables higher specific capacity and average discharge voltages than previous Na-Al batteries, utilizing two distinct cell reaction mechanisms in one battery,” the researchers said, noting that this second reaction, on top of the neutral molten salt reaction, is the crucial factor for the device’s higher voltage and capacity. “Specifically, after 345 charge/discharge cycles at high current, this acidic reaction mechanism retained 82.8 percent of peak charge capacity.”
The researchers assembled Na-Al full cells in the discharged state in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. They then closed the cells with stainless steel endcaps and sealed them hermetically by tightening a set of eight screws in a star pattern.
“The system design allows only sodium to move through the solid-state electrolyte to charge the battery,” they explained. “This flat cell design allows the cell capacity to be increased by simply using a thicker cathode, which we leveraged in this work to demonstrate a triple capacity cell with sustained discharge of 28.2-hours under laboratory conditions.”
The research group found that the battery achieves a high areal capacity cell of 138.5 mAh cm−2 at a high current density of 4.67 mA cm−2. The scientists said the battery could potentially achieve an energy density of up to 100 Wh/kg at a cost of $7.02 kWh.
“We have eliminated the need for nickel, a relatively scarce and expensive element, without sacrificing battery performance,” said Li. in reference to another advantage offered by the new battery design. “The aluminum cathode charges more quickly, which is crucial to enable the longer discharge duration demonstrated in this work.”
They presented the battery tech in “Unlocking the NaCl-AlCl3 phase diagram for low-cost, long-duration Na-Al batteries,” which was recently published in Energy Storage Materials.
“We showed that this new molten salt battery design has the potential to charge and discharge much faster than other conventional high-temperature sodium batteries, operate at a lower temperature, and maintain an excellent energy storage capacity,” said researcher Guosheng Li.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/08/reactivate-illinois-community-solar-program-enrollment-begins/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,ILLINOIS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",Reactivate Illinois community solar program enrollment begins,"Illinois residents can begin reaping the benefits of solar power offsetting steadily rising energy prices on their utility bills. Solstice Power Technologies, a customer management platform for community solar development, this week is beginning to enroll subscribers on three low-to-moderate-income (LMI) community solar projects developed by Reactivate, a joint venture of developer Invenergy and Lafayette Square, an impact investment fund.
The Reactivate program is specifically for income-eligible residents whose household must verify as 80% or less of the Area Median Income (AMI). Prospective enrollees can check if their household meets the AMI qualifications on Solstice’s website through the “See If You Qualify” prequalification form.
These projects provide benefits to income-qualified and energy transition communities and will deliver enough clean energy to power about 1,200 homes, providing customers a combined projected savings of $12 million over 20 years.
In addition to financial benefits for LMI and energy transition ratepayers, Reactivate reports that its projects will make important environmental contributions to Illinois’ climate priorities. Combined, the three community solar projects in development by Reactivate reportedly will generate nearly 13 million kWh of electricity per year, helping the state avoid 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions.
With 77% of Americans still unable to install rooftop solar, community solar bridges the physical and socio-economic barriers, providing the opportunity for more households to access local renewable energy with monthly savings on their electricity bill, says Solstice.
The Reactivate platform is among the first to collaborate with the statewide Illinois Solar for All (ILSFA) program, which spreads the benefits of low-cost, renewable energy to income-eligible Illinois residents.
Solstice manages the subscriptions of the large majority of projects underway. The subscription offering from Solstice and Reactivate will provide income-eligible residents with a deep community solar discount as well as an enrollment bonus from Solstice.  Eligible residents will benefit from monthly savings of up to 50% off the supply portion of their utility bill and enjoy supporting local renewable energy generation.
“By working with Solstice we will provide economic relief to Illinois households, which include some families deciding between the expense of their utility bill and feeding their family,” said Jordan Leventhal, senior vice president of product development at Reactivate. “The cost savings from subscribing to our projects could be a lifeline for those families.”
Based in Cambridge, Mass., Solstice Power reports that it has sourced more than $1 million in aggregate electricity savings by community solar enrollment and has shared over $250,000 in revenue to grassroots organizations who spread the word about community programs and energy justice. The company is a subsidiary of global energy infrastructure company Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and operates under Mitsui’s North American investment arm, MyPower Corp.
Lafayette Square and Invenergy formed Reactivate in January 2022 as a community solar energy platform supporting development in underserved communities. The platform will finance, acquire, develop, and operate solar energy projects primarily serving LMI communities and areas disproportionately affected by the clean energy transition.
According to Reactivate, the company isn’t limited to community solar projects, and will also develop small-scale utility solar projects, energy storage, building electrification, and EV charging infrastructure. Beyond project financing and development, the company attests that it is focused on creating development, construction, and operational focused jobs while focusing worker training efforts on traditionally underrepresented segments of the workforce and those transitioning to the renewable energy industry.
By 2030, Reactivate seeks to develop 3 GW of renewable energy capacity, save $50 million in energy costs for LMI households, sign 100 contracts with minority or women-owned contractors, and facilitate workforce training for 2,500 underserved workers.
The Illinois Solar For All program established incentives for eligible low-income homeowners and renters for residential properties, properties that house non-profits and public facilities, and community solar projects. The program purportedly enables participants to see no upfront costs, and ongoing costs and fees are expected to not exceed 50% of the value of the energy generated from the solar project.
Commercial and industrial customers are offered an incentive based on system size from ComEd, one of Illinois’ largest utilities. Systems of 2,000 kW of capacity and below are offered $250 per kW.
Like most states, Illinois makes solar exempt from property taxes. Like all states and territories, Illinosians are offered the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which cover 30% of system costs. The ITC is now available to many customers as a direct payment following new provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/08/linton-crystal-to-move-pv-equipment-manufacturing-back-to-the-u-s/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",Linton Crystal to move PV equipment manufacturing back to the U.S.,"At an event held last week in Washington D.C., European equipment suppliers and PV manufacturers discussed what a McKinsey & Company consultant described as a  $1 billion to $1.5 billion market opportunity in the U.S. as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act. The U.S. market opportunity is based on an assumption that 50 GW of PV manufacturing capacity will be added by 2030, according to Lawrence Heath, a consultant at McKinsey.
While many manufacturers have broadly announced on-shoring of solar modules, cells, ingots and polysilicon, Linton appears to be the first equipment manufacturer announcing a move to the U.S. In Linton’s case, it is a move back to its roots as a U.S. manufacturer.
Linton Crystal Technologies, based in Rochester, N.Y., specializes in the design, development, and manufacture of Czochralski (CZ) furnaces for producing monocrystalline ingots for the semiconductor, machined part, and solar industries. The company also still makes diamond wire saws, which is where it began, and it makes other specialized equipment for shaping and polishing ingots and cutting them into wafers. Now Chinese owned with manufacturing facilities in China, Linton has retained the intellectual property for the CZ furnaces, which will soon be manufactured in the U.S. The company plans to break ground in Q2 2023 at a location yet to be announced.
“We’ve been working on this plan for a while now and are looking forward to reshoring manufacturing to the United States,” said Todd Barnum, president and CEO of Linton Crystal Technologies. “As a U.S. company with Chinese ownership, Linton Technologies Group, the geopolitical issues have been difficult to navigate. Our company used to manufacture in Rochester and we’re eager to get back to the United States.”
The company said it intends to establish a manufacturing center to build and demonstrate its full line of equipment. This includes CZ furnaces for monocrystalline silicon ingots, both semiconductor and solar grade, and the machines for producing solar ingots and wafers, including wire saws and polishing equipment.
Linton said its initial investment of $10M will be used to add a new facility, establish a demonstration line, and build 1 to 2 gigawatts of production capacity, all by the end of year one. Initially the workforce will grow to more than 75 employees, with a goal of growing to close to 200 by the end of  year two. Back in 2008, when the company was still manufacturing in New York, it employed nearly 200 in its U.S. factory.
“I’m excited to break ground.  This creates more opportunities for our employees, new employees and their families,” Barnum said. “The IRA and CHIPS Act have created the pathway for manufacturing investment to fulfill the need for U.S.-made products. We’re going to meet that demand and we have the expertise to scale rapidly.”
Linton Crystal Technologies originated in Rochester in 1952 as a wire saw manufacturer, Hamco, and through a series of purchases became Kayex, a manufacturer of CZ crystal pullers. Linton has been the exclusive owner of Kayex technology since 2013. In 2020 the company moved manufacturing to China, and Linton China raised addition capital through its public offering on the Shanghai stock exchange. The company reports that it holds several patents, with others under application.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/08/50-states-of-solar-incentives-ohio/,"INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,OHIO",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 8, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Ohio,"The midwestern state of Ohio, nicknamed the Buckeye State, is the 34th largest by area and the seventh most populous. Ohio’s electric rates are still relatively low, currently at 9.76 cents/kWh, and petroleum and natural gas dominate the energy mix (77.8%), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Solar energy did not factor much in the energy mix until 2021, when the tide turned a bit, and utility-scale and commercial installations began to dot the landscape.

Changing landscape
Ohio currently has over 916 MW of solar installed, ranking 26th in the country, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Solar provides 0.9% of Ohio’s electricity, but that is expected to change, as SEIA’s projection is that nearly 8.8 GW of solar will be installed over the next five years, making Ohio one of the top five solar states in the country.
In addition to a growing solar industry, the Buckeye State is home to several manufacturers of solar products including thin-film manufacturers First Solar and Toledo Solar, racking manufacturer Applied Energy Technologies (AET), glass supplier Glasstech, and more.

Incentives
Like other Americans, Ohio residents who want to go solar can take advantage of the federal investment tax credit, plus the many potential adders offered in the Inflation Reduction Act. As far as state incentives go, the state has some catching up to do.
The state’s first net metering law was passed in 1999, according to DSIRE. At the time, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) required the utilities to credit excess generation to customers at the full retail rate. However, the Ohio Supreme Court declared this illegal in 2002, and the credit was dropped to the utility’s unbundled generation rate. In 2017, PUCO amended the net metering rules, setting a maximum size limit of 120% of a customer’s average yearly usage.
The state has an alternative energy portfolio standard (AEPS) that requires 25% of the state’s annual energy supply to come from alternate energy sources, half of which must come from renewables. In 2014 the state legislature passed a bill that made Ohio the first state to freeze its renewable portfolio standard, however, that ended in 2017 and the AEPS was scaled back in 2019. The AEPS includes a solar carve-out, which states that 0.5% of the state’s electricity must come from solar by 2026.
Ohio currently does not have community solar legislation.
County opposition
In 2021 the Ohio Senate passed senate bill 52, legislation granting county commissions the power to stop new wind and solar development projects in their tracks. After passage, ten rural Ohio jurisdictions banned large “single interconnection” wind or solar facilities in unincorporated areas. Clark County, however, rejected the ban. And while there are currently no utility-scale solar or wind facilities in Clark County, the door is now open for new development opportunities. Landowners in unincorporated areas of the county can lease or sell land for solar and wind development following the ban’s rejection.
Landmark installations
Hillcrest Solar in Mt. Orab at 265 MW is the largest operational solar project in Ohio. Developed by Innergex, the plant is powered by 606,480 made-in-Ohio First Solar Series 6 thin film photovoltaic solar modules. Hillcrest came online in 2021 and produces enough electricity to power 32,648 homes. It was one of six solar installations tied to Ohio’s controversial HB 6, which passed in July, 2021, and provided a bailout for uneconomic coal and nuclear power plants.
Stay tuned because what may be the largest solar installation in the United States is before the Ohio Power Siting Board. The Oak Run solar project developed by Savion would create over 3,000 construction jobs and generate up to $504 million in tax revenue over its lifespan, 60% of which would fund local school districts. If approved, it will be installed on 6,000 acres of land in rural Madison County, and construction would begin in 2023, with commercial operations coming online in phases starting in 2025.
Up next
The last stop on the pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives was in Indiana, and next we’ll head to North Dakota.
