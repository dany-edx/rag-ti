The funds support the Biden Administration’s goal of building out a convenient, affordable, and made-in-America national network of EV chargers. The plan calls for at least 500,000 publicly available chargers by 2030. 
“America led the arrival of the automotive era, and now we have a chance to lead the world in the EV revolution—securing jobs, savings, and benefits for Americans in the process,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. 
The EV market has taken off in recent years, with sales more than quadrupling during Biden’s presidency. Publicly available charging ports have grown 70%, and more than 4 million EVs are now on the road, said the Department of Transportation. 
Nationwide, the market is readying for a transition to an EV dominated road. Private companies have now announced more than $155 billion in the EV and battery supply chain. The $623 million in grants announced this week come as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocates $2.5 billion in spending for a Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program. 
The CFI is a competitive funding program that will fund 47 EV charging and alternative-fueling infrastructure projects in 22 states and Puerto Rico, including the construction of about 7,500 EV charging ports. The program complements the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program to build the “backbone” of high-speed EV chargers along the nation’s highways. 
As part of the $623 million grant funding round, $311 million will be invested in community projects, including on Tribal land in Alaska and Arizona. These projects invest in EV charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure in urban and rural communities, including at convenient and high-use locations like schools, parks, libraries, multi-family housing, and more. 
The remaining $312 million in funding will go to 11 projects along major travel routes across the nation. Described as Alternative Fuel Corridors, these projects are expected to fill gaps in the core national charging and alternative-fueling network. 
Project selections in this round of grants include: 
 “From my time working at the local level, I know that finding electric vehicle charging in a community is different from finding charging along highways,” said U.S. Transportation Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg. “USDOT is proud to make an investment that will provide Americans with convenient, straightforward charging options in their communities.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/12/solar-wafer-prices-stabilize-with-potential-for-future-price-hike/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 12, 2024",Solar wafer prices stabilize with potential for future price hike,"From pv magazine Global
Solar wafer prices this week held steady following four consecutive weeks of falling prices. FOB China prices of Mono PERC M10 wafers trended flat on-week at $0.241 per piece (pc), while Mono PERC G12 wafer prices remained at $0.356/pc.

The primary cause of stable prices is a notable reduction in the availability of Mono PERC wafers, according to numerous sources. Multiple wafer producers have reportedly aggressively decreased operating rates for Mono PERC wafers in favor of switching their manufacturing lines from Mono PERC to n-type wafers.
In addition, some small and medium-sized wafer producers that have been selling their Mono PERC M10 wafers at low EXW pricing of between CNY1.8 ($0.25)/pc and CNY1.85/pc on the Chinese domestic market have successfully lowered their stock, according to a market observer. Consequently, the low-price portion for such wafers has vanished, with the majority of the price negotiation focused on the mainstream CNY1.93/pc, according to OPIS’ market survey.
There have also been reports of an impending price hike for Mono PERC wafers in the market. Multiple sources stated that a slight and temporary price increase for Mono PERC wafers may occur as a result of their decreasing supply.
Furthermore, the wafer market’s total operating rate has decreased as a result of some companies’ unstable n-type wafer production lines. According to the projection of the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, China’s overall wafer production output in January might range from 54 GW to 56 GW, indicating a decline of 7.92% month over month.
According to a market expert, wafer manufacturers still try their best to maintain operating rates at a particular level despite the continuous wafer overcapacity. At present, polysilicon prices make up about half of wafer production costs, the source added, and went on to say that when polysilicon prices are nearly at their floor, it is essential for wafer makers to maintain specific operating rates to reduce non-silicon costs by as much as possible.
It’s an undeniable fact that the market for wafers is currently experiencing a severe overcapacity, according to a source in the polysilicon segment, who added that she is not optimistic about Chinese wafer businesses expanding into production overseas as one of the biggest obstacles is the high cost of producing abroad. Selecting a factory location in regions appropriate for labor-intensive businesses is crucial, said the source, who concluded that the best investment destination for this industry may still be Southeast Asia.

The Rough Hat project is proposed by Candela Renewables, which submitted a right-of-way application in 2019, and will be responsible for constructing, operating and decommissioning the plant. Located on approximately 2,400 acres, 38 miles west of Las Vegas, the proposal is to add 400 MWac of solar to the grid, or enough to power approximately 74,000 homes. The project is also intended to include up to a 200 MW battery energy storage system.
The project description states that the Rough Hat project would include solar modules mounted on fixed-tilt or single-axis horizontal trackers. An onsite substation would have one or more 34.5 kV to 230 kV high-voltage transformers, and the energy storage system would also be on site. The project would be connected to the Trout Canyon substation. During construction Candella expects to employ up to 400 workers.
“Public input on this Draft Resource Management Plan Amendment and Environmental Impact Statement is critical as we continue to evaluate the proposed project,” said BLM Las Vegas Field Manager Bruce Sillitoe. “The most useful comments concern the scope of the environmental impact statement analysis, potential alternatives, and identification of relevant information and studies.”
The project is intended to provide electricity to both Nevada and California. It supports Nevada’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS), which requires that 25% of all electricity generated in Nevada come from renewable sources by 2025 and 50% by 2030. The California Senate passed SB 100, which sets the state’s RPS requirement at 60% by 203, with a goal of 100% from renewable and carbon-free sources by 2045. The Rough Hat project also supports the federal Energy Act of 2020, which permits 25 GW of solar, wind and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025.
The BLM is currently processing projects, which include solar, wind and geothermal, that have the combined potential to add more than 37 GW of renewable energy to the western electric grid. The BLM reports that it is also in the preliminary review phase of over 195 applications for solar and wind development, as well as 97 applications for solar and wind energy site area testing.
BLM will host one virtual and one in-person public meeting to discuss the Rough Hat Project:
Written comments may be mailed to the BLM Southern Nevada District Office, Attn: Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project, 4701 N. Torrey Pines Drive, Las Vegas, NV, 89130 or emailed to BLM_NV_SND_EnergyProjects@blm.gov. Comments may also be submitted using the “Participate Now” function at the BLM National NEPA Register project page.
The 90-day comment period will close April 11, 2024. For more information, please contact Whitney Wirthlin, Project Manager, at 725-249-3318 or email BLM_NV_SND_EnergyProjects@blm.gov.

Fortress Power announced its entry into the high-voltage energy storage residential market. It marked this milestone with the installation of its first residential Avalon System in late December.
The Avalon HV ESS system features a smart energy panel, customizable battery stack, and inverter. The system works inside and outside and is scalable up from 14.4 kWh to 176 kWh. It can be DC- or AC-coupled, with 200 A pass-through.
Operating at 200 V to 300 V at the DC terminal, the Avalon System closely matches PV array voltage, reducing the need for DC to DC conversion which, according to the manufacturer, enhances overall operational efficiency by approximately from 6 to 8%. 
The system includes a 7.6 kW or 11.4 kW inverter. It has four MPPTs with a voltage range of 80 V to 520 V and maximum input current per string of 16 A.
The Avalon Smart Energy Panel manages large loads in the house to stop the inverter from tripping. It can intelligently manage up to twelve different 120 V circuits, six 240 V circuits, or any combination, providing flexible whole home backup without a dedicated emergency power panel. 
With the integrated smart load panel, pre-installed AC coupling circuit, 200 A pass-through and straightforward EV charger installation, the Avalon System reduces the need for extra components, such as back up panel, AC combiner, separate smart load panel, bypass, and other, the manufacturer says.
Avalon boast a cycle life of more than 8,000 cycles and comes with a 10-year warranty. The system is based on tier 1 automotive grade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells.
Furthermore, for homeowners, Avalon could be turned into a source of revenue through the company’s EnergyBroker program by selling energy into wholesale markets.
“This helps achieve a shorter payback period while contributing to a more resilient and efficient power grid,” Fortress Power says.

However, according to findings published in MarketWatch, even these homes can come at a premium.
To find out which regions of the U.S. have the highest number of solar-powered homes for sale per 100,000 people and how much prospective buyers are paying for solar-powered residences across the country, MarketWatch searched Zillow. Using the keyword “solar,” they assessed how many relevant home listings popped up in specific states and cities relative to the local population.
MarketWatch used each listing’s page views and price details to calculate the average interest in the property and determine how much more a buyer needs to pay for a solar-powered home:  
MarketWatch attributes the high number of solar homes on the market in Las Vegas to the rapid growth rate of solar-powered developments in that area. Goodyear, Ariz., ranked high due to receiving 300 days of sunshine, making it ideal for solar, MarketWatch reports.
California had the highest number of solar-powered homes for sale at 6,014 listings, which MarketWatch also attributes to its regular exposure to the sun. Hawaii boasted the highest number of solar-powered homes on the market relative to the people at 23 listings per 100,000. The report authors state this is because its electricity costs are the highest in the nation.
The top nine U.S. cities that had the most interest in purchasing a solar-powered home were in California. These include properties in Irvine, Calif., which had 2,188 views per day, followed by Corona Calif., at 2,160 views and San Diego, Calif., at 2,151 views. MarketWatch states this is partly because of the rising costs of utilities in fast-growing cities. 
According to the study, buyers in Arkansas had the highest premium (91.5%) when purchasing a solar-powered home. Buyers in California pay an average 4.13% price premium on their solar-powered home, the lowest in the country.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/12/ev-owners-more-likely-to-install-rooftop-solar-on-homes/,"EV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"JANUARY 12, 2024",EV owners more likely to install rooftop solar on homes,"Owners of electric vehicles (EVs) are more likely to add solar panels to their homes, a new behavioral study analysis from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) concluded.
The study, funded by the DOE’s Vehicle Technologies Office, was based on a survey of 869 households in the San Francisco Bay Area, first in 2018 and then revisited in 2022. It found that around a quarter of EV owners also own a solar photovoltaic system, while only 8% of people who didn’t own EVs had adopted distributed solar. 
EV owners might have a tendency to also install solar since solar panels could help offset the energy costs of charging their vehicles at home, Shivam Sharda, a computational research scientist at NREL’s Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences, and lead author of the study, said. 
“Both EVs and PVs have a complementary nature, which might play a pivotal role in energy systems resiliency, addressing concerns regarding grid stability and power management strategies,” added Sharda. 
On the flip side, the research found that owning solar panels could also influence whether a homeowner buys an EV, although that correlation is not as strong.  
As of 2021, 3.4% of light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S. represented EVs, and around 6% of homeowners had deployed rooftop solar. As more EVs make their way on to the roads, they will also add to electrical demand. In this context, solar energy could present an important solution. 
Two aspects that could encourage a consumer to adopt either solar or EVs, or both include being cognizant of the technologies, and being social enough to ask about them, the study determined. For instance, if someone has a friend or family member who owns a rooftop solar panel or EV, they become more educated about the technology and its pros and cons, thereby influencing their decisions, Sharda said. 
From a policy perspective, while governments currently incentivize the adoption of both EVs and rooftop solar, the study recommended implementing strategies that could accelerate the deployment of the two technologies jointly.
“Because EV owners are inclined to use PV anyway, such incentives might provide a push for EV owners to adopt solar technology much earlier than what is currently observed. How soon a household adopts cross-sectoral sustainable technologies will play an important role in achieving decarbonization goals,” NREL said. 
The study also highlighted the need for additional holistic surveys to better understand the nexus of transportation and residential energy use. 
A 2021 consumer report from SolarReviews found that an EV would cost about  $1,058 per year when using a public charger, but that costs drop to as little as $415 annually with home solar – compared to the $1,260 a year it costs to fuel a traditional, gas-powered car. The report compared a gas-powered Hyundai Kona with an all-electric one, and found that during a 13,500-mile year, the former would cost $1,260 to fuel, while the latter, when charged at home, could cost around $662 per year in California and $450 annually in a state like Florida. In fact, over a 25-year period, charging an EV with home solar could save the owner some $16,250, the study concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/12/small-scale-solar-best-for-environment-but-agrivoltaics-may-be-the-answer/,"RESEARCH,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 12, 2024",Small-scale solar best for environment but agrivoltaics may be the answer,"A study conducted at the University of Western Ontario compared both large and small solar installations and concluded that small-scale solar systems are better for the environment than even the largest, most efficient, utility-scale solar project.
Solar is scaling up in both the U.S. and Canada in part because Today solar energy is the lowest cost form of new-build electricity in  many markets, according to a the energy and resources report by Ernst & Young, which notes that the global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar is 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative.
To eliminate carbon emissions and meet U.S. and Canada’s clean energy goals, many more solar panels must be installed. A study that looked at the agrivoltaic potential in Canada predicted we would need only 1% of Canada’s agricultural land to offset all fossil fuels for electricity generation if we installed large-scale solar farms. While this is a modest amount of land, the researchers at University of Western Ontario questioned whether it is better for the environment to have a few large-scale solar farms or many smaller rooftop systems.
The lifecycle analysis study conducted by Riya Roy and Joshua M. Pearce compared rooftop solar systems to multi-megawatt utility-scale solar PV systems from production to decommission. They found rooftop solar systems require 21% to 54% less input energy, make 18% to 59% less carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions, and consume a reduced quantity of water ranging from 1% to 12% per kilowatt-peak.
 
Thus the researchers calculated energy payback time of rooftop solar systems is approximately 51% to 57% lower than that of ground-mounted solar systems across all locations, with the main reason being that rooftop systems don’t required the racking or trackers used in large-scale projects. Plus they are usually closer to transmission lines, whereas many utility-scale installations need lines added or they must account for transmission losses if running a long distance.

The researchers determined that the carbon dioxide payback time was 378% to 428% longer for ground mount large-scale solar installations, compared to rooftop solar for the same modules.
The reality
While the research shows that small, rooftop installations are better for the environment, the researchers concluded that a mix of both is needed because there are not enough rooftops to meet electrification needs, if we take into account heating and transportation. Agrivoltaics, which is dual-use, offers advantages because it uses land for both energy generation as well as food production, according to the authors of the study.
