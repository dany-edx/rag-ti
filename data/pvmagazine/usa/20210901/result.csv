The supply contract secures more than 800 MWh of battery storage capacity on over 200 MW of storage systems, and delivery of the systems is scheduled for the second half of 2022. Specifically, RWE will be utilizing LG’s Energy Solution Grid-scale Energy Storage System, an integrated BESS comprised of pre-assembled transportable battery enclosures.
RWE Renewables has not made public yet exactly which of its upcoming projects are included in this announcement.
According to RWE, the company intends to leverage its energy storage technical capabilities to enhance LG Energy Solution’s offering by providing detailed project design, modeling, system integration and an energy management system software platform to ensure a safe and reliable operation of the assets.
This is not the first supply partnership between RWE and LG, as LG had previously supplied storage solutions for two smaller RWE projects in Texas in 2017.
Earlier in the year, RWE came to terms with Wärtsilä to provide a 40 MW/80 MWh DC-coupled solar-plus-storage system to RWE Renewables’ 200 MW Hickory Park Solar project under construction in Georgia.

Following multiple high-profile cases of PV installations damaged by strong winds, hail, and other extreme weather conditions, ensuring the ability to withstand everything the climate at a site will throw at a PV project in its 20-year-plus lifetime is high on the list of priorities for project stakeholders.
And the solar industry is rapidly evolving here. Testing standards are emerging to better simulate the effects of extreme weather, and assessments required by insurance providers and other project stakeholders are becoming more sophisticated. But there is still plenty that we don’t know about climate conditions and their potential effects on solar generation.
A research project led by the US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories aims to fill this gap in knowledge by collecting and analyzing field data from operating PV plants, and referencing this with weather data to observe the impact of various weather events. Their latest paper, Evaluation of extreme weather impacts on utility-scale photovoltaic plant performance in the United States, has been published in Applied Energy.
The group analyzed data from more than 800 solar installations located in 24 U.S. states. They used various machine learning methods, details of which are publicly available for other research, to draw conclusions about the most damaging weather conditions.
Analysis of words used in maintenance found that “hurricane” was the most frequently mentioned weather event, followed by snow, storm, lightning and wind. “Some hurricanes damage racking — the structure that holds up the panels — due to the high winds,” said Sandia researcher Nicole Jackson. “The other major issue we’ve seen from the maintenance records and talking with our industry partners is flooding blocking access to the site, which delays the process of turning the plant back on.”
Deeper analysis that also incorporated weather data from project sites found that snowstorms have the highest impact on PV production, a difference in output of 54.5% between “event” and “non-event” days. This also found that older solar projects are more vulnerable to extreme weather, potentially due to already being weakened by wear and tear.
While it offers valuable insight into PV in extreme weather, the group notes that events causing major damage – such as hailstorms – may not be listed in maintenance records, as they would go straight to an insurance claim to document the damage.
The group now plans to extend the scope of its study to include wildfires and prolonged extreme heat, and also to look at impacts on the entire electricity grid, rather than PV installations alone. “This analysis improves our understanding of compound, extreme weather event impacts on photovoltaic systems,” Jackson and co-author Thushara Gunda conclude. “These insights can inform planning activities, especially as renewable energy continues to expand into new geographic and climatic regions around the world.”

The DOE has set its sights on the task, dedicating $25 million, alongside a partner cost-share of $10 million, to launch the Universal Interoperability for Grid-Forming Inverters (UNIFI) Consortium.
Co-led by NREL, along with the University of Washington, and the Electric Power Research institute, the consortium will seek to unify the integration and operation of synchronous machines and inverter-based resources in electric power grids.
NREL said at the current scale of growth in renewables, inverter-based resources are fundamentally changing the physics of the grid by replacing traditional physical generators with fast-response digital devices.
Inverters are already working in concert with old methods of grid operation in many places. On the island of Maui, inverter-based resources like solar and wind are nearing providing 100% of local power, which comes with a new set of opportunities for optimizing the way the grid is operated.
(Read: “As Maui approaches 100% renewables, NREL models grid options”)
NREL said grid-forming inverters could enable renewable integration at scale with added security, resilience, efficiency, and affordability.
Over the next five years, UNIFI will build consensus on functional requirements and interoperability of grid-forming technologies through the unification of research capabilities and project objectives.
The consortium will use federated hardware test beds housed at partner institutions to demonstrate these next-generation power systems. This will include a facility at least 20 MW in size using different manufacturer technologies and operating scenarios.
UNIFI will also use its findings to produce industry-standard models and tools to facilitate growth in renewables, and will build training materials for the future workforce.

The pilot was developed by Joule Community Power and is similar to a traditional community solar pilot, but with a twist. As designed, the municipality signs up the entire population, leveraging the collective buying power at a scale large enough to secure better terms through a single competitive bidding process with solar providers.
For Brockport and Lima, six community solar farms will supply more than 3,800 households and small businesses with roughly 28 million kWh of electricity annually for the next 25 years, with roughly 500 of those households being low- and middle-income residents.

The program is also expected to reduce residents’ electricity bills by up to 10%.

The solar farms are expected to begin operation in October 2021—all residents will be covered by Spring 2022.
What’s more, under this pilot program homeowners who want to take part do not have to undergo a soft credit check, sign a contract with a community distributed generation, or pay separately for the solar credits.
Many more opt-out programs are expected to launch in the near future. 
As the program launches, however, National Grid and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) have filed a petition with state regulators that requests that National Grid and, eventually, all investor-owned utilities be granted authority to purchase and distribute a significant portion, if not all, of the state’s expected community solar resources.

In short, National Grid’s proposal looks to shift the program’s ownership model so that utilities own the community solar installations, rather than the communities served by the installation owning them. Not only does this partially devalue the community aspect of the program, but it could also restrict the ability for municipal leaders to dedicate savings from solar projects to their own residents and communities.
The proposal would place municipal leaders in direct competition with utilities, requiring them to apply for and justify to utilities their need to access community solar benefits for their own low-to-moderate income residents, even when projects are located on their municipal land.
The idea of decreased support for community solar projects is a particularly troubling one, considering how much success New York has seen with community projects.

The idea of decreased support for community solar projects is a particularly troubling one, considering how much success New York has seen with community projects.
In 2020, New York added 549 MW of community solar capacity according to NYSERDA, leading the nation. More than 90% of the state’s 2.7 GW pipeline of projects under development that have been awarded NY-Sun incentives, and are expected to come online in the next two years, are community solar, comprising more than 800 projects.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the next five years will see the U.S. community solar market add more than 4 GW of total capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/01/our-inertia-makes-us-vulnerable-to-disaster/,"DISASTER RECOVERY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2021",Our inertia makes us vulnerable to disaster,"Twenty years ago there was general agreement that a failure of imagination left America vulnerable to the unprecedented attacks of September 11. No one the day before that awful day could have foreseen using airplanes full of people as a weapon of terror. The terrorists’ imagination, it seemed, had advanced beyond the intelligence community’s.
Today, it is natural calamities–resulting in death, injury, economic hardship, and monetary loss–that are advancing at a pace seemingly faster than what we are able to–or perhaps willing to–address. People in places like Paradise, California, stand in stunned anguish in front of their burned-out homes; across Texas many lives were lost in a winter storm this past February. Economic losses are in the billions of dollars.
Now, as September gets under way, upwards of 1 million people in Louisiana are without electricity as a result of Hurricane Ida. The local investor-owned utility, Entergy, said that the August 29 storm brought “historic” wind speeds to south Louisiana, and resulted in “catastrophic” damage to its grid. Its transmission lines into New Orleans were knocked out of service, along with some 2,000 miles of transmission and local distribution lines.
The storm was historic, but its punishing effects should have been expected. After all, Entergy New Orleans went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization as a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, which struck the state 16 years to the day before Ida made landfall.
Recall that several weeks after Katrina, in September 2005, Hurricane Rita struck the Louisiana coast and did significant damage to Entergy’s transmission system. The city of Houston narrowly dodged a bullet after lines that served its water utility were damaged.
The “historic” and “unprecedented” arrival of storms continued. Superstorm Sandy struck the Northeast in 2012 with devastating consequences. Hurricane Harvey stalled over Houston for days in 2017, where it dumped torrents of rain and was blamed for as many as 100 deaths.
Hurricanes Irene and Maria tore through the Caribbean also in 2017, all but wiping Puerto Rico’s electric power grid off the map. Puerto Rico’s power outage lasted 11 months and the island territory–and its U.S. citizens–has yet to fully recover.
Further warnings of the perils climate change poses to the electric grid include the seemingly never-ending fire season in the West. Some of the fires have both been started by utility equipment and then consumed utility assets, along with  thousands of homes and businesses. Skies across the U.S.this summer have been tinted by smoke from western fires.
A near-master class in hubris was offered by Texas this past February when a winter storm crippled the state’s electric grid; the storm came exactly a decade after another February winter storm crippled the electric grid. Recommendations that followed the 2011 storm on how to winterize electric generating stations were largely ignored.
And this is not a 21st century phenomenon. The Northeast suffered blackouts in 1965 and 1977. More than 1 million Hydro-Quebec customers lost power in 1998 after an ice storm. And in March 1989, the same system suffered an hours-long blackout due to a solar storm.
The conscious act of responding the same way to disaster after disaster while expecting a different outcome may be seen as some as bordering on insanity. After all, the electric power grid gets knocked in a disaster and is rebuilt. Another grid disaster, another rebuilding project. Disaster, rebuild. Repeat and repeat.

We need to rethink our energy future to more nimbly adapt and adjust to the realities of climate change and catastrophic events. We need to start by scrapping our surprise and acknowledging that these events are “everyday” and “all too common.”
We also need to move away from the idea of centralized power generation and embrace instead  microgrids with islanding capabilities. In that way, rather than have hundreds of thousands of people without power, Louisiana might instead be addressing a far smaller number outages that can more readily and rapidly be addressed.
For a guide to what is possible, look no further than the work that the Smart Electric Power Alliance and others did to prepare a plan to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electric power network in a more resilient and reliable way.
I wonder whether either solar or wind would have done very well in 150 mph winds. But I note, too, that the photo near the top of this article shows an intact roof that can be seen behind the toppled electrical pole. With solar on the roof of that structure, it’s likely that people living in that building would have their lights on today.
Make improvements to the roofs of schools, fire stations, and other public buildings so they can accommodate solar. These can become places where people can go to recharge cell phones, store medicine in refrigerators, and access online resources to help them start the recovery process.
Battery storage increasingly is a viable option. And small modular reactors–which are largely modeled on reactors that have been powering the Nuclear Navy for decades–could offer a carbon-free baseload backbone to just this sort of microgrid.
An electric grid that was an engineering marvel has proven to be vulnerable starting in the 20th century and now is failing us in the 21st.
Billions of dollars will be spent in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida to rebuild Louisiana’s grid, just as billions are being spent in the West. The result will be a grid that remains vulnerable to a known–and inevitable–climate threat. Our failure to respond differently to this threat is not owing to a lack of imagination, or even insanity. Chalk it up to inertia; that’s almost worse.
As we reflect on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, we need to recognize the parallels that exist today in terms of existential threats and the human cost that results from our failure to adapt. We need to act decisively to protect our families, our neighbors, and our way of life from the threat that is at our door.

Set to be located in Monroe, Tennessee, in the north-central part of the state, Sunrise is developing the Dancing Horse Solar project with the aid of Earth-Right Energy, a Tennessee-based solar developer.
TVA’s Flexibility Program, launched in 2019, allows member utilities the flexibility to meet 5% of their power needs through local generating sources, like wind, solar, and natural gas, so long as they have a 20-year long term partnership agreement in place with TVA.
The program also covers distributed resources, meaning that, while not outright stated by LUB, the Dancing Horse Solar project will likely be a community solar project.
One aspect of the program that has caught attention is its 5% power need cap, as many of TVA’s member utilities have been asking for a greater commitment to renewables than what the company has demonstrated so far.
Jeff Dykes, president and CEO of BrightRidge, which provides electric and broadband services to Johnson City, Tennessee, told Public Power.org in 2020 that that the 5% mark is “just a start,” and that “It could become 20% at some point.”
When the program was initially launched, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) also took issue with the cap and TVA’s assertion that higher levels of flexibility created revenue erosion and a higher risk to the company’s financial plan. While understanding that the Green Investment program is a different construct than the Power Supply Flexibility Proposal, SEIA pointed out that TVA had recently claimed that 212 MW of Green Invest capacity for the Knoxville Utilities Board (KUB) would produce carbon-free energy equivalent to 8% of KUB’s annual electric load.
Essentially, SEIA was curious why 8% was economically feasible under Green Invest, but the figure is just 5% for the Flexibility Program.
Once completed, the Dancing Horse Solar project will provide energy to power over 1000 homes across Loudon County and Monroe County.
