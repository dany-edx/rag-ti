Forecasts show 2021 will represent a 21% year-over-year growth in residential solar as the market reaches 3.9 GW installed, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Residential SolarReviews released its annual review of the sector and noted a 130% increase in customer quote requests. This growth came despite a big year for 2020, in which many homeowners shopped for improvements to their residences.
The U.S. solar market has now surpassed 3 million solar installations, most of which are distributed residential PV, said SEIA. As commodity prices rose, costs took a small uptick in all solar sectors in the first half 2021, reports SEIA.
In a report built in partnership with University of California, Berkeley, SolarReviews found that 72.5% of survey respondents said the upfront cost of solar remains the most significant barrier to adoption. Primary motivations for installation included bill savings, followed by disaster resiliency and reduced carbon emissions.
With quote requests reaching new highs, SolarReviews released a home solar calculator, which allows shoppers to estimate the size of the system needed, storage options, and financing options. The tool will soon model cost and emissions savings associated with charging an electric vehicle with residential solar, said SolarReviews.

This year, SolarReviews reported a ten-fold increase in quote requests related to its guide on how to charge a Tesla at home.
Home battery interest and growth are ramping up nearly exponentially. The joint study found that in the span of five years (2016-2020), 71% of battery installations occurred in 2020. Installation totals for 2021 are expected to be even greater, said the study.
Interest in battery storage alongside solar is increasing, though only 11.5% of solar customer respondents to the SolarReviews – UC Berkeley survey said they have an attached battery.
SolarReviews also noted a sharp uptick in solar and energy storage quotation requests during extreme weather events. During peak wildfire season in California, it reported a 358% increase in quote requests. That figure was 850% during the Texas power crisis of February 2021, and the Pacific Northwest heatwave this June caused a 919% increase in home solar quote requests.

The company has committed to a minimum investment of at least $76 million and expects to generate more than 200 new jobs over the next several years at the 327,000 square foot battery system production plant. The factory is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2022, with multiple GWh of annual production capacity for Proterra’s battery systems. By 2025, the factory is expected to support additional battery system production capacity, as well as the production of ancillary systems incorporated into electric medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles and equipment.
Proterra’s new battery system manufacturing facility will be located at the 42.76-acre Carolina Commerce Center in Greer, South Carolina near Proterra’s electric bus manufacturing facility in Greenville, South Carolina. By opening the company’s first EV battery system factory on the east coast of the United States, Proterra will bring battery production closer to its customers and its own Proterra Transit electric bus manufacturing operations.
The new South Carolina factory represents the company’s third battery production facility nationwide. In December 2020, the company opened its second battery production site co-located in its EV bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County.
Proterra’s  ZX5 battery-electric transit buses are utilized by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, as it moves toward to a planned fully electric fleet by 2028. Proterra has, to date, delivered 25 electric busses to the agency, as well as five Proterra 1.5 MW fleet chargers with 104 remote EV charging dispensers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/14/li-cycle-to-upsize-rochester-hub-facility-in-face-of-growing-demand/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETING,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 14, 2021",Li-Cycle to upsize Rochester Hub facility in face of growing demand,"Li-Cycle, currently the largest capacity lithium-ion battery recycling company in North America, announced that the company will be expanding the input processing capacity of its Rochester, New York Hub facility due to rapidly-growing demand.
According to the company, the input processing capacity of the facility will be increased by about 40%, from 25,000 tons to 35,000 tons of “black mass” annually. The upgraded facility will have the capacity to process the equivalent to approximately 90,000 tons of lithium-ion battery feed annually, enough material for 225,000 electric vehicles.
Located in Eastman Business Park, the hub facility will refine battery-grade materials from a ‘black mass,’ using a wet chemistry/hydrometallurgical process. The mass in question will be sent to the facility from one of the company’s numerous Spoke facilities, and is composed of materials taken from spent lithium-ion batteries. The terms ‘Hub’ and ‘Spoke’ are used to differentiate the types of plants the company operates, with the commercial goal being that a handful of regional Spoke plants will produce ‘black mass’ for a regional Hub plant to then refine.
The Company estimates that the Hub will require a total capital investment of approximately $485 million, and has not yet clarified how far the expansion will push back the facility’s targeted completion date. The facility was initially pegged for completion in 2022.
“We believe the upsizing of our commercial Hub facility is timely, to capture growth from heightened demand with the mainstreaming of electrification in North America driving significant new battery megafactory deployments,” said Li-Cycle’s President, CEO, and co-founder, Ajay Kochhar.
Alongside the Hub, the Rochester location also houses a “spoke” facility, which was completed in December 2020. The Rochester spoke has the capacity to process up to 5,000 tons of spent lithium-ion batteries per year, which brings Li-Cycle’s total recycling capacity to 10,000 tons/year through its two North American Spokes. The company also has a Spoke facility in Kingston, Ontario, and has recently announced plans to build its third North American ‘Spoke’ plant in the Phoenix area, becoming the first such plant located West of the Mississippi.
Alongside the hub expansion, Li-Cycle also announced that the company has entered into a manufacturing scrap supply and nickel sulfate off-take agreement non-binding letter of intent with LG Chem (LGC) and LG Energy Solution (LGS).
Under the terms of the agreement, Li-Cycle will sell 20,000 tons of nickel contained in nickel sulfate and produced by Li-Cycle to LGC and LGES over 10 years, beginning in 2023. Additionally, LGES and Li-Cycle intend to cooperate on recycling nickel-bearing lithium-ion battery scrap and certain other lithium-ion battery materials to create a closed loop ecosystem. Nickel is essential for producing many types of EV batteries. Li-Cycle estimates that the amount of nickel that LGC and LGES plan to procure from Li-Cycle will be enough to produce lithium-ion batteries to power approximately 300,000 EVs.

Once the projects are completed, residents and businesses in the Portland General Electric (PGE) and Pacific Power service territories will be able to offset their electricity bills with solar energy contracts. The community solar program offers a 10% savings to low-to-moderate income (LMI) subscribers.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), in 2020 Oregon received 2.76% of the State’s electricity from solar. And with just under 1200 MW installed, or enough solar to power 158,675 homes, it was ranked 20th in the nation for solar installations.
All three Standard Solar projects are expected to commence construction over the next 12 months.
“This portfolio of projects contributes directly to Oregon’s clean energy economy by providing additional revenue through taxes, local economic development for the state and local governments, job creation and providing a clean, renewable energy source to residents, businesses and towns,” said Eric Partyka, Director of Business Development, Standard Solar.
Earlier this month, Standard completed a 3.3 MW solar project for school systems in Virginia. The project leveraged the Virginia Clean Economy Act, and is planned to provide over 50% of electricity needs to the school system.
In November, the company announced its plans to build nine community solar projects across Maryland, with a total of 24 MW in capacity. In September, Maryland regulators voted unanimously to expand the state’s community solar program, and to improve LMI access to community solar. All projects in this portfolio are considered “dual use” meaning that they will operate as solar farms and provide pollinator habitats.

Supported by the Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund (TSAF), about 200 kilowatts of solar capacity will be installed at single-family residences and apartment buildings at four reservations in San Diego County and Bishop, California, supporting more than 200 tribal members.
(Read “GRID Alternatives launches fund to solarize Native American communities”.)
TSAF addresses barriers by building renewable energy infrastructure. There is currently a disproportionate number of Native American households living in energy poverty, with 14.2% having no access to reliable energy, which is more than 10 times the national average.
The TSAF not only installs solar but GRID Alternatives provides hands-on training in solar installation, which engages broad tribal participation and builds climate resiliency.
“Solar energy and workforce training is critical to building energy sovereignty in tribal communities,” says Tanksi Clairmont, director of the Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund.
This project is part of a broader commitment by Sempra Foundation to expand energy access in underserved communities. In the fall Sempra and GRID Alternatives announced that they working to install solar projects to help improve energy access for communities in Mexico.
