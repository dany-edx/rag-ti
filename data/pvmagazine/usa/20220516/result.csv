Collaborating researchers invented technologies that go beyond conventional lithium-ion technology and have produced more than 30 patents now available for licensing. These patents are technologies including redox flow, lithium-sulfur, multivalent and solid-state.
“The portfolio of intellectual property we’ve developed illustrates our fundamental understanding of how to build, from the atomic level up, molecules that interact and create stable, functioning battery materials,” said Brian Ingram, Argonne materials engineer and JCESR researcher.

Although the market for lithium-ion batteries is booming, the technology is not without its drawbacks. Manufacturing is expensive, they can cause fires—and, therefore, require safety precautions. Lifetime is another limiting factor in current lithium ion batteries.
JCESR researchers are developing alternatives including redox flow, multivalent ion, lithium-sulfur, solid state, and lithium metal.
Redox flow
Redox flow batteries deliver lower amounts of energy over longer durations, compared to lithium-ion. Flow batteries use reusable, externally stored electrolytes, which can make them less expensive, safer, more flexible and adaptable when compared to lithium-ion. The DOE has funded development of redox flow technology as a part of its Long Duration Storage Shot. In studies conducted by JCESR, researchers discovered ways to make redox flow batteries more efficient and energy dense, and they have been awarded patents that address limitations in existing redox flow batteries and another emerging battery technology, non-aqueous flow.
Multivalent-ion
Multivalent-ion batteries can have a higher charge density compared to lithium due to the metals used. Magnesium and calcium, for example, are two of the metals and they are not only more abundant than lithium but are more sustainable. JCESR was awarded a patent on the development of a stable electrolyte that would maintain performance over time.
“The electrolytes that have existed within this space are stable only under a very narrow scope of conditions. With JCESR, we’ve done a lot to expand that stability range,” said Ingram.
Lithium-sulfur
Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries use sulfur instead of using a cathode comprised of nickel, manganese, and cobalt, (NMC). Sulfur has shown to have a much higher energy density, and it is very inexpensive. However, the challenge is that when Li-S batteries are discharged, there is a “polysulfide shuttle,” meaning that polysulfides can accumulate in the battery, thus reducing its cycle life. JCESR researchers have developing materials and processes to address this issue, and the resulting intellectual property includes patents for binding materials to prevent polysulfide material from diffusing throughout the battery, as well as for making sulfur cathodes.
“How sulfur is spread out within the cathode is extremely important. You want the sulfur particles not to be in big chunks but rather smaller pieces so that you can have more interfaces where reactions can happen,” said Lei Cheng, Argonne chemist and JCESR researcher. “In our patent we’ve put forward a process for making the sulfur in a way that maximizes the number of interfaces or active sites in the material.”
Solid-state and lithium metal
The advantage of solid-state batteries is that they can hold more energy and charge faster than lithium-ion, making them attractive to the electric vehicle manufacturers. They also have the advantage of using solid electrolytes, so they are non-flammable. Lithium metal is a type of solid-state battery, which has the same problem as solid-state, which is that they form dendrites that can limit the battery life and safety. JCESR researchers have patented a coating for the anodes that they developed in response to this problem. They’ve also developed processes and battery designs intended to enhance efficiency and extend the battery’s life cycle.

The LFP cells are expected to be integrated into Lion Energy’s set of products, including portable solar generators, and energy storage systems with residential, commercial, and utility-scale operations. 
ABF will provide high-capacity prismatic cells with outputs ranging from 50 Ah to 300 Ah. Lion Energy will begin with a 1.2 GWh supply annually, growing to 6 GWh annually over a five-year period. 
“Adding a scalable, onshore U.S. supplier for batteries is the missing link for energy independence; ABF and Lion Energy are dedicated to creating the pathway to 100% renewable energy,” said Frank Davis, CEO of Lion Energy. The US-based solar and storage provider is headquartered in American Fork, Utah.
In March, ABF announced it planned to set up a network of LFP fabrications across the US. The company was incubated by Lion Energy, a mobile battery and solar generator provider that reported $100 million in sales in 2021. 
The factories are designed with a modular approach, able to be constructed rapidly in 3 GWh “pods,” said ABF. “Pods” can be built on-site of pack integrators like Lion Energy, thereby localizing one segment of the supply chain. 
LFP batteries have known benefits in eliminating the need for cobalt, a key element that is connected to labor, environmental, and health concerns. Cobalt is also a key culprit in thermal runaway, which leads to fires in traditional lithium-ion batteries. LFP chemistries significantly reduce that risk, said ABF. 
“Pack integrators, energy solution providers and a host of other potential battery customers are in need of and searching for U.S.-based lithium battery manufacturers to help them diversify their supply chain as well as to unlock market opportunities that specify the need for onshore battery technology and applications, including home, business and grid-level energy storage systems, U.S. military applications and targeted e-Mobility uses such as trucks, buses, trains and agriculture vehicles.” Paul Charles, president and CEO of ABF. 
DOE funds for battery supply chain 
Last June, the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced $200 million in funding for EV development and the battery supply chain. Its vision for the next decade is the establishment of a secure battery materials and technology supply chain.

The DOE is directing the $200 million in funds via a blueprint by the Federal Consortium of Advanced Batteries, which outlined five goals. First, to secure access to raw and refined materials and discover alternatives for critical minerals. Second, to support the growth of a United States material-processing base to meet domestic battery demand. Third, to the nation’s electrode, cell, and pack manufacturing sectors. Fourth, to enable end-of-life reuse and recycling at scale. And fifth, to advance U.S. battery technology leadership through the support of R&D, STEM education, and workforce development. 
ABF said its batteries will qualify for “US-made” requirements and will support the above DOE goals. It said the batteries have applications in grid-scale, commercial, and residential energy storage, select EVs like trucks, agricultural vehicles, trams, e-bikes, etc. 
Off-grid power aids Ukraine 
Last month, Lion Energy announced it donated nearly $400,000 of energy storage systems, portable solar PV modules, and lighting accessories to Ukraine, supporting citizens who are defending their country from the Russian invasion. 
The company sent portable generators, including the Lion Safari LT and Lion Safari ME, portable power packs, and portable solar panels, including the Lion 100-watt panel. LED light build strings and solar extension cables were included in the donation. 
To Ukraine With Love, a non-profit organization built by a Ukranian living in the US, Svitlana Miller, received the donations. Miller has been collecting first aid kits, walkie-talkies, groceries, drones, and more. 
With centralized power compromised in many areas, Lion Energy’s portable PV and battery power station donations can help Ukrainians like Miller’s family stay in touch with their loved ones and have a source of lighting while the grid is knocked out.

This will supply the developer’s growing pipeline of solar-coupled and standalone energy storage projects across the country.
Under the terms of the MOU, Urban’s batteries will be supplied to Pine Gate to provide a choice in storage technology for Pine Gate’s development partners and customers, giving said customers the freedom to choose a technology that meets long-term reliability, energy and capacity needs.
The Urban Electric story began 12 years ago, when the company received an Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) Grant for $6 million to design something for the grid, specifically a storage solution that would be comparable in cost to pumped hydrogen, yet not as geographically exclusive. When looking at battery technologies and chemistries, zinc and manganese dioxide made the most sense, as both were already being widely used for battery cells and their supply chains were well established.
Over the course of years of R&D and testing,  the company was able to “freeze” the chemical change that naturally occurs in zinc alkaline cells after discharging by adding “certain doping agents like bismuth and copper,” finally achieving both high capacity and rechargeability. Urban Electric has since used this innovation to develop modular batteries that can provide backup electricity for personal use (under the Ohm label), may be installed in a home garage or basement, grouped as part of a commercial microgrid, or installed en masse at grid scale by an electric utility or independent power provider (branded as Zeus).
Urban Electric’s batteries are certified to UL standards as not subject to thermal runaway, and the cells that make up the batteries avoid several issues that have challenged battery expansion and adoption in the past, like high integration costs, short and uncertain supply, and geopolitical complications regarding the sourcing of required materials.
“We’re excited to partner with Urban Electric Power to bring zinc alkaline batteries, a familiar household item, and apply it towards grid-connected utility scale applications for our customers across the United States,” said Raafe Khan, director of Energy Storage at Pine Gate Renewables. “We are committed to supporting our partners and customers with safe, domestically manufactured, scalable, reliable, and durable solutions that they can connect with for their storage needs.”
Urban Electric’s battery solution is part of an ongoing pilot demonstration at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), replacing 20,000 pounds of toxic lead-acid batteries formerly housed at the center with a safer, environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternative, and more than doubling the available battery backup electricity.
According to Urban Electric, the goal of the project was not just to update the chemistry of the battery backup system onsite, but increase the amount of energy being stored, as the growth of the center made its initial battery backup system less effective in the event of an outage. There are 5,200 individual alkaline cells in SDSC’s initial installation, which stores 1 MWh worth of electricity and replaces an array of lead-acid batteries now being recycled. An additional 5,200 cells are on the way for Phase 2 of the installation, which is expected to be commissioned this summer at the San Diego site.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/16/california-solar-policy-misaligned-with-clean-air-boards-rooftop-priority/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 16, 2022",California solar policy misaligned with clean air board’s rooftop priority,"Regulators from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a comprehensive report outlining the state’s path to carbon neutrality, and chief among the recommendations was support for solar, specifically rooftop solar. However, regulators from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have been developing policies that are set to slash the value of rooftop solar in the state.
California’s rooftop solar industry represents over 1.4 million homes, small businesses, and other structures topped with PV. The state accounts for 50% of rooftop solar installations in the United States, and of the 230,000 people employed in the solar industry, as many as 68,000 jobs are supported by the state’s rooftop solar business.
Based on California’s clean energy goals, as much as 28.5 GW of rooftop solar needs to be installed through 2045, according to Environment California. If all this capacity were instead installed on land, 148,000 acres would be needed to support it, an area about half the size of Los Angeles.
However, current policies under development in the state, namely the Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 policy, are set to lower the value of solar in the state. The original proposal of NEM 3.0, supported by California’s three large investor-owned utilities was considered an outright disaster for those who supported the buildout of rooftop solar in the state. The proposal was delayed for a couple months after thousands of Californians took to the streets to protest the decision, which was labeled as a “tax on the sun.”
Now, NEM 3.0 is revisited, and it appears the policy still involves plans to reduce the value of rooftop solar, going in direct contrast to CARB’s clean air recommendations. The revised NEM tapers down the value for homeowners’ excess solar generation, using a “glide path” over four years to bring net metering values to the “avoided cost” for the utility, a fraction of what the utility charges for electricity.
It also introduced “non-bypassable charges,” which would add $0.05/kWh to a customer’s bill, whether or not they own solar. These charges would apply to the electrons generated by the customer’s rooftop solar array and delivered to their own homes. Regulations make it very difficult, or even illegal, to disconnect from the grid entirely in many areas in California.
This means that even if the customer completely self-consumes solar energy and doesn’t use utility-generated power, the utility will profit from the homeowner’s system via non-bypassable charges.
“Gov. Newsom should listen to the state’s top clean air officials, not the utility-captured electricity regulators, and use his authority to protect the state’s rooftop solar program,” said Environmental Working Group president Ken Cook.
“It is imperative the governor reject the plot by utilities to undermine one of the main pillars of CARB’s roadmap to ensure renewable energy is the dominant source of electricity in the state. Anything less would send a clear signal that felonious, corrupt companies like PG&E can decelerate California’s progress in addressing the climate crisis,” he said.
CPUC is continuing to take comments on the new proposals in the revised NEM 3.0 until June 10.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/16/a-fate-realized-1-tw-of-solar-to-be-deployed-annually-by-2030/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 16, 2022",A fate realized: 1 TW of solar to be deployed annually by 2030,"If it feels as if the solar industry has crossed a major milestone, that’s because it has. Cumulative industry deployments reached 1 TW of installed capacity sometime in Q1. And now, only a couple of months later, it is time to move on from these accomplishments and ask the industry, “what will you do for us by 2030?”

What is it we are asking for? One terawatt of solar power, installed each and every year, and forever thereafter, starting in 2030.
At InterSolar Munich last week, LONGi Solar, the global leader in solar panel manufacturing, projected that global solar deployment will reach 1 TW per year by 2030.
To elucidate this point, pv magazine USA assembled the chart below based upon BloombergNEF solar photovoltaics deployment data from the year 1980 through 2021. The vertical axis shows the amount of growth in each year versus the three years prior.

Based on 1980’s deployment volume of 7 MW divided by 1983’s volume of 20 MW, we saw 286% growth – almost tripling the deployed capacity in three years. This is an average that saw “slower,” 127% to 286% growth in the 1983 to 2003 period, which turned into explosive 224% to 661% growth from 2004 to 2013, before settling into 156% to 224% growth from 2014 through to the present.
The trend line shows that we’ve slowly been increasing deployment growth rates since 1980, and if we were to have actually doubled our deployment volume every three years since that 7 MW built in the 1980s, we would have built somewhere between 100 and 114 GWdc of capacity in 2021, instead of the ~183 GW which was actually deployed.
Looking at these numbers, it is easy to see how LONGi and others have arrived at their projections.
Several industry analyst groups have reported that global solar deployment in 2021 totals 150 MW of capacity versus BloombergNEF’s 183 GW. Starting with the lowest estimate, and assuming that installed capacity continues to double every three years, the capacity deployed in the near future will be immense:
Alternatively, if we start with the 183 GW deployment predicted by the venerable BloombergNEF team, we arrive at nearly 1.5 TW of yearly deployments in 2030.
Starting with the highest estimates, based on the energy war boosted 230 to 250 GW deployments forecast for 2022, we see 1 TW per year being deployed as soon as 2028.
Naysayers may claim that these estimates are simply a sales story from a company that seeks to sell more solar panels. That is a logical conclusion, but let’s consider another, more practical explanation. Perhaps this sales story comes from informed manufacturers and developers, readying their companies for the inevitable whirlwind of market demand.
This author sees the story of intense industry growth as a warning, not an advertisement. Perhaps by examining some corollary data we can confirm the story.
SolarPower Europe released their Global Market Outlook (GMO) for 2022 through 2025 capacity projections in time for the InterSolar conference. In just three years, SolarPower Europe predicts global solar deployments will more than double, to 2.3 TW in 2025.

Below, SolarPower Europe shares their historical GMO capacity projections, and how they’ve changed as deployment has sped up versus their seemingly ‘conservative’ projections.
The group’s middle-of-the-road growth scenario now points to 283 GW of solar power being deployed in 2024. This projection has increased several times, from 200 GW in 2020 to 239 GW in 2021 and it now sits at 283 GW.
One might reasonably assume that SolarPower Europe could increase their 2024 projections once more in 2023, and then again in 2024, possibly reaching 300 GW. That would fit right in with the anticipated 1 TW per year by 2030.

Skepticism appears warranted, and we can already hear our critics saying, “Predictions are easy, show me the factories!”
Can do.
Just two weeks ago, Tongwei said they sought to have up to one million metric tons of polysilicon manufacturing capacity by the end of 2026.
It was only a few years ago that global solar manufacturing produced ‘only’ 500,000 metric tons of the product. Now, on a timeline of only four years, we’re seeing plans for one company to potentially double the world’s capacity.
There have also been dramatic reductions to the amount of polysilicon required to manufacture solar panels. Only a few years ago, solar panels needed 4 to 5 grams of polysilicon to make one watt of solar power, supporting 100 to 125 GW of capacity deployed.
Today’s solar technology requires only 3 grams of polysilicon to produce that same watt. Technology has advanced so quickly that even this 3 grams per watt figure may be a conservative estimate.
Thus, by 2026, one million metric tons of polysilicon should be expected to support 333 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity. That’s a third of our terawatt needs, and about half of our 2027 medium-growth estimate of 600 GW.
Of course, Tongwei is not the only company seeking to massively expand their polysilicon capacity. LONGi Solar and others have made similar announcements. They are only two of several manufacturers readying themselves to meet demand and stay in control.
It’s time for us solar professionals to prepare ourselves, as well.

The pilot functions similar to a community solar program, with customers subscribing to a portion of a project in return for lower-cost electricity and access to renewable energy. According to GMP, the pilot is free to join, assuming customers meet the eligibility requirements, and will see the average customer saving roughly $150 annually.
According to research done by Energy Outreach Colorado, energy burden, the concept that LMI households spend a disproportionate amount of their income on energy bills, when compared to higher-income households, is significant, with such households experiencing an average financial burden brought on by their electricity bills three times worse than non-LMI customers. Households that meet or are below the 80% area median income threshold can see energy bills take up to 20% of their monthly income.
The pilot program will run using LO3 Energy’s Pando software, designed specifically for this type of program, offering compensation models to optimize renewable energy assets and ways to engage customers.  GMP customers who enroll in the program will be given access to a mobile app that will give a forecast of solar energy one to three days ahead to highlight opportunities to save more by using more energy when the sun is shining.
“Pando will help GMP’s customers subscribe to solar and optimize their savings by aligning their energy use with the sunniest periods,” said Bill Collins, CEO of LO3 Energy. “Pando’s platform means customers can easily participate in renewable energy without upfront costs or long-term commitments and can get information they need to shift their usage to solar hours and save more when it makes sense for them.”
LO3 Energy also provided the software platform for GMP’s peer to peer energy trading platform which allows businesses to purchase solar power from customers who own the rights to the renewable energy credits via a phone app.
Vermonters interested in signing up for the program or learning more can contact GMP at sunmatch@greenmountainpower.com or sign up here. Customers must meet the eligibility requirements for seasonal fuel assistance and have a gross household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty level.

Soon the original 18.6 MW installation will be supplemented with a 6 MW/h energy storage system. Ameresco owns and operates the plant and has been supplying electricity generated to the US Army under a 25-year power purchase agreement, which at the time was expected to meet around 12% of Fort Detrick’s annual electric demand.
LS Energy Solutions (LS-ES) has contracted with Ameresco to supply the AiON-ESS energy storage system for the solar project to help further lower the garrison’s total electricity spend, achieved through participation in frequency regulation, demand response, and energy supply markets within PJM, a wholesale electricity market. The storage system will be microgrid-ready to support Army’s resiliency goals.
One of the Army’s resiliency goals is to install a microgrid on every installation by 2035. These will include renewable generation and large-scale battery storage, with the goal being able to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all Army installations by 2040. In addition, the Army aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half from its buildings by 2032, compared to 2005. Part of the plan is for light-duty non-tactical vehicles to be all-electric by 2027, and all non-tactical vehicles would be EVs by 2035.
The AiON-ESS Energy Series is for 2- to 6-hour applications. It combines Ameresco’s fourth-generation String Inverter System (SIS) with Tier-1 lithium-ion batteries in a modular format that can be configured for different applications. The energy storage systems are UL9540 approved, indicating that they meet the highest safety standards for energy storage products.
“Our AiON-ESS provides all AC and DC energy storage functions in a single, easy to install and commission unit.  We look forward to deploying more of these systems with Ameresco in similarly critical applications,” said Steve Fludder, CEO of LS Energy Solutions.
The solar installation sits on a 67-acre site and has 59,994 solar panels with nine central inverters and transformers.
