Coal-fired power generation has fallen 55% from its 2007 peak to 2021, the report authors contend, and the accelerating closure of coal facilities along with the increased cost of natural gas is happening in parallel with the dropping costs of renewable energy.
In this third iteration of the Coal Cost Crossover, analysts tell a tale of an economic shift toward wind and solar, especially when considering the tax credits, loans and investment opportunities created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Noting that the IRA shines a new light on opportunities in energy communities, or areas burdened by existing coal plants, the report shows that wind and solar are “unequivocally cheaper than coal-fired generation across the country”.
The study finds that for more than three quarters of U.S. coal capacity, the cost per MWh of the cheapest renewable option is at least a third cheaper than the going-forward costs for the coal it would replace. Analysts compared the cost of operating each U.S. coal plant in 2021, totaling 220 GW of coal capacity across the country, to the estimated costs of building new solar and wind generation.
The conclusion is that all but one of the country’s 210 coal plants are more expensive to operate than either new solar or new wind. If the IRA’s new energy community tax credit is included in the equation, 199 of the 210 plants are more expensive to operate compared to local solar resources sited within 45 kilometers of the plant. Altogether, the study identified 205 coal plants have local renewable options that would be cheaper than coal-fired electricity.
The economic benefit would drive $589 billion in local capital investment, the study finds. One advantage to siting renewable plants near a retiring coal plant is that the new plant could make use of the coal plant’s interconnection, thus solving the problem of long interconnection queues.
The savings generated by switching from more expensive coal to cheaper clean energy can be used to finance other resources, such as energy storage. The study found that the savings generated by shifting to local solar could fund the addition of 137 GW of four-hour batteries across all plants, and 80% or more of the capacity at a third of existing coal plants.
The report authors point out the human health benefits in addition to the economics of swapping coal for renewables, and suggest that regulators and system operators do the following:
While coal-fired power generation is decreasing, from 2007 to 2021, the report contends that utility-scale solar and wind generation have increased more than 18,000% and 1,000%, respectively, as costs declined by 90% for solar and 72% for wind. And while these numbers are staggering, it is the new federal tax credits in the IRA make the economic case for replacing coal with clean energy unequivocal, according to the report authors.
The combined impacts of energy community, labor, and domestic content bonuses reshape solar economics in coal communities. The study finds that the median cost of new solar in these communities is about $24/MWh with low variance, while the median marginal cost of coal is $36/MWh with higher variance. This cost differential provides significant headroom for additional battery storage, which can also qualify for energy community bonuses.

The analysts found that investment in local solar resources could drive $589 billion in capital investment to energy communities across the country. The map above shows the solar cpacity needed in each state to rpvode enough energy to make up for coal generation.
The report authors followed up on their local solar scenario by looking at a solar-plus-storage replacement option for each plant that includes local solar energy plus four-hour batteries to provide additional capacity value and higher market profitability in some cases. The conclusion was that the savings available from switching from coal generation to local solar generation can finance 137 GW of four-hour battery capacity at a price of $330/kWh across the coal fleet.
The analysts found that for more than a third of the coal capacity studied, in addition to energy generation replacement with local solar, 80% or more of the plant’s capacity can be replaced with four-hour batteries at a combined levelized cost that is still less than the going-forward cost of the plant. For the remaining plants, the percentage of capacity that can be economically replaced is still quite significant: savings from renewable generation could fund storage at more than 50% plant capacity at 136 plants.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/30/massachusetts-program-accepting-applications-for-low-income-housing-solar-financing-and-assistance/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,MASSACHUSETTS",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 30, 2023",Assistance for solar on low-income housing in Massachusetts,"The Massachusetts-based Solar Technical Assistance Retrofit (STAR) program is entering its third phase with a goal to support the development of 3 MW of low-income housing solar.
Launched by Resonant Energy, the Boston branch of Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations, the STAR program offers financial and technical assistance to affordable housing organizations, catalyzing the exploration of solar PV potential and breaking down barriers to adoption.
Over the last two years, the STAR program analyzed the portfolios of 31 affordable housing providers, encompassing more than 900 buildings. In the first two phases of the program, housing providers have committed to a total of 4.9 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) across 113 rooftops, which is more than 20% higher than the program’s initial goal. These projects represent nearly $11 million in lifetime savings for owners and reduce carbon emissions equivalent to taking 879 cars off of the road.
One of the unique challenges that has made adding solar difficult for affordable housing developers in the past is the coordination of the review and consent process with all of the lenders and investors affiliated with their sites. The campaign organizers have been working with these parties to help streamline this process and have built extra staffing time into the process to help alleviate this burden on developers hoping to take the next step toward clean energy.
As the application period for the third phase of the program kicks off, some of the first projects from phase one have been installed and are beginning to produce power. More than a dozen phase one projects are scheduled for construction this spring.
In the second phase of the program, STAR supported seven nonprofit housing owners with successful funding applications to the Department of Environmental Protection Gap Energy Grant program, leading to $1.2 million in grant funding for solar and storage across the state.
“Without the expert assistance and flexible financing options through the STAR program, a shift of this magnitude would have been extremely difficult for us,” said Rafael Mares, Executive Director of The Neighborhood Developers (TND). “The STAR program provided the perfect opportunity for us to transition more than a dozen buildings in our portfolio to using and producing sustainable energy.”
Now in its third phase, STAR will provide another 10 organizations with grants to perform solar feasibility studies with support from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s EmPower Massachusetts program and from the Jampart Charitable Trust. The phase three campaign has a goal of developing 3 MW of additional solar, leading to $250,000 in annual bill savings and $6 million over lifetime operations of the solar projects. One participant will be selected as a pilot to include battery storage to support future iterations of the program.
STAR will also be working with the Boston Housing Authority to analyze their portfolio’s PV potential and overcome legal, financial, and technical barriers to adoption. Findings and successful strategies from the analysis will be shared with all housing authorities in the state.
“Deploying solar energy is critical to meet the Boston Housing Authority’s goals for shifting to all-electric, healthy, sustainable buildings,” said BHA Chief of Staff Joel Wool. “Generating clean power at home will put public housing tenants at the forefront of the energy transition.”
The additional scope of work included in the Boston Housing Authority research is made possible by a generous donation from the Lauenstein Family Fund.
Efforts in this round of the STAR program will be supercharged by energy equity goals embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act. The policy now institutes a 30% investment tax credit value as a baseline for 10 years, with most affordable housing developments being eligible for at least 40% to 50% with energy community and domestic content credit-adders.
The policy creates options for nonprofits and public entities to receive cash in lieu of a tax credit for the first time since the 1603 Grant program (active 2009 to 2012) via the new policy’s “direct pay” provision.
(Read: “50 states of solar incentives: Massachusetts“)
“The Treasury has been directed to issue the final details of the Inflation Reduction Act in February 2023,” said Isaac Baker, Co-CEO of Resonant Energy. “We have already seen a dramatic uptick in interest in solar PV and expect interest to spike even further as the final rules come out and implementation begins. The savings estimates we’ll make in the coming year will likely nearly double anything we’ve seen in prior years.”
Housing providers interested in participating in phase three can apply here by Feb. 28, 2023. The STAR team will hold live office hours on Feb. 14 at 3:00 p.m. EST as an informational session.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/30/facebook-tops-1-gw-of-renewables-procured-through-apex-clean-energy/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 30, 2023",Facebook tops 1 GW of renewables procured through Apex Clean Energy,"Apex Clean Energy announced an environmental attribute purchase agreement with Meta (Facebook) for the full capacity of the 195 MW Angelo Solar project in Texas. The project is expected to support 100% of Meta’s regional operations with renewable energy.
Angelo Solar is expected to generate $31.7 million in tax revenue for the local community and at least $22 million in landowner payments. Approximately 400 jobs will be supported during construction. Angelo is slated to begin commercial operations in early 2024.
The partnership between the tech giant and utility-scale developer now exceeds 1 GW of renewables. Past projects include 80 MW with Altavista Solar; 200 MW with Aviator Wind East, part of the largest single-phase, single-site wind project in the United States; 175 MW with Lincoln Land Wind; 197 MW with Jayhawk Wind; and, most recently, 225 MW with Great Pathfinder Wind.
“We appreciate Apex’s partnership in helping us bring a total of one gigawatt of new renewable energy to the grid across Texas, Virginia, Illinois, Kansas, and Iowa,” said Urvi Parekh, head of renewable energy at Meta. “This new solar project will support our commitment to 100% renewable energy and will help bring jobs and investment to the local community.”
With over 3.6 GW of renewables installed through 2022, Meta remains the top corporate procurer of solar in the United States, growing its energy offtake by 380% since 2019. In early 2019 the social media giant had 177 MW of solar capacity contracted.
Microsoft will now jump from fifth-most solar procurement to second behind Meta as it announced a landmark 2.5 GW module purchase and project development plan with Qcells.
Corporate solar procurement is rising at a breakneck pace. Corporations in the United States have installed nearly 19 GW of on-site and off-site capacity, which doubles the amount that had been installed through 2019.
Recent growth is due to the expansion of off-site corporate solar procurement, which now represents 55% of all commercial solar use, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Almost 70% of all off-site corporate solar has been brought online since 2019. 
Solar assets procured by corporations cumulatively generate enough electricity to power 3.2 million homes and offset 20.4 million metric tons of carbon annually.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer of SEIA celebrated corporate adoption, saying it shows “the incredible flexibility of solar, whether it’s installed on a warehouse roof, on a carport or at an off-site facility.”
“From data centers to industrial freezers, the most energy-intensive business operations are turning to solar as the most reliable and affordable way to power their infrastructure,” said Hopper.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/30/rfo-alert-clean-power-alliance-seeks-solar-plus-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 30, 2023",RFO alert: Clean Power Alliance seeks solar-plus-storage,"Clean Power Alliance’s Power Ready Program is looking for developers who are qualified to build power resiliency in several Southern California communities.
Founded in 2017, Clean Power Alliance in 2017, is a community choice aggregator (CCA) that is reportedly the fourth largest electricity provider in California. CCAs are entities formed by local governments to take over procurement of energy in their jurisdictions. In California, CCAs were formed with the mandate to procure clean energy faster than the state’s mandate and has exploded across the state. The alliance reports that it provides 100% renewable energy to three million people via 1 million customer accounts in 32 member communities across Los Angeles and Ventura counties, as well as the unincorporated areas of both counties.

Power Ready is a community benefit program that the Alliance offers to its partner communities in order to make public buildings energy resilient by installing solar-plus-storage systems.
The backup power systems are needed for resilience against the rising numbers of power outages related to wildfires, public safety power shutoffs, aging infrastructure, and times of extreme heat.
To facilitate the program Clean Power Alliance has contracted with a developer-financier to build, own, and operate the systems for 20 years.  Initially, the Power Ready program will provide critical backup power systems to 12 public facilities throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties at no cost to participating communities.
Dedicated to the use of 100% renewable energy, the Alliance signed a 33 MW 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) in October with Fervo Energy for the delivery of geothermal power from a facility in Beaver County, Utah, to CPA’s 32 member communities. In September 2021, the Alliance signed a PPA for the Desert Quartzite Solar-plus-Storage project with EDF Renewables North America. The project combines a 300 MW solar project with a 600 MW/h battery energy storage system, and is expected to begin delivering electricity to CPA customers in February 2024.
RFO details
Proposers will be required to demonstrate that they have the qualifications, resources, expertise, and experience sufficient to undertake the project on a timely and cost-efficient basis. The successful Proposer will be required to enter into a 20-year PPA for all 12 sites, with CPA and lease agreement with each site host.
Mandatory Offer Forms will be required to submit a proposal. Offers will be evaluated quantitative and qualitative factors further described in the Power Ready RFO Protocol document, which will be released via email upon completion of the Registration Form.
A webinar for the initial submission round will be held on Wednesday, February 8 from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. PST. The proposer must first register before attending the webinar, which will discuss the Power Ready Program and RFO process. Second round submission Virtual Proposers Conference is to be scheduled the week of April 24 to 28.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/30/utility-scale-solar-opportunities-and-risks-in-a-post-ira-environment/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 30, 2023",Utility-scale solar opportunities and risks in a post IRA environment,"In this article we look beyond the headlines of the Inflation Reduction Act and at some of its pitfalls and direct opportunities for solar developers. Apricum is best known in Europe and the Middle East, but the US represented 25% of group revenues last year.  Our development clients eyeing the US should be mindful of the complexity in capturing these IRA-led opportunities.  Solar development is not an all-you-can-eat feast; familiar challenges mean only a few strategies are likely to yield immediate results when trying to capitalize on these opportunities.
The IRA has tilted the renewables industries on their axis. Many clients now debate the merits of US expansion: 10 years of policy certainty, with higher asset values, ends the inefficient policy lapse and extension cycle to allow developers, investors and other stakeholders to make longer term plans.
However, just like in Europe, supply chain constraints, long interconnection queues, and rising interest rates all create challenges to building successful projects and add uncertainty. Capturing the opportunities will require greater strategic insight than in other booming markets.

While the IRA has national application, this does not diminish the need for local market sensitivity. Some stackable IRA incentives will also only apply to local communities (ie:+10% for low-income or fossil fuel dominant communities). But the largest impact is from local energy market design and policies. Below we review the top four below with a developers’ eye.
The majority of the Texas population is served by ERCOT, an independent grid insulated from the rest of the country. Within ERCOT, which is not subject to federal regulation, developers generally have more flexibility in deploying infrastructure. The Lone Star state has a geographically zonal market structure, presenting very different opportunities for projects. Historically dominated by wind, in recent years solar and battery storage have grown rapidly. Unique characteristics such as a lack of capacity market, a highly open and competitive retail energy market, and the ability to build private-use networks, mean projects in Texas have unique requirements. For instance, many projects are financed using hedges instead of a PPA, or a PPA only for a portion of the total capacity, running the additional capacity as merchant power to capture spot market pricing that can be as high as $5,000/MWh during periods of high demand.
PJM is the largest system operator in the US. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Most large projects in PJM were given two year delays in mid-2022 while a new interconnection process was implemented. This pushed almost half of projects in development out to the 2025-26 timeframe. The result is an opportunity for patient capital, such as new market entrants from Europe, to cheaply acquire partially-developed projects whose domestic appeal has diminished with the later connection dates. Additional opportunities exist for projects connected at the distribution level with utilities in specific state markets. PJM projects in particular benefit from sourcing short-term PPA’s with local utilities prior to broader market access.
Historically one of the largest and most active markets for solar in the world, recent years have seen extraordinary growth of renewable projects paired with storage in California. The rise of Community Choice Aggregators is challenging the status of the big three in-state regulated utilities [PG&E/SoCalEdison/San Diego Gas & Electric] and creating opportunities for new contracts/customers. This is not as easy a market as new entrants assume. Challenges around credit and structuring exist with CCAs, and it’s never easy to surmount permitting obstacles for new projects of any type anywhere in California.
Like California and Texas, New York has its own single-state system operator, making project development somewhat more straightforward. Like California, New York has strong renewables and energy storage ambitions in pursuit of aggressive decarbonization targets.  Unlike the other states, opportunities for the largest solar developers are limited:  insolation quality is mediocre, and there are few sizable parcels of land suitable for large-scale PV deployment.  However, community solar and behind-the-meter markets are fairly robust, spurred by leading distributed energy resources (DER) pricing policies.  Moreover, given New York’s plans to add 9 GW of offshore wind by 2035, as well as significant intrastate transmission bottlenecks constraining the ability to serve New York City, the need and value associated with energy storage assets is profound.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/01/30/rmi-says-utilities-should-model-and-plan-for-distributed-solar-adoption/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 30, 2023",RMI says utilities should model and plan for distributed solar adoption,"The nonprofit consultancy RMI has recommended that utilities include in their resource plans granular projections of the adoption of distributed resources such as solar, storage, and electric vehicles.
States that require utilities to prepare resource plans every few years are shown in light blue in the nearby map.
Several utilities already use third-party models to forecast adoption rates of distributed resources, said RMI. Sacramento’s municipal utility has worked with Clean Power Research to deploy the WattPlan Grid tool, while utilities in California and Minnesota have used the LoadSEER model from Integral Analytics. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has used its dGen model, which is also available to others, in its utility-level decarbonization studies, and PGE Oregon has used its own in-house model called AdopDER.
Some of these tools are helping utilities avoid the need for some supply-side resources, RMI said.
Modeling the adoption of distributed solar and storage is one of several recommendations that would level the playing field for solar and storage in the planning process, which RMI presented in its report “Reimagining resource planning.”
Utilities should implement a distribution system planning process to complement resource planning, the report advised. Distribution system plans, already required in 21 states, can include hosting capacity analysis to identify circuits that can handle more solar without upgrades, the report said. The plans can evaluate “non-wires alternatives,” such as distributed solar and storage, that can defer or substitute for grid investments. And distribution plans can update the interconnection process for distributed solar and storage.
Including all-source solicitations in the planning process is required by “leading jurisdictions,” the report said. “Effective” all-source solicitations evaluate combinations of bids as portfolios, “to understand which combination of bids can meet the described need and perform best.”
Solicitations can be used at the beginning of the planning process, when the bids showing actual market costs for resources can be used instead of “assumed” costs, the report said. Or the generation needs identified through the planning process can be used to structure an all-source solicitation, “as the intended and integrated outcome” of the planning process.
Some of these recommendations would reduce opportunities for utilities to bias their resource plans against solar and storage.
To avoid burdening state utility commissions, the report suggested that some recommended tasks could be undertaken by other state agencies. A state’s energy agency, for example, could project adoption of distributed solar and storage, while a state transportation department could project adoption of electric vehicles, the report said.
“Instead of adding more requirements to the integrated resource plan, there is an opportunity to define additional planning activities with their own objectives, and the links among them,” the report advised, suggesting specific stages in the planning process at which the results of other planning activities could be incorporated.
Among other suggestions in its 76-page report, RMI said utility planning processes should “meaningfully” engage stakeholders, consider air quality and health impacts of various types of generation, and define and map disadvantaged communities to assess these impacts.
