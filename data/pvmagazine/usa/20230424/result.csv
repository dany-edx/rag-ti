Not only are there tax credits to assist with the cost of buying an EV, but production incentives are boosting the manufacturing of the cars, batteries as well as charging stations.
Building out the EV charging network across the country is seen as crucial to increasing EV adoption, as potential buyers may have “range anxiety,” the worry that there won’t be a charging station where and when it’s needed. To help build the network, President Biden set a goal of adding 500,000 EV chargers, which got a boost with funding announced that will accelerate the creation of zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) corridors that expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure.
Nick Esch, research analyst for Grid Edge at Wood Mackenzie, noted that public EV charging networks are crucial.
“We are seeing collaboration and integrations among EV charging networks both old and new, as well as significant local and federal policy support, and investment across the public charging market,” said Esch.
The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) is doing its part to alleviate range anxiety with a new interactive tool that shows where EV charging sites can be found at any of the United States’ more than 400 national parks, monuments and historic sites.
Developed in collaboration with the National Park Service (NPS), the tool is now live on the NPS.org website and offers up-to-date information on chargers. NREL researchers used the Alternative Fueling Station Locator to help create the map, and it has also automated data collection through an application programming interface (API). The laboratory collects daily updates on eleven different charging networks and the data is imported directly into the Station Locator. Data is also collected manually on any chargers not connected to a network.
“Developing an EV charging map for the National Park Service was a way to harness work that we already do at NREL to track charging infrastructure nationwide,” said Matt Rahill, an NREL software developer. “If we were starting from scratch, this project would have taken much longer. Instead, we were able to leverage the existing data from the Station Locator tool and tailor it for national park visitors.”
The NREL map includes some filters that let users customize the map to show a specific type of charger, the level at which it charges—from 120 to 240 volts, plus DC fast-charging levels of 400 volts or more. Users can also show only the EV chargers located near a specific park or monument. The map will show the hours the charger is open to the public.
“This tool is meant to streamline the visitor experience for those who want to drive an EV to a national park,” said Abby Brown, an NREL transportation project manager who serves as the Station Locator’s data collection lead. For a fuller portrait of the nation’s EV charging landscape and alternative fuel sites, she noted, visitors can check the main Alternative Fueling Station Locator map.
Private cars remain the most convenient way to travel to the National Parks, and The National Park Service is dedicated to carbon reduction by installing the infrastructure to support visitors’ electric and alternative fuel vehicles. The third edition of the Green Parks Plan, launched in 2023, outlines new steps to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and zero-emission transportation methods.
“The National Park Service serves as a model for environmental stewardship, but we can’t meet our sustainability goals alone: The public plays an integral role in this work,” said Jennifer Madello, division manager for NPS’ Park Facility Management Division. “The new NPS EV charging map, developed with NREL’s support, invites visitors to participate in and contribute to our goals of supporting net-zero emission transportation, climate resilience, and environmental justice.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/24/st-johns-santa-fe-college-undergoes-solar-and-energy-efficiency-makeover/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW MEXICO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 24, 2023",St. John’s Santa Fe college undergoes solar and energy efficiency makeover,"St. John’s College in Santa Fe, New Mexico announced it has partnered with Ameresco to undergo a comprehensive solar and energy efficiency upgrade. The campus-wide project is expected to save the college over $100,000 annually.
The multi-phase renovation will include the installation of a 1,670-panel solar project, as well as 20 electric vehicle charging stations in four locations. The solar array will be grid connected, linking the college’s solar production to the local utility grid, enabling it to store and utilize power as needed.
To date, completed projects include interior and exterior LED lighting retrofits, re-roofing and HVAC retrofits, boiler and air handling unit replacements and water infrastructure upgrades.
The updates are expected to help the college reduce its carbon footprint by 858 metric tons, equivalent to the emissions of nearly 100,000 gallons of gasoline burned or the electricity demand of 167 homes.
“Together, we’ve been able to identify areas of improvement that will have a long-lasting impact and help the college generate significant energy and cost savings, making room for funding allocations elsewhere,” said Bob Georgeoff, executive vice president, Ameresco.
The project was catalyzed by a senior gift from the college’s Class of 2019, which provided funding for an energy audit for the campus.
“The implementation of these sustainable solutions ensures that our campus facilities and student offerings fit the culture we’ve built our institution on,” said Mark Roosevelt, President of St. John’s College Santa Fe.
Solar schools
Colleges, universities, and schools across the nation are adopting solar and energy efficiency at accelerated rates. A report from Generation180 showed that solar on K-12 schools has tripled since 2015, and now 9% of schools source electricity from PV.
Energy is second only to teacher salaries when it comes to cost, according to NREL, and U.S. schools spend more than $6 billion a year on the line item. Solar presents an opportunity for schools to alleviate budget pressure, often at little or no upfront cost, freeing up funds for more educational benefits.
Schools often sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) when going solar, allowing the school to buy the electricity produced by the solar installation for 10-25 years at a discounted rate, serving up cost savings from day one.
The report found that 87% of schools enter third-party power purchase agreements, while the remainder own their systems. Nearly half (47%) of the public schools that have invested in solar are eligible for the Title 1 Schoolwide Program, which serves a large population of low-income students.
Across the nation, over 1.6 GW of solar capacity has been installed for schools, enough to power 300,000 homes annually.
Generation180 offers guidance for schools interested in solar in its Clean Energy School Leaders Network and providing educational resources and technical assistance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/24/google-and-edpr-announce-500-mw-distributed-solar-to-benefit-environmental-justice-program/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,OHIO,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 24, 2023",Google partners for 500 MW environmental justice-focused distributed solar portfolio,"Google and EDPR NA Distributed Generation (EDPR NA DG), the distributed generation business unit of EDP Renewables North America, signed a framework agreement supporting more than 80 distributed solar PV projects totaling 500 MWAC. According to data from S&P Global and BloombergNEF, this is the largest corporate sponsorship of distributed solar development in the U.S.
The deal aligns with an environmental justice program benefiting over 25,000 families in low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities. The initial focus will be on projects in the PJM Interconnection service area, which stretches from New Jersey to Ohio. The first projects will be built in Ohio, where Google operates a data center campus in New Albany and Google Cloud region in Columbus.
Google said at least 35% of the projects are planned to be built directly in LMI communities. Additionally, the company said at least 10% of the portfolio’s revenues will be redirected annually for up to 15 years as utility bill credits to more than 25,000 households facing a high energy burden. Google also plans to contribute Nest thermostats to select participating homes to further cut back on energy costs and encourage participation in demand response programs.
The initiative, named the Clean Energy Financial Benefit Sharing Program, will be funded, in part, through Google’s purchase of a novel renewable energy credit (REC) called the ImpactREC.
The ImpactREC leverages the landmark tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, and will provide direct investment into communities throughout the Midwest and Northeast, enabling economic benefits for LMI communities. Developed by the EDPR NA DG team in collaboration with Google, like other traditional RECs, the ImpactREC is generated in and eligible for the applicable compliance market. However, unlike traditional RECs it requires direct community involvement and LMI benefits.
“What we heard through interviews with local community leaders and Environmental Justice advocates was that the disproportionate impact of high energy burden remains a primary barrier to an equitable energy transition,” said Sana Ouji, energy lead, Google.
In addition to the ImpactREC purchase, the program includes the creation of a community impact fund valued at $12 million that will support initiatives reducing energy poverty in the communities where the projects are built.
“We are appreciative to Google for anchoring the ImpactREC and are looking forward to increasing participation throughout the compliance procurement community as our industry expands this product,” said Gustavo Monteiro, chief executive officer of EDPR NA DG.
Over the coming weeks EDPR NA DG plans to release blueprints that “will help make the ImpactREC the defining incentive methodology to enable localized renewable development linked with environmental justice,” according to Richard Dovere, chief investment officer of EDPR NA DG.
EDP Renewables is a global renewable energy producer, and its subsidiary EDP Renewables North America currently operates 475 MW of solar projects with 1.6 GW of solar projects under construction. The company also operates more than 200 distributed generation solar sites throughout North America.
In 2007, Google announced that its operations were carbon neutral and the company reports that in 2017 it became the first of its size to match 100% of its global, annual electricity consumption with renewable energy. Google  plans to decarbonize its electricity supply and operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy globally by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/24/biden-to-maintain-solar-tariff-pause-with-veto/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,CAMBODIA,CHINA,MALAYSIA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 24, 2023",Biden to maintain solar tariff pause with veto,"President Joe Biden is expected to veto a move by Congress to lift a two-year pause on tariffs for goods shipped from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, which are responsible for roughly 80% of the U.S. supply of solar components.
“The Administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 39, which would disapprove a rule issued by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) that temporarily suspends the collection of certain duties on imports of solar cells and modules,” said the White House in a press release.
The four Southeast Asian countries were allegedly harboring tariff-dodging products from China, which under antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws could lead to tariffs that range between 50% to 250% of the cost of shipped goods.
This looming threat of tariffs created an untenable level of risk that cascaded into cancelled and delayed projects. The effect was so stark that it led the Solar Energy Industries Association to cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year.
About 20% of utility-scale solar capacity was delayed or cancelled in the first half of 2022 due to supply problems and uncertainty. This uncertainty was temporarily lifted when President Joe Biden placed a 24-month moratorium on solar tariffs from the four nations on June 5, 2022.
This April, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 26-13 to end the moratorium and restore tariffs via the Congressional Review Act.
“We cannot allow foreign solar manufacturers to violate trade laws, especially when it comes at the expense of American workers and American businesses,” said Representative Dan Kildee (D-MI).
The tariff exemption applies to modules that are imported before June 6, 2024, or modules installed on project sites before December 2024. Biden’s two-year moratorium is meant to act as a bridge while U.S. domestic solar manufacturing ramps up, said Reuters.
“The United States currently lacks the capacity to produce solar panels and cells in adequate volumes to meet domestic demand,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association. “This strategic approach protects existing jobs while new ones are added, but it also helps sustain the robust environmental, national security and job-creating benefits offered by U.S. solar deployment.”
Commerce made a preliminary ruling in December that suppliers from the four nations are guilty of breaking AD/CVD laws. The final decision for this ruling is scheduled for May 2, 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/24/maryland-community-solar-poised-for-take-off/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,MARYLAND",,"APRIL 24, 2023",Maryland community solar poised for take off,"Maryland has a history of supporting solar and has set an ambitious goal of 100% renewable energy generation by 2035. Now the state is on track to expand a burgeoning solar market segment, community solar. Maryland’s new community solar bill provides an excellent opportunity to accelerate the state’s shift to renewable energy. Building on its 2015 Community Solar Pilot Program, House Bill 908 makes much-needed improvements to that program and makes the program permanent. This bill will allow Maryland to join the ranks of the 22 other states that have implemented community solar programs, offering access to solar power for both residents and businesses statewide.
The pilot program proved effective in kick-starting community solar initiatives in Maryland, and it is anticipated that it will provide energy to approximately 90,000 customers in the state before its expiration at the end of this year. The pilot also provided a valuable learning opportunity that has informed development of the new program.
Based on lessons learned during the pilot as well best practices employed by programs across the United States, the permanent program incorporates several upgrades that are formulated to revitalize Maryland’s community solar market. To avoid delays in permitting and getting projects built, the program calls for greater coordination between the Public Service Commission (PSC), utilities and the authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ) responsible for project queues. The program is expected to be more inclusive and less limiting than the pilot, ensuring that solar access is more equitable. Furthermore, establishing a permanent program will provide the essential policy certainty required for any solar initiative to thrive.
The new program will allow for broader participation by all customers, including low- to moderate-income (LMI) households. It will require community solar projects to dedicate 40% of their solar generation to LMI subscribers. To make this goal more achievable, the program allows LMI customers to provide self-attestation of their LMI status, making it easier for them to sign up for community solar projects. The program also introduces consolidated billing, simplifying participation in the program and lowering the entry barrier by allowing customers to get just one electricity bill.
In addition to helping customers, consolidated billing and self-attestation for LMI will simplify the process for owners of community solar gardens to gain subscribers.
The program also makes significant improvements in project requirements. There is now additional system size capacity allowed on rooftops, parking canopies, parking structures, industrial areas, brownfield sites and on or over transportation or public rights of way. Also included are clean fill sites — land previously zoned for industrial use or was ecologically compromised, provided the site is not targeted for mitigation or restoration. Agrivoltaics projects, which combine farming with solar panels, will now be authorized to utilize co-location on farms, facilitating greater economies of scale for developers.
The new program will also eliminate the restrictive programmatic structure within the pilot and remove project categories, project-generating capacity limits, yearly programmatic and utility-specific capacity limits and sunset dates. Whereas the pilot had an overall cap of 580 MW, the new program’s total capacity is subject only to the state’s overall net metering capacity limit, allowing developers like Standard Solar to bolster community solar development within Maryland.
The bill is particularly significant for Standard Solar, as our company’s presence continues to expand in our home state of Maryland, contributing to delivering affordable, reliable, clean energy to Marylanders.
But the bill’s significance could — and should — go beyond Maryland. Community solar is an important market segment because it increases access to solar with locally generated energy, offering numerous benefits to communities. Combining the best elements of successful programs around the country, Maryland’s new community solar program provides a blueprint that other states can follow. As more states see the value of community solar and enact their own programs, having an example of a robust program will make them more likely to succeed in supporting this crucial market.
Given the pressing need to move away from fossil fuels and the numerous incentives for clean energy provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, there is no better time than now for all states to establish programs like Maryland’s.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/24/green-hydrogen-production-can-be-profitable-in-much-of-the-u-s/,"HYDROGEN,SUSTAINABILITY,MINNESOTA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 24, 2023",Green hydrogen production can be profitable in much of the U.S.,"Just months after passage of the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), power plant owner-operator AES Corporation and industrial gases company Air Products announced a $4 billion joint venture to build, own and operate a green hydrogen production facility in Texas with 1.4 GW of solar and wind capacity, that could qualify for the clean hydrogen production tax credit under section 45V of the IRA.
The project, to produce 200 metric tons of green hydrogen per day, is “financially viable” even without a grid connection, said the policy consultancy Energy Innovation in a report.
To identify other locations where green hydrogen production can be profitable, Energy Innovation modeled project economics and found that in areas with a “strong” wind resource and “decent” solar resource, these projects are “financially viable from the outset.”
The broader focus of the report is an argument for “smart design” of the section 45V production tax credit for clean hydrogen, to ensure that it fosters both low emissions and growth of the clean hydrogen industry.
The report discusses three types of clean hydrogen project designs that the authors suggest will qualify for the tax credit, by matching renewable generation on an hourly basis with the consumption of electricity by electrolyzers.
Electrolyzers use electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The U.S. Treasury is currently developing regulations to specify the requirements to qualify for the section 45V tax credit.
The simplest project design discussed in the report would use only on-site renewable power, as shown at left in the nearby image. The report also describes “export-only” projects that could sell excess renewable power to the grid and, at times of high market power prices, turn off the electrolyzer plant and sell all the power to the grid. The third project configuration, “detached,” would use grid power and could match its hourly use of power to hourly accounting of the emissions rate from grid power.



For its financial analysis, Energy Innovation modeled export-only projects with “oversized” wind and solar capacity relative to the electrolyzer plant’s capacity. Oversizing the renewable generation can increase the electrolyzer plant’s utilization, as indicated in the nearby image. The image also shows sales of exported electricity both at times of excess generation and when market prices for power are at a “premium.”

“Wide swaths of the U.S.” can support profitable green hydrogen production, the report says, where the cost of power from new wind and solar capacity averages less than $25/MWh, as shown on the nearby map.

Energy Innovation map of hydrogen production in the U.S.
For the three locations shown with stars on the map, Energy Innovation modeled project finances for an export-only green hydrogen plant. Most profitable was the West Texas location, achieving profits of $143 per kW of electrolyzer capacity per year, by powering a 1 MW electrolyzer plant with 3 MW of solar and 2 MW of wind. Next most profitable was the location near Houston, with profits of $85 per kW/year using higher levels of both solar and wind capacity, followed by the southwest Minnesota location with profits of $61 per kW/year using 2 MW of solar and 4 MW of wind.
Energy Innovation assumed electrolyzer capital costs of $1,400 per kW. Revenues would include hydrogen revenue of $1/kg, plus the IRA’s production tax credit and electricity sales. The cost of water was not a factor in the analysis. In each location, about half the electricity generated would be sold to the grid. The need for an export-only hydrogen plant to interconnect to the power grid, the report says, is “a process which can incur high costs, delays, and overall uncertainty.”
As electrolyzer capital costs continue to decline, green hydrogen projects will become economic in more locations over time, the report says. When those costs decline to the point that electrolyzers need to run only 20% to 30% of the time to be profitable, “solar-only projects will become viable.” The report says “this is a desirable long-term outcome,” because electrolyzers that run only in “very low-priced hours can help integrate higher shares of renewable energy onto the grid.”
To enable the use of hydrogen for seasonal storage of renewable power, Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development LLC are adding 300 GWh of hydrogen storage capacity in salt domes near the Intermountain Power Project in Utah, which sells electricity to the Los Angeles municipal utility.
Current industrial uses of hydrogen include production of ammonia, largely for fertilizer, and oil refining. Ammonia could also be used as a fuel for shipping. The Green Hydrogen Coalition says that green hydrogen could also decarbonize the production of steel and cement.

The executive order focuses on communities most affected by toxic pollution and disproportionate environmental harms.
The new order builds on and supplements the efforts of Executive Order 12898, signed by President Bill Clinton nearly 30 years ago. The new order states that environmental justice is the duty of all executive branch agencies. It directs agencies to better protect overburdened communities from pollution and other environmental harms. It aims to strengthen engagement with communities and mobilize federal agencies to confront existing and legacy barriers and injustices. The order directs agencies to identify and address gaps in science, data, and research related to environmental justice, and to make information on environmental and health concerns more publicly accessible to communities.

In addition, the order calls for a new Office of Environmental Justice within the White House Council on Environmental Quality. It also establishes the White House Office of Environmental Justice, led by the federal chief environmental justice officer, and its role will be coordinating the implementation of environmental justice policy across the federal government. Also established is a new Environmental Justice Subcommittee within the National Science and Technology Council, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
With the goal of increasing accountability and transparency, federal agencies will assess their environmental justice efforts and will also develop an environmental justice strategic plan. An environmental scorecard is one of the ways in which the accomplishments will be made public. The first version of the scorecard establishes a baseline for tracking the federal government’s efforts through 24 agencies to secure environmental justice, including to advance the Justice40 Initiative. This initiative has a goal of delivering 40% of overall benefits of federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to marginalized, disadvantaged communities that are overburdened by pollution.
“A White House office of environmental justice is a hard-fought victory that’s long overdue, but it needs to be empowered,” said Jean Su, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Energy Justice program. “A fundamental part of the president’s first-ever Environmental Justice Scorecard needs to be saying no to the fossil fuel projects that pollute communities of color and sow climate chaos… It’s high time Biden showed up for environmental justice communities and the planet instead of fossil fuel companies.”
The announcement of the new executive order follows introduction of a bill by Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) called the “Limit, Save, Grow Act” that would make cuts to renewable energy spending while supporting domestic oil and gas production. Provisions within the bill would gut the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes nearly $400 billion in federal spending to support the energy transition including funds going to “energy communities” that will be supported under the new executive order.
