EnerVenue, a U.S. nickel-hydrogen battery startup that launched at the height of the pandemic in summer 2020, has signed a master supply agreement with Green Energy Renewable Solutions, under which the latter will procure and supply 250 MWh of batteries over the next three years.
The company will deliver 50 MWh of capacity in 2023, 100 MWh in 2024, and 100 MWh in 2025. Green Energy’s parent company, Nicon Industries A/S – a manufacturer of steel and aluminum in the wind, offshore, and maritime industry – aims to build 1 GW of storage projects within the three-year period, according to a company statement.
“EnerVenue’s technology features exceptional longevity and durability with minimal maintenance required, and its fire-safe properties are especially critical in our expected applications,” said Henrik Jensen, CEO of Nicon Industries.
EnerVenue claims that its nickel-hydrogen batteries have lifespans of more than 30 years, through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation, along with overcharge, over-discharge, and deep-cycle capabilities. The company also claims costs per kilowatt-hour as low as a penny, as well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion batteries.
Unlike lithium-ion, metal-hydrogen batteries excel operating in conditions of extreme heat and extreme cold, the company claims. The solution operates optimally in ambient temperatures from -40 F to 140 F (60 C). Because of this, the battery purportedly comes with no risk of fire or thermal runaway and includes no toxic materials, making it recyclable.
These properties are especially crucial for safety and compliance in maritime and offshore projects, where Nicon plans to deploy the storage solutions over the long term. The batteries will initially be deployed onshore, for large construction and heavy industry projects, packaged into customized building blocks. The solutions will have to meet DNV certification and CE certification mandates to be deployed in the offshore and maritime market.
“By 2024, Nicon’s forklifts will be converted from fossil fuel to electric power and will be charged with Green Energy battery containers,” said Jens Juul, COO of Nicon. “Additionally, the power needed for our sea fastenings jobs on wind installation vessels will be supplied from our own battery containers charged overnight with renewable energy coming from the wind farms.”
In June, EnerVenue agreed to provide 460 MWh of its batteries to Sonnell Power Solutions for large-scale renewable and storage applications in Puerto Rico. In May, Pine Gate purchased 2.4 GWh of the company’s batteries. In spring 2021, the company signed its first major distribution agreement with Hong Kong’s Towngas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/23/bluetti-unveils-modular-energy-storage-system-at-ifa-2022/,"SPONSORED POST,AUSTRALIA,EASTERN EUROPE,UNITED KINGDOM,WESTERN EUROPE",,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",Bluetti unveils modular energy storage system at IFA 2022,"Last week Bluetti showed off its latest innovations at IFA in Berlin, Germany. Its offering included the AC500+B300S combo, AC200 series, and the long-rumored solar system-EP600+B500 three-phase system that features a 6kW inverter and maximum 79kWh LFP battery capacity.
The modular design of EP600 significantly shrinks the overall weight and size. The system weighs 123.4 pounds and measures 25 inches by 12.8 inches by 13.3 inches. Packed with a 6000 W bi-directional inverter for AC input and output, the system provides AC power at 230/400V to easily run almost any household electric appliances, the company reports. Besides, the EP600 also supports up to 6000 W solar input from 150V to 500V range and has a reported 99.9% MPPT solar efficiency.
As an expansion battery, B500 is tailor-made for the EP600 system. It features 4,960 Wh ultra-durable lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, an aluminum alloy appearance, and is the same size as EP600. Every EP600 supports up to 16 battery modules to reach a total 79.3kWh capacity, which Bluetti says can cover all power needs at home or off-the-grid for days or even over a week. EP600 and B500 can be stacked to save space inside or out.
What sets the EP600 apart from other solar generators is the hybrid inverter at the heart of the system. This simplifies operation because, as Bluetti explains, it is operated by simply plugging the solar panels into the generator. , which means all you need to do is plug solar panels into the solar generator. No solar inverter or MPPT controller is required.
Bluetti reports that the EP600 and B500 system will be available by the end of the fall in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The pre-order is expected to start before November on BLUETTI’s official website. You may subscribe here to get an early bird price and stay up to date with the latest news on Bluetti’s new solar power system. According to James Ray, marketing director for Bluetti, the combination of the EP600 and B500 will sell for less than $9,500.
Note that as a three-phase 230V/400V system, this EP600 and B500 system is not applied to countries with 100-120V utility grid voltage. Another whole home power system is currently under development for those living in the United States and Japan.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/23/rallying-for-the-solar-decade/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",Rallying for the ‘Solar+ Decade’,"For solar energy and energy storage, it is the best of times and the worst of times. Public opinion favoring solar is strong, the number of jobs is growing, and more households are choosing to go solar than ever before. Solar has earned its place as an integral part of the US electricity mix now and for decades to come.
At the same time, it has been a challenging year for the industry with political headwinds and a number of blows from clean energy opponents. These events did not materialize in a vacuum but are the result of global instability and a much broader debate about energy in America.
Even compared to the 1970s crisis when oil prices quadrupled, the sheer quantity and complexity of challenges at hand – rising prices, an aging grid, widespread economic inequalities, and the pressing threat of climate change – makes this a history-book moment.
Thankfully, unlike in crises of the past, today the solution is clear and attainable: rapid clean energy deployment. Investing in the clean energy economy will stabilize energy costs and build a more secure and resilient energy system that’s capable of cutting emissions and creating jobs in every community. The vast majority of Americans recognize the tremendous economic and environmental benefits of solar energy, but we can’t simply wish for a clean energy future.
Strategy, stability
To meet the challenges ahead and fully realize the promise of an equitable clean energy transition, we must rally around a long-term strategy. The objective is to meet the goals of the Solar+ Decade, where solar and storage will comprise 30% of US electricity generation by 2030. Three broad ambitions can guide the path forward: securing trade and supply chain certainty, fostering a stable policy environment, and removing barriers to sustainable and equitable growth.
Anyone working in solar today knows all too well the need for predictable and transparent trade policy. When the Department of Commerce initiated an anti-circumvention investigation on solar products from Southeast Asia this spring, it sent shock waves through the industry and put 100,000 jobs at risk.
The solar industry stepped up and successfully made its case to the Biden administration, resulting in executive action to pause circumvention tariffs for two years. Without President Biden’s declaration, the case could have singlehandedly derailed any chance of achieving the Solar+ Decade goals.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is working with its members to ensure that unfair petitions cannot pose a threat of this magnitude again and to advocate for policies that will build a robust United States’ solar supply chain. This would reduce trade vulnerabilities and create thousands of American manufacturing jobs in the process.
SEIA continues to advocate for bold federal clean energy policy. While more and more states are rising to the task and advancing pro-solar legislation, accomplishing a task as herculean as rewiring the country’s energy system requires long-term policy certainty on a national level. The stop-and-start nature of negotiations in Congress over the last 18 months underscores how critical it is for clean energy businesses to strengthen relationships with elected officials and educate them about the commonsense policies that will supercharge the clean energy economy.
Sustainability matters
Finally, with rapid growth comes great responsibility. As the market scales up, the solar industry needs to proactively address and lead on sustainability and equity issues. We know that concerns like land use and recycling are already on the public’s mind and will only become more pressing as time goes on.
In May, SEIA launched the Solar and Storage Industries Institute (SI2), a new education and charitable organization that will inform SEIA’s advocacy to ensure responsible growth and continue earning public trust as solar becomes more prominent in Americans’ lives.
SEIA is also working to integrate diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice considerations into all of its work. To decarbonize our electric grid, the solar workforce will need more than 1 million workers by 2035, which provides an opportunity to build a vastly more inclusive and diverse clean energy economy. People of color are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis and our industry must center equity in all our work.
The stakes have never been higher as we gather as an entire industry for the first time since 2019: We must take this opportunity to connect with the solar community and rally around our long-term objectives.
We cannot get distracted or bogged down by the obstacles of the past year. We must rally around the goals of the Solar+ Decade to resolve our nation’s energy and climate crisis. We know solar and storage is the solution, and that the American people are with us — now let’s deliver on the promise of clean energy and get this done.

At the Energy Department, that means a power system with the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and recover rapidly from operational disruptions.
Solar energy can play an important role in increasing the resilience of the nation’s grid. Instead of having one main generator that provides electricity for a large area, distributed solar energy systems—such as rooftops and community solar—can increase overall resilience of the grid and of the communities it serves.
Grid-based resilience
Power comes from a variety of sources—fossil-based generators fueled by coal or natural gas have been standard for the last century. Now, solar energy offers an affordable, low-cost electricity source well suited for a 21st century clean energy economy.
To enable solar to provide resilience, grid operators need tools like battery storage, demand management, and load shifting to ensure reliable power. The tricky part is understanding when to use those tools. That requires real-time knowledge of how much energy solar resources are producing at that moment, as well as how much energy they will produce in the future, known as forecasting. DOE recently completed the first Solar Forecasting Prize to help commercialize tools that will aid in predicting solar generation, and has also been investing in tools and models that continue to improve communications between solar generation facilities and grid operators so they have the accurate and timely information to do their jobs effectively.
DOE is also working to enable microgrids with large amounts of solar generation. These smaller grids, which often include renewable power like solar paired with battery storage, can disconnect from the main grid and operate autonomously when the main grid is down. Microgrids help to improve resilience of the overall grid by limiting the number of customers affected by an outage and enabling faster system response and recovery, reducing the threat posed by man-made or natural disasters and keeping communities safe and secure.
Grid-forming inverters, which automatically coordinate inverter-based and other resources to maintain electricity on the grid, are similarly important to grid resilience. These newer technologies require continual innovation and research, which is why we’ve created a consortium to UNIFI these diverse stakeholders. In the future, it is anticipated that grid-forming inverters will enable solar-plus-storage systems to restart the grid after disruptions without the assistance of more traditional forms of electricity generation.
Focus on communities
New research is expanding the definition of resilience to include the communities served by electric grid. Increasing the amount of solar energy on the grid and ensuring its affordability increases community resilience by helping to relieve energy burdens and provide clean, reliable, local electricity.
This idea of community energy resilience is a focus of our Renewables Advancing Community Energy Resilience (RACER) funding opportunity. Later this year, several projects will be selected for a total of $25 million in funding to support innovative community energy planning methods and technology demonstrations that can increase energy resilience in response to the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. These events frequently cause widespread equipment failures and infrastructure damages, particularly in the distribution grids that directly serve communities.
Electricity powers vital services that are integrated into virtually every corner of our economy and communities: lighting at night for safety, communication services for emergency responders, refrigerated food and medication storage, and clean water and sewage disposal. To achieve far-reaching impacts, the projects under RACER will bring multiple stakeholders to the table—utilities, municipal planners, emergency responders, community groups, among others—to ensure the electric needs of all community members are considered.
The future of resilience
With the help of RACER and other DOE efforts, new and innovative approaches to community energy planning and new clean energy technologies will be developed to lessen the impact of power disruptions to essential services and increase the ability to withstand and recover rapidly from extreme weather events.
As the amount of grid-connected solar energy continues to grow, resilience at both the grid and community levels remains an important priority for the DOE. The Solar Energy Technologies Office is committed to researching and developing a resilient grid that can handle the increase of solar as we continue to transition to a decarbonized power system, while ensuring solar technologies improve the grid’s ability to keep the lights on.

Garrett Nilsen is the deputy director, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).

Their implementation would result in a cascade of benefits, including extending the adoption of distributed energy resources like rooftop PV and lowering electricity costs for consumers.
Three major drivers in solar growth  Three forces are driving solar adoption today: the economics of energy, the energy crisis driven by the war in Ukraine, and a growing global focus on green and net zero initiatives. What matters is that these three drivers change the dynamics of investment – there is a growing body of capital looking to align with low-carbon, net-zero initiatives. Yet as the debate rages about operational versus overall sustainability, what is the future of solar for ESG finance?
Battery manufacturing ramps up in the U.S.  Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has resulted in numerous battery manufacturers announcing plans to begin production in the United States, supporting the transition to clean energy as well as clean transportation.
