Regulators also said that the state will transition the two-year-old pilot community solar program to permanent status. The decision to move to a permanent program now rather than wait for a third year of the pilot to commence was driven by the pilot’s success so far.
The community solar program is administered by New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program. It provides access to solar energy through a subscription-based model.
Regulators awarded 78 MW across 45 projects during the pilot program’s first year, exceeding a 75 MW goal. While the pilot required that at least 40% of all approved projects reserve at least 51% of their capacity for low- and middle-income households, all of the approved renewable energy projects met that goal.
Year two of the pilot program doubled the amount of capacity, with the 150 MW available. It carried the same carve-out for low- and middle-income customers. The program was modified as regulators looked to reduce time and costs for developers to enroll customers.
Scott Elias, senior manager of state affairs, mid-Atlantic for the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said that the trade group is working with the state to develop a program that adds at least 150 MW of solar energy capacity each year.
“We are pleased that every one of the 105 approved community solar projects in New Jersey will provide low-to-moderate-income communities with clean, affordable energy,” Elias said in a statement. He said that regulatory changes to the community solar program, including improvements to the low and moderate-income subscriber verification rules, “are another positive step in improving access to the benefits of clean electricity for lower income communities and communities of color.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/28/federal-policy-can-drive-the-solar-industry-but-still-may-fall-short/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",Federal policy can drive the solar industry… but still may fall short,"When we began in 2008, if somebody suggested at a conference that solar would repeatedly be the single largest source of new energy infrastructure in the United States, they would have received a polite smile – with the right audience. And yet here we are.
Solar outperforms natural gas and wind as the fastest growing, and one of the least expensive, new electricity-generating sources in the U.S. and around the world.
In the first half of 2021, solar photovoltaics (PV) accounted for 56% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the U.S., adding nearly 11 GWdc of capacity. This is a 45% year over year increase and the largest Q2 on record.  This year is on track to become the biggest year ever for new solar capacity additions in the U.S.
Right now, a new project is installed every 84 seconds in this country by over 10,000 solar businesses employing over 250,000 workers.
This growth is being led in large part by utilities, municipalities, and corporations. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that the 285 corporations in the RE100 could drive as much as 93 GW (around $100 billion) of incremental new wind and solar projects by 2030.  
Our challenge is our scale. Increasing global demand for renewable energy and the continued electrification of the U.S. power and automobile sectors only adds to already significant supply chain issues for everything from modules, to inverters, to batteries.

Freight costs have increased by nearly 1,000% at the Port of Los Angeles, and across ports in the United States. An unprecedented expansion of development assets within ERCOT, PJM, NEPOOL and MISO has created 5+ year interconnection delays, sometimes longer, with limited system-wide planning or cost-sharing for these upgrades.
Many current policies focus on optimizing the economic outcome of owning assets through a stand-alone federal investment tax credit (ITC) for batteries, an extension of the ITC for solar, or a direct pay option.
(Read “White House announces framework for its Build Back Better agenda.“)
We support these incentives, but they enable projects at or near commercialization at the “top of the pyramid” of our industry. This has worked historically to pull earlier stage projects through, but it will not work if we are to scale as needed.
About 2% of current domestic electricity generation is produced from solar. Our goal is 40% or more by 2035. In the next decade we will need to quadruple or quintuple our annual development of solar energy assets. A more cogent long-term policy approach must also focus on the development assets that will be the seeds of this future.
To plant these seeds effectively, the industry needs more transparency in cost projections, more confidence in equipment procurement, a more stable and transparent view on interconnection, basis and congestion, and a significant voice in helping utilities shape their long-term planning and investments.
In order to address these needs, federal policy must address equipment availability, solar development pathway risk and timing, as well as transmission and distribution interconnection. This will enable our industry and investors to appropriately allocate risk capital among a much larger number of assets.
Solar development needs to be less binary and faster to drive a vastly larger and broader base of assets at the “bottom of the pyramid” of the industry.
In our 2021 Annual Letter, we highlighted three bipartisan priorities that are instrumental to meeting U.S. decarbonization goals: (1) immediately reduce solar import tariffs (and find other ways to incentivize long-term American made manufacturing); (2) invest in aging transmission and distribution infrastructure in concert with utilities and RTOs; and (3) implement a national renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) or clean energy standard (CES).
Remove Solar Import Tariffs That Threaten the Pace of Deployment. Solar import tariffs dramatically limit the growth of the U.S. solar and renewable energy industry, putting the U.S. at a global disadvantage and calling into question our ability to meet the goals set under the Paris Climate Accord.
We estimate that 201 tariffs alone add at least $.05/watt to the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projections for each project, with a limited (if any) increase in domestic manufacturing. The tariffs also create massive uncertainty and compound preexisting supply chain issues.

We can, and should, incentivize domestic production through incentives such as production tax credits, not tariffs. We must ensure the availability of supply side materials even when they’re from China and pursue parallel focus on forced labor and other human rights violations.
Tailored regional trade solutions targeted at specific bad actors paired with SEIA’s leading traceability protocol is a good starting point and one the solar industry pioneered. The volatility of tariffs is dramatically increasing costs for our industry and impairing the ability of our industry to plan for and scale our future.
This is not a priority of the Biden Administration, but it should be. Climate change is repeatedly the most important issue for Democratic voters, solar energy is the most important tool we have to combat climate change, tariffs are the single largest issue the industry faces, and removing the tariffs requires no Congressional approval or action. We need to remove them.
Support Aging Infrastructure Upgrades. One of the biggest hurdles to scaling renewable energy is the existence of old and aging electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure.  This is a well-publicized problem, made even more evident by recent grid failures in California and Texas. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and the budget reconciliation package offer the first comprehensive opportunity to build the 21st century grid.

The solar ITC has led to a period of remarkable industry growth since 2008. The infrastructure and reconciliation packages could do the same for transmission and distribution.  In addition to economic incentives, the packages would tackle some of the issues with regional and interregional transmission necessary to successfully grow clean energy.
For example, the infrastructure package includes $9 billion to assist states with siting transmission projects and to support the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) transmission planning and modeling capabilities.
It also includes financial support for constructing and modernizing grid infrastructure across the seams between the Eastern and Western Interconnections, the domestic interties with ERCOT, and for offshore wind projects.
Further, it directs DOE to study capacity constraints and congestion when designating National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, with the intention of spurring a nationwide version of Texas’s successful Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ). This is exactly the work that must be done and the Administration’s leadership here is commendable.
Pass Congressional Solutions to Expand Renewable Energy. With the release of the Administration’s new budget framework, Congress will not likely pass a Renewable Portfolio Standard, a Clean Energy Standard, or even the proposed Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP) as part of federal budget reconciliation.

But there are other policy instruments under consideration that, although imperfect, will help to drive a more sustainable future.
Congress is expected to vote on a budget reconciliation package intended to supercharge the expansion of solar and other renewable energy projects by, among other things, extending the solar investment tax credit (ITC) by 10 years at 30%, adding a new 30% storage ITC, and adding an additional 10% bonus ITC for solar projects that demonstrate concrete benefit to a low to moderate income (LMI) or environmental justice community. These provisions are in additional to the separate bipartisan infrastructure bill.
We expect the final package will require companies to pay prevailing wage for all new projects and possibly to demonstrate the domestic content of projects, incentivizing those with higher a share of American-made components, in addition to directly incentivizing the growth of domestic manufacturing. The entire reconciliation package is expected to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in manufacturing, construction, and service industries nationwide. Based on our internal analysis, we believe that the 30% ITC would effectively fund the prevailing wage requirements.
We are on the precipice of groundbreaking federal clean energy policy that will fundamentally change the landscape for renewables, and specifically solar. The current infrastructure package and reconciliation bill offer a powerful and promising catalyst for the redesign and rebuilding of our national energy infrastructure and transportation grid.
This country is still missing a clear roadmap for hitting our climate goals, and a market-based framework like a RPS to implement them. And we must act quickly to modernize our grid through a collaborative effort with regional transmission organizations, FERC, utilities, and industry. But we’re well on our way to creating the energy future so many of us have been working on.

The projects were acquired from Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.
Each project is expected to enter a power purchase agreement with local utilities. The projects are planned to produce power equivalent to the demand of 7,700 homes. SolRiver’s investment is expected to be in excess of $90 million, said the company.
This announcement follows the passing of the Energy Solutions for North Carolina act, which establishes a carbon emission reduction target of 70% by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050. SolRiver’s investment includes several Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURPA) projects, increasing the state’s renewable energy mix.

Last year, Duke Energy and the solar industry reached a series of agreements intended to speed interconnection for utility-scale solar projects, and reduce costs. The interconnection queue process was reworked, and a cluster study model was adopted.
SolRiver, founded in 2016, manages over 180 MW in capacity from 300 projects. In mid-October, the firm bought a set of utility-scale and community solar projects developed by Sulus Solar in Oregon. The company said it invested $52 million in the projects, the first of which is set to begin construction in spring 2022.
Earlier in October, the firm entered a virtual net metering agreement for a 3 MW solar project that powers a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Pennsylvania. The net metering program, authorized recently by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, allows customers to offset on-site power consumption through solar PV generated on nearby land that is owned or leased by the same customer.

The framework also includes a 10-year tax credit expansion.
The proposed framework would be the basis for legislation to be drafted and then would be taken up by both Houses of Congress.
News reports said that neither Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) or Krysten Sinema (D-AZ) had immediately signed off on the deal, which was announced hours before Biden was slated to depart for Europe and the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Both senators are considered to be key votes.
Highlights of the framework according to the White House include:
The White House said that the framework will deliver “well over one gigaton” of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in 2030. It also said the framework’s $555 billion investment represents the largest single investment in a U.S. clean energy economy in history, across buildings, transportation, industry, electricity, agriculture, and climate-smart practices across lands and waters.
Image: Wikimedia commons
The framework also is intended to set the United States on course to meet its climate targets, achieving a 50-52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels in 2030.
Heather Zichal, CEO of the American Clean Power Association applauded the revised framework for the Build Back Better Act and said it includes provisions that will “help drive clean energy investment across the country” while also delivering “substantial” emission reductions.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said “The Build Back Better framework contains the most ambitious and transformational clean energy policies we’ve ever seen from Congress.” She called on Congress to “come together and pass this momentous legislation as soon as possible.”
And Jason Burwen, interim CEO of the U.S. Energy Storage Association said that with new manufacturing incentives available for batteries and federal procurement of next-generation long-duration storage, the framework will “supercharge efforts to rapidly transition to clean energy while building a robust energy storage supply chain here at home.”
The Build Back Better framework is intended to deliver consumer rebates and ensure middle class families save money as they shift to clean energy and electrification. Proposed measures include enhancement and expansion of existing home energy and efficiency tax credits, as well as the creation of a new, electrification-focused rebate program.
According to the White House, the framework will cut the cost of installing rooftop solar for a home by around 30%, shortening the payback period by around 5 years. The framework’s electric vehicle tax credit will lower the cost of an electric vehicle that is made in America by $12,500 for a middle-class family. In addition, the framework is intended to help rural communities tap into the clean energy opportunity through targeted grants and loans through the Department of Agriculture.
The framework also proposes incentives to grow domestic supply chains in solar, wind, and other industries. In addition, the framework aims to boost the competitiveness of existing industries, like steel, cement, and aluminum, through grants, loans, tax credits, and procurement to drive capital investment in the decarbonization and revitalization of American manufacturing.
The framework proposes a new Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator to invest in projects around the country, while delivering 40% of the benefits of investment to disadvantaged communities, as part of the administration’s Justice40 initiative. The framework will also fund port electrification; facilitate the deployment of cleaner transit, buses, and trucks; and support critical community capacity building, including grants to environmental justice communities.
In addition, it would create a new Civilian Climate Corps with over 300,000 people to work on public land conservation, community resilience, and climate change.

The company will use the batteries as part of a virtual power plant to output energy when needed.
RMP said it will pay the solar owner a one-time incentive of $400 to $600 per kW of energy output capacity, based on when they installed solar power. After the larger first-year incentive is paid, the utility will pay an ongoing annual capacity payment of $15/kW.
RMP said it may trim these incentives as needed in the future. Here are the numbers, as provided by the utility.

The utility told prospective customers that it will not use the batteries from November through February, except for grid emergencies. From March through October, the utility may use the batteries daily, given high electricity demand conditions. In its FAQ, RMP stated that it will not discharge batteries below 10%, and also assured customers that it will not discharge customer’s batteries below 50% in the program’s first year.
The incentive program requires that the batteries be charged by the on-site solar power system in order to fully qualify for the 26% solar tax incentives; however, it did not specifically refer to any technical requirement to do so.
 The utility said that sonnen batteries are to be used in the program. sonnen offers two batteries: the 10 kWh Core and the Eco. The Eco comes in two flavors, a 20 kWh Eco and a 30 kWh EcoLink.
The Core’s 4.8 kW output will earn an incentive payment of $1,920 to $2,880. The 3-7 kW Eco will earn $1,200 to $4,200, and an 8 kW EcoLinx will receive $3,200 to $4,800.
sonnen was a logical choice for this program because it created one of the first virtual power plant (VPP) batteries, which launched the sonnenCommunity program. The company’s VPP first came to the United States in 2017 in an Arizona community.
The use of residential solar+storage as a power grid asset has been growing. Sunrun first broke through in 2018 by winning a bid for its projects to be part of the ISO New England capacity market. Since then there have been a number of announcements, including $500,000 saved during heat waves, Tesla in California, and the ConnectedSolutions program in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
As the United States recently passed three million solar panel installations (and because we have hard evidence that distributed solar power saves massive amounts of money on grid upgrades), it only makes sense for publicly owned power grids to tap into resources owned by the public.
In fact, research from Vibrant Clean Energy suggests that hundreds of billions can be saved by fully realizing the value of distributed solar+storage through 2045.
This is, of course, before we consider the value of resilience to local business and homeowners. The Texas grid collapse in February that killed hundreds, and the ongoing challenges in California have spurred consumer demand for home energy storage.
Add to the list this bit of breaking news: This author is writing this article in the middle of a Nor’easter event which has cut power to 66% of remote work staff and more than 600,000 customer accounts (over a million individuals) in the New England region.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/28/supply-chain-issues-could-impact-half-of-all-solar-pv-projects-in-2022/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"OCTOBER 28, 2021",Supply chain issues could impact half of all solar PV projects in 2022,"The surging cost of manufacturing materials and shipping could threaten 50 GW of the 90 GW of global utility PV developments planned for 2022, according to analysis from Rystad Energy.
The firm said that commodity price inflation and supply chain bottlenecks could lead to the postponement or even cancelation of some of these projects.
Driven by core component price inflation, manufacturing costs for PV modules have climbed from below $0.20 per watt peak (Wp) in 2020 to between $0.26 and $0.28 per Wp in the second half of 2021,  a nearly 50% increase in a year, the company said.
One driver of this surge is a more than 300% hike in the cost of polysilicon, a core component in PV manufacturing. In addition, other raw materials – silver, copper, aluminum and glass – have also climbed steadily since January 2020, increasing the pressure on module prices.
The current bottlenecks are not expected to be relieved within the next 12 months, meaning developers and offtakers will have to decide whether to reduce their margins, delay projects, or increase offtake prices to get projects to financial close, said David Dixon, senior renewables analyst at Rystad Energy.

In addition to materials cost inflation, shipping is another element in the supply chain causing considerable challenges for developers and module suppliers. The cost of shipping continues to rise, playing more of a role in overall production capital expenditure. Before 2021, the cost of PV shipping had a minimal impact on the overall production cost. However, pandemic-era shipping delays and bottlenecks have resulted in a near 500% increase in prices, from $0.005 per Wp in September 2019 to $0.03 per Wp in October 2021, the firm said.
Modules and their associated shipping costs typically comprise between a quarter and a third of the total project capex and together represent the single-largest item of a project’s cost. When the cost of modules – and shipping – increases, it can significantly impact project economics.
Rystad Energy said it also performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for different plant sizes comparing 2020 module and shipping costs with current costs. The results showed that the LCOE of new projects has increased by between 10% and 15%, a “major cost bump” for most of the projects planned for 2022.
Seeing their projects at risk, the firm said that developers may have to resort to negotiating higher power purchase agreements or absorbing some of the cost inflation, accepting higher project costs and lower margins.

In addition to being down 27% compared to Q2 2021, total module shipments were also down 11%, compared to Q3 2020, according to S&P. Many in the industry are blaming the fall on a proposed expansion of tariffs, introduced by an anonymous group of domestic manufacturers last month.
The proposed tariffs would apply to manufacturers in Southeast Asia beyond just China, including modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. Those countries account for 80% of all panel imports into the United States.
The report claims that the uncertainty over the tariffs is already stalling projects, as, if instituted, the tariffs could be applied retroactively to already-completed sales. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has warned that tariffs on imported panels from three Asian countries would jeopardize nearly 30% of the solar capacity the U.S. is expected to install over the next two years.
The proposed tariffs also come at a time where it has become harder to source modules, regardless of their country of origin, due to worldwide supply chain problems and difficulties in international shipping.
These potential of these tariffs are not the only factors affecting imports, however.
Implications of trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather,… Join us as solar experts discuss these issues on November 09 at the virtual Roundtables USA 2021. More information and free registration
According to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm, supply chain disruptions and shipping difficulties could threaten 56% of the utility-scale solar projects planned globally for 2022. Additionally, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have not passed the world over yet, and overall production has still not recovered to pre-Covid levels.
In mid-August, reports emerged that solar module shipments to the U.S. were being detained by Customs and Border Protection agents as part of an enforcement action aimed at banning the import of solar equipment containing components provided by a Chinese company suspected of using forced labor. Reports said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. Analysts said that Jinko may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
All of the above factors could potentially derail the Biden administration’s goal of producing 45% of U.S. electricity supply from solar by 2050.
The U.S. Dept. of Energy’s Solar Futures Study, released in September, outlines the need for the U.S. to install an average of 30 GW of solar capacity per year between now and 2025, then 60 GW per year from 2025. According to SEIA’s Q4 2020 Solar Market Insight Report, domestic solar module manufacturers only have the capacity to produce about half of the domestic demand.
Earlier this week, SEIA sent a letter to U.S. Dept. of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to “refute the credibility” of the so far unknown petitioners of the tariff, saying that SEIA is leading the fight against the tariff request to protect this country’s 10,000 solar companies and 231,000 solar workers from the “monied interests” behind the petition.
While the companies included in the group that began the petition, the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention, have identified themselves to the U.S. Department of Commerce, their names are being kept private, in order to avoid any potential retaliation.
