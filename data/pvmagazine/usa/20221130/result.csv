The company anticipates breaking ground by the end of the year on its Arizona gigafactory.
The Coeur D’Alene, Idaho-based  manufacturer is raising $75 million of a $150 million investment round from Siemens Financial Services and utility contractor Quanta Services. Additional strategic investorsinclude Nidec Motor, Honeywell Ventures, Trog Hawley Capital and a yet undisclosed energy storage provider.
KORE Power is using the fund raise to begin construction of its KOREPlex gigafactory in the Phoenix, Arizona area and to purchase equipment for the 6 GWh production facility.
With initial output anticipated in late 2024, production is expected to double to 12 GWh of lithium-ion battery cells produced to meet expected market demand in energy storage and electric mobility applications.
“Strengthening domestic manufacturing capabilities for battery cells will be critical to the transformation and build out of energy infrastructure in the United States,” said Andrew Schwaitzberg, vice president of operations at Quanta Services. “We expect our strategic alliance with KORE to enhance Quanta’s ability to deliver comprehensive energy solutions in partnership with our customers.”
This year BloombergNEF forecast a 30% compound annual growth rate in the energy storage market. Similarly, electrification in the mobility sector, which includes electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, is experiencing rapid growth with EV sales up 60% year over year.
Earlier this month, KORE Power signed a multi-year supply agreement with EV start-up Kindred Motorworks to supply VDA 355 batteries for use in the EV company’s pick-up truck fleet.
In June, the company signed a battery collaboration agreement with ABB and Ecotricity to use its Mark 1 energy storage modules in ABB’s 20 MWh energy storage system adjacent to an existing Ecotricity 6.9 MW wind farm in Gloucestershire, England.
In March, KORE Power acquired Northern Reliability (NRI), a Waterbury, Vermont-based power and energy storage solutions provider active in the renewables space for nearly 50 years.
At the same time, the company launched KORE Solutions, a full-service energy storage installation services provider that will operate as a division of battery manufacturer, allowing KORE Power to become a vertically integrated energy storage solutions provider.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/30/battery-manufacturer-installs-massive-3-8-mw-rooftop-system-at-pennsylvania-hq/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,PENNSYLVANIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022",Battery manufacturer to install massive 3.8 MW solar system at Pennsylvania HQ,"Correlate Infrastructure Partners announced the installation of a 3.8 MW solar system at the Reading, Pennsylvania corporate headquarters of EnerSys, reportedly one of the largest U.S. behind-the-meter solar systems to be deployed to date.
EnerSys, a manufacturer of lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries for various industries, said the solar deployment reflects the company’s internal efforts toward a low-carbon future as it strives to be a producer of batteries for applications that pivot customers away from fossil fuel resources.
Construction of the Pennsylvania project is to commence in 2023, while the project consists of a combination of ground-mounted and rooftop solar modules, a Correlate spokesperson told pv magazine USA.
“This partnership and project bring together a decade of our team’s vision, whereby we are both supporting a corporate renewables program and helping decarbonize the supply chain with a global market leader,” said Todd Michaels, chief executive officer of Correlate. “We’re proud to be working with EnerSys to further advance solar development in the Commonwealth and to support their commitment to long-term sustainability.”
Formerly known as Triccar, Correlate Infrastructure Partners is a publicly-traded development, finance and fulfillment platform for distributed energy resources across North America, providing solar, cogeneration, energy storage, EV infrastructure and energy efficiency project solutions.  Correlate trades at a $46 million market capitalization and manages a $488 million project development pipeline.
Keystone solar initiatives
The new EnerSys project contributes to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf’s goal to increase renewable energy resources to at least 40% statewide in order to achieve a 26% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.
EnerSys’ rooftop solar project is the largest commercial and industrial distributed generation solar project in Pennsylvania, a state that has seen a spat of recent large-scale distributed generation solar projects.
In June 2011, pretzel maker Snyder’s-Lance installed what was then the largest project in the state with a 3.5 MW ground-mounted array comprised of 15,092 panels on 26 acres at its Hanover headquarters.
The Philadelphia Eagles also went green in 2013, with Sunora Energy Solutions installing a 3 MW solar carport system around the Lincoln Financial Field stadium’s perimeter with 11,000 panels. At the time this was one of the largest solar facilities used by a National Football League team.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), several other consumer goods and retailers have gone solar in the Keystone State, including Crayola, IKEA and Johnson & Johnson.
SEIA reports that Pennsylvania has 955 MW of solar cumulatively installed through Q2 2022, ranking the state 23rd in the country for deployments. SEIA projects that the state may add another 4.1 GW over the next five years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/30/california-rulemaking-to-cut-solar-net-metering-payments-by-75/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022",California rulemaking to cut solar net metering payments by 75%,"The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is expected to vote on the proposed Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 in mid-December. The proposed decision changes the structure of net metering, and also lowers export rates by as much as 76%, a change that has been heavily criticized by the solar industry.
Net metering is a process by which utility companies pay rooftop solar owners for exporting electricity back to the grid. The solar array produces extra electricity during the day and in sunnier times of the year, so that a credit carries on the utility bill to cover the times when solar production is not covering electricity usage. Net metering helps rooftop solar owners get a return on their investment, and the excess energy sent by the system helps utilities balance the grid and meet demand.
Currently, average net metering rates range from $0.23 per kWh to $0.35 per kWh, and the new proposed decision cuts those rates to an average of $0.05 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh. This is set to be the largest drop in export rates in U.S. history, in a market that represents roughly 50% of the nation’s residential solar market.
Current NEM 1.0 and 2.0 customers are grandfathered in to their rates for 20 years, as are those who receive grid interconnection approval from the utility before 3.0 is enacted, should it go through in the vote. If enacted, the final date by which interconnection approval would be needed to attain NEM 2.0 rates would be April 15, 2023.
“If passed as is, the CPUC’s proposal would protect utility monopolies and boost their profits, while making solar less affordable and delaying the goal of 100 percent clean energy,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA).
There are several case studies across the nation that have shown solar adoption falls sharply following such a rulemaking decision. In California, the Imperial Irrigation District abandoned net metering in July 2016, causing residential solar installations to decline 88%. Also in 2016, Nevada made a cut to net metering compensation resulted in a 47% reduction in residential solar installations over the next year, said CALSSA. This led to a 2017 legislative session that restored net metering, which led to an increase in solar adoption.
“At a time when California needs rooftop solar to flourish, it’s risky to cut a key incentive without having a viable alternative in place. California’s decision-makers need to make rooftop solar as affordable and accessible as possible so that every household with solar potential can realistically make the choice to go solar,” said Laura Deehan, state director, Environment California.
The CPUC found that California must triple the amount of local, distributed solar to reach the clean energy mandate laid out by the state’s Senate Bill 100. CALSSA said rooftop solar will save California ratepayers $120 billion by 2050, or $300 per person per year.
Abigal Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said that the decision should be altered to “ensure a more gradual transition to net billing.”
With upcoming CPUC vote, there is still time to voice opinion on the rulemaking procedure. Visit savecaliforniasolar.org to learn more.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/30/why-the-solar-industry-has-a-trust-problem-and-how-to-fix-it/,"GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022",Why the solar industry has a trust problem (and how to fix it),"Trust is a strange thing. Too little trust in systems can lead to unnecessary redundancies: too much time spent re-checking work already completed, too much money spent employing people to resolve disputes. In a crumbling marriage or relationship, a lack of trust becomes evident as people grow bitter, anachronistic and eventually in some cases, divorce. However, there are some marriages where people limp along, entrenched in long simmering debates, with new systems of survival that just barely hold onto the institution they’ve committed to. Trust is gone, but the marriage remains because it has to. Sound familiar?
In a system, like solar energy, failures of trust erode normal operating practices but the desire or capacity for profit means that new systems are built in their place; systems that often drag down a business. Like a crumbling marriage bound together out of need, we have limped along. But we don’t have to.
The failures of trust in the solar industry revolve around one thing: data. Solar installers collect their own data. Lenders and other regulatory bodies then collect their own data as a means of re-checking. And, homeowners are caught between mixed promises. Often the homeowner does not receive what they were promised or what they are promised changes as their project plan/contract is refined. Contractors sign a contract with the homeowner based on incorrect data/design. After the sale, the contractor, or in some cases the lender, checks the data/design and will, hopefully, correct it. If this is done, the homeowner has to sign a new contract, which is typically not as attractive as the original. So now they question the decision to sign in the first place. Or even worse, if the proper checks and balances were not put into place to check/correct the original bad data/design then the homeowner never sees the electricity savings they were expecting.
This isn’t healthy.
Creating an unbiased centralized standard or measurement will eliminate the implicit distrust within the solar industry. It’s why I have my job at EagleView Solar; I believe that creating trust within the industry is paramount, and that we can solve it with better data. That data must be accurate, reliable and independent of any of the parties involved and when it is, it can become a gold-standard for how we measure and build industry solutions. This empowers solar companies to deliver higher quality systems in an efficient manner, benefitting the homeowner who receives an optimal system and the savings they were promised.
One example I often use is the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. This seal of approval helped to build consumer trust in products around the turn of the century. It did so by verifying and vetting the claims of product manufacturers, and then giving those products a rating. Doing so made consumers feel better about buying the products offered to them and helped industries to grow.
As we know, solar energy has been around for a long time, but it wasn’t until recently that it started to become more popular. When it was less popular, the trust problem was easy to overlook, ignore or claim that it’s “business as usual.” But, as solar technology has improved, making it easier and cheaper to install solar panels, and as people are starting to become more aware of the benefits of solar energy, i.e. how it can save them money in the long run, the opportunity cost for the trust disruption is too high. Unlike a struggling marriage, we have a big opportunity to capitalize on growth.
So, let’s fix it.
We can align on centralized industry measurement practices. In doing so, we can create more trust among everyone involved in the solar installation journey. This is about creating proposals that are accurate from the moment of issue. If contractors use accurate data to inform a proposal or contract, then they do not lose the trust of the homeowner when they go back for a contract change order.
To do this, we need to create improved forecasting and electrical production modeling and then standardize on how we report on those models. The accuracy of those predictions will create a cycle of trust-building that will help to repair our outdated or broken systems.
Beyond that, we need to create more sources of consistent or normalized information for homeowners and improved measures of consumer protection. Our trust problem is fixable, we just need to do it together.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/30/doe-priorities-for-3-8-billion-in-grants-include-distributed-resource-aggregations/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022",DOE priorities for $3.8 billion in grants include distributed resource aggregations,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is accepting concept papers for up to $3.8 billion in grants for grid flexibility and grid resilience projects, in the first of several grant cycles that will ultimately total up to $10.5 billion.
One area eligible for grants is distributed energy resource aggregation, said Colin Meehan, project manager of DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership program, in a webinar that drew more than 1,000 participants.
Another eligibility area is grid-enhancing technologies, which could increase transmission capacity and facilitate interconnection of large-scale solar.
DOE expects to award 90 grants across three program areas, and seeks to fund projects that are “transformational” and have a “multiplier effect” that leads to further private sector investment, Meehan said.
Smart grid grants totaling up to $1.1 billion, to enhance grid flexibility, are available to any type of entity, whether for-profit, non-profit, or governmental. The six priority investment areas, according to a webinar slide, include aggregation of distributed energy resources, electric vehicle chargers, or vehicle-to-grid capabilities; grid-enhancing technologies; and providing information between electricity system operators and consumers.
Meehan added that secure communications and cybersecurity is another investment area for these grants. The smart grid grants will require cost-share of at least 50% of the grant.
Grid innovation grants totaling up to $1.8 billion will be awarded to state and local governments, Native American tribes, and public utility commissions. DOE’s three areas of interest for these grants are transmission capacity enhancements and renewable energy interconnection; advanced distribution grid assets and functionality; and innovative approaches for improved joint resilience and functionality across transmission and distribution.
For these grants, DOE is seeking proposals that contribute to decarbonizing the electricity system, as well as the broader energy system, Meehan said. Grants will require a minimum cost share of 50% of the grant, and grantees are expected to partner with private sector entities, such as utilities, that can deploy infrastructure.
Grid resilience grants totaling up to $920 million are available to transmission owners, electric grid operators, electric storage operators and electricity generators. Grantees must address at least three of 12 requirements, only one of which relates to electricity storage. The cost-share for these grants is 100% of the grant amount.
Grant applicants must develop a community benefits plan, addressing community and labor engagement; investing in the American workforce; diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, and President Biden’s goal that 40% of the benefits of certain climate and clean energy investments must flow to disadvantaged communities.
The grant program is known as the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership program. It is administered by DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, which was developed through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to focus on transmission and distribution systems, especially demonstration and deployment projects, said Grid Deployment Office Director Maria Robinson.
Further information is available in the program’s funding opportunity announcement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/30/spacing-between-pv-cells-effectively-cools-panels-down-study-finds/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,COLORADO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022","Spacing between PV cells effectively cools panels down, study finds","While sunny and cloudless day might seem like the optimal setting for solar cells, too much sun and too much heat can reduce the efficiency of photovoltaics, increasing the levelized cost of energy at larger solar farms, according to new study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Portland State University and the University of Utah.
As operating temperature rises by 1 degree Celsius, traditional silicon-based solar cells will lose about 0.5% efficiency. In a typical photovoltaic plant, where modules operate nearly 25° Celsius above the ambient temperature, energy losses can reach 12%.
Even for temperate regions like Colorado, ambient temperatures in this range result in module temperatures between 42° and 61 °C over the course of a single day. In hotter locations, possible operating temperatures of up to 70 °C correspond to 12% efficiency losses.
Since more than 50% of PV generation capacity om the U.S. is located in warmer climates of California, Arizona, and Nevada, understanding and finding methods to mitigate panel heating becomes crucial to the success of low-cost solar energy.
This pattern requires cooling measures for solar panels. The study, published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, examines how to exploit the geometry and thus spacing of solar farms to enhance natural cooling.
In the past, cooling methods force wind or water over solar panel surfaces, while others employ materials with less thermal sensitivity to start the cooling process.  Such techniques require considerable resources, and in contrast a solar farm with optimally spaced panels facing the correct direction could cool itself through convection using the surrounding wind.
The NREL group improved models that calculate the amount of energy a PV plant produces based on factors such as material, environmental conditions, and panel temperature. They focused on the geometry of solar farms, including the degree of gaps present between the panels.
“Our hypothesis was that the most precise estimate of solar plant convection, and ultimately production efficiency, must consider the farm as a whole and all possible configuration changes,” said author Sarah E. Smith, of Portland State University.
No two solar farms are installed exactly the same way, based on irradiance, shading factors, tilt and height varieties based on latitude and surrounding vegetation.
“The heat-removing wind flow will also move differently throughout each solar plant based on its arrangement, ultimately changing how efficiently heat is removed from module surfaces,” said Smith.
The NREL research group performed wind tunnel experiments and high-resolution simulations with real-world data. Various tweaks including module height, row spacing, angle and wind direction were deployed.
Raising the solar cell’s height and increasing row spacing improved the cell’s power output by 2% to 3%, the group found.
“This correlation between geometry and efficiency is a huge step toward predicting convective cooling for solar farms based on their inherently unique arrangements,” said Smith. “It paves the way for more accurate energy generation and cost prediction models.”

The study examined 16 PV array designs subjected to a variety of environmental conditions, resulting in a total of 55 unique plant variations. Three methods of data collection were used involving large eddy simulations (LES), wind tunnel experiments (WT), and field data collected at the solar farm of Denver Federal Center (DFC).
The DFC field site is a 2 MW solar plant located in Denver.
Geometric variations among the three separate campaigns are referenced below. Blue panels represent three of the nine LES configurations, varying row-to-row spacing. The dotted separations denote intermediate spacing configurations omitted from the figure for brevity. Red panels represent geometric variations in the WT arrays, where inclination α was varied for a nominal ground-to-panel case (base height), and panel heights were considered at 30° inclination.
Panels at DFC are shown in purple, and details on the constant configuration of fixed-tilt modules. Gray, dotted panel silhouettes accompanying each diagram represent the most compact array of the LES study to simplify discussion of geometric variations.
Geometrically, a cell’s length scale based on fractal lacunarity, a term for a gap space or a pool, encapsulates all aspects of arrangement (ie: angle, height) in a single value. When applied to the Reynolds number (Re) within the Nusselt number heat transfer correlation, lacunarity reveals a relationship between convection and solar farm-specific geometry. That correlation can be applied to existing and forthcoming array designs to optimize convective cooling, ultimately increasing production and PV cell life.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/30/guidance-for-solar-tax-credit-prevailing-wage-and-apprenticeship-requirements/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 30, 2022",Guidance for solar tax credit prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury released guidance for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in August. Hailed as the most significant piece of climate legislation in history, the IRA mandates a reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030.
One of the most significant provisions of the infrastructure law is the long-term extension of the investment tax credit (ITC) which was instrumental in launching the U.S. solar industry. The bill calls for a 10-year extension of 30% of the cost of installed equipment to be tax exempt, falling to 26% in 2033, and 22% in 2034.
The IRA offers increased credit amounts to developers who pay a prevailing wage and use a certain percentage of registered apprenticeship. The guidance released today provides further details of how those requirements will work.
In essence, the prevailing wage requirements states that the taxpayer (developer) must pay any laborer, mechanic, contractor or subcontractor at the prevailing rates for the location in which the construction takes place, as determined by the Secretary of Labor. The prevailing wage rate requirements provides correction and penalty mechanisms for a taxpayer’s failure to comply.
To meet apprenticeship requirements, taxpayers must ensure that, for construction that begins before January 1, 2023, at least 10% of labor is performed by qualified apprentices. This steps up to 12.5% for construction that begins after December 31, 2022, and before January 1, 2024. And then bumps up again to 15% for construction that begins after December 31, 2023.
“This guidance offers a preview of a new era for clean energy tax credits, which takes into account not only the vast emissions reduction potential of clean energy technology but also the opportunity it presents to create good-paying, accessible union jobs across the country,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance. “We look forward to continuing to work with the administration to maximize the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act for workers and communities.”
The publication of this notice in the Federal Register begins the 60-day period in which taxpayers must begin construction of a facility (or installation under the rules for expensing energy efficient commercial building property) to receive the enhanced tax benefits without satisfying the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
