Public Service Commission for renewable energy to serve a target quantity of 5% of the standard offer service (SOS) electricity supply load beginning in December 2024. The agreement is the result of a pilot program to procure renewable energy through long-term PPAs for electricity generation sourced by solar and wind located in the PJM interconnection region.
The agreement, signed with developer Invenergy, covers the sale of energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity for a 15 year term. The PPA features levelized pricing for approximately 154,000 MWh of electricity per year, representing 73 MW, or 29% of Invenergy’s solar project capacity.
The project marks another step by the PSC to move D.C. closer to meeting its 100% renewable energy by 2032 goal. “Approving a 15-year agreement for renewable energy for SOS customers is a significant milestone for the Commission,” stated Emile C. Thompson, PSC chair.
The SOS program allows D.C. electric customers to buy default electric generation services through Pepco and rather than about 45 deregulated competitive electric suppliers. About 31% of Pepco’s electricity supply sales were provided through the SOS program in 2021. In D.C., about 86% of residential electric customers buy Pepco-supplied default SOS power. Thie latest agreement is Pepco’s largest purchase of solar energy for its customers to date.
“By incorporating the long-term renewable energy PPA into the SOS procurement portfolio, we are taking direct action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the construction of new renewable energy generation within the PJM Interconnection grid region. This pilot program is the product of a collaborative, comprehensive, and transparent SOS Working Group process. I want to thank all stakeholders, including the Office of the People’s Counsel, for their input and participation,” said Thompson. “We intend to re-engage the SOS Working Group as we endeavor to continue furthering the District’s energy and climate goals by exploring the expansion of the percentage of SOS load served by renewable energy PPAs in the near term.”
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports Washington D.C. as having 181 MW of solar capacity installed to date, enough to power nearly 30,000 homes. It has a widely distributed mix across sectors, with significant capacity in residential, commercial, community, and utility-scale solar. The District is home to 157 solar companies and has had $430 million in solar investment to date.
In 2021, Washington D.C. had 1,055 solar jobs. It is projected to add 216 MW over the next five years, more than doubling the installed capacity across the existing 10,624 solar installations that exist today.

Local utility, Hawaii Electric Company signed a 25-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced from the project.
The 30 MW (AC)/43 MW (DC) solar and 30 MW/120 MWh storage project will be built on approximately 300 acres of leased land near Waikoloa Village in the South Kohala district of the island. The solar installation will feature single-axis trackers equipped with bifacial solar modules. The associated lithium-ion battery system will safely store energy for use at peak demand periods, and will also provide grid and ancillary services and enable the grid to accommodate more renewable sources while displacing conventional generation.
“We have completed several successful solar and storage projects in Hawai’i,” said Todd Lindstrom, chief operating officer at BayWa r.e. Power Solutions LLC. “We’re excited to support Hawaiʻi’s renewable energy leadership in the U.S. and about the growing relationships we have with the local community. We look forward to bringing more renewable energy solutions to the island as we grow.”
The project is expected to be completed late in 2022. Once complete it will produce enough electricity to power 13,600 households, contributing more than 7% of Hawaiʻi Island’s annual energy needs and result in the equivalent of total avoided fuel consumption of more than 511,000 barrels of oil over its 25-year lifetime.
Over the course of the project, 200 jobs will be created, and the project is expected to generate a total economic output of an estimated $47 million toward Hawaiʻi’s economy.
The State of Hawaii has a goal of producing 100% renewable energy by 2045, an effort to reduce reliance on expensive, imported fossil fuels. The state is rapidly increasing its solar energy installations, as it has gone from a ranking of 31st in the country last year to 16th this year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Hawaii is currently receiving 17.68% of its electricity from solar with 1,477 MW installed as of Q1 of this year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/09/chicago-commits-to-100-renewable-energy-by-2025/,"SUSTAINABILITY,ILLINOIS",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 9, 2022",Chicago commits to 100% renewable energy by 2025,"Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot and the Department of Assets, Information and Services (AIS) visited the Chicago Urban League to announce an agreement with electricity supplier Constellation to meet the city’s needs with 100% renewable energy by 2025.
Swift Current Energy will collaborate with the utility to develop and deliver 100% renewable energy to all city facilities and operations within three years, making Chicago one of the largest cities in the world to make such a commitment.
“I am incredibly proud to advance this commitment to transitioning all city operations to 100% renewable energy by 2025,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “The signing of this agreement demonstrates that the City of Chicago is leading by example and driving high-impact climate action, building the clean energy workforce of the future and equitably distributing meaningful benefits to foster the local clean energy economy for all.”
Under the contract, the City entered into an energy supply agreement with an initial term of five years, beginning January 2023. Starting in 2025, the City will partially source its large energy uses such as the airports, Harold Washington Library Center and Jardine Water Purification Plant with clean, renewable energy from a new solar generation installation currently being developed by Swift Current Energy to the south outside Chicago. The project is expected to begin construction before the end of this year, bringing hundreds of construction jobs to the state of Illinois.
Constellation and Swift Current Energy have made financial commitments under the agreement to help fund job training, apprenticeships, education, and other programs in Chicago that focus on the development of a diverse, clean energy and sustainability-focused workforce. This approach will enable innovative local and equitable co-benefits agreements that will fund community climate infrastructure projects and workforce development training.
Constellation’s chief commercial officer Jim McHugh said the collaboration will also call for environmental justice initiatives. “As we work with our customers to implement sustainability initiatives, it is especially important that we help underserved and under-resourced communities participate in the transition to a carbon free future. We look forward to collaborating with Swift Current Energy to bring this project to life for the City of Chicago,” he said.
The 100% renewable agreement is the result of a competitive process that began with requests for proposals in September 2020. Chicago’s Climate Action Plan (CAP) calls for a 62% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 through direct investment and action by the city. By procuring solar energy for city operations, Chicago is expected to reduce its carbon footprint by more than 290,000 metric tons each year, equivalent to emissions associated with 62,000 passenger vehicles, according to US Environmental Protection Agency estimates. 
“As the owner or operator of over 425 facilities city-wide, including City Hall and one of the world’s busiest airports, it is imperative that we as city leaders take all measures necessary to decarbonize our assets and to mitigate the disastrous effects of climate change,” said Sandra Blakemore, Acting Commissioner for AIS.
To support the city’s needs, Swift Current Energy will own and operate Double Black Diamond Solar, a 593 MW facility, one of the largest in Illinois to date. “As the long-term owner and operator of Double Black Diamond Solar, Swift Current Energy will continue to strengthen our relationships with the project customers, Constellation and the host communities to ensure the benefits of the project are robust and long-lasting,” said Matt Birchby, co-founder and president of Swift Current Energy.
The City of Chicago will also procure Renewable Energy Credits from other sources for its remaining power uses, such as small and medium-sized buildings and streetlights.
“Chicago is thrilled to leverage our buying power to develop more equitable outcomes for the renewable energy market here in the State of Illinois,” said Angela Tovar, Chief Sustainability Officer. “The City of Chicago is proud to execute strategies that demonstrate our commitment to the goals outlined in CEJA including delivering community benefits to residents and reinvesting funding to spur more renewable energy deployment within the city limits.”
As a next step, AIS and the Chief Sustainability Officer will lead strategic planning to identify opportunities to encourage additional local, distributed renewable generation, city asset energy efficiency projects, and distributed energy storage within the city.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/09/study-finds-100-renewables-would-pay-off-within-6-years/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 9, 2022",Study finds 100% renewables would pay off within 6 years,"From pv magazine global
As renewables come to represent a larger portion of the worldwide energy mix, and as targets are put in place to increase it further still, there are plenty of worries over the cost that radically changing our energy systems will entail. And the intermittent nature of wind and solar also creates concern about insufficient supply and possible blackouts.
The latest energy system models from Stanford University researcher Mark Jacobson, however, show that for 145 countries, the energy transition too 100% wind, water, solar and storage would pay for itself within six years, and ultimately cost less than continuing with the current energy systems.
“Worldwide, WWS reduces end use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from $17.8 to $6.6 trillion per year), and Social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of $61.5 trillion,” Jacobson said in his most recent paper. “Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than business as usual.”
He described the model in “Low-cost solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy insecurity for 145 countries, which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. It builds on Jacobson’s previous work by adding new countries, more recent energy consumption data from all regions, and calculations to deal with uncertainty in the future price of battery energy storage, the role batteries will play, and the development of newer technologies such as vehicle to grid. But despite these uncertainties, Jacobson is certain that technological barriers don’t present a major roadblock for the transition.
“(About) 95% of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercialized,” he states.
The study also finds that, while jobs would be lost in the mining and fossil fuels segments, 28 million more jobs would be created than lost overall. Only Russia, Canada and parts of Africa are expected to see net job losses as a result, as these regions economies depend heavily on fossil fuels.
Though the study provides clear evidence that a full transition to 100% renewable energy is both technically and economically possible, Jacobson warns that plenty of uncertainty remains.
“Many additional uncertainties exist. One of the greatest is whether sufficient political will can be obtained to affect a transition at the rapid pace needed” he said. “However if political will can be obtained, then transitioning the world entirely to clean, renewable energy should substantially reduce energy needs, costs, air pollution mortality, global warming, and energy insecurity while creating jobs, compared with BAU.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/09/four-steps-to-creating-a-sustainable-distributed-generation-strategy/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,GUEST POST,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 9, 2022",Four steps to creating a sustainable distributed generation strategy,"The way the United States manages electricity was transformed over 40 years ago with legislation that established open access to the transmission level of the electricity grid. Known commonly as PURPA, it created independent system operators (ISOs) across the country to manage supply and demand in an unbiased manner. While the legislation had a tremendous impact, we now face a dire need to revisit how electricity markets are structured to accommodate the rapid influx of renewable energy systems that the Inflation Reduction Act will likely bring to the grid. It’s time to expand the PURPA approach to the distribution level of the electricity grid.
The sad truth is that our electricity markets currently lack the ability to accept the vast amounts of renewable energy capacity to meet state targets and corporate commitments to procure clean energy. A study by Princeton University found that high-voltage transmission capacity would need to expand by 60% to meet clean energy targets, representing billions of dollars in needed utility upgrades. 
However, we can avoid much of this need by siting renewable resources closer to where they are needed – at the distribution level of the grid. In order to do so, we will need to take several key steps to solve major system barriers to expanding renewable energy on the grid. The good news is that with some policy improvements – some major and some minor – renewable energy capacity at the distribution level can meet needs without the long lead time required for larger, utility-scale resources.  
Step 1: Unlock grid congestion data for more transparency
Across most of the United States, it’s relatively unknown to renewable energy developers how the grid will be able to handle the influx of new power generation at a particular location of the grid. This lack of transparency leads to cost uncertainty for developers and delays as projects get assessed for their grid impact and potential costs. 
The California Public Utilities Commision (CPUC) found a solution to this issue by requiring the state’s largest utilities to show where new renewable energy and energy storage capacity can be added to the grid without costly upgrades. While not foolproof, these interactive maps are a welcome feature that should be adapted across the country as a first step towards transparency. All utilities should have this data at their fingertips, so this step should be fairly straightforward to achieve.
Step 2: Integrate distributed generation into grid planning
While conventional thinking would suggest that large, centralized power stations would provide economies of scale benefits, the traditional approach to utility grid planning only considers the transmission level of the grid. Moreover, it fails to consider the costs and benefits of energy resources  at the distribution level, such as community solar and energy storage. 
Utilities should be encouraged and incentivized to participate in the growth of distributed energy resources. For example, community solar programs in Colorado have included the participation of both private developers as well as the state’s largest utility, Xcel Energy. This approach may reduce the opportunity available to non-utility investors, but it does provide a more sustainable approach that isn’t at odds with the future of the electric utility as we know it.
In addition, regulators should require utilities to plan for widespread deployment of local solar and storage when spending billions on hardening and upgrading the grid, as many utilities are currently requesting to do.  Regulators, utilities, and developers can and should work together to build these grid upgrades that allow for distributed energy. This would result in lowered costs and increased speed to deployment for new resources that bring significant societal benefits.
Step 3: Enact legislation and regulation that allows for long-term, proactive distributed generation growth
Through state legislation and regulation, some states are already fostering the growth of distributed generation. Located in close proximity to end users, distributed generation provides unique resiliency and reliability benefits. Projects have less environmental impact and reflect a lower interconnection burden on the grid. 
Because the distribution level of the grid lacks open access, state legislation is required to create programs that allow renewable energy developers to build projects to serve local communities. Some states, like Illinois, have generous program incentives to encourage new capacity. While the incentives are welcome, the main benefit of these programs is that they create a process to add distribution level capacity to the grid. Developers flock to states with such programs  until they are exhausted, then move to the next state with open capacity. The business model is akin to playing a game of whack-a-mole across the United States to find the next renewable energy market.
Instead, states should work to proactively enable their grid to deploy more distributed energy through a more market-based approach with increased transparency.  The actions mentioned in Steps 1 and 2 are good starts toward this, but more can be done. An ideal system would provide a scaled approach to both grid access and applicable incentives that reflects the need for capacity and the potential benefits that a given project would provide. A 2020 study by the Local Solar for All Coalition shows that the public stands to reap over $400 billion in savings and two million jobs by 2050 from a more local and clean electricity grid, not to mention its importance to fighting climate change. 
New York has taken such an approach to distributed generation policy through their relatively new “Solar Value Stack” model that appropriately incentivizes and directs deployment of renewable energy. Through this approach, each project is assigned a value to the grid by combining the local wholesale price with benefits like reduced carbon emissions and cost savings to customers. It’s the closest thing that we have today to proactive planning for projects that match grid needs.
The Coalition for Community Solar Access released a report earlier this year that outlines specific policies that states and utilities should follow to modernize the grid. It also encourages support for state regulators and policymakers so that they have the resources available to create effective policy.
Step 4: Create an independent body to manage the distribution level of the grid
Unlike the framework created by PURPA for the transmission level of the grid, the distribution level currently lacks an independent body to facilitate the buying and selling of electricity. Instead, electric utilities fully manage access with monopoly power of the local grid. Because state action is required to create special programs that set aside capacity for distributed generation projects, solar developers face unnecessary delays and market uncertainty, such as the 18-month waiting period in Massachusetts for new capacity. While the New York model is already an improvement, we can go a step further. 
The solution is to create independent distribution-level entities that facilitate open access, just like ISOs are currently doing at the transmission level. Utility companies will likely object to such ideas, driven by concerns about an erosion of market share and loss of control of customer relationships. However, utilities have a key part to play in the grid of the future. They should be profitable, sustainable entities that are compensated appropriately for access to a grid that they manage. 
This more granular take on an ISO means the creation of distribution system operators, or DSOs, to serve as referees to facilitate another part of the electricity supply chain. Under such a framework, utilities would still be paid for managing grid infrastructure and the power that they produce. In addition, distributed generation project owners would have open access (like at the transmission level) to sell electricity and much more transparent paths to interconnect projects. 
A 21st Century PURPA
The climate crisis has already brought significant changes to the electric grid. The cost of renewable energy has steadily decreased over the past decade. New technologies, like energy storage, are adding even more value to the grid by maximizing the impact of renewables. Community solar now represents a sweet spot through optimally sized projects that better serve the local environment and consumers alike. But we need to do more, and we need to do it faster.
The good news is that there is already a framework from the 1970s “energy crisis” that can be adapted to help solve our existing “climate crisis”. While the framework that PURPA created may not be perfect, it provides a good lens through which we can see the grid of the future. Our overarching goal should be a new system that works to solve the existing climate crisis by fostering more renewable energy on the electricity grid.
