The project will deploy advanced monitoring for overhead transmission lines in the Hornell, N.Y. area. This will reduce grid congestion by providing real-time data on where additional power can safely flow through the existing transmission infrastructure. If successful, this increased visibility could link more renewable energy resources to the state’s electrical grid. 
Historically, grid operators used static line ratings to decipher a grid’s energy capacity. They were applying the same weather assumptions to the entire grid regardless of the location of each line or the maximum continuous temperature it could withstand during its lifetime. This approach limited grid potential.
LineVision’s monitoring software observes and collects real-time data. Otherwise known as dynamic line ratings (DLR), the product determines the capacity limits of the power lines by assessing the current sag temperature and forecasted weather conditions in each region. The company reports that this increases the adaptability of transmission lines as they can more efficiently and safely increase the amount of energy flowing through them in response to current and evolving conditions. 
LineVision’s no-contact sensors also share insights on conductor health while detecting anomalies and risks. Moreover, the software can be deployed at scale without cutting off power. This combination can help stakeholders take a deep dive into understanding how to accelerate net-zero grid construction safely. “Our technology has helped our utility customers identify between 25% and 40% additional capacity on existing lines, which helps accelerate a transition to renewables,” said Hudson Gilmer, CEO and co-founder of LineVision.  
Monitoring current transmission lines decreases the necessity of large upgrades, which may help stabilize utility bills for New York residents. This is because the costs of incentivizing renewable electricity development and transmission upgrades are borne almost exclusively by the state’s utility customers through a charge per kilowatt hour of electricity consumed. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has spent almost $6.7 billion of ratepayer funds on various clean energy programs between 2008 and 2021, The Office of the New York State Comptroller (NYSOSC), currently led by Thomas P. DiNapoli reports.
New York has the tenth highest utility bills in the nation, and charging consumers per unit of electricity used economically impacts low-income households the most. Part of the state’s CLCPA requires at least 35% of benefits be directed to members of disadvantaged communities. 
One NYSOSC report proposes programs that provide low-income electric customers with bill credits to lower their overall utility cost through community solar programs like the Solar for All Program. Other suggestions include limiting electric bills of low-income consumers to 6% of household income pending their participation in state-sponsored electric installation and appliance programs. 
LineVision will partner with Avangrid’s electric utility operating company, New York State Electric & Gas, to install a non-contact lidar that will monitor transmission lines running from Elma Wyo., to Strykersville Wyo., and Warsaw Wyo., to Perry Wyo.   
Funding for the project was awarded to Avangrid and LineVision through the second round of NYSERDA’s Future Grid Challenge program. It centers on researching and scaling transmission and distribution technologies to realize New York’s CLCPA goal of achieving 70% renewable energy by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/22/soltec-introduces-hail-defense-algorithm-for-solar-trackers/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",Soltec introduces hail defense algorithm for solar trackers,"Soletc, a global solar tracking solution provider, announced it has released a new hail defense algorithm for mitigating damage to solar facilities.
Hailstorms, often unpredictable in nature and destructive to solar panels, pose a challenge to solar infrastructure. In 2021, hail related losses exceeded $1 billion across the United States.
Research suggests that hail begins to damage solar modules at starting at diameters of 3 cm, causing both invisible and visible damage to occur. Starting at 4 cm, the percentage of visible damage increases significantly.
A pv magazine USA webinar session revealed that hail risk mitigation is a common problem in the “Hail Alley,” a broad region encompassing around six states from the Dakotas to Texas, which often experience five or more days each year of catastrophic hail. Climate change has created patterns of irregularity as extreme weather increasingly crops up in regions bordering hail-prone regions.
Soltec’s research reveals that the risk of module damage due to hail impact is most often due to the direct and perpendicular strike of hailstones to the front glass of the module.
The company introduced its Hail Algorithm, combining prediction and detection to direct the panels to angle at a stowed position, protecting them from direct impacts on the face of the module. Stowed solar panels are angled steeply when a hail event is predicted or detected, leading to lowered risk of damage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/22/2022-iea-review-growth-and-challenges-in-the-us-solar-sector/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",2022 IEA review: Growth and challenges in the US solar sector,"For the solar industry in the United States, 2022 was a year of contrasting events. On one hand, the euphoria of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) overwhelmed all other industry dynamics, and is set to bolster the sector for decades. On the other hand, the total amount of solar power deployed in 2022 actually decreased compared to previous years.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its National Survey Report of PV Power Applications in the United States of America (PVPS), providing a comprehensive overview of 2022.
According to a joint analysis by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association, approximately 21,127 MWdc of solar power was installed at utility-scale and distributed sites in 2022. This total included 5,959 MW of residential and 2,667 MW of commercial capacity. Cumulatively, 2022 brought the distributed volume to 51,627 MW and utility scale to 89,929 MW, for a total of 141,556 MW of installed solar generation capacity. However, there was no available data on off-grid solar installation volumes.

By the end of 2022, cumulative solar installations had reached 4,043,034 systems, including 3.9 million residential, more than 130,000 industrial, and nearly 4,000 utility-scale systems.
Despite these numbers, the year’s total installed capacity was disappointing. The report attributes this to several factors, noting that “module costs rose during 2022 because of inflation, trade uncertainty (including an investigation into circumvention of antidumping/countervailing duties and scrutiny of the supply chain to ensure compliance with forced-labor laws), high polysilicon costs, and state-level and national policy uncertainties.” These challenges were compounded by inflation, pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, and increased logistics and labor costs.
Nationally, system pricing saw a year-over-year increase in all market segments: residential up 7%, commercial up 2%, small centralized (fixed tilt) up 8%, and small centralized (one-axis) up 3%.
The report highlights that roughly 80% of utility-scale projects in 2022 were owned by third-party power plant operators, bringing the cumulative total to 86%. However, in states like Florida and Virginia, where regulations require utilities to own the assets, the ownership percentages are reversed.

Loans financed 70% of residential installations, while cash purchases accounted for 10%. The remaining 20% were under third-party ownership, involving companies like Sunrun and Sunnova.
The report also discusses various policy frameworks supporting solar power across the U.S., including feed-in tariffs, feed-in tariff premiums (above market price), capital subsidies, green certificates, renewable portfolio standards, income tax credits, net metering, net billing, collective self consumption, interconnection laws, PURPA, financing support, sustainable building requirements, and merchant facilitation measures.

Naturally, the most impactful support came from the implementation of the IRA. The report examines the IRA’s various incentives, such as the Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, 48C, Production Tax Credit, Investment Tax Credit, and others.
The report estimates the “business value” of the solar industry in the United States at $38.6 billion. This figure is derived from the average price of $3.06 per watt for the 8.6 GW of grid-connected distributed solar, amounting to $26.4 billion, and $0.97 per watt for the 12.5 GW of utility-scale capacity deployed, totaling $12.1 billion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/22/u-s-energy-information-administration-says-solar-power-will-surpass-hydropower-by-14-next-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",U.S. Energy Information Administration says solar power will surpass hydropower by 14% next year,"Data published in the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) November Short-Term Energy Outlook, finds solar power will bypass hydroelectric power by 14% in 2024. The analysis used industry reports detailing the continued growth in utility and small-scale solar plants to make this assessment. 
According to the American Clean Power’s (ACP) quarterly market report, the domestic utility-scale clean energy industry installed 5.55 GW of renewables in Q3. Solar installations ranked first at 3.1 GW, followed by battery storage at 2.1 GW and land-based wind at 288 MW. 
Alternatively, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) U.S. Hydropower Market Report 2023 Edition, states that hydropower datasets depicting capacity additions, investment in refurbishment and upgrades, turbine runner installations, and hydraulic turbine trade rates show decreased activity throughout the early 2020s. This is compared to the 2010s, where hydropower capacity increased by 2.1 GW over the decade. 
DOE partially attributes hydropower upgrade and build-out decline to Covid-19 trade and travel restrictions. The new regulations caused supply chain challenges that resulted in construction delays and higher material costs. “In the case of U.S. imports of hydraulic turbines and turbine parts, the decrease in activity started in 2019 and was likely influenced by U.S. import tariffs.” 
The Inflation Reduction Act offers a $5.50 MW/h and $22 MW/h tax credit for applicable hydropower and marine energy projects. However, the DOE attributes the decline of hydropower activity during 2021 and 2022 to the legislation, too. “Plant owners were waiting for full guidance on implementing these incentives (which types of projects would qualify, details on wage, apprenticeship, and domestic content requirements) to make new capital investment decisions,” the report states. 
The Solar Energy Industries Association’s U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 report predicts domestic solar installations will increase from 153 GW of direct current (dc) capacity to 375 GWdc by the end of 2028. This is partially due to the steady growth of installations throughout Q1 and Q2 of 2023 despite a lull the industry experienced in 2022 because of supply chain constraints: they included changing regulations and rising material costs, reports LevelTen Energy, a clean energy transaction platform. 

SEIA’s November Short-Term Energy Outlook states that along with increased penetration of renewables, changing weather patterns have reduced U.S. hydroelectric generation through August this year, which has stayed at about 80 GW for the past few decades. 
Namely, extreme drought in the West decreased hydropower generation in the Northeast (-0.5%), the Northwest (-6.5%) and the Southwest (-31.6%). This made the average U.S. net hydropower generation between 2020 and 2022 4.2% lower than the average annual generation during the 2010s, decreasing from 278 TW/h to 266 TW/h. 
While weather patterns also affect solar and wind power, both have had the fastest growth in generation capacity compared to hydropower. This is because while hydroelectric generators have reservoirs that can store water for later use to power hydro turbines during high demand, EIA suggests that the activities of underwater and wetland ecosystems limit the ability to control the output.
