The solution in question is a lithium-metal chemistry with an energy density of 350 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), which is on the higher end of the spectrum, but not entirely in a league of its own. The chemistry also has the added advantage of being much lighter than traditional lithium-ion chemistries.
These aspects of lithium-metal are not new, however. What is new is the resilience of the battery. Historically, lithium-metal batteries have been plagued by premature death, with previous record holders accomplishing just 200 cycles before seeing significant drops in capacity.
The chemistry developed by the PNNL team was able to maintain 76% of its initial capacity after 600 cycles, blowing the old record out of the water. There is still work to be done for sure, as currently-used EV batteries typically last for around 1,000 cycles.
The breakthrough was achieved when researchers decided to test thin strips of lithium-metal, thinner than a strand of hair. This decision broke with tradition, as it had been commonly thought that thicker lithium anodes would be optimal. The researchers instead found the opposite to be true, coming to the conclusion that thicker strips contribute directly to battery failure, due to complex reactions around a film on the anode known as the solid electrolyte interphase.
Under optimal conditions, solid electrolyte interphase acts as a molecular gatekeeper between the anode and the electrolyte. Thinner lithium strips, it was found, retain contact between the liquid electrolyte and the anode, making important electrochemical reactions possible.
The work was funded by DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office and work was done through DOE’s Innovation Center for Battery500 Consortium, a multi-institution effort led by PNNL to develop electric vehicle batteries that are lighter, more energy intensive and less expensive than those currently used. The name Battery500 comes from the consortium’s foundational goal of developing a 500 watt-hours per kilogram battery.

The checklists, downloadable for free, provide guides to help ensure that projects comply with the newly updated Florida Building Code, National Electric Code, and National Fire Code.
“Checklists are a key element of high-reliability and high-performance engineering,” said Christopher Castillo, CEO of Castillo Engineering. The Solar Done Right Checklist is intended to help keep local building departments, solar installers, and homeowners current on the latest structural, electrical, and fire safety solar codes; as well as reduce plan examiners’ review times and permit rejections.
The company cited five primary reasons why solar plans are rejected in Florida.
In addition to the checklists, Castillo Engineering will offer a series of Continuing Education Courses hosted by the Building Officials Association of Florida.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/14/clean-energy-requires-metals-and-minerals-can-the-u-s-compete/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,CHINA,DR CONGO,IDAHO,MINNESOTA,MISSOURI,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 14, 2021",Clean energy requires metals and minerals: Can the U.S. compete?,"The transition to clean energy may reduce the need to mine and burn coal, but it comes with increased demand for raw materials that present supply chain hurdles.
Solar and wind create a demand for minerals and metals that will likely require expanding mining operations for cobalt for use in alloys and batteries, tellurium for solar cells and semiconductors, and germanium for transistors in electronic devices.
Researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T) said that rising demand for these components could increase metal production needs by two to six times per kilowatt produced. For example, they said that the 100,000 tons of cobalt produced each year globally will need to double by 2030 and triple by 2050.
“We could eventually reach some of our materials needs by recycling, but there is very little to recycle at this point,” said Michael Moats, director of the Thomas J. O’Keefe Institute for the Sustainable Supply of Strategic Minerals at Missouri S&T. As a result, new mining capacity will need to be brought online to meet demand, he said.
A recent Wood Mackenzie report said that while the U.S. is making some strides toward manufacturing batteries, it is behind in the race for raw materials. The report said that China currently has more than 80% of the world’s lithium refining capacity, more than 60% for cobalt, and more than a third of global nickel refinement.
The report projected a need for a 70% rise in U.S. nickel production by 2040; a 200% rise for cobalt; and 600% for lithium. China has positioned itself well to access these resources, with ownership of cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, lithium in Chile, and nickel in Indonesia.
Moats said, “It becomes an issue of how much control you want over your supply chain and how difficult it can be to bring supplies from overseas during wartime or political upheaval.”
The United States has cobalt assets in Missouri, Minnesota, and Idaho, but production trails other sources as the U.S. permit process can take years, said Moats. The U.S. also lacks smelters to refine the ore and existing mine tailings.
Moats testified to members of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources earlier this year, and said that many U.S. universities no longer offer degrees in mining or metallurgical engineering.
He said that although metal processing needs are on the rise, U.S. training in the trades, engineering, and science is lacking, especially in degrees in mining and metallurgical engineering. Seven schools in the U.S. offer Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited metallurgical engineering programs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/14/wartsila-joins-a-growing-field-of-oems-testing-hydrogen-as-a-fuel-for-electric-power-generation/,"HYDROGEN,NORTH AMERICA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 14, 2021",Wärtsilä joins a growing field of OEMs testing hydrogen as a fuel for electric power generation,"Global power plant developer Wärtsilä has begun testing in Finland to learn how its reciprocating internal combustion engines may be fueled with pure hydrogen. It also announced plans to disclose by 2025 an engine and power plant “concept” capable of running on 100% hydrogen. The firm said it has already proven its existing engines can be operated with up to 25% hydrogen.

Wärtsilä joins other engine and turbine manufacturers in working to test and prove hydrogen-based power generating technology.
One utility that is already planning long-term seasonal storage of renewable energy as hydrogen is the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. LADWP is leading the conversion of the Intermountain Power Project in Delta, Utah, to use one of the world’s first gas turbines designed and built to operate on 100% green hydrogen.
Dubbed “IPP Renewed,” the Intermountain project includes retiring existing coal-fired units at the power plant site and installing new natural gas-fired electricity generating units capable of utilizing hydrogen for 840 MW net generation output. Additional investment will modernize the power plant’s transmission system to southern California, and develop hydrogen production and long-term storage capabilities. The new natural gas generating units will be provided by Mitsubishi Power and designed to use 30% hydrogen fuel at start-up, transitioning to 100% hydrogen fuel by 2045 as technology improves.
Salt dome storage of hydrogen is also being evaluated at other U.S. locations, by a partnership between Mitsubishi Power and Texas Brine.
Wärtsilä said it will test its existing internal combustion engines to find the “optimum parameters” for running on hydrogen. The firm projects that 933 GW of carbon-neutral “thermal balancing capacity” will be needed in the G20 group of nations to achieve 100% renewable energy.
One challenge in introducing hydrogen to conventional gas-fired power plants is the issue of flashback, a phenomenon where the flames inside the combustor travel up the incoming fuel and actually exit the combustion chamber.
Mixing hydrogen with air must be done in as confined a space as possible. The problem is that flashback becomes more likely when the fuel nozzle jets and flame are close together. One possible fix is to modify the combustor design to create a multi-cluster combustor that uses many fuel nozzles. This approach would allow mixing to occur on a smaller scale, eliminating flashback. As a result, as hydrogen concentrations greater than 30% are introduced, combustor modifications at the power plants may be required.
Gas turbine manufacturer GE is also testing the use of a fuel blend starting at about 5% green hydrogen and increasing to about 30%, in a pilot project with the New York Power Authority and other partners. GE announced a goal of achieving net-zero emissions from all of its products, including gas turbines, by 2050.
The U.S. Department of Energy continues to fund hydrogen energy research projects, most recently granting $52.5 million across 31 projects.
Beyond internal combustion engines and gas turbines, Japanese manufacturer Panasonic is developing a pilot project using fuel cells that will generate electricity from 100% hydrogen, with a planned start of operations in the spring of 2022. Each of the firm’s fuel cell generators has a power output of 5 kW and a rated power generation efficiency of 56%.
A reversible fuel cell technology is also being developed by a startup team led by Thomas Zawodzinski of the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The technology is possibly suited for long-term storage, Zawodzinski said in an online presentation.
And Indiana-based Cummins Inc. said it began testing a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine. The proof-of-concept test may potentially expand the technology options available and aligns with what Cummins said are its existing capabilities in hydrogen fuel cell, battery electric, and renewable natural gas powertrains.
Following proof-of-concept testing, the company plans to evaluate the engine in a variety of on- and off-highway applications.
The hydrogen engines can use green hydrogen fuel, produced by Cummins-manufactured electrolyzers, emitting near-zero CO2 emissions through the tailpipe and near-zero levels of NOx.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/07/14/sunrise-brief-doe-aims-to-cut-long-duration-storage-costs-by-90-in-a-decade/,"ACQUISITIONS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JULY 14, 2021",Sunrise brief: DOE aims to cut long-duration storage costs by 90% in a decade,"The U.S. Department of Energy set a goal to reduce the cost of grid-scale, long duration energy storage by 90% within the decade.
As the second target within DOE’s Energy Earthshot Initiative, the so-called “Long Duration Storage Shot” aims to accelerate breakthroughs that store electricity generated by the hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy that the agency expects to come onto the grid over the next few years.
DOE said that several of its offices conduct energy storage activities, and the administration’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request included a total of $1.16 billion for those activities. Pending appropriations from Congress, DOE said it anticipates funding opportunities and other activities to help advance its goals.

DOE said that long-duration energy storage – defined as systems that can store energy for more than 10 hours at a time – would support a low-cost, reliable, carbon-free electric grid. Cheaper and more efficient storage would make it easier to capture and store clean energy for use when energy generation is unavailable or lower than demand.
The storage initiative will consider all types of technologies, including electrochemical, mechanical, thermal, chemical carriers, or any combination with the potential to meet duration and cost targets for grid flexibility.
Currently, pumped-storage hydropower is the largest source of long duration energy storage on the grid, DOE said. And lithium ion is the primary source of new energy storage technology deployed on the grid, providing shorter duration storage capabilities.
DOE developed the target through its Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC), which are linked across the Department’s Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Electricity, Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, Science, Nuclear Energy, and Technology Transitions, as well as the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy.
The first Earthshot – Hydrogen Shot – was announced on June 7. It sets a cost target to speed innovation and spur demand of clean hydrogen by reducing the cost by 80%.
DOE said it plans to hold a series of events, including a Long Duration Storage Shot Summit to be held on the Autumn Equinox, also known as World Energy Storage Day, on September 22.
Altus Power and CBRE Acquisition Holdings said they will combine, resulting in Altus Power becoming a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AMPS. Acquisition Holdings is a special-purpose company sponsored by CBRE Group, one of the world’s largest commercial real estate services firms.
Altus Power is currently wholly-owned by its management team and Blackstone Credit, and provides solar generation, energy storage, and EV-charging stations across the U.S. Since its founding in 2009, Altus Power has built or acquired more than 200 distributed generation solar facilities totaling more than 265 MW from Vermont to Hawaii. The company said it expects to end 2021 with a solar asset portfolio of more than 400 MW.
The transaction is anticipated to generate gross proceeds of up $678 million of cash, which will be used to fund the company’s growth and strengthen the combined company’s balance sheet.
Proceeds include a $275 million fully committed common stock private investment in public equity (PIPE), anchored by CBRE Group and existing investors, including Altus Power management and Blackstone Credit, as well as new investors, including ValueAct Capital, Liberty Mutual Investments, and other institutional investors. The pro forma implied equity value of the combined company is $1.58 billion at the $10 per share price in the transaction.
Altus Power’s leadership will remain, with Lars Norell and Gregg Felton continuing as co-CEOs of the combined company. The Board of Directors of the combined company will include representation from Altus Power, CBRE, Blackstone Credit, and ValueAct Capital, and have a majority of independent directors.
The transaction was approved by the boards of Altus Power and Acquisition Holdings. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Los Angeles-based Universal Hydrogen signed two letters of intent with air carriers to convert commercial aircraft to hydrogen as fuel.
One letter of intent was with Air Nostrum, a regional airline based in Valencia, Spain, and covers the purchase of 11 turboprop conversion kits for use across the airline’s existing and future fleet. The kits include a hydrogen fuel cell and electric motor that replaces the aircraft’s existing turboprop engine. The kits also are compatible with Universal Hydrogen’s modular hydrogen capsule technology that allows for the delivery of hydrogen to airports without the need for purpose-built infrastructure.
In addition to the aircraft conversions, Universal Hydrogen would become Air Nostrum’s long-term green hydrogen service provider. The aircraft are expected to have equivalent or better unit economics compared to the existing fleet.
Universal Hydrogen signed a second letter of intent with Icelandair Group, through which the two will pursue green hydrogen as a propellant for Icelandair’s domestic aircraft fleet of Dash 8 turboprops. Universal Hydrogen will provide its aftermarket hydrogen conversion kit for regional aircraft, as well as a fuel distribution system.
Once the Dash 8 conversions are successfully completed, Universal Hydrogen and Icelandair would enter into a long-term fuel services contract to provide green hydrogen for Icelandair’s fleet at scale.
