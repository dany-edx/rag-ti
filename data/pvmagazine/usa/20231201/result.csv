The solar installation is expected to produce 20 GWh of  clean energy annually or enough to power 195 homes.
The 1.7 MWdc project also powers six electric vehicle charging stations, which have already been installed on the R.A Jones’ campus for use by company employees.
Construction on the roof installation has begun, with Melink Solar of Milford, Ohio providing the design and build of the solar installation. The project is expected to be completed in Q1 of 2024.
Melink Solar is using Sollega ballasted racking, with VSUN and Znshine panels. The six EV charging stations feature PowerPost EV chargers from Konnectronix. Both Konnectronix and Melink are members of the Workplace Charging Challenge, U.S. Department of Energy  initiative to expand the EV Everywhere program that is part of the “Clean Energy Grand Challenges,” which encourages companies to increase the amount of workplace EV chargers.
The solar installation is expected to offset 33,200 tons of atmospheric CO2 in its 30-year lifespan, or the equivalent of taking 252 cars off the road for 30 years or planting nearly a half a million trees.
R.A Jones’ business focus is helping its customers be more environmentally focused by reducing packaging, substituting plastic shrink-wrap with recycled paperboard, etc. The decision to install solar and EV chargers at its U.S. facility is in keeping with that focus.
“For years, R.A Jones has been working to help some of the largest consumer brands in the world meet their sustainability initiatives by lessening the impact their manufacturing processes and packaging has on the environment,” said Jonathon Titterton, CEO of Coesia Americas and R.A Jones. “Our company is firmly committed to being environmentally responsible and ready to transition to renewable energy at our Covington plant.”
R.A Jones is the first Coesia company in the United States to power its facility with photovoltaic systems. Coesia, a global operation headquartered in Bologna, Italy, projects that the R.A. Jones installation will  reduce the company’s electric bill by $6.4 million over its 30-year life span.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/01/california-rooftop-solar-installations-drop-80-following-nem-3-0/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",California rooftop solar installations drop 80% following NEM 3.0,"California, once a leader in residential solar, is feeling the effects from unpopular policy changes like the introduction of Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 and more recent market rate cuts for rooftop solar generation by renters, schools, and farms. 
The two policy changes cut compensation rates for exporting local, clean solar generation to the grid by about 75%. State regulators said the change facilitating was a necessary evolution in the grid, but opponents argued that the move was a thinly veiled move to protect the profits of major utilities. 
“We are launching the solar and storage industry into the future so that it can support the modern grid. The new tariff promotes solar systems and battery storage with a focus on equity,” said the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) upon passing NEM 3.0. 
“The CPUC’s final proposal is a loser for California on many levels. For the solar industry, it will result in business closures and the loss of green jobs. For middle class and working-class neighborhoods where solar is growing fastest, it puts clean energy further out of reach,” said the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA). 
Which prediction came true? 
Unsurprisingly, gutting the return on investment for solar for homeowners, renters and small businesses in California did not encourage installations. 
Utility interconnection request data shows that solar sales have fallen between 66% and 83% year-over-year following NEM 3.0.  
What’s more, there have been massive layoffs industry wide. CALSSA said over 17,000 solar jobs have been lost in 2023, representing 22% of all solar jobs in the industry.
Based on interviews of residential solar installers across the state, CALSSA found that 59% of installers expect more layoffs ahead, and 63% expect to have cash flow issues over the next three quarters. About 70% expressed concern about their business outlook, while 43%, or about 300 businesses, said it will be difficult to remain in business. 
To meet its clean energy goals, California needs to install 3.5 times as much solar and seven times as much energy storage as what is cumulatively installed today. With minimal demand, layoffs and business closures, it will be very difficult to meet these requirements. 
CALSSA said that short of reversing the decision altogether, there are a few things CPUC can do to repair the damage done. First, it recommends rejecting the Income Graduated Fixed Charge proposed by utilities that would assess minimum bills on all customers, regardless of whether they pull electricity from the grid or not. 
Other recommendations include: 
“CPUC commissioners claimed their decision was about ‘launching the solar and storage industry into the future.’ Instead they caused the nation’s largest-ever loss of clean energy jobs, pushed once thriving businesses out of the state or into bankruptcy, and derailed California’s fastest and most accessible path to a clean energy future,” said Bernadette del Chiaro, executive director of CALSSA.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/01/battery-prices-down-14-this-year-says-bloombergnef/,"BATTERY,COST AND PRICES,WORLD",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"DECEMBER 1, 2023","Battery prices down 14% this year, says BloombergNEF","From pv magazine global
BloombergNEF said in its latest annual study on lithium-ion batteries that the average price of battery packs has fallen this year to $139/kWh, or 14% less than the average of $161/kWh in 2022.
To calculate this average price, BNEF conducted more than 300 surveys among buyers and sellers of lithium-ion batteries for electric passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, buses, two- and three-wheeled vehicles, and energy storage applications.
Prices vary by sector: Chinese electric buses and commercial vehicles have the lowest prices at $100/kWh. The average price of packs for fully electric passenger cars was $128/kWh.
“However, the story behind this price decrease is somewhat different from previous years,” the analysts said. While the main cause of falling battery prices has historically been technological innovation, this year the price drop is mainly attributed to reduced raw material costs.
Prices for key battery metals, especially lithium, have fallen sharply since January, due to significant growth in production capacity in all parts of the battery value chain, from raw materials and components to cells and battery packs.
Although demand continued to increase year on year, the pace of growth in some electric vehicle markets slowed in the second half of the year, mainly due to increased financing costs and economic uncertainty. On the other hand, battery production in China alone exceeded global demand.
As for the future, BNEF’s energy storage team expects prices to closely follow the trajectory of raw material prices. “We project that pack costs will fall to $133/kWh next year in real terms in 2023,” said BNEF. “In the long term, if the learning pace of the previous year is maintained, battery prices will fall below $100 /kWh in 2027.”
BNEF said that local battery manufacturing in regions such as the United States and Europe can drive up prices in the short term due to the price of energy, equipment, land and labor in these regions compared to Asia.
“However, as the industry matures, these costs could end up falling,” the report said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/01/ev-adoption-can-help-curb-urban-air-pollution/,"EV,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",EV adoption can help curb urban air pollution,"The challenge of urban air pollution has emerged as a significant barrier to healthy development. In 2014, almost half of the American population resided in areas that fell short of federal air quality standards. This concerning trend correlates with a notable demographic shift noted by the Pew Research Center: between 2000 and 2014, urban regions in the U.S. saw a net gain of 1.6 million migrants, marking a move from areas with cleaner air to those more polluted.
The solution to improving urban air quality has been recognized within the scientific community since at least 1958, when a report in the Journal of Chemical Education contrasted the air pollution in Los Angeles ― with more cars per capita than any city on Earth ― and other major cities. The authors were confident that automobile exhaust was the main driver of urban air pollution for several reasons: the chemical composition of automobile exhaust, comparison of the estimated quantities of pollutants emitted by automobiles with those measured in the atmosphere, and distribution of traffic compared to the distribution of pollution effects. The report noted “the elimination [of air pollution] will depend on how much the citizens of Los Angeles and other affected areas are willing to pay for a remedy such as a device to be used on automobiles.”
Flash forward to the present. Emissions from transportation are the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. According to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector increased more in absolute terms than any other sector from 1990 to 2021. Yet cities already have the solution. The miraculous “device to be used on automobiles” hypothesized decades ago is well-known today: engines powered by electricity, not gasoline, that eliminate tailpipe emissions altogether.
Years of research have also revealed the startling effects of toxic emission exposure on early childhood development, especially among non-White communities. The need for cities to reduce pollution is a moral imperative with clearly defined consequences for their most vulnerable residents:
Children’s increased exposure to air toxins during infancy can delay brain development and reduce reading and math abilities. For some, the effect is equivalent to losing an entire month of elementary school.
Pollution in the “most White” and “least White” census tracts across the United States is unevenly distributed. Nitrogen dioxide levels in the least White tracts were nearly three times higher than those in the most White, according to research published by the National Academy of Sciences. This is because many minority communities are jammed up against highways and major traffic corridors, often because of past redlining and highway construction cutting through their neighborhoods.
According to the American Lung Association, if all new cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs sold by 2035 were zero-emission, there would be up to 89,300 fewer premature deaths, 2 million fewer asthma attacks, 10.7 million fewer lost workdays, and a savings of $978 billion in public health benefits across the United States by 2050.
Norway is often cited as a real-world example of how EV adoption can reduce air pollution. About 80% of new cars sold there now are fully electric, and another 10% are plug-in hybrids. The country is powered by an electricity grid that is already very green (91.8% hydropower and 6.4% wind). As a result, emissions of dangerous particles less than 2.5 micrometers in size plunged by nearly three-quarters from 2000 to 2020.
California’s ambitious EV adoption goals in recent years have yielded measurable results, too. According to a zip-code based ecologic study conducted in California from 2013-19, increasing the number of electric vehicles per 1,000 people by 20 in a given zip code was associated with a 3.2% drop in the rate of emergency room visits due to asthma ― a common side effect of inhaling combustion byproducts such as carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and aldehydes.
So, what’s a city to do? It can start by setting an example for residents by ditching gasoline-powered fleet vehicles in favor of EVs. These are cars, trucks, and buses that, by definition, conduct business within city limits. The growing number of fleet conversions at both the city and county levels appear to acknowledge both the problems associated with toxic automobile emissions and the obvious solution. The largest municipality in North America, New York City, already operates more than 4,000 government-owned EVs. The EPA’s Clean School Bus Program is providing more than $5 billion to help cities prioritize vehicles moving children and idling near schools.
Cities are also finding other ways to use taxpayer dollars to encourage EV adoption. In Los Angeles ― ground zero for harmful tailpipe emissions ― residents now enjoy more than 1,100 public charging stations, free parking and charging for EVs at some locations, and rebates for residents who install home chargers. In the San Francisco Bay Area, EV drivers receive reduced bridge tolls.
Advances in EV technology have been rapid enough over the last decade that cities and counties have no excuse not to meet the imperative of embracing EV adoption. In a world rapidly evolving toward urbanization, the menace of air pollution stands as a dark shadow, threatening the health and futures of our children. The correlation between toxic emissions and cognitive impairment in the most vulnerable communities paints a sobering picture of inequality and environmental injustice. Yet, amidst this gloom, the electric vehicle revolution shines brightly as a beacon of hope.
Cities are not just sprawling centers of economic growth and human potential; they also bear the responsibility of shaping the quality of life for millions. Every child deserves the right to breathe clean air, and every parent the assurance that their child’s environment isn’t silently eroding their potential. Data from places like Norway and California present not just a vision but a tangible reality of what is achievable.
As we stand on the cusp of technological and societal shifts, it’s no longer a question of whether cities can afford to embrace electric vehicles but whether they can afford not to. Let the drive toward an electrified future be the legacy we leave behind.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/12/01/100-years-of-patience-needed-for-1-billion-in-interconnection-costs/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",100 years of patience needed for $1 billion in interconnection costs,"BayWa r.e., with its roots in the early 20th century, originated from its parent company, BayWa AG. Founded in 1923, BayWa AG initially focused on the agricultural sector before expanding into the energy industry in the 2000s through acquisitions of wind, solar and energy services.
pv magazine USA sat down with Fred Robinson, CEO of BayWa r.e. Solar Projects, to discuss the intricacies of designing and interconnecting solar power plants. BayWa r.e. has an active presence in numerous regions across the United States. The company’s projects are located in the WECC, CAISO, Arizona, MISO, PJM, New York, and Texas regions, although they are not actively developing  in Texas.

The conversation centered on interconnection, with Robinson emphasizing the need for transparency in queue processes, crucial for BayWa r.e.’s continued investment in project development. 
Robinson believes that the tides are turning a bit, and he praised California Governor Newsom’s initial efforts in addressing CAISO’s queue challenges. Notably, the company is developing projects exceeding 1 GW in the CAISO region, underscoring its significant investments there. Historically, securing a position in the interconnection queue meant that the position could be held indefinitely, irrespective of whether the project was moving forward. This approach, counterproductive to state clean energy objectives, is currently being revised.
Robinson says that utility attitudes are changing, particularly in their approach to solar assets. Recently, they’ve inclined toward ownership of solar plants, spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit opportunities. It’s expected that there will be an increase in “build and transfer” facilities built by groups like BayWa r.e.
One of our superpowers is our patience. If you can be patient it’s a competitive advantage. BayWa r.e. has been around for 100 years. We’ve got patience.
This patience is necessary, as the company works through interconnection costs approaching $1 billion, sometimes more. Meanwhile, the interconnection situation provided motivation for BayWa r.e. to innovate.
“These days, the name of the game is ‘maximizing sites’,” Robinson notes.
The company is enhancing wind sites by integrating solar and batteries, boosting the output at individual interconnection points. BayWa r.e. then manages the energy throughput at these sites, prioritizing wind, followed by battery charging, and curtailing solar as needed.
We look at projects like a little symphony. Holistic project development gets a lot of sympathy from land owners, and our company’s history feels the allure of taking care of the land.
Robinson says that he and his colleagues are strongly enthusiastic for the future of their industry, especially since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation provides a decade-long runway for BayWa r.e. As they continue developing projects in the U.S. market.
