https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/16/solar-tax-credit-transfer-market-gains-momentum/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023",Solar tax credit transfer market gains momentum,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a key initiative of President Biden’s administration, has introduced a transformative feature for the solar industry: The ability to transfer solar project tax credits from the project owner to other commercial entities with tax liabilities. Previously, tax equity models required the future owner of the tax credits to share in the project’s risk, a complex arrangement that has facilitated over a hundred billion dollars in U.S. solar projects.
This new transferability option simplifies the process significantly. It eliminates the need for the tax credit’s new owner to be a partner in the solar project; they only need to be able to utilize the tax credit. Theoretically, for smaller projects, the documentation should be simple. Larger, more financially intensive projects still require substantial legal expertise.
Some industry groups have found that for projects exceeding a certain size, traditional tax equity models may remain advantageous due to the opportunity to sell the project’s depreciation.
In October, Evergrow, a specialty finance company, announced their first IRA tax credit transfer. The transaction involved connecting high net worth individuals with Connecticut-based solar developer Davis Hill Development.
Larger deals in the solar tax credit transfer space are happening as well, as demonstrated by Blackstone and Bank of America’s agreement to transfer $580 million worth of tax credits, funding $1.5 billion in solar and wind projects.
For insights into this evolving market, pv magazine USA consulted Adam Shor, a boutique finance consultant who works on smaller projects, and tax attorney David Burton of Norton Rose Fulbright.
Adam Shor noted a growing demand for tax credits, influencing the tax equity market.
Some deals that I previously would have seen as a “tax equity” deal are now “tax credit transfer” deals. This is due to the perceived simplicity of a transfer deal, but more practically speaking, it’s easier to attract a transfer credit buyer than a tax equity investor.
Shor highlighted that tax credit transfer deals, often simpler purchase and sale agreements, are becoming more popular due to their straightforward nature compared to tax equity partnerships. These partnerships require deeper involvement and understanding of the long-term risks in solar projects. In contrast, transfer deals cut down on complexity and documentation, with term sheets typically a third of the length of those in tax equity deals. This efficiency makes these transfers appealing to investors seeking the financial benefits of tax credits without deep operational involvement.
David Burton noted that certain large-scale deals, particularly in areas with high solar radiation and lower labor costs, are opting for the performance tax credit (PTC) over the standard investment tax credit (ITC). This choice is seen in projects where the PTC, applied over the first ten years of a project’s life, offers greater benefits.

An analysis by the CRC-IB team [pv-magazine-usa.com] indicated that projects with higher capacity factors and lower cost might benefit more from the PTC. Conversely, smaller projects in lower capacity markets would likely gain more from the ITC.
Shor has observed tax credit prices for smaller projects (under $15 million) hovering in the 85 to 90 cents on the dollar range. In contrast, Burton’s team at Norton Rose Fulbright sees similar pricing for newer technologies like renewable natural gas and CO2 capture. For larger, standard solar and wind projects with strong indemnity and solid balance sheets, the prices are slightly higher, often in the mid to low 90 cents per dollar range.
Both experts agree on the increasing necessity of insurance in these transactions. However, the insurance focus isn’t on the project’s completion but on ensuring the project’s eligibility for tax credits. Burton noted: 
The insurer is covering risks like how much of the project’s basis is ITC-eligible, whether the project began construction before January 29, 2023 to be grandfathered from compliance with the prevailing wage and apprentice rules, or whether the project satisfied the “80/20” repowering test in order to qualify for tax credits, despite the predecessor project having qualified for tax credits.
The team at Norton Rose Fulbright has extensively covered this topic in a detailed article.
An essential aspect of tax transfer finance is that developers and project owners must fully fund their projects initially. Credit buyers typically prefer to finance projects as late in the year as possible, with December 15th being a common deadline. Bridge loan financing is becoming available for the tax credit transfer amounts to approved customers.
To conclude, Shor emphasized a critical strategy for solar developers aiming to maximize their commissions: understanding and leveraging the “step up” in tax credit transfer deals. Unlike traditional tax equity deals, transfer deals typically do not accommodate a “step up” due to legal penalties for claiming excessive credits. The “step up” refers to the difference between the cost basis and the fair market value basis of an asset, which can significantly impact a developer’s financial return.
Many developers are adopting what’s informally known as a “t-flip” (tax equity flip) strategy. This involves initially selling the project into a traditional tax equity partnership to benefit from some level of a step up and monetize the available depreciation. Subsequently, the credits are transferred from the tax equity partnership to a third-party buyer solely interested in the tax credit aspect. This method allows developers to distribute risk, reduce the initial tax equity investor’s investment, and maximize benefits from the sale of the project’s tax advantages.
This approach underscores the nuanced strategies solar developers can employ to optimize their returns in the evolving landscape of solar tax credit finance.

The company’s “field factory” installed 17 MW of a 225 MW solar project in Arizona in development by Leeward Renewable Energy and engineering and construction contractor RES.
The Terafab system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.
In the Arizona project, Terabase said its labor productivity improved 25% when compared with manual installation.
“[The project] demonstrates that Terabase’s technology can drive substantial progress in solar construction safety, quality, cost, and schedule,” said Will Schultek, vice president of construction, RES.
The installation system cuts the amount of labor needed on-site and improves working conditions for laborers. Workers are housed in shaded and cooled conditions, allowing for system operation and installation in harsh desert environments.
Reducing labor requirements to install utility-scale solar project may prove useful for accelerating the energy transition. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects a demand of 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the United States needs to be on pace with its decarbonization plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, said the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).
Terabase’s field factory also enabled a 100% return on solar panel packaging for reuse by the manufacturer.
Leeward Renewable Energy executive vice president of project execution Sam Mangrum said the benefits demonstrated in the project underscore the “transformative potential of automation” in solar.
“This milestone marks a pivotal moment in our mission to accelerate solar plant deployment to meet the terawatt scale demands of the future,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer, Terabase Energy. “Furthermore, the Terafab system was deployed alongside our Construct digital twin software for managing and monitoring solar power plant construction.”

Fujifilm contracted for 125 MW and Bristol Myers Squibb for 145 MW of solar from the project.
Including the Blevins project, National Grid Renewables has nearly 1 GW of renewable energy projects in ERCOT, and Blevins is the second National Grid Renewables project located in Falls County.
In addition to producing new tax revenue and landowner income for the local and statewide communities, National Grid reports that it has set up a dedicated charitable fund. The company estimates that Blevins’ direct economic impact will reach approximately $35 million over the first 30 years of operation.
Fujifilm is a Japanese multinational corporation that makes displays, medical imaging equipment,  photographic film and more. The company reports that its purchase of about 46% of the solar plant’s capacity will offset 100% of the company’s total electricity use in the United States and Canada, or the equivalent to avoiding approximately 90,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year.
“Fujifilm strives to be a company that contributes to solving society’s greatest challenges, including addressing climate change through our business strategy and operations,” said Teiichi Goto, president and chief executive officer, representative director of Fujifilm Holdings Corporation. “This Power Purchase Agreement is aligned with our policy, which emphasizes securing a stable supply of renewable electricity with additionality2. We will continue to reduce CO2 emissions in our supply chain and contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society.”
The investment in clean energy from Texas is just one of many environmental moves by Fujifilm. The company’s plant in Tilburg, the Netherlands, derives 100% of its electricity from wind, and it is moving toward being 100% carbon neutral with the installation of high-efficiency heat pumps and an e-boiler. Fujifilm has also outfitted manufacturing plants in China, Japan and the U.S. with solar panels. Furthermore, the company is addressing decarbonization of the fuel it uses in and is promoting an advanced initiative to establish a carbon neutral model in manufacturing using technologies including synthetic methane and hydrogen that do not emit CO2.
World Konect Energy Services served as advisor for the agreement between Fujifilm and National Grid Renewables.
Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), a global biopharmaceutical company, has set goals of achieving net zero by 2050 and obtaining 100% of its electricity purchased from renewable sources by 2030. In 2022 the company signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for 60 MW of electricity generated 240 MW Cattlemen Solar Park in Milam County, Texas.
For this Blevins project, Bristol Myers Squibb worked with Edison Energy, LLC as an independent advisor, providing renewables market expertise and analytics support.
“Environmental sustainability is an important component of our business strategy and embedded within our enterprise operations,” said Danielle Menture, vice president, environment, occupational health, safety and sustainability at Bristol Myers Squibb. “This agreement is another critical step in our journey towards achieving our goal of 100% purchased electricity from renewable sources and supporting the move toward cleaner energy.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/11/16/restorage-better-than-a-colorado-utilitys-proposed-400-mw-gas-unit-strategen/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,COLORADO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023",RE+storage better than a Colorado utility’s proposed 400 MW gas unit: Strategen,"Storage and renewables projects already offered in response to an RFP from the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) would be more economic and provide greater capacity than a 400 MW gas peaker unit proposed by the utility, found the consulting firm Strategen in an analysis of the utility’s proposed resource plan.
The Colorado utility, an Xcel Energy subsidiary, “takes commendable strides toward decarbonization,” says the Strategen analysis, but the low cost of clean energy resources supported by the Inflation Reduction Act “could provide an opportunity to avoid additional natural gas deployment.”
Strategen analyzed a portfolio of battery storage, solar and wind projects it selected from a public list of almost 800 bids for new renewables and battery projects that were offered in response to the utility’s 2022 all-source request for proposals.
Strategen said its portfolio, sized to exceed the capacity of a 400 MW gas peaker unit the utility proposed in its resource plan, would provide savings of about $29 million in its first year of operation, with greater savings in subsequent years. Those savings do not consider grid service benefits, stranded asset risk or fuel supply risk.
Because the costs for specific RFP bids are not publicly available, Strategen’s analysis assumed that the costs of the battery storage, solar and wind projects would equal the generic costs that PSCo presented in an appendix to its resource plan.
PSCo’s plan proposes 628 MW of new gas units by 2027, representing “long-term investments that will restrict PSCo’s ability to eventually achieve a fully decarbonized grid,” Strategen’s report says.
For two of the gas units proposed by PSCo—sized at 200 MW and 28 MW—Strategen was unable to analyze the potential to substitute renewables and storage because the utility proposed those units specifically for their local reliability benefits, and the public database of projects submitted in response to the RFP did not disclose location data. Strategen said its analysis of the 400 MW gas unit may also be applicable to the 200 MW unit if locational data and local reliability analysis were made available to stakeholders.
Strategen credited PSCo with proposing in its resource plan an 80% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, retiring all coal plants in the process.
Even so, Brian Turner, a director at the trade group Advanced Energy United, which sponsored the Strategen analysis, said Xcel’s proposal to build the new gas units “is a missed opportunity to provide Colorado households and businesses the best-cost and cleanest energy.” Turner noted that last winter the price of natural gas “skyrocketed, leaving ratepayers with high bills.”
Advanced Energy United said in a statement that as the cost of renewable energy continues to decline, new gas turbines risk becoming stranded assets, leaving ratepayers to pay billions of dollars “for a resource that may one day soon no longer produce any energy.”
The trade group formally presented its concerns in comments it submitted to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission.
