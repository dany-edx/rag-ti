Qcells and a group of European research institutes led by HZB have started a project with the aim of producing high-efficiency tandem solar cells and modules. The so-called Pepperoni project will establish a pilot manufacturing line in Thalheim, Qcell’s headquarters in Germany. The name stems from the broader project titled ‘Pilot line for European Production of PEROvskite-Silicon taNdem modules on Industrial scale’ or PEPPERONI.
The silicon-perovskite tandem cells will have a bottom silicon cell based on Qcell’s Q.ANTUM technology. “The project aims to scale up the active area of perovskite/Si tandems from the 1cm2 of today’s record devices to industry-relevant dimensions,” the group said in a statement.
The project will identify and address barriers to speeding up the technology’s mass manufacturing and market penetration. One of the project’s goals is to minimize scaling losses by using innovative materials and equipment. It will also develop thin-film deposition processers and equipment, with the ultimate goal of building a new production capacity in Europe.
“At HZB we have developed the tandem technology to world-record efficiency level on lab scale,” said Bernd Stannowski, head of group industry compatible processes at HZB. “We are now looking forward to cooperate in the Pepperoni consortium with partners from science and industry to jointly scale this new and very promising technology up and transfer it to industry.”
The four-year project is partly funded by Horizon Europe, to a total of €14.5 million ($14.9 million). It includes 17 partners from 12 countries across Europe, with a key objective to demonstrate 26%-efficient modules or higher on industrial scale.

HECO is offering the solar procurement as part of a new community-based renewable energy or CBRE program to help lower electric bills of Hawaiian ratepayers and assist customers unable to afford the cost to install rooftop solar arrays.
In March 2022, HECO sent out requests for proposals to developers, companies, organizations or groups to form a subscriber organization of shared solar projects for the utility’s LMI customers.
After a competitive RFP bidding process, the Hawaii and Maui projects selected for inclusion in the CBRE program were developed by Nexamp Solar, with the co-development participation of MeLink Solar for an Oahu Island project.  The utility continues to work with the developers to finalize 20-year contracts.
The LMI solar projects are expected to enter commercial operations in 2025.

According to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Hawaii’s Community Power, which grades states based on community solar, net metering terms, PACE financing, community choice aggregation and various statewide tariffs and utility protocols, the state of Hawaii has a Grade C community power rating.
Hawaii scores in the middle because the state has some policies that continue to support local authority over consumer energy choice, according to the ILSR.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Hawaii rocketed to 18th place in the U.S. solar development market in 2021 from 32nd coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic with 1.49 GW of current PV installations as of mid-2022. The island state has been stymied by slow growth prospects and ranks 41nd in the country based on 825 MW of developments in the pipeline over the next five years.
The Hawaii State Legislature in June 2015 under Governor David Ige directed the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to form a “community-based renewable energy” tariff, Section 269-27.4 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. Details of the tariffs and statewide DG programs have been  developed under PUC Docket No. 2015-0389.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/23/solar-for-extreme-arctic-conditions/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022",Solar for extreme Arctic conditions,"Researchers from the US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories are assessing solar generation in extreme environments north of the Arctic Circle. The team recently installed a 4.3 kW PV system on top of a storage container at Oliktok Point, Alaska. The system uses bifacial solar modules from an undisclosed manufacturer.
“Data collected at Oliktok Point will track daily energy gains and help develop predictive models of energy performance based on the tilt angle and orientation of the solar modules,” said the research institute.
Temperatures at the remote location can go as low as -43 C, with a wind chill factor of -57 C. Structures are covered by ice for most of the year and are exposed to harsh shoreline conditions.
“Oliktok Point is a very environmentally relevant field site – it checks all the boxes,” said Andrew Glen, the manager of atmospheric sciences at Sandia National Laboratories. “We go from permanent ice through the winter, with permafrost, to the sea ice breaking up, to open water and a melt season where the ground softens and turns to mud.”
The results from the system will show which system designs and technologies are most efficient in northern environments with limited sun in the winter.
“Alaska, and Oliktok in particular, represents an edge case for PV deployment,” said Bruce King, the director of Sandia’s Photovoltaic Systems Evaluation Lab. “Learning about edge cases helps inform conventional system design and may identify opportunities to increase energy harvest that might not otherwise be considered. This can be particularly important for PV deployments in other geographic areas that are also not optimal.”
The team said that it hopes the Oliktok Point project will help to facilitate the rollout of climate-optimized PV systems for remote off-grid communities in Alaska.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/23/berkeley-lab-report-on-u-s-residential-solar-adoption-shows-shifting-income-and-demographic-trends/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022",Berkeley Lab report on U.S. residential solar adoption shows shifting income and demographic trends,"The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory released the latest edition of its Residential Solar-Adopter Income and Demographic Trends report. The report is based on data from 2.8 million residential households across the country that have installed solar, covering about 86% of all U.S. residential PV systems. This update contains new data on systems installed through 2021, comparisons of income trends for rural vs. urban adopters, and trends among disadvantaged communities, based on the Department of Energy definition.
Solar has been adopted by households across all income levels, as seen on the left of Figure 1 below. Roughly one-third of households adopting solar in 2021 were middle-income, with incomes between $50k and $100k. About 15% had incomes below that, and over half had incomes above that with a significant curve up after $250k.
Compared to the broader U.S. population, solar adopter incomes skew high at $110k, as seen on the right of Figure 1. The disparity is driven partly by the data’s overexposure to California, which represents more than half of the total sample, and 42% of systems installed in 2021, a relatively high-income state. However, this skew towards higher incomes remains true in all states, with median relative solar-adopter household incomes ranging from 31% to 68% over the county median.
Over time, solar adoption has been slowly shifting towards less affluent households.  As Figure 2 on the left shows, the median solar adopter income has fallen from $129k in 2010 to $110k in 2021.  Based on the steady downward trend in relative income, which compares solar adopters to all households in the same county, there’s been a “deepening” of solar by reaching lower-income households in existing markets.  At the same time, there has been a “broadening” of solar into increasingly less affluent states, as seen in Figure 2 on the right.  This broadening trend is driven partly by significant solar market growth in Texas and Florida, which are respectively middle- and low-income states.
As expected, those who adopted solar+storage consistently have higher incomes. In California, solar+storage adopter incomes were 20% higher than standalone solar adopters.  The exception to this is Hawaii where about 90% of all residential PV installed in 2021 was paired with storage.
The report found that the solar market in disadvantaged communities (DACs) has more than doubled from 5% in 2010 to 11% in 2021.  Despite this, DACs remain underrepresented relative to their 18% share of all U.S households.  President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative directs 40 percent of climate, and clean-energy related funding to historically disadvantaged communities through laws like the Inflation Reduction Act, and hundreds of Federal programs. What impacts these programs will have on adoption patterns remains to be seen.  These positive trends will be essential for broader adoption as residential solar crosses “The Chasm,” or when a new technology moves from early adopters to being accepted by the general population.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/23/50-states-of-solar-incentives-mississippi/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,MISSISSIPPI",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Mississippi,"The pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives last stop was Alabama, and now moves to Mississippi.
Mississippi, the Magnolia State, is the 32nd largest and 35th most populous state in the United States and ranks 37th in solar installations. The state is home to the 1.4 GW Grand Gulf Nuclear Power, the largest single-reactor nuclear power plant by generating capacity in the nation, which, according to Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, generated about 17% of the state’s electricity in 2021. The Pascagoula oil refinery, located on Mississippi’s Gulf Coast, is the nation’s 10th-largest refinery. Natural Gas is also big in Mississippi, which has about one-fourth of total U.S. underground salt cavern natural gas storage capacity. Natural gas is the primary fuel used at nine out of the 10 largest power plants in the state, supplying about 72% of Mississippi’s electricity generation 2021.
The state’s dependence on fossil fuels, coupled with relatively low-cost electricity—currently at 12.61 cents per kWh—may leave little incentive to go solar. Or does it? The state is prone to hurricanes and tornados—with 113,000 people left without power from Hurricane Ida in 2021.
The state currently has about 321 MW of solar installed, or enough to power just over 34,000 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Total solar investment in the state amounts to $365 million. Change may be on the horizon; however, as SEIA projects 2.3 GW to be added over the next five years, bouncing the state up to 22nd in the nation for installed solar.

In the fall of 2021, Entergy announced its intent to expand renewable energy in its territory when it launched EDGE, for “Economic Development with Green Energy,” a program that aims to replace aging natural gas facilities with 1,000 MW of renewable energy, including solar, over the next five years. This level of added capacity would increase the company’s total power generation portfolio from less than 1% to 17% in three years, and nearly 33% by 2027. Entergy expects to have 11,000 MW of renewable energy generation by the end of 2030.
Net metering
The Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) recently approved final amendments to the state’s net metering policy, referred to as the “Net Renewable Generation Rules”. The program aims to improve access to solar for low- and middle-income (LMI) residents.
The base net metering rate is below full retail electricity rates, at 2.5 cents per kWh over the deemed ‘avoided cost’ of solar. In this sense, avoided cost refers to the difference between the cost of solar generated by a rooftop and the cost of the utility procuring that energy from a different generation facility.
The new net metering rules also include a requirement that each of the state’s investor-owned utilities offer a one-time $3,500 upfront cash rebate to any retail residential customer purchasing a renewable distributed energy project of at least 3 kW and which provides a maximum of 110% of the customer’s expected annual usage. The PSC also added to the program meter aggregation provisions, meaning that customers with multiple meters can use energy generated by one solar or other form of distributed generation (DG) system on any eligible meter of theirs. Eligible meters must be located on the same premises or within the service area of the customers’ current electric provider.
The number of customers that may participate in net generation has also been raised, with the previous hard 3% participation cap moving up to a 4% non-hard cap.
LMI support
In 2022 Mississippi Public Service Commission approved revised distributed generation compensation, expanding eligibility for the LMI income benefits adder from 200% to 225% of the federal poverty level, creating new upfront incentive programs for LMI customers and residential battery storage, and establishing solar for schools program, as highlighted in North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center’s The 50 States of Solar: Q3 Quarterly Report, October 2022
Landmark project
In May of this year, the Sunflower Solar Station was completed, named for the county in which it is located. Said to be the largest in the state, the 100 MW solar installation was constructed by Recurrent Energy, a subsidiary of Canadian Solar. The plant will provide enough clean energy to power 16,000 homes in Entergy Mississippi’s territory, and is one of the first utility scale solar projects to be constructed under a Build Transfer Agreement (BTA) in the United States and it is the first BTA signed by Recurrent Energy. The BTA was signed with Entergy Mississippi in 2018 designating that the utility would take ownership of the project once it began commercial operation.
With the completion of Sunflower, along with the recent state expansion by the state’s two largest utilities, Mississippi is well on its way to achieving—and possibly exceeding–SEIA’s forecast for an additional 2.3 GW in the next five years.
The next stop on the pv magazine tour of 50 states of solar incentives will be Oklahoma.
