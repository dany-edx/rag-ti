Murphy’s desk,"The New Jersey Legislature passed A3352, which would require all new warehouses to be solar-ready buildings. The bill now awaits signature from Gov. Phil Murphy.
A3352 defines a warehouse as any building that is 10,000 square feet or more and primarily used to store goods for resale. New warehouses built on or after July 1, 2022 will need to be optimized for solar. If the structure or building is intended to use hot water, then it also must allow for the installation of a solar water heating system.
Following A3352’s passage, Scott Elias, senior manager of state affairs for the Mid-Atlantic at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said the bill is another opportunity for New Jersey to make progress on its goal to reach 17 GW of solar by 2035.
In an op-ed for local press, Megan Steele, the communications coordinator for the Sierra Club New Jersey Chapter, proposed that the legislation could be used to expand community solar programs for low- and moderate-income families by opening up warehouse projects to these customers.
Warehouse sprawl has become a big issue in the Garden State. A survey conducted by Newmark, a commercial real estate advisory firm, found the aggregate area of leased warehouse space in the northern and central parts of the state grew by 11.1 million square feet in the first quarter of 2021. Alongside this, South Jersey has become a hotspot for construction.
Efforts are also being made to ensure that new warehouses in New Jersey are not developed on environmentally sensitive areas such as sensitive farmland and near residential areas, due to concerns over stormwater runoff, traffic congestion, and increased pollution.

Where once developers, independent engineers, universities, and financing institutions used data largely for project prospecting, research, and financing, data today is  being used by professionals in operations and maintenance, EPC, asset management, market trading, and “green” investment funding.
And datasets are used for performance benchmarking, long term resource and energy assessment, ground-tuning analysis, variability assessment, and energy trading.
Those were highlights of a recent pv magazine-hosted webinar featuring Mark Grammatico of Clean Power Research and Armando Solis of Lightsource bp.  The two highlighted the types of data that are available to solar developers, compared the pros and cons of free data versus commercial data, and demonstrated how solar data can be deployed across the project lifecycle. 
Solar data has transitioned from a simple, imprecise tool that often lacked validation to one that is complex, comprehensive and forward-looking. The solar industry’s own evolution is leading solar dataset providers to offer a full suite of meteorological variables to estimate long-term performance, optimize real-time performance, and provide forecasting for future performance. 
Grammatico offered five factors to be considered when selecting a solar dataset. First, is the solar data validated and widely accepted? Second, are the data’s rates of uncertainty known and acceptable? Does the solar data have an extensive historical record to back current data? Are the measurements spatially precise? And, was the data built specifically for solar applications? 
He suggested that users conduct due diligence in selecting data sources and said while many valid free solar data resources available, commercially available datasets can offer a higher level of precision and insight. 
One advantage of commercial datasets like those backed by Clean Power Research and Lightsource bp is the power of real-time data. These reports rely on input data that is comprised of both ground-based instrumentation and satellite data, and a correlation study between the two sources.  
This real-time information enables asset owners to consistently analyze and identify which projects are under-performing over the long term. It allows for the creation of performance thresholds that leverage digital technology to alert users when intervention is needed. Real-time data can also provide clear and comparable metrics across all projects that allow operations and maintenance users to make informed decisions. 
The presenters offered white papers and case studies demonstrating data in action. The archived webinar is available here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/07/we-need-interconnection-reform-to-unlock-the-benefits-of-energy-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",,"JUNE 7, 2021",We need interconnection reform to unlock the benefits of energy storage,"It’s widely recognized that one of the greatest challenges in transitioning from an electric grid powered predominantly by fossil fuels to one powered by clean energy sources like solar and wind is the intermittency of many renewables.
Energy storage presents a key solution—offering, along with demand response and other load flexibility options—to be the “glue” that holds together a more flexible and distributed grid.
Unfortunately, despite dramatic reductions in battery prices and demonstrated consumer demand, outdated interconnection policies remain a significant barrier to unlocking the full value of energy storage on the distribution grid. Without action to remedy the shortcomings of these policies–which control which storage capabilities are recognized and how efficiently they are evaluated–that clean grid of the future may be out of reach, at least within the timeframe needed to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.
Many states’ interconnection rules do not explicitly address energy storage, creating uncertainty that slows and complicates the interconnection process and that can negatively impact financing prospects. Additionally, many interconnection policies use unrealistic assumptions when assessing the impacts of potential storage projects on the grid. These policy flaws present significant barriers to unlocking the broad energy storage deployment that will be needed to achieve high-renewable scenarios.
In this article, the second in a series exploring the need for interconnection reform to enable rapid deployment of clean energy to reach climate goals, we explore why existing interconnection policies are falling short for energy storage systems (ESS) and what can be done to remedy the situation. (Read “Interconnection is broken: Radical rethinking is needed to achieve clean energy goals.”)
One of the major benefits of energy storage, particularly when co-located with solar or other intermittent distributed energy resources (DERs), is that storage offers the flexibility to control when power is exported to (or drawn from) the grid, mitigating the grid management challenges presented by these sources.
Software (including power control systems or PCS) that manages energy storage exports makes this possible. For example, instead of exporting during the middle of the day when there is an excess of solar energy, ESS can store that energy and send it to the grid in the evening when solar is offline and home energy demand increases.

Likewise, project developers could also propose “operating schedules” for their ESS projects, exporting more or less power to the grid during periods when the grid can accommodate more generation (such as when consumers are using more power to run air conditioners) and limit export when the grid is more constrained.
Storage systems could also be designed to change their export levels in response to dynamic signals, such as demand response programs that disincentivize export during certain times of day.
Neither of these functions is in widespread use today, however, and current interconnection rules are a key reason why.
PCS also allows DER projects with energy storage to be designed as “non-export” projects that do not export power to the grid, or “limited export” projects that do not export over a certain threshold. This option can be particularly valuable in allowing DER projects to proceed in areas of the grid that are capacity constrained.
Most interconnection policies currently require individual project owners to pay the full cost of any distribution grid upgrades that are needed to accommodate their project. Because upgrade costs are high, this factor may prevent new projects in areas of the grid with high penetrations of DERs. Interconnection customers can avoid hefty grid upgrade fees by designing their projects to operate as non- or limited-export systems, which can reduce grid impacts. Howver, few interconnection procedures provide a clear pathway for such systems.
Unfortunately, most interconnection policies hinder the use of all of these beneficial energy storage functions. That’s because the “screening” or “study” process, in which utilities evaluate the potential impacts of a proposed distributed generation facility seeking to connect to the grid, generally fails to recognize the controllable nature of energy storage.
CNW Group/Hydro-Quebec
The current default method is to study projects with the assumption that the project may export or import its full capacity at any time, as opposed to being able to reduce capacity during specific times or to limit it altogether. This assumption may lead to unnecessary and time-consuming studies that slow the interconnection process, or to costly upgrades that may make projects infeasible. This makes it harder for project developers to deploy projects that are specifically designed to provide beneficial services on the grid.
Interconnection rules need to include revised screening and study processes for these types of systems if we want to unlock the unique value of ESS in enabling a high-DER future. Processes for evaluating non- or limited export projects will need to be developed. Additional processes will need to be defined for evaluating systems that export varying amounts of power at different times, such as based on an operating profile.
Several states, including California, Hawaii, Arizona, and Nevada, have updated their interconnection rules with these challenges in mind. Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York are actively working on this, while related proposals have been introduced in Colorado, New Mexico, Maine, Connecticut, and New Jersey. While these states are making progress, no jurisdiction has developed a straightforward process that truly enables these capabilities in an efficient manner.

Thus, further attention will be needed to ensure that this barrier is addressed in all states. Given the critical nature of integrating energy storage onto the grid to meet climate goals, combined with the fact that ESS is rapidly becoming a larger part of the market, these are key questions that should be at the forefront for any state opening an interconnection docket or adopting policies to enable more DERs.
Fortunately, forthcoming resources will make this easier. The Building a Technically Reliable Interconnection Evolution for Storage (BATRIES) project, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office and led by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and partners, aims to simplify the interconnection process for energy storage.
As part of a toolkit of solutions that the team will develop to address key barriers to energy storage interconnection, the BATRIES project will produce resources to inform the development of updated study processes that can be incorporated into interconnection rules. The project aims to reach regulators and utilities in a majority of states with resources to reform energy storage interconnection.
Gwen Brown is communications director at the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. This article is the second in a four-part series on interconnection reform. In the next article, we will explore the need for greater accountability in the interconnection process. A subsequent article will explore the need for increased data access and transparency.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/07/california-explores-real-time-retail-pricing-to-enable-more-renewables/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 7, 2021",California explores real-time retail pricing to enable more renewables,"Real-time retail pricing of electricity, which can make room for more renewables on the grid by increasing demand flexibility, is one element of a draft proposal presented by the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC’s) Energy Division. The commission is considering opening a rulemaking aimed at achieving widespread demand flexibility.
Such a system could include scheduled charging of electric vehicles and distributed storage, and remote control of space heating and water heating, said CPUC Commissioner Darcie Houck in remarks during a recent workshop.
Opt-in real-time pricing for retail electricity, which involves “sending prices to devices,” is a central element in the Energy Division’s draft proposal.
Real-time electricity pricing has been proven to work in a pilot program funded by the California Energy Commission that involved customers of California utility SCE. Participating customers reduced their electric bills mostly by shifting air conditioning loads.
CPUC Energy Division staff member Aloke Gupta said the SCE pilot’s pricing scheme could inform a pricing scheme for California as a whole, as could San Diego Gas & Electric’s hourly dynamic rate for electric vehicle owners.
Smart devices receiving and responding to price signals, Gupta said, could include thermostats, heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and smart plugs.
If California moved to bi-directional pricing, Gupta said, a utility customer could either consume or export electricity at the current price, with exports coming from storage or from rooftop solar. Alternatively, a customer could choose a fixed-price subscription, he said.
The California Solar & Storage Association asked the CPUC in 2018 for a rulemaking on opt-in real-time pricing, in a joint petition with the Solar Energy Industries Association and others. CALSSA and others followed up that request in 2020, asking the CPUC to allow customers in the San Diego area to choose real-time pricing.
Houck said in the workshop that communications and power control systems are now available to automate demand flexibility, “so customers can spend as much or as little time as they want thinking about their energy.”
“Reshaping demand to flex with supply” is as important as deploying more renewables, Houck said, as the state works to reach 100% clean electricity by 2045.
Energy Division staff plans to release a white paper this summer on widespread flexible demand management. The staff expects to recommend at that time that the CPUC open a rulemaking to consider the proposal.
If the bid for a rulemaking is adopted, any changes would likely occur in a stepwise fashion, said Paul Phillips of the Energy Division. Infrastructure recommendations being developed by the California Energy Commission will help facilitate the CPUC’s work, he said.
Representatives from four other organizations contributed to the workshop. Karen Herter of the California Energy Commission spoke on load management standards. Delphine Hou of CAISO, California’s grid operator, spoke on renewable integration and grid needs. Sarah Moskowitz and Jeff Zethmayr with the Citizens Utility Board in Illinois spoke on that state’s experience with hourly pricing. And Carmen Best of ­­­­software developer Recurve spoke on expanding distributed energy resources.
Presentations from the CPUC’s “Advanced DER & Demand Flexibility Management” workshop, and a video recording, are available online. Informal written comments are invited through June 11.
This article was updated June 8 to reflect a change in the due date for written comments on the proposal.

Senate Bill 52 would require renewable energy project developers to share their application with township trustees 30 days before applying for a certificate from the Ohio Power Siting Board. HB 118 currently awaits referral to a House committee.
Township trustees, after reviewing the application, could then move to call for a referendum petition. If that petition receives signatures representing at least 8% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election, then the project must be voted on at the next primary or general election before moving forward.
Critics of the bill have argued that it adds an additional and unnecessary bureaucratic step to the project  development process, one which has already been bogged down by the Ohio Power Siting Board’s lengthy application project. These same constraints do not apply to oil and gas projects.
There is also concern that the passage of the bill would steer renewable developers away from Ohio. This could have significant implications in the state if true, as the Solar Energy Industries Association projects Ohio to install 1,904 MW over the next 5 years, good for 14th in the nation over that period.
Bill advocates said the measure is an expansion of community rights and is only permissive in nature. They said the bill would not hinder townships that want to host renewable energy projects.
The bill passed with a 20-13 vote, as five Republicans joined all eight members of the Democratic caucus in opposition. It will next go to the House of Representatives for review.
Community clashes with the developers of large-scale renewable energy projects have also become a phenomenon in Virginia, most recently with a 150 MW project proposed for development in the state by Strata Solar.

Once in service, it will be the largest utility-scale solar facility in the Duke business unit’s fleet.
Charles River Laboratories International signed a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) for 102 MW of capacity from the project over 15 years. The VPPA will address all of the company’s North American electric power load by 2023. Charles River was advised by Schneider Electric, which helped the company in project selection and negotiations.
Two other companies have signed separate 15-year VPPA agreements for the remaining 148 MW of capacity. All three VPPAs will settle on an as-generated basis tied to the project’s real-time energy output.
Project engineering and construction are by Moss, and Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions will own and operate the project. Commercial operation is expected by the end of 2022.
Solar and wind made up almost 94% of the new electrical generating capacity added in the U.S. during the first four months of 2021, according to a review by the SUN DAY Campaign of data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
The data show that 131 units of new utility-scale solar (2,702 MW) and 18 units of new wind (3,802 MW) accounted for most of the capacity. Natural gas provided 402 MW, hydropower added 14 MW, oil provided 6 MW, and biomass 5 MW. All but 1 MW of the new utility-scale capacity reported in April was from solar (147 MW) and wind (659-MW).
Utility-scale renewable energy facilities now account for almost 25% of the total available installed generating capacity. The total does not include distributed rooftop solar.
Directors of California-based Clean Power Alliance (CPA) approved four contracts for 256.5 MW of renewable energy and 163 MW of storage. The contracts include one geothermal facility and three solar plus storage facilities.
A 15-year contract with Clearway’s Arica solar plus storage project will add 93.5 MW of solar plus 71 MW of storage. CPA will begin receiving power in December 2023, with an expected average annual generation of 284,054 MWh.
The Clearway Daggett 2 solar plus storage project is an extension of a solar plus storage project already under contract with CPA. The 15-year Daggett 2 contract adds 65 MW of solar plus 52 MW of storage. CPA will begin receiving power in September 2023, with an expected average annual generation of 202,432 MWh.
A third contract is with NextEra Energy Resources’ Resurgence Solar I project, located in San Bernardino County, for a 20-year term. The project adds 48 MW of solar plus 40 MW of storage with an expected average annual generation of 144,161 MWh. The Resurgence Solar Project repurposes an aging solar thermal facility. The project is scheduled to begin operations in March 2023.
The fourth contract is with Calpine’s The Geysers geothermal facility, which will add 50 MW of energy and generate 438,000 MWh of energy per year. Under the 15-year contract, the project will begin delivering January 2022. Located north of San Francisco on the border of Sonoma and Lake counties, The Geysers ranks as one of the single largest geothermal electrical operations in the world.
To date, CPA has signed 19 long-term contracts with renewable and storage resources for terms of 10-20 years, totaling 1,601 MW of renewables and 878 MW of storage. Founded in 2017, CPA provides electricity for 30 cities across Los Angeles County and Ventura County, as well as the unincorporated areas of both counties. CPA is the fifth largest electricity provider in California.
Distributed Solar Development (DSD) acquired a 2.176 MW PV solar project at the Lost Hills Oilfield in Kern County, California, from Alternative Energy Development Group, which co-developed the project with Regatta Solutions. The single-axis ground mount system is estimated to produce over 4,917 MWh of energy per year for the oil field operation. Under terms of the deal, Lost Hills Thermal, LLC will buy energy from DSD, which will be the owner/operator of the system, via a 20-year PPA. Lost Hills Thermal is a privately owned special purpose vehicle managed by Crimson Resources Management Corp., the contracted operator at Lost Hills.
