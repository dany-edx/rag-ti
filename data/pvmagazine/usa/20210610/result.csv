The State Fire Marshall has ruled the fire as accidental and no one was injured during the incident.
The fire, which caused an estimated $500,000 in damages is the second such rooftop solar system fire to occur at an Amazon facility in as many years. In April 2020, the roof of an Amazon fulfillment center in Fresno, California combusted after a section of 20 panels on the roof caught fire.
Across the country, solar system fires have been on the rise since 2015, when Lawrence Shaw, owner of Higher Powered, LLC, a company that does residential solar preventative maintenance (PM) in Arizona, reached out to the The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) to request the data on these events.
While USFA doesn’t specifically track solar fires as their own category, they are recorded and have risen steadily every year, from 25 in 2015, to 56 in 2018. Solar system fires are much more common in the Southwest, specifically California, Arizona, and Nevada, however they are by no means a geographically limited phenomenon.
Shaw believes that regular infrared imaging of residential projects could cut instances of fire down immensely, as many of these instances are started by hotspots, small instances of failure and thermal events that can be picked up by infrared imaging.

Under terms of the agreement, DTE will will lower the MIGreenPower’s program cost and simplify enrollment, including adding a fixed-price subscription option. The changes are set to be implemented during the first quarter of 2022.
DTE will also implement a new pilot program that will create three community solar projects in Highland Park, Detroit, and River Rouge. Low-income subscribers to these projects will receive a monthly reduction on their energy bills from the solar savings.
As for the projects themselves, DTE has agreed to fund a portion of the project cost and will begin to solicit a partnership with a third-party organization to assist in funding the new installations.
The three highlighted projects are not the only solar capacity to come out of the settlement, as the agreement paves the way for DTE to add more than 420 MW of new solar capacity proposed as part of the company’s renewable energy plan filed last August.
This week’s compromise came in large part due to the work of Soulardarity, a membership-based non-profit working to save customers money on energy bills, and work with local communities to build a just and equitable energy system. And while the road to arrive at this point stretched 16 months, Soulardarity said that the settlement “leaves a lot to be desired from the perspective of racial, economic, and environmental justice and energy democracy.”
The group cited DTE’s efforts to fight locally owned solar projects, specifically referencing the utility’s ad campaign surrounding Michigan HB 4236, a bill to lift the 1% peak demand cap on utility distributed generation programs. Soulardarity said it also objects to DTE’s practice of hiking residential electricity rates and selling the debt of customers unable to make payments to collection agencies.
Shortcomings of DTE’s larger business practice aside, the group said that the settlement includes potential community benefits and positive changes, such as:
Soulardarity said that each of the three community solar projects will be at least 250 kW in capacity, although other project specifics have not yet been released.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/10/back-to-business-in-boston-solar-and-energy-storage-northeast-in-person/,"BUSINESS,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 10, 2021",Back to business in Boston: Solar and Energy Storage Northeast… in-person!,"Over 1,500 smiling faces gathered in Boston’s Seaport district to forge connections and display products and services live and in-person for the first time since the pandemic. Business cards changed hands, product spec sheets were passed around, and print copies of pv magazine were distributed by yours truly throughout the expo hall.
The Solar and Energy Storage Northeast expo ran June 9 and 10 attracted nearly 70 exhibitors who displayed their latest innovations and products. And while this event was smaller than in previous years, there was palpable energy in the air as the element of human connection facilitated great discussions.
Similar message came from many attendees: this conference felt like a fresh start. It was characterized by the exchange of powerful ideas and actionable connections.
Buyers and suppliers from over 300 unique organizations explored business solutions, new technologies, policy initiatives, and market dynamics at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) sponsored event. All proceeds from the event support the expansion of the solar energy industry through SEIA and SEPA’s year-round research and education activities, and SEIA’s extensive advocacy efforts.
Here are some of the tech highlights from this year’s expo.
Fortress Power
Fortress Power unveiled its eVault Max 18.5 kWh lithium battery storage unit, boasting increased safety, easy of installation, and scalability.
The unit was on display, which was easy enough for the exhibitors to do, as this design includes wheels for easy install and maintenance. The unit has a front-facing wall that can be removed for access to the four cells contained inside. Fortress Power says these features save time, and lead to a one- to two-hour install time.
Fortress Power’s battery can be used for whole-home backup, off-grid storage, peak reduction, and demand shaving, and is applicable at both residential and small commercial scales. The battery can build out to as many as 20 units in parallel, achieving 370 kWh. The company uses lithium iron phosphate technology, which they say is a safer and more environmentally friendly option than typical battery elements.
QuickBOLT
QuickBOLT offered the QB1 microflashing, a mounting solution that saves material and eliminates the need for removing shingles or underlayment. The QB1 is a patented small “puck” that sits on top of a pre-drilled hole drilled directly through the shingles and into rafters. It is then fastened with a collar and “L-Foot” to sit flush with the roof.
The company said it has over 1 million QuickBOLT mounts installed with no reports of leaks. Additional “miniflashing” that is smaller than the size of a typical shingle can be added for an even greater water-tight seal.
geothinQ

geothinQ develops GIS mapping software for site suitability analysis. Its customizable and user-friendly GIS platform allows solar developers to search for property that meets a solar project’s criteria.
The geospatial tool allows the user to make informed decisions by supplying data about transmission line and substation proximity, land evaluation and site buildability analysis, and due diligence. geothinQ is not only a mapping tool, but a team of spatial data experts  to provide support.
Enteligent
California startup Enteligent displayed the SolarUp Rapid Shutdown Module, a rapid shutdown device (RSD) with module-level power electronics (MLPE) for efficient power optimization. The company said the device will be available in August and adds the benefit of power optimization at a price competitive with standalone RSD.
The Sunspec certified device allows for ease-of-install and service, housing both RSD and MLPE in a single location. SolarUp Single provides module-level shutdown and optimization across two panels, while SolarUp Dual allows for shutdown at module level with independent module optimization for two panels.
Enteligent said it soon will release a residential EV Quick Charger. This device charges directly from solar, delivering what the company said would be as much as 13% more electricity from panels than traditional EV charging. After sunset, the charger pulls from storage or the grid. This product will ship in Q2 2022, and has both commercial and residential applications.
S-5!
S-5! metal roofing solutions featured its PVKIT 2.0, a standing seam metal roof mount that reduces the total weight and volume of the installed solar system. S-5! said that a standing seam roof already contains integrated “rails” and their direct-attach utilizes this feature of a metal roof.
The result is what S-5! says is an 85% reduction in weight, 25% better load distribution, 70% fewer components, and lower material costs compared to rail mounting. The lighter weight and smaller component also leads to lower transport and logistics costs, the company said.

The expanded credit is expected to let the Houston-based company speed development of its 3.5 GW of solar and 2.5 GWh of energy storage pipeline. Macquarie Group served as lead arranger of the upsized facility after closing the earlier financing deal in 2020.
Vesper Energy added two banks to its facility, Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen Girozentrale and ICBC Standard Bank Plc. The company will use the expanded facility to post securities for power purchase agreements (PPAs) and interconnection agreements with energy transmission networks.
Since its start in 2015, Vesper Energy has commercialized more than 680 MW of utility-scale solar projects in the U.S. It plans to start work on two facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania in early 2022, and has a larger construction program planned for 2023.
Vesper Energy earlier said that its Deer Creek Solar + Storage project signed a 20-year PPA for 50 MW of solar energy and 200 MWh battery storage with Desert Community Energy, a community choice aggregator in Palm Springs, California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/10/solar-101-grumpy-neighbors-and-falling-quahogs-are-just-two-perils-to-jolt-your-solar-project/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 10, 2021",Solar 101: Grumpy neighbors and falling quahogs are just two perils to jolt your solar project,"Everyone loves solar, right? Well, not always.
In our prior Solar 101 articles, we’ve covered everything from construction, finance, incentives, and net metering, to how to vet a contractor. Subsequent articles will focus more on hardware, and revenue streams.
Here, we will look at a few of the many “gotchas” that might upend your dream – or practical ability – to install solar panels. The examples here are only the tip of the iceberg. If you’ve had any weird happenings in your own solar dealings, please comment at the end of this article and let us all be educated!
The number one strange thing to deal with is neighbors.
For many of us, this isn’t a revelation. The proverb “good fences make good neighbors” is known to have originated independently in several cultures. And as Ben Franklin said: “Love thy neighbor, yet don’t pull down your hedge.”
Your Homeowner’s Association will be one of the first “strange” places that you may need to reach out to in order to verify rules related to having solar on your property. Your HOA is typically in place to protect the value of your property from neighbors who have different tastes than your own. Solar power is considered by many folks to be just such a different taste.
The most common HOA rule forbids homeowners from installing solar panels facing a street. This rule is in place in many HOAs in many states across the country.
Check to see if your HOA has any solar or aesthetics rules that might limit where you can install solar. If the HOA has rules against solar facing the street, then ask your contractor if you can install on a different roof surface. Keep in mind, however, that different roof surface angles generate different amounts of solar electricity, potentially affecting your payback period.

The next defense against an HOA is to build a “beautiful” solar power system. Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. To my eye, the Solaria system above is about as handsome as a standard solar system gets.
Another type of “beauty” is a solar shingle type system from Tesla, Luma Solar (left), or others making this new product type.
Unfortunately, some of your neighbors just won’t get it. For example, folks in North Carolina voted against a larger scale solar power project because they believed solar panels would ‘suck up all of the sunlight.’
 
When you install a residential solar power project on the ground, there’s a general requirement to get zoning approval, along with approval from neighbors in a town meeting. The best way to avoid a town meeting is to build solar power on your roof instead of on the ground.
 Plugging your system into the power grid can sometimes present more of a challenge than you might expect.
The image at the right shows a solar power project in Three River, California. The house is located on top of a mountain foothill, a couple of hundred feet tall. Connecting this home to the power grid would have cost more than $250,000 according to the local electricity utility.
The homeowner instead chose to build an off-grid solar power system. The system includes solar panels that track the sun, batteries, and solar-powered water pumps, as well as the inverters and controllers needed to properly manage intermittent electricity generation.
While this scenario is a bit extreme, there are plenty of locations already connected to the power grid that won’t allow a solar connection. An electricity utility recently informed this author that a customer’s home was too far from key power grid hardware. The line’s voltage wasn’t strong enough to handle the solar system’s potential export to the power grid, the utility said.
Unfortunately, this is often a problem that cannot be determined until after you have spent money preparing and submitting one or more applications to the utility. Such an outcome could be a major setback, so you may want to take time to learn about interconnection issues before going forward.
In some places – especially Hawaii, but also hot solar markets like San Diego and Massachusetts – there is too much solar power.  If you’re the last one on your block to get solar, you might not be allowed to export any electricity to the power grid.
The energy industry is among the largest, and most economically influential industries on earth. And even though each of us is looking to attach just one tiny solar power system to the largest machines in the world, plenty of folks out there see that as an attack on their bottom line. And they don’t like that one bit.

For instance, the federal government group that regulates the power grid – Federal Energy Regulatory Commission – recently stated it is probable that Alabama is violating the law by charging those who install solar power projects a capacity fee.
Currently, anyone who installs residential solar power in Alabama will pay this fee, which has been in place since 2013.
Luckily, Kansas struck down a similar fee against solar power about a year ago. The fee had been proposed by utilities, approved by state regulators, and even affirmed by a lower court – despite a 1980 Kansas law explicitly forbidding such fees. All it took to shut down the proposed legislation was a reading of the “plain text” per the state supreme court judge.
One extreme example that might not affect residential customers directly – but we all should stay conscious of – is in Wyoming. The state is moving forward with a rainy day fund of $1.2 million, which it may use to sue states whose pro renewable energy laws have wounded their extraction business.
 Nature is another dynamic to consider. For instance the quantity of dust, pollen, and other materials that fall on your solar panels varies broadly, and can even change every few miles.
Is the home near an industrial area? Watch out for dust. Near beautiful fields? Pollen. Near a pig farm? Sticky manure dust. Close to the beach? Beware falling quahogs.
Falling quahogs?
At left we see a Sunpower 315 W solar panel from a 2013 installation along a fishing harbor. The local gulls collect the bivalve mollusk known as a quahog (the official shellfish of Rhode Island and pronounced KO-hog) from  waterways, and drop them on hard surfaces to crack open the shells and eat what’s inside.
Obviously, broken solar panels won’t generate much electricity. And we’re pretty sure quahog-caused damage isn’t covered under hail warranties.

Our Solar 101 series is coming into the home stretch. Next, we’ll get into solar panels and inverters, the two key pieces of hardware.

The two will coordinate and share objectives focused on:
The MOU continues a history of collaboration between the two. In 2013, Sempra Energy’s subsidiary San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and NREL established a utility-owned community microgrid in Borrego Springs, California. The microgrid is connected to a local 26 MW solar field (owned by a third party), two battery storage systems, two generators, and an ultracapacitor.
NB Power selected a New Brunswick solar company to build a 1.63 MW solar farm, the first of its kind in the Canadian province and part of a larger Smart Grid Atlantic smart and renewable energy research program being run by NB Power, Siemens Canada, and Nova Scotia Power.
The Smart Energy Company will deploy it packaged solar energy system that was designed for Canadian winters in collaboration with the National Research Council. The packaged system includes a ground-mounted racking structure, solar modules, grid-tie inverter, electrical wiring, and all miscellaneous hardware and components.
Site work for the Shediac solar farm is being completed by NB Power crews and local contractors. Module installation is expected to begin this summer after the racks have been fabricated at Smart Energy’s facility through a partnership with Razor Contract Manufacturing.
The solar facility is expected to connect to the NB Power distribution grid in the town of Shediac early in 2022. It will be the third, and largest, solar installation in Shediac this year as part of the Smart Grid Atlantic program. The town’s Multipurpose Centre and a Federal Pension Centre recently installed rooftop solar arrays, and are installing the first commercial battery storage systems in large buildings in the province.
Leyline Renewable Capital has partnered with SaveSolar, a Washington D.C.-based solar company that finances and develops community solar projects, to develop 10.3 MW of solar capacity in the city. Through a $10 million construction facility, Leyline will provide SaveSolar with the working capital and initial construction equity to develop and retain ownership of approximately 17 residential, commercial, and government rooftop solar projects.
The U.S. electricity generation mix has shifted away from coal and toward natural gas and renewables over the past 15 years, leading to lower CO2 emissions from electricity generation.
According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2019, the power sector produced 1,724 million metric tons (MMmt) of CO2, 32% less than the 2,544 MMmt produced in 2005.
EIA said that lower CO2 emissions have largely been a result of a shift from coal to natural gas in the electricity generation mix. For the next few years, however, this trend may be changing. EIA forecasts that higher natural gas prices will lead to less natural gas-fired generation and more coal-fired generation this year. By 2022, both coal and natural gas are expected to lose ground to renewables.
EIA said that in 2005, 9% of the electricity generated in the United States came from renewable sources. That share rose to 18% in 2019, largely driven by growth in solar and wind. Nuclear made up about 20% of U.S. generation in both 2005 and 2019.
Schlumberger New Energy and Panasonic Energy of North America will work together to validate and optimize a lithium extraction and production process to be used at Schlumberger’s Neolith Energy pilot plant in Nevada.
Neolith Energy’s approach uses a differentiated direct lithium extraction (DLE) process to produce high-purity, battery-grade lithium material while reducing the production time from over a year to weeks. Panasonic will provide guidance to validate and optimize the lithium material for battery-grade consumption. The pilot plant is 200 miles from Panasonic’s large-scale advanced battery manufacturing operation in Sparks, Nevada.
Neolith Energy’s objective will be to pump brine from the subsurface, extract greater than 90% of the dissolved lithium, and pump more than 85% of the brine back to the subsurface. In addition to maximizing the reinjection of the brine, the goal is to eliminate the need for any fresh water from an external source.
