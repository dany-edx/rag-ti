This makes for a dynamic, flexible, and resilient grid and helps the island fight its high electricity rates for the long term.
Hawaii’s solar-batteries market was partially buoyed by a program called Battery Bonus (BB), which reached its enrollment cap in Oahu and closed in December 2023. Hawaiian Electric customers on Maui still have 7.2 MW of capacity remaining at the time of publication.
The program offers upfront incentives and pays customers a monthly rate based on battery capacity for agreeing to dispatch power during times of peak electricity demand. It also helped encourage coordinated distributed energy resource use, which has community-wide cost benefits versus a disconnected off-grid model.
Battery Bonus was replaced by a new program called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), which Rocky Mould, executive director of Hawaii Solar Energy Association (HSEA) said is a far less lucrative program for customers, placing Hawaii’s rooftop solar market at risk.
“[BYOD] undoes years of progress to enable customers to lead the way on adopting clean energy to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and reduce costs for everyone,” said Mould. “We’re hoping the PUC quickly corrects course to avoid a catastrophe for local industry and a massive momentum killer for clean energy in Hawai‘i.”
Mould called the now-closed BB program “a distributed energy success story” in which over 46 MW of rooftop solar and battery systems were rapidly enrolled to help support the grid when delays in utility-scale renewables project development led to a grid reliability crisis and bill spikes from sharpened oil demand.
A key BB’s success was lowering the upfront cost of battery energy storage. Under Battery Bonus, customers were offered a single upfront payment of $850 per kWh of battery capacity enrolled. That means a common battery like a Tesla Powerwall would be offered $4,250 up front for enrolling and installing. Under the new BYOD, that figure is capped at $500 total. Both programs also pay $5 per kW of battery capacity enrolled per month.
In return, customers export power to the grid to be used by their neighbors. But a key difference between BB and BYOD is that BB required customers to dispatch power for two hours to neighbors on their local distribution network, while the new BYOD program forces customers to route their electricity as utility-dispatched power, for two-hour periods, up to 365 days a year.
Mould said the new BYOD program forces customers to perform “reverse arbitrage” for the utility, worsening electricity prices for everyone on-grid.
Though net metering has been closed in Hawaii since 2015, the BB program allowed customers to add additional net-metered solar capacity to existing systems and export to their neighbors during peak demand events.
Furthermore, non-net metered customers were incentivized to join the Battery Bonus program. Customers would receive a monthly export bill credit amount for energy exported to the grid for 3 years. The credit is an amount equivalent to the respective retail rate for electricity exported during the two–hour period. The credit rate was updated to the retail rates at the beginning of each calendar quarter. Any unused portion of the credit will be zeroed out at the end of every year.
However, the BYOD program slashes this retail rate, paying customers far less for exporting stored solar production when it is valued most.
“Therefore, participating customers are making kWhs via rooftop solar and selling low (i.e., below retail) per the program rules, and then needing to buy these same kWhs back in order to operate their home loads at the higher retail rate. This mandatory ‘reverse arbitrage’ is a fatal flaw.”
HSEA said when the PUC closed net metering abruptly in 2015, the industry downsized by 60%, triggering approximately 2,000 job losses. It warned that the transition to BYOD may cause immediate and lasting impacts as severe or worse than the fallout from eight years ago.
“In my 15 years working with this Commission, this decision is the most drastic misstep I have seen—up there with slamming the curtain on net metering eight years ago, but with potentially more disastrous results,” said Isaac Moriwake, an attorney with advocacy group Earthjustice who has represented HSEA at the PUC since 2009.
Fixing incentives
Legislators have now in February 2024 introduced HB 1687, which seeks to undo some of the value damage caused by the transition to BYOD.
Mould said HB 1687 eliminates the mandatory reverse arbitrage obligation that “serves as the Achilles heel” of the program designed by utility Hawaiian Electric Company by requiring that exports be compensated at the full retail rate.
“If customers are compensated at the retail rate for their energy exports, they are indifferent between supplying the energy in their batteries to the grid or consuming it themselves. Thus the barrier to participation has been eliminated,” said Mould.
Under the Commission’s new program, customers will have to choose between self-consumption and the BYOD programs. Mould said given current incentives, customers will rationally choose the self-consumption program, which leads to a customer-specific load offset, which he said could instead be used to help the entire grid under a supportive program like BB.
By eliminating the perverse incentives at hand and instead encouraging broader grid participation, HB 1687 is expected to make the islands’ grid more stable and reduce blackouts.
“Grid instability and blackouts hurt all ratepayers but they hit LMI ratepayers even harder,” Mould told pv magazine USA. “These grid service programs are a necessary service to stabilize the whole grid for the benefit of all ratepayers.”

Under the agreement, Qcells owned and installed solar panels will be recycled after decommissioning.
The agreement marks a landmark deal in solar recycling in the United States. Qcells operates one of the largest solar manufacturing operations in the United States, with plans to expand production to 8.4 GW annually by the end of 2024, adding 4,000 jobs. The company announced a $2.5 billion investment to support this expansion in January 2023.
Solarcycle said its patented recovery process retains 95% of the value of materials in the panel, as opposed to conventional methods, which extract about 50% of the material value. The company recycles aluminum, silver, copper, silicon, and low-iron glass and will send these materials back to the domestic manufacturing value chain, thereby supporting a circular economy.
With the rapid growth in solar energy in the U.S., there is also growing concern about what will happen to solar panels at the end of their useful life. Without an increase in solar recycling, the U.S. will contribute 10 million metric tons of trash in landfills and other waste facilities by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). To put into context, the U.S. dumps almost 140 million tons of waste each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“We want our solar panels to not only help our customers cut costs and carbon, but also to be a part of building a more sustainable clean energy industry. Our partnership with Solarcycle will give our panels a life after powering homes, businesses and communities, reducing waste and reusing pieces for all types of technology including solar.”
Solarcycle runs recycling centers in Odessa, Texas and Mesa, Arizona, employing nearly 100 people since opening operations in 2022. The company said it expects to employ over 700 people in the next couple of years.
“Together, we can close the supply chain loop to ensure solar energy is manufactured and recycled in the U.S. using American labor and cutting-edge sustainability practices,” said Suvi Sharma, chief executive officer and co-founder, Solarcycle.
Earlier this month, Solarcycle announced it would move its headquarters to Mesa, AZ and open a research facility at the location. The Mesa facility will initially recycle 250,000 solar panels each year, and ramp to one million panels per year to keep pace with growing market demand in the solar industry for its recycling and circular supply chain services.
The solar recycler has grown its infrastructure footprint nationally through high-volume contracts with industry leaders including AES, EDF Renewables North America, EDP Renewables North America, Greenbacker, Ørsted, Silicon Ranch, and Sunrun.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory projects that by 2040, recycled panels and materials could help meet 25% to 30% of U.S. domestic solar manufacturing needs.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/12/electrolyzer-manufacturing-capacity-could-outpace-demand-by-2030/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-02-12,Electrolyzer manufacturing capacity could outpace demand by 2030,"Electrolyzer manufacturing capacity could outstrip demand by two times by the end of a decade, according to a new report from Clean Energy Associates.
The report, which looks at the technology trends and policy impacts in the green hydrogen space, forecasts that global manufacturing capacity for green hydrogen will touch 54 GW by 2027. China is likely to account for almost half of that global capacity, and when combined with North America and Europe, will reflect some 93% of the electrolyzer capacity global market share, its authors noted. The country currently accounts for 61% of manufacturing capacity across the world, due in part to a complete supply chain and relatively low costs. 
However, especially given the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and the policy support that provides the green hydrogen sector, North American manufacturing capacity is also set to rapidly grow, the report noted. 
While hydrogen can be made using multiple raw materials, including coal and natural gas, green hydrogen – that is, hydrogen produced with renewables – has increasingly become a priority for the U.S. as a potentially critical part of the clean energy transition. Green hydrogen is made by electrolyzing water using renewable energy like wind or solar. 
The report also compared different electrolyzer technologies, including alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM). It estimates that alkaline electrolyzers, which are largely clustered in China and Europe, will remain the most prevalent technology over the next decade, thanks in part to lower costs and the potential for efficiency improvements. PEM electrolyzers, meanwhile, are manufactured more globally but depend on electrodes that use rare materials, which could be a potential challenge.
While the report estimated that electrolyzer manufacturing capacity could outpace demand by 2030, it also noted that the actual usable capacity is likely to be less than nameplate capacity.
“The forecasted electrolyzer demand is highly uncertain, as it can be affected by policy implementation, downstream industry developments, low-cost renewable energy availability and operation of existing projects,” the report said.  
The industry as a whole has been focusing on the issue of ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity. One of the key challenges it faces in doing so is accessing the necessary capital – however, a couple of announcements last year indicate that trend could be changing. For instance, Verdagy revealed plans to open a new plant in Newark, California, early this year to build large volumes of advanced water electrolyzers. 
Electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen, meanwhile, completed an oversubscribed $380 million Series C financing. The company is building a 1.2 GW facility to produce commercial electrolyzer systems in Devens, Massachusetts, with deliveries expected later this year. 
Some experts are also looking at alternatives to the rare materials used in PEM electrolyzer technology – like clean chemistry company Mattiq, which announced in October that it is developing a portfolio of alternatives to iridium, one of those materials. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the current iridium production levels could support manufacturing some 3 GW to 7.5 GW of electrolyzers every year. Mattiq, however, is looking at alternative catalysts that could be used in these electrolyzers instead.

3,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/12/lg-launches-new-residential-storage-solution/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-12,LG launches new residential storage solution,"From pv magazine global
South Korean conglomerate LG has unveiled a new storage system for residential applications. The enblock E system is available in two versions, with usable energy capacities of 12.4 kWh and 15.5 kW.
“With just a few millimeters required on each side, the storage cabinet is not limited in any way when it comes to installation,” the company said in a statement. “Thanks to the IP55 protection class, enblock E can be operated in the cellar as well as in the garage without any problems.”
The system features lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) cells manufactured by the group’s LG Energy Solutions unit. It is also compatible with inverters from major producers such as Fronius, Kostal, GoodWe and SMA.
The smaller model has a usable energy capacity of 12.4 kWh and a battery capacity of 56.6 Ah. The voltage range is between 180.0 V and 262.8 V, while the nominal voltage is 231.8 V.
The system’s maximum charge-discharge current is 36.5 A and the maximum charge-discharge power is 6.2 kW. The battery pack’s roundtrip efficiency is more than 95%.
The larger product offers a usable energy capacity of 15.5 kWh and the same battery capacity as the smaller product. The voltage range is between 225.0 V and 328.5 V, while the nominal voltage is 289.8 V.
The system’s maximum charge-discharge current is 36.5 A and the maximum charge-discharge power is 7.7 kW. The battery pack’s roundtrip efficiency is more than 96%.
The two different models measure 451 mm x 330 mm, which enables easy deployment in the “furthest” corners, said the manufacturer.
“Owners of a PV system can integrate enblock E on the DC side with a new solar system or retrofit an existing solar system on the AC side,” said LG. “If the originally installed storage capacity is not sufficient, enblock E allows an additional storage module to be retrofitted up to two years after commissioning.”

First Solar will provide Longroad with 800,000 Series 6 Plus solar modules. The cadmium telluride bifacial panels have a 455- to 480-watt capacity and offer up to 19% efficiency. Nextracker will supply its NX Horizon trackers, which have been configured to withstand Arizona’s extreme heat and overall climate. Sungrow’s utility-scale inverters feature an integrated current and voltage monitoring function that allow remote analysis and troubleshooting.  
Powin, a U.S.-based energy storage system manufacturer, will provide a battery energy storage system (BESS) with a duration of 1200 MWh. It will include SMA inverters and cells from the Automotive Energy Supply Corporation, a Japanese lithium-ion electric vehicle battery developer. 
Powin says its modular and scalable Centipede Energy Storage platform arrives at the field built, pre-integrated and performance-tested in an outdoor enclosure, reducing installation time by 50%. The BESS has built-in emergency features that detect hydrogen levels and activate ventilation when necessary. 
U.S.-based national construction business McCarthy Building Companies Inc. is providing engineering, procurement and construction services for this project, which is the third Sun Streams 4 complex in the area. Other Longroad plants include Sun Streams 2, a 200 MWdc solar plant that began operations in mid-2021, and Sun Streams 3. The facility consists of a 285 MWdc solar array and BESS with a 215 MWac capacity and 860 MWh duration. The project, which is still in development, is expected to start commercial operations next year. 
McCarthy said it plans to hire over 250 people during Sun Stream 4’s peak construction phase, expected to run through July of next year. McCarthy is paying prevailing wages and leveraging over 65 registered operators and carpenter apprentices per Inflation Reduction Act tax incentive requirements. McCarthy states it is paying apprentices 70% to 95% of the project’s workers in the same occupation and receiving the Investment Tax Credit as a result. 
“Longroad is proud of the solar workforce we are helping to build and support in Arizona through our partnership with McCarthy,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad. “Sun Streams 4 is one of our first projects to incorporate provisions from the IRA.”
The solar and storage facility is expected to generate over $100 million in revenue for Arizona schools and communities through long-term leases with the Arizona State Land Department and tax remittances. 
Longroad will collaborate with Powin and NovaSource Power Services, a solar O&M service provider, to manage Sun Streams 4’s long-term operations.
