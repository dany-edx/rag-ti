The fire department and its new solar array were visited by President Joe Biden on January 25, 2024. 
The solar array is supporting the fire department’s ongoing efforts to boost the environmental sustainability of its operations while simultaneously improving use of its budget. The array is expected to offset about 267,000 lbs. of carbon dioxide emissions per year, roughly equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 145 acres of forest in one year. 
Federal and state programs supported significant savings for the municipal account. The department received an elective pay tax credit for 40% of the cost of the project, while Wisconsin’s Focus on Energy program created an $18,000 rebate. 
Focus on Energy is a broad program serving rebates and incentives for residential, commercial, nonprofit and other accounts seeking to install renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Eligible technologies include solar, insulation, heating and cooling, smart thermostats, and more. 
In three to five years the fire department plans to switch to an EV truck, and Cedar Creek said it helped the municipal water, light and power company to secure a discounted charging rate for the electric vehicle. 
The installation marked the first municipal solar project for Superior, Wisconsin. 
“This project is an example of environmental stewardship and innovation. We’re honored to have contributed to this historic initiative and excited for the department’s green journey ahead,” said Rob Appelhof, chief executive officer, Cedar Creek Energy. 
Solar and energy storage engineering, procurement, and construction provider Cedar Creek is based in Blaine, Minnesota, serving residential and commercial solar customers.

When complete in 2025, it will be the largest utility-owned solar in New Hampshire. The first utility-owned solar plant is a 2.59 MW in Moultonborough, owned by New Hampshire Electric Cooperative.
The Kingston solar project will include 11,232 Qcells solar modules mounted on Terrasmart single-axis trackers with an east-west rotation. The installation will include approximately 40 Chint Power Systems’ string inverters, and the electricity generated by the solar plant will be delivered directly into Unitil’s electric distribution system.
The plant is expected to generate approximately 9.7 million kilowatt hours of energy in its first year of service and is expected to average 8.6 million kilowatt hours annually over its projected 40-year lifespan.
Unitil chose New Hampshire-based ReVision Energy based in Brentwood, N.H. as its engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the solar array.
“The new array reflects Unitil’s long-term goals of addressing the region’s climate objectives in a way that’s cost-effective, sustainable, and provides direct benefits to all customers,” said Alex  O’Meara, external affairs director at Unitil. “We look forward to partnering on this project with ReVision Energy, which brings with it 20 years of award-winning experience in the solar industry here in New England.”
The Kingston project was approved by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission in May 2023 and has since received all required local, state and federal permits. Under New Hampshire law, utilities can invest in renewable generation of up to 6% of their total distribution peak load, which provides Unitil the opportunity to develop as much as 18 MW of renewables.
“With this array, Unitil will provide substantial savings for ratepayers, generate employment opportunities within the community, and significantly curb carbon emissions,” said Dan Weeks, vice president of business development at ReVision Energy. “
While energy storage initially will not be part of the Kingston site, it has been designed for solar. A spokesperson told pv magazine USA that Unitil continues to evaluate the cost and benefits of storage to ensure the addition of storage provides net benefits to customers.
This article was amended on Feb. 27, 2024 to state that the Kingston plant is the largest utility owned, but not the first.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/26/arizona-approves-discriminatory-charge-on-rooftop-solar-customers/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ARIZONA",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-02-26,Arizona approves “discriminatory” charge on rooftop solar customers,"The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) has approved a request from major utility Arizona Public Service to raise electricity rates for all customers, assess fixed charges, and to single out those who have invested in rooftop solar with the largest of such charges.
Commission Chair Jim O’Connor said he and three Republican ACC members approved the rate plan without knowing the real effect it would have on customers’ bills. Under the new rate hike, O’Connor promised customers will see their bills rise roughly 8%, far outpacing inflation.
APS president Ted Geisler told reporters that residential customers should expect to see bills increase by about $10 to $12 per month, while customers with rooftop solar can expect to see their bills increase by as much as $15 per month. The move comes on the heels of Arizona reducing its rooftop solar export rates, known as net metering rates, by 10% last summer.
However, the full impact of the rate hike has not been fully evaluated by the ACC. Arizona Public Interest Research Group Education Fund requested the commission reconsider the approval, suggesting that APS should be required to testify under oath the exact projected impact on customers.
“Comprehensive data should be entered into the docket, and APS executives should be sworn in before they speak,” wrote Diane Brown in an appeal from the organization. “The commission failed to ask the questions necessary to ensure they had adequate and complete data before voting on the entire rate plan.”
Michael O’Donnell, vice president of Arizona-based solar installer Sunsolar Solutions called the proposal “truly outrageous.” He said solar customers are already paying about $80 per month on average to be connected to the grid, and that under the new rate structure, these customers can expect to pay $120 per month. This would even apply to customers who produce 100% or more of their electricity from their rooftop array.
Despite having an abundance of sun, steadily rising rates, and high electricity demand due to air conditioning use, Arizona is not a leading rooftop solar market. Export rates are low, and the ACC has approved numerous cuts, reductions, and demand charges on solar customers.
“Arizona is a needlessly difficult state to do business in,” said Christopher Worley, director of policy, Sunrun. “Adding unsupported, discriminatory charges to the state’s already low export rates is punitive to solar customers, bad for the solar industry, and bad for ratepayers.”
The charges retroactively apply to customers who already have rooftop solar and have signed a net metering agreement with APS. This type of discriminatory move by APS undercuts broader goals of supporting energy independence, bill stability, and lowered carbon emissions by weakening consumer confidence that solar is a stable investment.
“Retroactive policies like this undercut market certainty and drive frustration in customers,” said Worley.
The discriminatory charges on rooftop solar customers were justified based on a need to upgrade transmission, and due to “cost-shift issues.” The cost-shift is an argument used by utilities nationwide suggesting that non-solar customers are cross-subsidizing rooftop solar customers by increasing utility system costs.
When net metering rates were cut last summer, APS claimed “the magnitude of cost shift within the residential ratepayer class is within the range of $800 to $1000 per year.” This would amount to an $18 million cross-subsidization.
However, numerous studies by national labs and state groups have debunked utility claims of such a significant cost-shift. Berkeley Labs  found that at current levels of rooftop solar adoption, the cost shift is negligible. In its modeling, Berkeley researchers found that rooftop solar creates cost savings system-wide. At solar adoption rates of 10% of electricity generation mix or more, which is roughly where Arizona stands, the cost shift was found to be a miniscule $0.005 per kWh.
What’s more, amendments to the new rate hike create a cost shift in the reverse direction. Amendment 3 on the rate hike, proposed by Chairman O’Connor, would require APS to run a program leveraging customers’ rooftop solar and batteries to export power and serve peak demand hours on the grid.
“Programs like this leverage the investment of solar customers to save money for all ratepayers,” said Worley.
Over 2,000 individuals and organizations in Arizona filed public comments on the rate hike, nearly all of which were in opposition.

This target will guide utilities in choosing electricity sources, with projections for solar power capacity reaching a potential 76.9 GW in a “low gas” scenario by 2035.

The default future projection, known as the 25 MMT Core Case, projects a need for 3 GWac of utility scale solar deployed in 2024, growing to almost 10 GW in 2028, before nearly doubling to 17.9 GW by 2033 and ultimately reaching 57.5 GW in 2045.

This decision marks the culmination of discussions which began in 2020, when it was suggested that previous procurement models were not aggressive enough to meet California’s negative emission goals.
The CPUC also considered additional modeling, including a “0 MMT Core Case” for 2045 and a “Low Gas” model as per requests by stakeholders. The “Low Gas” model proposes accelerating the closure of gas plants beyond the 25 MMT Core Case’s projections, which call for a 70% reduction in gas plant utilization by 2035 and a 90% reduction by 2039, compared to levels in the base year of 2024.
Furthermore, the CPUC urged the state to continue pushing for offshore wind. It contended that transmission upgrades are inevitable, stating that “it was not a matter of if, but rather when, transmission upgrades would be needed” and that these challenges should not impede the work of CPUC staff members mapping the 1.6 GW of potential capacity in waters near the North Coast/Humboldt area.
The state also greatly reduced the projected volume of out-of-state wind available to 52.82 GW of potential capacity.

Utilities were instructed to continue procuring new capacity as if the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant were closing, despite uncertainty about the exact closing dates within the 2024-2025 calendar year. The wide potential closure date range was identified as a potential grid destabilizing event as new capacity was still being deployed and commissioned. The CPUC reiterated the requirement of 2.5 GW of clean resources “designed specifically to mitigate the loss of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant”.
This capacity does not necessarily refer to utility scale power plants, but rather to any capacity for which local electricity utilities contract. For instance, PG&E has signed a contract with residential solar specialist Sunrun for the “Peak Power Rewards” program. This program compensates customers for dispatching power during times of peak demand on the grid. Over 90 consecutive days, 8,500 residential solar-plus-storage assets delivered an average of 27 MW of power during peak hours.
The model included 2 GW of geothermal capacity. One might see a change in this value in the future as Fervos Energy continues its evolution.

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/26/fully-printable-flexible-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-17-6-efficiency/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-26,Fully printable flexible perovskite solar cell achieves 17.6% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Victoria in Canada have built a flexible perovskite solar cell based on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate in ambient air fabrication.
They explained that PET is cheaper than commonly utilized polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) in substrates for flexible solar cells, with the latter having however the advantage of being more thermally stable during the production process. PET, by contrast, has a maximum temperature tolerance of 100 C and can tolerate deposition procedures under this threshold.
For this reason, the research group chose a cell architecture with a substrate made of PET and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin oxide (SnO2), a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite absorber, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer (HTL), and a gold (Au) metal contact.
They deposited the SnO2  layer by annealing at 100 C, the Spiro-OMeTAD at 50 C, and the perovskite absorber at 100 C by a slot-die coating of acetate/chloride salts. “The acetate component of this ink converts to gas during perovskite deposition process, creating local positive pressure and pushing dust away from deposition area,” they explained. “Deposition of perovskite from this ink requires neither clean rooms nor inert atmosphere. The chloride component, in contrast, improves crystallization dynamics of the film.”
The group built a cell with an active area of 0.049 cm2 active area and a reactant known as phenyltrimethylammonium chloride (PTACl). “When adding PTACl into the colloidal solution of SnO2, we observed doubling the size of agglomerates, which indicates that the phase-transfer agent indeed increased the particle-to-particle interaction in the colloidal solution,” it stated.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the flexible perovskite device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V, a short-circuit current density of 23 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 80%.
The scientists also built a 1 cm2 device with the same configuration showing an efficiency of 12.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.97 V, a short-circuit current density of 21.7 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 60.2%. They said the fill factor loss compared to the smaller device is due to increased resistance of the ITO substrate, which they ensure can be further improved through improved electrode design.
“The incorporation of phase-transfer catalyst, PTACl, into the SnO2 colloidal solution improved particle-to-particle interaction, enhancing SnO2 coverage and strengthening the binding to the perovskite layer,” they emphasized, adding that future research should focus on replacing MAPbI3 with more stable perovskite materials.
The device was introduced in the study “Enhanced Particle-to-Particle Interaction of Tin Oxide Electron Transporter Layer for Scalable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells,” published in RRL Solar.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/26/tribal-solar-on-the-rise/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",MATTHEW LYNAS,2024-02-26,Tribal solar on the rise,"From pv magazine 02/24
In December 2020, the smokestacks of Navajo Generating Station (NGS) tumbled. The 2.25 GW coal-fired power plant had provided electricity to customers in Arizona, Nevada, and California. The closure caused hundreds of job losses.
For more than 40 years, NGS was fueled by coal mined on Navajo Nation – the largest Native American reservation in the United States. Despite this, it is estimated around 14,000 reservation homes have no electricity. When the White House issued guidance on the IRA flagship industrial policy, the text recognized tribal nations had been “left behind for too long.”
The IRA could change the game for Native American solar. Native American lands account for around 2% of the United States land mass but hold more than 5% of the nation’s solar potential. Tribes face barriers to installing solar, however. Before the IRA, tribal solar projects were a less attractive financial prospect. There was no easy way for Native American peoples to access investment tax credits (ITCs) for solar projects – worth around 30% of investment value. Native American tribes are treated as sovereign, meaning they are not subject to federal income tax. Accessing tax incentives, therefore, required creativity.
When the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA) was developing its utility scale Kayenta solar plant, near the former Kayenta coalmine that supplied NGS, the tribal electric company set up a for-profit, limited-purpose company: NTUA Generation Inc. In this way, the utility was able to acquire tax credits and share the value with project finance partners.
Thanks to the IRA, things are more straightforward. Non-profit organizations can receive tax credits as a direct payment. That is one of many measures in the IRA providing incentives to develop renewable energy projects on tribal land. A key characteristic of the IRA’s investment tax incentives is that they can be stacked (see chart below). With these bonuses, known as adders, the credit value of the ITC could hit 70% of project cost. For example, a solar project on tribal land would benefit from the 30% base tax credit, plus a 10% tribal land bonus. If it met the requirements for domestic content and energy community bonuses, the ITC value would double to 60% of project cost. Guidance on the exact criteria for adders is still forthcoming.

Tribal ownership
Government backing for tribally owned energy is a break from precedent. There are strong feelings on this issue in Native American communities. Throughout the 20th century, Native American people and their land contributed a great deal to the United States energy mix. It is widely acknowledged Native Americans did not receive a fair share of the benefits.
“The reason the NTUA was first created is because we were ignored,” said Arash Moalemi, deputy general manager at NTUA Generation Inc. “We were ignored as far as the United States providing basic utilities on Navajo Nation and the leadership of Navajo Nation said, ‘you know, this is unacceptable. We’re going to have our own utility because outside entities are not protecting us’.”
Founded in 1959, the NTUA’s main goal is to provide electricity and other essentials such as water, internet, and cellphone service to Navajo Nation residents. In recent years, pursuing that goal has seen NTUA take ownership of utility scale solar plants on its land, starting with the Kayenta site.
Developed in two phases with local utility Salt River Project (SRP), Kayenta Solar Farm is a 55 MW project located in the El Capitan area of Navajo Nation. Phase one of the 148-hectare site was completed in 2017 and phase two came online in 2019. In addition to the $12.8 million in tax revenue that the NTUA claims Kayenta will generate for Navajo Nation over its lifetime, the project was also an economic engine during development, creating 434 construction jobs.
Those jobs were welcome but NTUA’s Moalemi knows they can’t replace the roles lost through the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants and the mines that supplied them. Solar manufacturing is a different story. There, the adders included in the IRA could really come into play.
“To alleviate that employment issue, we’re trying to create streams of opportunity related to solar manufacturing on the Navajo Nation,” said Moalemi. Discussions remain confidential but he confirmed the NTUA has spoken to PV manufacturers, and added, he has already identified buildings with conversion potential.
Solar manufacturing ambition may be in the early stages but utility scale PV development continues. In August 2023, the NTUA held a ribbon cutting ceremony for its 94 MW Red Mesa solar plant. Four months prior, NTUA had signed up to a memorandum of understanding with local generator Avangrid, part of Spanish multinational utility Iberdrola, which committed the two organizations to explore the development of 1 GW of green energy projects within Navajo Nation.
Navajo Nation’s tribal government signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and eight federal agencies on Dec. 6, 2023. That memorandum sets out the government’s intention to better facilitate tribal access to the funding available through the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act; the IRA; and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, along with programs offered annually by agencies.
Big money
Within the DOE, the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs is the body tasked with providing financial, technical, and educational assistance to the 574 recognized tribes in the United States. Between 2010 and 2021, the office invested $114 million in more than 200 tribal energy projects.
Wahleah Johns, director of the Office of Indian Energy, told pv magazine that she hopes to “get $100 million out the door” in 2024. Her department’s ambition has been matched by funding. Since Johns took on the director role, the budget for her office has increased from $22 million, in the 2020-21 fiscal year, to $75 million in 2022-23. On Jan. 17, 2024, the department released a notice of intent to launch a $25 million funding opportunity in the spring.
The funding comes as an increasing number of tribes pursue energy products, according to Johns. “There is a huge need,” she said. “Sixty per cent of the [grant funding] applications that came in were new applicants and so we are seeing a huge increase of applications coming in from tribes that haven’t participated before.”
It’s not just the government that sees the energy potential of tribal land. Solv Energy is an engineering, procurement, and construction and operations and maintenance services provider with experience developing and managing solar installations on Native American land. The company worked on NTUA’s Kayenta and Red Mesa projects and is currently building the 250 MW San Juan solar and storage project near the Navajo border in New Mexico.
Opportunity knocks
“The great opportunity of Navajo is that they’ve got significant coal generation [power plants] that they’re decommissioning,” said George Hershman, chief executive officer at Solv Energy. All that decommissioning work means there are grid connections to spare – a bonus that enhances the business case when developing utility scale solar projects.
“That’s the beauty of it,” said Hershman. “You have this stranded interconnection because you had a large coal-fired plant. That interconnection was essentially at the end of a major generating line.”
Decommissioned coal-fired plants don’t just provide grid connections; they are the kind of location where the tax credit adders in the IRA can stack up.
Due to the wait for more detailed IRA guidance, Hershman said the United States solar industry hasn’t experienced the type of growth that tax incentives could provide. He is, however, optimistic for the future. “I think we’ll really start to see that in 2024 and ’25, as these guidances come out,” he added. “That market will grow dramatically once we get some of these pieces in place. Industries work because people want your products and right now, people want our products. That will give me reason to come to work every day and be bullish on the market.”
Off-grid electrification
If the Solv Energy boss is correct, it could be great news for the economies of tribes like Navajo Nation. But as the Navajo know well, generation doesn’t mean electrification – there is still the problem of the reservation’s 14,000 homes without power.
Here, utility-scale projects can provide some assistance. Moalemi said that, unlike non-tribal entities, when NTUA develops a project it looks to see how it can connect nearby Navajo households.
But the heart of the problem is the rural nature of Navajo. Grid connection quotes for remote households can run to tens of thousands of dollars – that’s economically unfeasible and it is where off-grid solar can, and does, come into play.
The NTUA offers a range off-grid solar packages, reducing or removing dependency on diesel generators for households. The utility also engages in an annual charity drive that brings electricity to rural homes. “Light up Navajo” is now in its fifth year and had a record-breaking 2023 that saw 26 utility companies from 15 states reportedly electrify 159 homes.
Solv Energy has got in on the act. Its Skip the Grid campaign sees the company provide off grid solar to Navajo households. An outreach component of the program provides children with classroom resources and solar education.
The off-grid PV systems themselves are not too complex. Typically, Solv Energy and charity partners fit households with 400 W modules and battery energy storage systems. “It’s a pretty hefty system,” said Alyssa Grant, community relations manager at Solv Energy. “In fact, you can actually run a refrigerator or a small stove.”
Light up Navajo education packs consist of basic school supplies such as pencils and scissors as well as what Grant described as a “solar 101” coloring book and a DIY solar toy car kit.
“I think the point is that we really want to inspire these kids to understand what’s being built in their back yard but also maybe inspire them to think, ‘well, this could be something I could get into’,” added Grant.

6,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/26/first-solar-could-have-5-billion-impact-on-u-s-economy-by-2026/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-26,First Solar could have $5 billion impact on U.S. economy by 2026,"First Solar, Inc. commissioned an economic analysis of the vertically integrated solar manufacturer’s value chain in the United States. The company is unique in the U.S. solar manufacturing landscape because it offers vertically integrated solar manufacturing facilities capable of production across the entire supply chain.
The study, conducted by the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, analyzed First Solar’s actual and forecast U.S. spending in 2023 and 2026 when the company expects to have 14 GW of annual nameplate capacity across Alabama, Louisiana and Ohio.
Manufacturing
First Solar produces thin film solar modules in a single process that allows the company to transform a sheet of glass into a fully functional solar panel in approximately four hours. At the end of 2023, First Solar had over 6 GW of operational manufacturing capacity in the U.S., and that figure will grow as new facilities become operational.
In addition to expanding its Ohio footprint to over 7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2024, the company expects to invest over $2 billion in new manufacturing facilities in Alabama and Louisiana, which are expected to come online in 2024 and 2026, respectively. First Solar is also investing up to $450 million in R&D infrastructure in Perrysburg, Ohio, expected to be operational in 2024.

Between 2016 and 2026, First Solar expects to have invested approximately $4 billion in manufacturing and research and development infrastructure in the U.S.
Jobs
The study found that in 2023 First Solar supported an estimated 16,245 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, representing $1.59 billion in annual labor income.
“This report reflects the real value of solar technology made in America for America, with materials sourced from businesses across the country, and not simply assembled here using imported components,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We know that our investments, catalyzed by the Inflation Reduction Act, are enabling jobs and bringing prosperity to communities in places such as Lawrence County, Alabama, Iberia Parish, Louisiana, and Crawford County, Pennsylvania, and this report helps quantify the extent of our contribution to the US economy in real terms.”
As part of First Solar’s manufacturing expansion, the report said that the company supported a total of 16,245 direct, indirect, and induced jobs in 2023, or nearly $1.6 billion in labor income in the U.S. economy. Furthermore, its operations are support nearly $2.8 billion in value added and almost $5.3 billion in total output, when including indirect and induced economic effects., according to the report.

Looking toward the future, the report says that the company’s expansion will provide more than 30,000 jobs and nearly $2.8 billion in labor income. By 2026 it is expected that First Solar will support nearly $5 billion in value added and over $10 billion in output to the U.S. economy.
Overall, assuming that the company achieves its 14 GW of nameplate capacity in the U.S. in 2026, it is forecast to add an estimated $4.99 billion in value and $10.18 billion in output to the U.S. economy in 2026 alone. In two years, First Solar is expected to directly employ 4,100 people, and with 7.3 jobs supported for every First Solar job, the report concludes that this represents an estimated total labor income of $2.78 billion including direct, indirect, and induced effects.
