Heat waves, floods, blizzards, and hurricanes more frequently threaten dangerous blackouts. Renewables paired with storage have helped to save lives, by keeping life-saving air conditioning and heat operating.
This happened when a “heat dome” punished the power grid this summer in Texas. It’s second only to California in energy storage capacity. According to S&P Global Intelligence, ERCOT has 2.2 gigawatts of storage now, and 29.2 GW in the planning pipeline by 2030.
At present, however, the short duration energy storage technologies being added to many electric grids and infrastructure across the globe have limitations—not just how long they store energy, but also safety concerns, and a shorter expected lifetime value than long duration energy storage solutions available today.
After Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico, leaving most of the territory’s 3.2 million residents without power for nearly two weeks, solar-plus-storage systems staved off some of the worst effects. Sunrun reported that its installations provided 400,000 hours of aggregated backup power in Puerto Rico during and after Fiona. Sunnova Energy said their systems delivered 3.4 million hours of backup power in the storm’s aftermath.
This has created a powerful appetite for more energy storage: The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is planning to install an additional 1.5 GW of battery storage capacity, hopefully in time for the next hurricane.
Long duration energy storage (LDES) provides energy storage for more than six hours with less fire risk, more stable reservoirs of power, and ultimately at a lower cost for truly grid-scale applications. This diverse set of technologies can store power for multiple hours, days, weeks, months and even seasons—with even more benefits to diverse industries and communities.
There are many benefits to LDES, as it saves energy from wind, solar and other clean sources and makes it dispatchable, matching supply and demand any time it’s needed, not just when the weather is favorable. Storage also helps avoid curtailment of wind and solar plants when demand is low, prices go negative, or transmission hits bottlenecks.
Long duration energy storage provides load shifting services that reduce the need for fossil fueled peaker plants, cutting even more carbon and pushing the world closer to the flexible and reliable energy system that is needed to meet today’s energy demands.
The savings add up quickly and help offset the cost, which depends on the market and technology. Some of our members are in the $100 per megawatt-hour range, while others are at $75 or $50. With costs falling even faster than solar panel costs did, others project that by 2027 certain forms of long duration storage can be at $20 per MWh, even less than wind and solar power capacity.
 Many long duration energy storage technologies are already commercially available today, but to keep cutting costs and scale to the level needed to reach the world’s decarbonization goals, we’ll continue to need supportive policies that accelerate the clean energy transition.
Early adopters
We anticipate the long duration energy storage market will grow to $4 trillion by 2040— these companies are making smart investments now to capitalize on this opportunity.
Rondo Energy and Siam Cement Group have partnered to scale up production of Rondo’s Heat Battery, which stores electric power as high-temperature heat in refractory brick without the use of combustibles, critical minerals, toxic chemicals, or liquids. Manufacturing capacity for 2.3 GWh per year is already online and expected to increase to 90 GWh per year. That’s larger than any current battery manufacturing facility worldwide.
Metal hydrogen battery manufacturer EnerVenue is building a 73-acre site east of Louisville, Kentucky. The first phase will offer 1 GWh of annual production capacity. The company plans to expand to 20 GWh per year across its U.S. facilities.
Form Energy broke ground on a factory in Wierton, West Virginia, that will employ 750 people to make 500 MW a year of iron-air batteries
Will your company be next?
Julia Souder is Chair of the Global Renewables Alliance and CEO of the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, a global non-profit with over 60 members in 20 countries. The Council works to accelerate decarbonization by providing member-driven, fact-based guidance and research to governments, grid operators, and major electricity users on deployment of long-duration energy storage’s mechanical, thermal, electrochemical and chemical solutions, to help achieve net zero for electric grids by 2040.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/28/shifting-state-policies-reshape-distributed-solar-in-the-u-s/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2023",Shifting state policies reshape distributed solar in the U.S.,"From pv magazine Special Edition
Distributed solar projects, which range from small rooftop residential installations of a couple of kilowatts to wholesale market-participating projects as large as 20 MW, are considered an important part of the energy transition alongside their large utility scale project counterparts.  
Small, distributed projects are valued for their ability to be integrated on rooftops and other built-environment locations, preserving land for other uses, or protecting existing ecosystems. Distributed generation (DG) is also beneficial in creating a more climate resilient grid, especially when paired with energy storage.  
By bringing solar closer to the end user, DG sources can flexibly respond to extreme weather events when the centralized utility grid goes down. DG can also diminish grid losses from power transmission and lessen the amount of transmission infrastructure necessary to maintain a reliable grid, potentially offering cost savings for participating ratepayers. For these reasons, state legislators have enacted policies for years to encourage DG adoption and foster a healthy market.  
As the market evolves and demands change, policies are actively shifting today. Some major changes, including cuts to net energy metering, have been controversial, while others, like the establishment of low-income solar programs, have generally been met with praise.  
In the first quarter of 2023 alone, the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center’s Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE) shows that 41 states combined for 173 policy actions.  
The most common change, about one-third of all state policy actions, were adjustments to DG compensation. Most of these compensation changes relate to net energy metering (NEM), the process by which excess production from solar is exported to the grid in exchange for utility bill credits. The second most common type of change was the addition of community solar policies, where 19 states and Washington D.C. made changes.  
Additionally, 22 states made changes to add residential fixed charges or minimum bill increases. Other common actions were changes to third-party ownership rules (11 states) and the introduction of residential demand or solar charges (10 states). Ten states also approved the funding of a DG valuation or net metering study.  
Net metering  
Based on this data, the NC Clean Energy Technology Center identified three trends. The first trend, which has been the source of controversy in many states, is the shift to time-varying or avoided cost rates for net energy metering (NEM).  
According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), avoided cost is defined as “the incremental costs to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity or both which, but for the purchase from the qualifying facility or qualifying facilities, such utility would generate itself or purchase from another source.”  
In most avoided cost rate cases, the compensation rate has been cut considerably for NEM. In California, the NEM 3.0 ratemaking case cut credit values by about 75%. This change has made battery energy storage a necessary component in a home solar project to maximize value for both the individual and the grid.  
Time-varying and avoided cost pricing schemes are both designed to recognize the mismatch between electricity generation from intermittent resources and times of peak demand. They address the now-famous “duck curve” phenomenon that represents this mismatch in net demand.  
The “duck curve” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation (mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand (late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.  
The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market. In a duck curve scenario, conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace 
A few other states have taken unique approaches to NEM. Arizona utilities credit distributed generators at a flat rate, but these customers are required to take electric service on a time-of-use rate. In Hawaii, plans to move all customers to default time-of-use rates are being finalized, and the state is developing distributed energy resource tariffs that will incorporate time-varying export credit rates.  
While grid operators argue that this cut to NEM is a necessary evolution to address the intermittent generation cycles of solar and ensure a more equitable energy transition, it is likely that the sudden precipitous drop may do short-term damage to residential solar sales growth. However, as net metering rates are pulled back, other markets are emerging, namely community solar markets. 
Community solar  
The second most-common trends the DSIRE report highlighted both relate to community solar framework. One common change is around siting requirements and restrictions, while the other supports community solar access for low- to moderate-income customers.  
As federal funding under the Inflation Reduction Act is opening doors for community solar markets, states are rapidly adopting policies to access funds and secure low-cost, reliable clean energy for residents and businesses. 
Community solar is typically described by a subscriber-based market, where ratepayers sign on for a certain amount of capacity from a local solar project and are credited for the project’s contribution to the grid.  
The Department of Energy estimates that community solar subscriptions can save an average of 20% on customer bills, though pv magazine USA has reported on the rollout of many programs that offer 5% to 10% savings.  
The Biden Administration set a goal in 2022 to sign up 5 million community solar households, achieving $1 billion in bill savings by 2025. Today, the community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW in just two years.  
In early 2023, a growing number of states are addressing siting issues in community solar program design, by either limiting eligible sites or providing incentives or bid preferences to encourage development in particular locations like brownfields or rooftops.  
A community solar proposal in New Jersey would limit eligible project sites to rooftops, canopies over impervious surfaces, brownfields, and floating solar on manmade bodies of water. Maryland passed laws allowing multiple community solar projects exceeding 5 MW in aggregate to be built on the same or adjacent parcels if they are located on sites such as rooftops, brownfields and industrial areas.  
While shifting state policies and the nationwide cut to net metering were a cause for alarm for residential installers and environmentalists alike, it appears that states are recognizing the benefits of building smaller, distributed projects and siting them responsibly.  
As energy storage markets achieve scale, rooftop residential installers are expected to rebound from these changes, while emergent community solar markets will extend access to ratepayers that have not yet directly enjoyed the benefits of the energy transition.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/28/the-win-win-of-agrivoltaics/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2023",The win-win of agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine Special Edition
Agrivoltaics, the co-location of solar energy systems with crop production or animal grazing, solves at least two critical needs. Solar provides renewable energy to mitigate climate change while meeting global energy demands and crops grown alongside solar help feed the burgeoning population.
The practice of agrivoltaics dates back to 2011 in France when Christian Dupraz of the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment (INRAE) sited the first solar plus agriculture project in the world. Projects began in the U.S. in 2018 at Oregon State University, Arizona State University and Colorado State University. And in 2020, Jack’s Solar Garden in Longmont, Colo. was the first widely studied operational garden.
Today there are over 300 agrivoltaic installations in the U.S., according to data provided by Jordan Macknick, lead energy and water-land analyst for NREL. Siting crops under solar modules has agricultural benefits as well. For example, solar modules shade agricultural land, helping to retain moisture, thus benefiting the vegetation growing underneath. One study in France by Dupraz concluded that water demand is reduced by 12% to 34% due to the shade from solar arrays above.
Another French study conducted in 2023 by INRAE, found that the shading factor from agrivoltaic systems reduced water irrigation input by 19% to 47%, a huge savings as these systems become more utilized in drought-prone regions. Oregon State’s agrivoltaics professor Chad Higgins reported that agrivoltaic systems have been shown to increase land productivity for farmers by 60% to 70%, and also to increase the value of the energy production system by 30%. Soil health has been cited as another benefit of agrivoltaic projects.
A 2022 report by the Fraunhofer Institute showed that during the particularly hot summer of 2018, potatoes grown under the shade of solar panels in southern Germany obtained a land use efficiency of 186%, compared to potatoes grown next to a solar array. Studies by Greg Barron-Gafford at Arizona State showed larger heads of broccoli and increased seasonal production of tomatoes harvested in August in the arid regions of Arizona, where produce such as basil, lettuce, melons and chard grew under 10-foot elevated solar panels.
Pollinator boost
Successful food production often requires pollination, and planting bee pollinator habitat in agrivoltaic installations is a growing trend. One of the longest-running and widely known projects focused on solar-pollinator habitats is the Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems, or InSPIRE project, funded by the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technology Office.
InSPIRE’s database currently covers 270 reported U.S. solar-pollinator projects with a combined energy production of more than 1.2 GW and occupying just over 6,600 acres. Another resource, the Pollinator Habitat Aligned with Solar Energy, or PHASE, was initiated in 2021 by the Department of Energy to evaluate the economic and ecological implications of pollinator-friendly solar projects at large projects greater than 10 MW across the midwestern U.S.
Livestock grazing Siting solar with livestock is another agrivoltaic use, and it, too, has a myriad of advantages. According to the Department of Agriculture, sheep numbers peaked in the U.S. in 1884 at 51 million head but dropped to about 5 million by 2016. However, with the discovery that sheep provide useful vegetation management, the sheep count is rebounding to historic levels because of the new market for sheep. New utility solar projects with many multi-thousand acre projects in Texas require 1,800 or more sheep to keep vegetation growth within a 24-inch maximum clearance required for utility solar operations, said Texas rancher JR Howard of Texas Solar Sheep.
Loran Shallenberger, director of Regenerative Energy, a sheep grazing business of Silicon Ranch, said a common misconception is with sheep grazing between solar modules, mowing is no longer needed. The reality is that sheep grazing reduces the number of mowings from about five to three on average on a utility project, Shallenberger said. S
ilicon Ranch has seen a 20% operating expense saving from operations and maintenance from using sheep grazers, he said. The savings margin starts to add up for developers who have paid upwards of $1 million per year for conventional lawn mowing.
U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Mike Braun (R-IN) in May 2023 introduced federal legislation, the Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Act of 2023, which calls for $75 million in subsidies for research and demonstration type agrivoltaics projects from the Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy.
From 2024 to 2028 new funding will be dispersed at about $15 million per year. Based on the initial findings, the secretary of the USDA will create a five-year plan for utilizing the research and activities to provide better support to agrivoltaics. A comprehensive report outlining the study’s results will be submitted to the relevant committees within three years of the new legislation.
“Dual-use projects serve multiple purposes and generate many values that jump off the page when you take a second to look at them,” said Dan French, executive producer of Solar Farm Summit, LLC.
“Developers are starting to figure it out, and the fact that agrivoltaics is scaling so strongly in Illinois is powerful evidence that these practices can already pencil. Proper cropping may not come at scale until down the road a ways, but we know that advanced conservation with beneficial vegetation works now.”
The U.S. has more than 5 million acres of land suitable for agrivoltaics, according to the Great Plains Institute. With just over 43% of the U.S. contiguous land mass currently sited for agriculture use, the opportunity is vast.

The lithium hydroxide was recovered by Aqua Metals, which is working on recycling solutions for materials used in energy storage and electric vehicle supply chains. The two companies are working on creating a closed lithium loop – where lithium batteries are sourced, manufactured and recycled – all in Nevada. 
Using recycled lithium addresses two major initiatives for Dragonfly Energy, its CEO Denis Phares said – “it helps close the loop by filling in that all-important recycling component, and it provides a ready and sustainable supply of lithium for use in upcoming cell production.”
“This is an exciting step forward for the emerging lithium battery industry, as we have qualified the high-purity lithium hydroxide Aqua Metals recovers from recycled lithium batteries to manufacture new battery cells,” Vick Singh, director of research and development at Dragonfly Energy, said.
The development is also an exciting milestone for Aqua Metals in establishing the efficacy of its sustainable recycling process, Steve Cotton, the company’s president and CEO, said.
The Reno, Nevada-based Aqua Metals pulled the lithium hydroxide from “black mass” – a term that refers to a mixture of crushed and shredded battery cells that have already been used, which contains lithium and one valuable raw materials. Dragonfly Energy used this lithium hydroxide to produce a battery cell with a patented dry powder coating process.
Both companies are eyeing the potential of building a closed lithium loop in Nevada, a state they believe is well-positioned to be “the starting and ending point for lithium batteries.” Nevada is believed to have the largest source of lithium in North America, according to the companies, and is also an expanding market for electric vehicles and energy storage technology applications.
Recycling is essential to creating a robust and sustainable energy storage industry in the U.S. and ensuring the country remains globally competitive in the clean energy sector, Aqua Metals’ Cotton told pv magazine USA.
“Recycling lithium ion batteries is the most immediate route to developing domestic supplies of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are facing increasing supply shortages as the world ramps up clean energy manufacturing,” Cotton said.
The biggest challenge to closing the lithium loop in Nevada as well as other parts of the country will be timing, Cotton said. It is expected that the U.S. will have nearly a terawatt hour of lithium battery manufacturing operational by 2030, enough for 12 million to 13 million electric vehicles a year, he said.
“What we won’t have by then is the mines, mineral processing, and refinement capacity to satisfy the raw resource demand,” Cotton said.
Mines can take seven to 10 years to come online and begin producing battery-grade materials, while recycling facilities – which can be operationalized in six months – are constrained by the availability of recyclable materials, he added.
“Making the timing work out for resource demand, manufacturing, and our decarbonization ambitions will be a significant challenge as we create the closed loop systems necessary for a robust electrified economy,” Cotton said.

This article was written for the official event publication in circulation at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.
In August 2022, the United States made its boldest commitment to the energy transition yet, passing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The Act included a record $369 billion investment in climate and energy measures, much of which is directed to the manufacturing, development, deployment and operation of clean energy assets.
The IRA was met with general praise by the clean energy industry and environmentalists alike. Initial analysis by researchers at Princeton University and Dartmouth College said the act would lead to a tenfold increase in One year after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, federal policies help turn the page toward an economy powered by emissions-free technology and domestic manufacturing. By Ryan Kennedy, editor pv magazine USA annual solar deployment from about 10 GW in 2020 to 100 GW in 2030.
Annual U.S. energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% through 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and industry. The IRA also mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030, moving the nation further away from the worst effects of climate change.
“The solar industry stands ready to invest in our domestic manufacturing capacity, grow the solar workforce, and rapidly scale our clean energy deployment efforts. I look forward to continued collaboration with our leaders to ensure a brighter, more sustainable future,” said George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy, in reaction to the passage.
Now, about a year removed from the landmark law passage, private investment in clean energy manufacturing has exploded. Throughout the year the industry has received guidance on the finer details of how various incentives will be administered. As the details come in, the industry moves from evaluation to implementation, bringing renewable energy from a supportive role to center-stage over the course of the next decade.
Investment
One of the core goals of the IRA is to lessen U.S. reliance on foreign sources , creating a higher level of energy independence to support national security, economic growth and good-paying jobs. It appears that the goals are being met, as investors have opened their wallets in droves over the last twelve months.
A White House tracker shows that under the Biden-Harris Administration, over $137 billion in private investment in electric vehicles and battery manufacturing has been announced, and $84 billion in private funds has been directed to clean energy manufacturing. Virtually all of these announcements have taken place post-IRA passage.
A survey by the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) found that 100% of its respondents perceive the U.S. market to be increasing in attractiveness relative to other major countries in renewable energy investment. The response, made by executives from 43 leading companies with $100 million in annual revenues or investments, is the first time in the ACORE survey’s history that the United States has unanimously been perceived to be increasing in relative attractiveness to other nations.
Furthermore, more than one-third of surveyed investors, about 38%, reported plans to invest in clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. Traditional investors are not the only ones supporting the domestic content push. About 28% of developers reported plans to open a new manufacturing plant, and 33% said they plan to incentivize their suppliers to open domestic facilities. Furthermore, 11% of developers said they intend to directly invest in domestic manufacturing plants.
The relative strength seen in the U.S. market comes at a serendipitous time, as renewable energy investment globally now nearly doubles that of the fossil fuels. For every dollar invested in fossil fuels, $1.70 is invested in clean energy technologies. This marks a fast divergence from five years ago, when fossil fuels and clean energy investments were essentially even.
Guidance is in
In May 2023, the Internal Revenue Service released guidance on the requirements for the coveted domestic content incentive adder. Solar power projects that use domestic content are eligible for the full 30% tax credit and can increase their tax credit by an additional 10%, to 40% in total, or be credited 0.3 ¢/kWh for projects that use the Production Tax Credit.
The guidance allows developers to take advantage of the domestic content bonus credit for projects that begin construction this year. For projects to qualify for the adder, 40% of the cost of manufactured products used must take place domestically. This threshold will increase to 55% in 2026. Solar trackers, solar panels and inverters are classified under the “manufactured products” designation. Additionally, 100% of steel and iron in the project must be made in the U.S.
“We are encouraged by Treasury’s solutions to meet the manufactured product test, which are consistent with recommendations from ACORE and others, and we look forward to projects moving forward under this guidance immediately,” said Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
U.S. can compete
All this investment may lead one to wonder if the United States can achieve its energy independence goals; goals that the nation has largely shared on a bipartisan level for many years. Recent analysis from Princeton University and Dartmouth College suggests that at least from a cost perspective, the U.S. can now compete globally.
The research concluded that with the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, components manufactured in the U.S. are now likely to be less expensive than imports across the entire solar supply chain. This lower cost extends from polysilicon ingots, wafers, cells, to module assembly, as well as to inverters.
Before the IRA, domestic production was more expensive than imports for each component. The researchers estimate the cost of solar modules assembled in the U.S. and made from 100% domestically-manufactured components will now be more than 30% less expensive to produce than imported modules. And this 30% cost reduction is before considering any applicable import tariffs, further suggesting that domestic components will be more attractive to purchasers.
“Using U.S.-manufactured parts and materials for clean energy development and paying workers a fair wage has always been the right thing to do. Now it’s also the most economical thing to do,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a nonprofit that allies labor unions and environmental groups.
The report notes that the degree to which lower domestic production costs pass through to final prices for solar components or installed projects is uncertain. However, when considering the 10% tax credit adder for renewable energy projects employing domestic content, the IRA has the potential to induce significant demand for U.S.-made components.
The Princeton/Dartmouth report said this demand will outstrip current U.S. solar component manufacturing capacity, prompting investment to expand U.S. supply chains. However, it is uncertain that the supply chains will expand without bottlenecks along the way.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates the IRA will lead to 47 GW of new module manufacturing capacity, over 16 GW of cells, more than 16 GW of ingots and wafers, nearly 9 GWac of inverters and well over 100 GWh of battery manufacturing. SEIA also estimates that we can anticipate more than 20,000 tons of annual domestic polysilicon capacity coming back online and a multitude of new investments in tracker and racking capacity.
Gaps in the chain
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) shared that while module assembly has a strong presence today in the U.S., ingot, wafer, and cell production plans have not kept pace, and no plans for greenfield polysilicon plants have materialized.
“Despite a host of announcements promising new manufacturing investments, it remains a long way from press releases to manufacturing plants and progress to date is highly uneven along the value chain,” said a report from CEA.
The firm projects that by 2027, there will be a 94% supply gap between ingot and wafer supply as compared to module assembly capacity. It forecasts roughly 17 GW of polysilicon production, 3 GW ingots, 3 GW wafers, 18 GW cell manufacturing, and 40 GW module manufacturing capacities by 2027, suggesting that the U.S. will continue to rely on energy imports and exports for years to come.
Other analysts have agreed that the IRA and the domestic content adder may fail to address critical gaps in the supply chain, preventing the long-term goal of energy independence and security.
“Our competitors already have billions of dollars of infrastructure in place to manufacture each step of the supply chain, which they have subsidized for decades,” said Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Coalition.
He pointed out that the 45X credit can get a factory built and operating for the duration of the IRA, but that there’s no longterm advantage to setting up manufacturing here for any of the part of the supply chain not recognized in the domestic content standard.
“You can simply import pieces and get the same ‘bonus’,” he said. Carr noted that this is even more true for the wafer and polysilicon facilities because they are the most expensive to build.

Analysis and data by Taiwan-based industry analysts TrendForce show that the superior conversion efficiencies of n-type cells have led to “rapidly” expanded capabilities in 2022 and primed the market for competition. This has led TrendForce analysts to believe p-type PERC capacities could be phased out by 2025.
“Currently, PERC cell technology for producing p-type cells stands as the market’s mainstay,” the report said. “However, with the step-by-step realization of large-scale n-type cell capacities, there looms a risk that a substantial part of PERC cell technology capacities may be phased out within the forthcoming two to three years.”
Analysis suggests that as n-type silicon incrementally comes online there might be a sporadic shortage of high-quality silicon materials and wafers fit for n-type cells. “This could further establish a noticeable price disparity between n-type silicon wafers, and their p-type counterparts,” the report said, which may lead to a noticeable price difference between the two technologies.
Polysilicon supply poses its own problems. Although supply remains “abundant,” TrendForce warned that if production continues to surge for n-type cells there could be an oversupply of p-type silicon causing its price to drop faster.
TrendForce predicts supply could reach 68.8% capacity by the end of 2023 and 40.3% capacity by the end of 2025. “By 2023’s end, it is projected that the total production capacity of polysilicon will reach 2.072 million MT,” the report said. “The actual output of silicon materials is expected to be 1.483 million MT, sufficient to support over 600 GW of solar panel consumption (given a silicon consumption rate of 0.245 MT/GW). This aligns with an annual installation demand of approximately 370-390 GW, indicating a clear oversupply of silicon.”
TrendForce said demand and limited output may lead to periodic shortages of n-type silicon, which would level out prices.
Silicon wafer production capacity is expected to reach roughly 921.6 GW by the end of the year, the report said, with silicon wafer manufacturers reacting to the n-type cell scramble by “rapidly” transforming operations and scaling up output. This may once again impact p-type cells.
“With the inclusion of rectangular silicon wafers occupying a portion of this capacity, certain dimensions of p-type wafers might experience short-term supply shortages, potentially failing to meet immediate demands,” TrendForce said. “If the n-type cell rollout falls short of expectations, there remains a risk of n-type wafer oversupply.”
But as n-cell capacity deployment experiences delays, PERC tech will most likely remain the victorious technology for 2023, the report said. Total wafer capacity primarily attributed to n-type TOPCon cell technology is expected to reach 1,172 GW by the end of the year – a 106% increase since 2022, the report said.
“However, TrendForce has observed some delays in the actual deployment of n-type cell capacity. Given the existing price difference between n-p type wafers, PERC technology is anticipated to retain its leading position in the market this year, although the penetration rate of TOPCon cells will accelerate.”

We have all been asking ourselves for some time now: How far can photovoltaic module prices go down before the bottom is finally reached? Apparently, there is still room for further drops, as all prices have fallen again this month.
On average, prices in all module categories have been corrected downwards by around 10%. Never before in the history of photovoltaics have panel prices plummeted so significantly in such a short space of time. For a month or two now, the values have been below the previous all-time low of 2020 and even more so below the production costs of most manufacturers. Generating profit margins seems to be a thing of the past for the time being and for many of them it is now just a matter of minimizing damage or even survival.
How could we come to this, and what are the causes of this self-destructive trend?
First of all, it must be noted that module prices rose by more than 50% between October 2020 and October 2022, which is not due to technological developments, but primarily due to the pandemic-related supply shortage coupled with a simultaneous increase in demand. Ultimately, many players in the photovoltaic market made very good money – at the expense of the end consumers. Until recently, photovoltaic system prices were higher than they had been for a long time. Now things have completely changed, which inevitably leads to a drop in prices. The speed and intensity of this change, however, surprise even experienced market participants.
After the shortage issues of the past two years, many installers and wholesalers made generous forecasts and ordered new goods as if there was no tomorrow. The producers, predominantly from Asia, reacted and increased their capacities. Global production capacity usually exceeds the actual expected demand by 30% to 50%, so that fluctuations can be quickly compensated for. The production lines are then ramped up or down as needed. Recently, however, this mechanism has gotten a bit out of hand as many manufacturers have had to switch their cell and module production very quickly from p-type PERC technology to n-type TOPCon, due to patent rights problems in individual regions. However, since the sales restrictions did not apply worldwide, new capacities were built up for TOPCon without replacing the old capacities and without consistently shutting them down.
The prospects appeared to be good in the long term thanks to the supposedly permanently high costs of conventional energy sources. Unfortunately, European politicians were very good at replacing old fossil fuel sources with new ones at short notice, so the suffering from skyrocketing energy costs quickly fell. The pandemic also seems to have finally been overcome and the average European can travel without restrictions again. Not least due to high inflation, many people who recently wanted to invest in photovoltaic systems are now becoming more reluctant. The fact that interest rates on loans continue to rise doesn’t make the decision any easier. The consequence of all the factors listed is a collapse in demand so that the photovoltaics industry has not yet emerged from the summer slump even in mid-September.
The quickly dwindling interest in solar power generation inevitably means that the order books of installers and project planners run empty and pre-ordered modules and inverters cannot be delivered on time. The goods are increasingly piling up at wholesalers and in the manufacturers’ warehouses. There are now said to be 40 GW to 100 GW of unsold modules in European stores, primarily in the Rotterdam area. Determining an exact amount is almost impossible. However, it is enough to know that there is already about a year’s supply of modules in Europe to understand the dimensions and scope of the matter. Storing these goods costs a lot of space and therefore money; losses are increasing day by day, while sales opportunities are decreasing. The pressure increases until the avalanche finally starts to slide and the first ones will begin offering their modules below purchasing or production costs. Competitors are forced to follow suit and the downward spiral is set in motion.
Now one might think that falling prices would have to increase demand. In many cases, the current price level for materials has not yet reached end customers or investors. For many providers, the old inventory, which was purchased at higher prices, is still too large. The wave of devaluation is also just beginning, which is why the price drop is becoming more severe from month to month. Many still hope to get away with a black eye. But the risk of being stuck with the old goods is very high. Those interested in photovoltaics also monitor prices very closely and compare offers. Accordingly, many end customers are now waiting for the offered prices to fall further and are hesitating to place an order.
So everything now depends on where the journey takes you. How low do prices have to fall before demand increases again and a balance is achieved?
The production lines in China are already being shut down, and up to 50 GW are to be built in the country this year – in addition to the 80 GW to 90 GW already installed this year. But even if not a single new module came to Europe from China, we would need many months until the module backlog is cleared. The stored modules are also predominantly products with PERC cells, whose efficiencies are lower than those of modules with the latest technology. I doubt that these are suitable for increasing domestic demand strongly. These products are more likely to be used in markets outside of Europe, where people are happy about inexpensive solar modules. In my opinion, only when the existing glut of modules can be reduced will a healthy price level be able to be established in the market again. By then, however, a market shakeout will probably be seen in and some market participants will fall by the wayside.
