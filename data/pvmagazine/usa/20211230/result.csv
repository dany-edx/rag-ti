The China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) argued there is no evidence of any forced labor in the region, which is home to about 50% of the world’s polysilicon production.
In early 2021, leading European and U.S. PV trade associations and analysts began speaking out against accusations of human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang province. In particularly, accusations that some solar products and materials were being produced using slave labor.  The region has been under scrutiny for its alleged human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities.
Just days before Christmas, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. If enacted, the law would ban all imports from China’s Xinjiang region, unless it can be proven that products were not connected to forced labor.
The CPIA said in a statement that it strongly opposes the new legislation, which it believes disregards the truth, violates international law, and damages the overall interest of China. It argued solar businesses in the Xinjiang region strictly follow international standards, while employment in the region is voluntary and fairly compensated.
Due to difficulties in either gathering evidence of fair labor practices and verified certificates of origin for some PV modules and materials, some  European and U.S. solar companies may opt to source materials, and polysilicon in particular, from non-Xinjiang regions in anticipation of import bans.
As discussed in pv magazine’s UP Initiative on solar workers rights earlier this year, solar manufacturers will need to respond to looming sanctions and rigorous supply-chain tracing requirements by increasing transparency, where feasible.
The potential impact of the sanctions on polysilicon from Xinjiang has been discussed at length this year. According to BloombergNEF, such measures might increase the profitability of companies like thin film producer First Solar, which does not use polysilicon, and of polysilicon producers with capacity outside Xinjiang – but the measures would be unlikely to have a much wider impact on solar industry growth.
“Solar manufacturers have over and over again proven themselves flexible and willing to adapt supply chains to trade legislation, for a small price,” Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF, wrote in pv magazine earlier this year.

The project is expected to provide energy for roughly 1,000 homeowners, renters, and businesses in the Central Hudson area.
To date, Source Power has been contracted to own and operate a total of more than 365 MW of installed capacity, and the company has invested nearly $1 billion in residential and commercial solar assets since 2010.
According to the company, Source Power’s provision of services to CEV is a reflection of the tremendous success Source Power has had since entering the market with its hybrid approach to community solar and commodity supply.
Source claims that this unique approach is made possible because of the company’s roots in the solar development industry through its sister company Source Renewables. By sitting at the intersection of project finance, renewable generation, and energy supply, the company claims that it is able to more effectively match solar generation with power consumers and use its vertical integration to ensure efficiencies are passed along to customers at competitive prices.
“Expanding community solar projects throughout New York State is an important step in making clean energy and solar power more accessible to our customers,” said Mark Valori, Vice President of NJR Clean Energy Ventures. “Our second partnership with Source Power reflects our trust in the company’s subscriber acquisition and management services and its ability to deliver low-carbon energy solutions and reliable services to the communities in Central Hudson.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/30/scout-clean-energy-acquires-utility-scale-solar-project-in-illinois/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,ILLINOIS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 30, 2021",Scout Clean Energy acquires utility-scale solar project in Illinois,"Scout Clean Energy, a Boulder, Colorado-based renewable energy developer, owner and operator announced the acquisition of the utility-scale Blue Sky Solar project from developer Renewable Energy Systems (RES). Just last week Scout announced it acquired the 112 MW Stockton Lake Solar Farm, a southwest Missouri project developed by Azimuth Renewables. That project is valued at about $120 million.
The Blue Sky project is one of the largest solar projects approved to date in the PJM regional transmission organization, which coordinates wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia.
“Blue Sky further diversifies our fleet across wind, solar and storage,” said Michael Rucker, CEO and founder of Scout Clean Energy. “Scout will close out 2021 with over 12,000 MWdc in our development pipeline and more than 1,200 MWdc of renewable projects in operation across the United States.”
Blue Sky received unanimous approval for a special use permit with Grundy County in December 2020, under the established Grundy County Solar Ordinance. RES began land acquisition and interconnection studies on the site in 2018.  The project is expected to receive its full interconnection agreement in the third quarter of 2022.
The plans call for the installation of a 369 MWdc solar facility to be located on 2,700 acres of land near Morris, Illinois in Grundy County, IL. The Blue Sky facility is scheduled to begin commercial operations in 2024. Upon reaching commercial operations, Blue Sky is expected to provide an estimated 585,000 MW hours of carbon-free, renewable electricity to the PJM grid each year, enough to power over 67,000 Illinois homes. While only about 8% of Illinois’ power supply comes from renewables, the state has a goal of reaching at least 25% of renewable energy by 2025.
Scout reports that it expects to invest over $400 million to bring the Blue Sky project through construction and into operations and will support over twenty new jobs in the ongoing operations phase.
The project has a finalized and executed Property Tax Abatement Agreement in place with all taxing jurisdictions in Grundy County. It is estimated that the county taxing jurisdictions will receive $36.3 million in tax revenue over the life of the project, including $25.4 million slated to the local school district alone.
Scout is a portfolio company of Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners,  a specialist investment manager focused exclusively on renewables, storage and grid support infrastructure and operational asset management in the U.S., U.K., and Australia.

The preferred stock investment, if converted, would represent a minority stake in GameChange. In addition to capital investment, Koch and GameChange are exploring further synergies across Koch Industries, including KBX, a global transportation, logistics, and technology arm, and Koch Engineered Solutions.
GameChange Solar has demonstrated steady growth since founding in 2012 and is currently ranked the third largest solar tracker company in the U.S., and sixth globally in 2020 by Wood Mackenzie.
KSP’s strategy diverged from Koch Industries historic resistance to the proliferation of solar. In 2016, Koch-brothers-backed groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council led state-level policy fights against PV. In Arizona, Nevada, and especially Florida, the group had success in pushing rate hikes and fees for residential solar customers.
Now, KSP said it is focused on energy transformations as one of its core verticals, making investments in in companies met with strong tailwinds that are disrupting the industry. Recently, the investment arm announced investments in the battery value chain, energy storage, and infrastructure.
GameChange and KSP said the investment will fuel further develop margin-enhancing balance of system solutions, including a new 2P tracker technology, a fixed tilt system, and advanced tracker software.
Citi acted as sole placement agent and strategic advisor, and Goodwin Procter served as legal counsel to GameChange. Jones Day acted as legal counsel to Koch.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/30/solar-in-winter-mitigating-risk-of-environmental-damage-to-solar-panels/,"GUEST POST,INSURANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,"DECEMBER 30, 2021",Solar in winter: Mitigating risk of environmental damage to solar panels,"Tax incentives, profit of power buyback programs, and ever-rising electrical bills help justify the cost of solar panel installations for home and business owners. Cost-benefit analysis and the return on “solar investment” look attractive on paper over a 20-year term; however, the underlying risks of roof-mounted solar panels are typically not well known to owners and insurance companies.
Some of the risks involved with solar installations can be especially severe in areas of North America that experience very cold temperatures and cold and ice in the winter. Solar arrays placed on roofs that are not structurally sound may cause roof collapse or water intrusion. Solar panels are subject to great fluctuations in temperature, moisture exposure, and freeze-thaw cycles. Direct exposure to the outdoor environment accelerates wear and tear and increases the likeliness of component failure. Because there is currently no uniform standard in North America to provide guidance for the structural design, installation, and maintenance of solar panels, the risks vary case by case depending on the project characteristics including size, location, and installation approach.
For residential properties certain risks arising from rooftop solar panels such as damage caused by peril (e.g., fire, windstorm, and hail) may be covered under a standard home policy since they are typically considered as part of the property. However, for commercial buildings the business interruption loss resulting from solar panel failure may not be covered under a standard policy. Hence, commercial buildings are typically at a potentially greater risk of damage as a result of roof-mounted solar panels than residential buildings, although statistical studies in this area are limited.
Solar farms share similar environmental risks with roof-mounted solar panels, e.g., hail, freeze-thaw, and wind damage. However, they are exposed to additional losses such as frost heave, foundation failures, and significant movements due to variation in soil moisture or flooding. Solar farm development can pose a risk of wildfire to an extended area although there are certain ways to mitigate such risk. Given the amount of required land for a solar farm, aesthetics, proximity to residential areas, and the potential impact on wildlife risk can also be concerns during solar farm development.
Many engineering standards prescribe consideration of ice load for ice-sensitive structures. ASCE 7 defines ice-sensitive structures as “structures for which the effect of an atmospheric icing load (i.e., freezing rain) governs the design of a portion or the entire structure.” For structures such as steel power towers, guyed masts, ski lifts, etc., radial layers of ice can form around the structural elements which elevates their weight, internal stresses, and wind-exposed faces. As previously discussed, there is no generally acceptable structural standard for the design of solar panels. However, forensic experience and site inspections conducted after ice storms showed that solar racks can be categorized as ice-sensitive structures. This not only affects the design of solar racks (supporting frames) but can change the ultimate load applied on the supporting structures/ foundation system.
PV systems are typically designed for a lifespan of 20-25 years; however, in cold regions the effective life expectancy of ground-mounted systems may be shorter due to some aggressive environmental conditions. Frost heave may affect the power generation and even stability of solar racks. In sub-zero temperatures, water in the soil freezes, and the volume of the soil around the footings, e.g., micro piles, increases. This results in upward movement of the solar racks. Depending on the type of the soil, this cyclic frost-heave movement can occur at a rate ranging from 1/64” to 3/4” of an inch per day for an embedded foundation in certain weather conditions. The risk of frost-heave is higher in clay and silt and lower in sand and gravel, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
Frost heave result in structural deflection and changes in the angle of solar panels. Non-uniform deflections of the footing system may cause failure or deformation of connections, racking systems, disconnection of conductors, and/or grounding in the frozen soil. Proper design of PV systems for possible impact of frost heave can reduce the risk of damages. For instance, the footings or micro piles can be designed under the frost line per the building codes recommendation; however, determining the uplift force by frost-heave on piles is challenging although 15 psi is a typically recommended value. Nonetheless the piles can be pushed out of the ground even if driven under the frost line.
Gravity load
Mechanically attached PV systems on sloped residential roofs typically weigh 2-4 pounds per square foot. This is not a considerable amount of weight as an intact well-designed roof is expected to withstand this additional load with limited or no modification. However, alteration in structural systems or loads of an existing building may require code upgrades that may affect the original design of the building due to more stringent requirements. Gravity loads of ballasted PV systems on flat roofs are considerable and may impose an additional 5-30 pounds per square foot on the roof framing for which a detailed structural analysis is required.
The main challenge for both methods of installation is that the weight of solar panels is not uniformly distributed on the roof and may have critical local effects on certain structural elements. If detailed drawings for the location of arrays are not produced, the actual loads on the roof will differ from the design loads as repositioning of solar arrays on the roof in the construction stage is likely.
Solar panels on a sloped roof are attached to the roof framing using mechanical fasteners. For existing buildings, this means that numerous holes must be drilled into the roofing system. The anchor holes are typically sealed to prevent water leakage into the building. However, the performance of the seals is a factor of installation accuracy and long-term behavior of the sealant material’s exposure to environmental elements. Vibration of the panels due to wind forces, as well as thermal expansion/contraction cycles, may result in seal breaks and water intrusion.
On flat roofs, solar racks may disturb the drainage path of water to the roof drains depending on their supporting configuration. Ballasted solar racks are equally spaced in parallel rows on the roof and may result in rainwater or snow melt accumulation between the modules. Water ponding can occur in these strip regions which may lead to accelerated delamination, cracking, and sagging of the roof and, ultimately, water intrusion to the building.
Installation of solar panels on flat or sloped roofs may alter the roof geometry and its capacity, especially when factoring in exposure to environmental loads.  Snow load, ice load, wind load (plus wind on ice), additional dead load, water ponding, drainage obstruction, and water intrusion not only influence the structural design of buildings but may also affect their long-term functionality.
The risk of damage to buildings with roof-mounted solar panels is simply higher due to the presence of the panels. Insurers may unknowingly bear a considerable portion of this risk, and the owners may not be aware of the risk exposure. Lack of a uniform engineering standard, which includes all aspects of the design and installation—particularly for flat roofs—adds more complexity to the liability arising from the solar panels.
Movement of footing as a result of frost-heave may lead to permanent damage to the solar rack and power generation. Wind damage to solar farms is likely resulting from the complexity of the wind design and the effect of vortex shedding that may impose an excessive uplift load on the panels.
Simply put, the design of solar farms or roof-mounted solar panels is a multi-faceted problem that should be assessed by qualified engineers and insurers should know if the property includes roof-mounted solar panels to consider the potential risks.

Indeed, it has been calculated that buildings account for 32% of energy use and 19% of energy-related greenhouse gases in the form of heating, cooling, lighting, appliances, and machinery.
In addition to the predicted billions of square meters of space that will be built across the world over the next decade, most developments standing today will still be around in 2050. Thus, retrofitting existing structures is seen as a key sustainability target.
Urban solar: Solar and energy storage have a fundamental role to play, particularly when it comes to cooling and heating and, due to their increasingly small costs, for low-income households struggling with high energy bills.
Under one roof: pv magazine looks at the progress being made to green the world’s cities. This article focuses on Europe’s solar plans and current achievements, specifically in heating and cooling, rooftop solar, and building-integrated PV.
Independent action: The city of Ithaca, New York – located 180 miles from Manhattan – has adopted a Green New Deal, in line with its aims to offset all carbon emissions by 2030. It is implementing private equity programs and net-zero building mandates to get there. Ryan Kennedy reports.
Powerful equation to expand C&I: Big rooftop PV systems on factories, warehouses, and public buildings need not be limited by ownership issues nor local grid capacity claims Australian innovator EleXsys Energy. The company is maxing out an Ikea in Adelaide, Australia, with solar and storage. And it claims its smart technology can allow the same to be done elsewhere.
Prioritizing electrification: The urgency to decarbonize the building sector has caught global attention in the lead-up to the COP26 summit, commencing on Oct. 31. Wood Mackenzie’s Ben Hertz-Shargel says that success will require a two-pronged strategy of massively electrifying building heat over the coming decade, while also investing in technologies that can pick up future heating demand if the grid cannot handle it.
Up to code for decarbonization: The International Energy Agency predicts that India will record the world’s fastest growth in energy consumption from buildings through 2040. The energy demand could create a big market for solar installers and equipment providers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector. While building codes now include provisions for renewable energy integration, effective implementation will be key to ensuring compliance, reports Uma Gupta.
Building a new policy environment: Since the beginning of 2021, all new buildings constructed in the European Union must be “nearly” zero energy. This is a complex task requiring synergies among various stakeholders and technologies. Ilias Tsagas provides insight into the drivers and challenges toward this set goal and shines a light on solar’s most significant role.
Electrons to replace molecules in US homes: Policy developments are likely to define decarbonization efforts and rooftop solar deployment in U.S. homes. Proposed legislation at the federal level is looking to accelerate electrification, while net metering developments continue at the state level. pv magazine USA’s Ryan Kennedy provides an update.
BIPV no refuge: Deployment in the building-integrated PV segment is accelerating, and so too are the number of solar products available to architects and developers. And while BIPV had long been the segment in which an array of thin-film technologies could shine, they are now in increasingly stiff competition with crystalline silicon rivals.
Headroom on heat pumps: Heat pumps can now achieve sufficiently high flow temperatures to operate most heating systems, even in older buildings. They are not yet highly efficient, but new refrigerants are expected to provide a remedy. This presents a number of challenges, but German researchers and industry participants are working on solutions to harness the power of heat pumps to keep people warm throughout the year.
Check out the coverage from our UP Initiative Q1 theme: Agri-PV from Dec. 27, Q2 theme: Workers’ rights on Dec. 28, and Q3 theme: Sustainable electricity and corporates’ critical solar role on Dec. 20.
In Q1 2022, we will turn our attention to the rise of e-mobility and how it can complement the renewable energy transition. Specifically, we will examine the role electric vehicles, trains, and two- and three-wheelers can play in greening the electricity grid.
About the UP Initiative
In 2019, pv magazine pledged to place the issue of sustainability in the solar and energy storage industries at the heart of our reporting and events via the UP initiative. In addition to running quarterly themes, which examine key issues, we are also holding webinars on topics like supply chain transparency; publishing whitepapers on issues like green finance, and have ramped up our general reporting on a host of other sustainability issues. Our global series of roundtable events have also helped the initiative step UP even further.

The specific areas identified in this solicitation include: within Colorado – Antonito Southeast Solar Energy Zone (9,712 acres), DeTilla Gulch Solar Energy Zone (1,064 acres), and Los Mogotes East Solar Energy Zone (2,650 acres); within Nevada – Dry Lake Valley North Solar Energy Zone (25,069 acres), Gold Point Solar Energy Zone (4,596 acres), and Millers Solar Energy Zone (16,534 acres); and within New Mexico – Afton Solar Energy Zone (29,964 acres).
The solar energy zones were previously analyzed and designated in the BLM’s 2012 Western Solar Plan, which was the product of extensive stakeholder involvement, including conservation organizations, state and local governments, Tribal Nations, solar energy industry representatives, and cooperating federal agencies.
“Scaling-up support for responsible renewable energy production is one of the BLM’s top priorities as we work across the Department of the Interior to lead the way in creating a clean energy economy in the United States,” said BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning. “Today’s request for interest in these solar energy zones is an opportunity to expand the opportunities for the industry as we work to do our part to meet America’s energy needs.”
The solicitation builds on the announcement made earlier in December that BLM had identified 1,400 square miles of public land, which could support 100 GW of solar. BLM also approved the construction of the Arica and Victory Pass solar projects in California. The two have a planned combined capacity of 465 MW solar, 400 MW battery energy storage. The projects represent a $689 million investment and an estimated $5.9 million in annual operational economic benefit.
