The first fruits of US President Joe Biden‘s Inflation Reduction Act have already been witnessed, with Swiss solar module and production line manufacturer Meyer Burger ramping up its solar panel production plans.
The heterojunction module maker cited the U.S. climate change and health care package as one of the reasons it is accelerating its manufacturing plans, along with a big module order from New York-based developer DE Shaw Renewable Investments. Publishing its first-half results on its website this week, Meyer Burger said the extension of the Investment Tax Credit for solar manufacturing in the United States – which was part of the Inflation Reduction Act – will be worth $0.07 times the nominal power output of each Meyer Burger module produced stateside.
DE Shaw has placed an order for 3.75 GW of the European manufacturer’s panels, to be delivered from 2024 to 2029. It will pay a “substantial annual down payment” to help Meyer Burger fund the production capacity required to meet such delivery requirements.
However, the European company said the U.S. tax incentive and customer deposits will not be sufficient to finance a doubling of its manufacturing capacity to 3 GW per year. The business, headquartered in Gwatt, Switzerland, said it would need a further CHF 250 million ($262.3 million) to add 1.5 GW of production lines at its base in Thalheim, Germany, and 1 GW at its location in Goodyear, Arizona. Details of the fundraising effort will be announced to shareholders “in the next months,” the company said.
Traditionally a solar production equipment supplier, Meyer Burger’s decision to venture into module production has come at a cost to its bottom line as it ramps up its panel-making facilities. First-half revenue leapt from CHF 18 million in the first six months of last year to CHF 56.7 million this time around, with Meyer Burger stating that it was successfully passing on rising input costs to customers.
That led to a widening in net six-month losses, from the CHF 37.2 million shed in January-June 2021 to CHF 41 million. The investment required for module production has seen the company’s cash balance fall from CHF 247 million at the end of last year to CHF 186 million at the end of June. The good news is that DE Shaw has an option to expand its order to up to 5 GW of high-efficiency modules and to extend the length of the supply deal.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/18/solar-industry-eyes-50-gw-of-manufacturing-capacity-by-the-end-of-this-decade/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 18, 2022",Solar industry eyes 50 GW of manufacturing capacity by the end of this decade,"Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), an energized solar industry is aiming high and envisioning a future where the United States has a robust domestic energy supply chain. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a roadmap to achieving this goal, with a target of 50 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity by 2030. 
The United States has been plagued by numerous pressures threatening the supply of solar modules imported from overseas. With decarbonization and climate goals under threat due to this shortage, the U.S. is now turning to boosting domestic manufacturing to power the energy transition. 
The Department of Energy (DOE) said, “Greatly expanding U.S. PV manufacturing could mitigate global supply chain challenges and lead to tremendous benefits for the climate as well as for U.S. workers, employers and the economy.” DOE concluded in a study that U.S. production could reach 10 GW in two years, 15 GW in three years and 25 GW in five years on its path to 50 GW annual production.
Titled Catalyzing American Solar Manufacturing, the report explores how the U.S. can move from its current state of limited production to a full-fledged, economy-powering domestic energy supply chain. 
Currently, the U.S. has capacity to produce materials like metallurgical grade silicon, polysilicon, steel, aluminum, resins, racking and mountings. However, there are significant gaps in the supply chain. United States currently has no domestic solar ingot, wafer or cell manufacturing capacity and only modest capacity to produce solar modules, inverters and trackers, said SEIA. As a result, these segments must be targeted on the path to 50 GW.
The SEIA report said with the right application of new IRA incentives the U.S. should be on track to meet, or even exceed, the 50 GW goal across all segments of the solar supply chain. 
Domestic manufacturers should focus on building downstream production first and backfilling components with imports while upstream domestic production is built out, said the report. While scaling domestic module capacity will take 2-3 years, it will be 3-5 years before there is significant domestic manufacturing capacity for ingots, wafers and cells.
SEIA said investments in manufacturing should be timed intelligently and with awareness of demand. As an example, scaling solar ingot and wafer operations before new domestic cell capacity comes online could potentially strand new investments. The importance of domestic raw material supplies, and funding for related environmental impact assessments also cannot be overlooked. For example, building new domestic solar glass capacity will significantly improve the cost competitiveness of U.S. module assembly. 
U.S. manufacturers must create in-demand products, by selling at a competitive price and delivering quality goods. This cost competitiveness will likely only be achieved at large-scale, which requires significant upfront investment, said the report. 
Following the IRA, groundbreakings for large-scale manufacturing facilities will likely commence in 2023, and the first new factories supported by these policies will begin production in 2025, or as early as 2024 for trackers, racking and aggressive inverter and module manufacturing investments.
A successful buildout will require a robust U.S. workforce. The report said this will depends upon collaboration between companies, government agencies and higher education institutions; to advance solar-specific technical training and college-to-career programs. Diversity, equity, inclusion and justice should be central to the workforce strategy of the energy transition. 
SEIA offered nine pitfalls to avoid on this path:

The fund reserves $7 billion for low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies, including rooftop solar. States, municipalities and Tribal governments, as well as green banks, may compete for these funds.
The remaining $20 billion is available to green banks for direct or indirect investments in low- and zero-emission projects. Of that amount, $8 billion is reserved for low-income and disadvantaged communities. Indirect investments would establish new entities, or support existing entities, including community- and low-income-focused lenders and capital providers, that provide financial assistance for projects that reduce or avoid emissions.
Green banks, as defined by the IRA, are funded by public or charitable contributions, rather than deposits, and provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for “rapid deployment” of projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.

The Coalition for Green Capital announced that it plans to compete for funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, along with a network of state and local green banks and community development financial institutions. The coalition’s CEO Reed Hundt said that the American Green Bank Consortium, with 23 members in 17 states and the District of Columbia, “has already invested $2.6 billion of their own funds,” along with nearly $9 billion in private sector capital, “in green projects that provide financial returns while maintaining extremely low default rates.” He said the consortium has $20 billion worth of pending projects.
The Connecticut Green Bank, the nation’s first state-level green bank, lauded the passage of the IRA and said that since its founding in 2011 it has mobilized nearly $2.5 billion, “creating thousands of jobs, reducing energy costs for thousands of families, businesses, and communities, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”
The Coalition for Green Capital said that national legislation to fund green banks was first introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2009.
Under the IRA, funds will be available for disbursement from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to green banks and governments until September 30, 2024.

The DC-Optimized energy management system connects the inverter and the battery on the DC side, thus eliminating power conversions that are typical in many battery coupled systems. SolarEdge estimates that this can add up to 10 days of saved energy for every year of use. The DC-Optimized system also enables multi-day battery backup, which reduces dependence on the grid.
The system includes:
Homeowners can use the mySolarEdge app to control, schedule, and track their energy usage and savings, which will take into account external factors such as weather events and rising utility rates. The app has a Weather Guard feature that is designed to automatically alert the system when a storm is detected, and the system is triggered to charge the battery before the storm hits.
SolarEdge reports that the system simplifies the installation and commissioning process for installers because the DC-Optimized system simplifies design, reduces the need for main panel upgrades, and uses wireless plug-and-play connectivity, eliminating the need to wire communication cables between components.
“SolarEdge Home is designed to meet homeowner needs for larger PV systems, more applications, and seamless control through a single app. For installers, SolarEdge Home helps form higher-value customer relationships while minimizing operation and installation costs,” said Peter Mathews, North America general manager.
Homeowners can also opt to add features and capabilities to the SolarEdge Home ecosystem as their home energy needs evolve and change.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/18/jacks-solar-garden-blends-agriculture-solar-energy-and-community/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 18, 2022","Jack’s Solar Garden blends agriculture, solar energy, and community","On the edges of Boulder, Colorado sits Jack’s Solar Garden, a community garden that grows crops and local pollinator supporting plants. This community garden is far from ordinary, as it houses a 1.2 MW solar array that shares the same land as the crops below.
Jack’s Solar Garden is the largest commercial agrivoltaics research site in the United States. The 24-acre plot is part of a research study being conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Colorado State University, and the University of Arizona to understand the microclimates created by the panels and how they impact vegetation growth.
The electricity generated by the single-axis tracker mounted array is enough to power 300 average Colorado homes annually. The power is sold to various subscribers via utility Xcel Energy’s Solar Rewards Community program, where customers receive a percentage of the net metered production as credits against their monthly electric bills. Fifty residents, five local businesses, and two local governments subscribe to the plant. Jack’s Solar Garden donates 2% of its power production to low-income households through the Boulder County Housing Authority.
The solar array is designed to optimize output while enabling agricultural workers and researchers to operate under the modules. Torque tubes were elevated to six to eight feet, with different heights used to study the microclimate impact on the crops. During construction, care was taken to leave the long-standing brome and alfalfa forage in the area relatively unharmed. Metal mesh was attached beneath the solar panels to help protect people within the solar array from electrical wires.
The farm partners with Audubon Rockies, which planted over 3,000 perennials around the perimeter of the solar array; Sprout City Farms, the main cultivator of crops beneath the solar panels; and the Colorado Agrivoltaic Learning Center, which provides on-site educational opportunities for community groups to learn more about agrivoltaics. The garden also offers an annual stipend to a local artist on the firm to engage the community in their preferred art form.
Jack’s Solar Garden’s research projects include a crop production and irrigation study to determine crop yields at different locations within the solar array with varying amounts of sunlight, shade, and allotted irrigation.
NREL is also performing pollinator habitat research to measure the growth and performance of pollinator habitat seed mixes and evaluate different cost-effective vegetation-establishment techniques. Additionally, NREL is conducting pasture grass research to measure the growth and performance of dryland pasture grass seed mixes with different cost-effective seeding methods.
Colorado State University is leading two research projects, including a grassland ecology and physiology study, seeking to understand the health and functions of grassland ecosystems within a solar array by studying light patterns, soil moisture retention, plant production and physiology, forage quality, and grassland resilience. It is also leading an ecosystems services research project, in which the researchers will evaluate multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, erosion control, pollinator habitat, weed suppression, and microclimate moderation, provided by native vegetation and introduced pasture species within a solar array. 
These research projects were made possible by the participation of the Kominek family, owners of Jack’s Solar Garden. The Kominek family said local regulations that helped launch the project included Colorado State legislation allowing for locally owned and interconnected community solar gardens as well as a Renewable Portfolio Standard that enables locally owned community solar gardens to generate 1.5x renewable energy credits (RECs) per MWh. Additionally, the City of Boulder and Boulder County contain building codes requiring net zero for new homes over 5,000 sq. Ft., and Boulder County’s Land Use Code provides solar array projects on prime farmland with a special land-use review process.
A study by Oregon State University showed wide-scale installation of agrivoltaic systems could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said.
Agrivoltaics provide a “rare chance for true synergy: more food, more energy, lower water demand, lower carbon emissions, and more prosperous rural communities,” said Chad Higgins, an associate professor in Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences and the senior author of the paper published in the journal Sustainability.
The paper finds that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland.
The AgriSolar Clearinghouse is a resource available to those looking to learn more about and get involved in the practice of agrivoltaics.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/18/energysage-marketplace-intel-report-points-to-changes-in-solar-pricing-preferences/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 18, 2022","EnergySage Marketplace Intel Report points to changes in solar pricing, preferences","EnergySage released its fifteenth “Solar Marketplace Intel Report”. The semiannual report looks at quotes sent in the past year to shoppers on EnergySage.com and analyzes data points to look for trends and prices in buying solar panels and batteries from solar companies in 39 states and Washington, DC.
The three key insights from this latest report, which can be downloaded for free in its entirety at energysage.com/data, include price increases, shifts in market share, and the increasing acquisition of energy storage.
Solar prices increase again
For the second half year in a row, solar prices increased on the EnergySage Marketplace, this time jumping 3.4% to $2.77 per Watt; a price not seen since 2020. Despite increasing prices, the average quoted system size remained relatively steady, dropping from 10.3 kilowatts (kW) in H2 2021 to 10.2 kW in H1 2022. As a result, the payback period increased from an average of 8.7 years to 9.1 years.
Geographically the list of the top five solar states remained the same and four of the five (excluding North Carolina) witnessed median quoted prices on EnergySage below the national median price. Pricing in California was similar to the national distribution, with most of the quotes coming in between $2.25 and $3.00/W. Texas, Florida, and Arizona all had solar pricing distributions below the national distribution– at least two-thirds of quotes were between $2.00 and $2.75/W. The highest prices were found in Minnesota at $3.64/W and the lowest were in Arizona at $2.25/W.
Looking at system sizes, the wattage of the most frequently quoted panels increased from 360/370 Watts in 2021 to 390/400 Watts in the first half of 2022. About one-third of quoted solar panels on EnergySage in the first half of 2022 were rated between 390 and 400 Watts, compared to 360 and 370 Watts in the second half of 2021. Importantly, half of the quotes in the first half of 2022 were for 390 Watt panels, up from 16% in the second half of 2021.
Shifts in market share of modules, inverters
In the first half of 2022, the top four most quoted module brands jockeyed into new positions. REC overtook Panasonic for the number one most quoted brand, and Qcells took spot number three from Silfab Solar.
Overall, market share consolidation decreased slightly as the top three panel brands dropped from a combined share of 66% of quotes in the second half of 2021 to 59% in the first half of 2022.
Size of systems range widely in different states and different parts of the country. For example, in California, average quoted system size is about 8 kW, whereas in Arkansas they are 14.55 kW. However, half of the states analyzed were within one kW of the national average for the third half-year in a row.

On the inverter front, Enphase remained the most quoted brand despite losing 4% of its market share. As for battery storage, Enphase was again the most frequently quoted option–offered in 45% of all storage quotes–while Generac’s market share grew the largest at 7% from the second half of 2021 to the first half of 2022. Within that same time period, LG Energy Solution’s Marketplace share fell 10% on EnergySage.
In the first half of 2022, the difference in pricing between panel and inverter pairings dropped. For example, the difference between quotes for Enphase inverters compared to SolarEdge inverters was only 3.4%, down from 4.2% in H2 2021.  SunPower equipment continues to hold a premium price, as systems with SunPower solar panels and SunPower inverters were 33.3% more expensive than the least expensive pairing Qcells paired with a SolarEdge inverter.
Storage on the upswing, policy drives decisions
The median storage price increased by $1/kWh or 0.04%, which did not deter shoppers from buying. In the first half of 2022, a little over 17% of shoppers purchased a battery with their solar system, up 1.5% to 15.5% in the second half of 2021. The median quoted system size was 10.1 kWh in nine out of the 10 states, with the quotes ranging from about $12,000 to $16,000.
Why do solar shoppers buy storage? The single most cited reason was saving on utility rates. On a geographic basis, shoppers in Tennessee were most likely to receive a storage quote (94%), followed by Georgia (85%). Why? Neither of these states have net metering policies.
As for storage market share, EnergySage offered quotes on 20 battery storage brands in the first half of 2022. Enphase tops the charts, offered in 45% of all quotes, but Generac’s share grew the most—from 2% to 9%. This was the first time that the SolarEdge Energy Bank was featured in the data, and it accounted for 5% of the quotes. LG Energy’s share fell 10% in the same time period.

It was also noted that cost does not determine market position of storage. For example, the seven brands that were quoted below the $1,000 per kWh stored threshold in the first half of 2022 accounted for only 1.1% of the storage quotes. These brands include: BYD Battery Box, SimpliPhi Power, Homegrid Energy, Tigo Energy, FNS Power, Lion Energy and Q CELLS. On the other hand, Enphase, which received the highest number of quotes, is also the highest cost option.
