The RFPs solicit bids to buy solar energy resources of up to 1,350 MW and wind energy resources of up to 2,800 MW. Proposals may include a battery energy storage system as an option. The optional BESS must be no larger than 40% of the nameplate solar energy resource, and be sized for 4 and/or 8 hours of capacity.
In addition, the solar energy resources must be a minimum of 50 MW; wind energy resources must be a minimum of 100 MW. The resources must interconnect to the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and the solar resources must be in Oklahoma.
Proposals will be due on Jan. 13, 2022. Proposals selected from the two RFPs are subject to appropriate regulatory approvals.

Development work has been completed, and four of the nine are ready for operation. The portfolio is located across five different counties and three utility territories.
In Anne Arundel County, within Baltimore Gas and Electric’s (BG&E) service territory, are the 2 MW Checkerspot installation, which has already been completed, the 2.8 MW Bathian installation, and the 2.8 MW Patuxent project.
In Baltimore County, also within BG&E’s service territory, are the 2.4 MW Sassafras project and the 2.8 MW Trillium project. Rounding out the BG&E-area projects are Howard County’s 2.8 MW Metalmark project and the 2.6 MW Viceroy installation.
In Prince George’s County, in PEPCO’s service area, is the 2.8 MW Monarch solar project. The portfolio also includes Dorchester County, within Delmarva’s service area, with the 2 MW Glassywing solar project.
Standard Solar funded construction and will own and operate the projects long-term. OneEnergy partnered with landowners to site, permit, and design the projects. CCE is responsible for the customer acquisition to sign up Maryland residents.
The 24 MW portfolio is projected to benefit more than 5,000 Maryland households annually through community solar subscriptions, as each project is operating under the recently-strengthened Maryland Community Solar program.
In September, regulators unanimously voted to expand the capacity of the state’s community solar program as well as improve access for LMI customer participation in the state’s Community Solar Pilot Program. The expansion also changed development regulations, allowing community solar projects to be built on clean-fill construction sites, transforming previously unusable industrial locations into clean solar energy generation sites.
Earlier, Standard Solar, OneEnergy and CCE hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Checkerspot Community Solar site in Tracy’s Landing.
All the projects are “dual-use,” in the sense that they will function as solar farms and pollinator habitats.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/17/solar-could-account-for-20-of-all-u-s-generation-by-2050-eia-says/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021","Solar could account for 20% of all U.S. generation by 2050, EIA says","Solar power accounted for 3% of U.S. electricity generation from all sources in 2020. Now, the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that solar generation will make up 14% of the U.S. total in 2035 and 20% in 2050.
The numbers include electricity generated from both utility-scale (those of 1 MWt or more generating capacity) and small-scale (less than 1 MW) solar facilities in the electric power, residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.

EIA said that increases in small-scale solar, particularly in the commercial and residential sectors, drove much of the early growth in U.S. solar electricity net generation. In 2011, small-scale solar accounted for 68% of total U.S. solar electricity net generation. However, utility-scale solar generation increased substantially during the past decade as average construction costs for solar power plants fell.
In its long-term projections, EIA said the electric power sector will continue to produce the most solar generation, increasing from 68% of total solar generation in 2020 to 78% in 2050. The growing share of utility-scale generation is due in part to the availability of a 10% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) after 2023; in contrast, the ITC for small-scale solar has expired.
In one scenario in which natural gas prices were modeled to be higher than in baseline assumptions, EIA said that solar generation can reach as much as 25% of total generation by mid-century. In another case in which installed costs of renewables are lower than in the baseline scenario, solar generation was forecast to make up 27% of total generation by 2050.
Last spring, BloombergNEF published a forecast that said solar was poised to see five years of record-setting large-scale capacity additions. It predicted that the U.S. more than 20 GW of large scale solar each year. It said that both large- and small-scale solar will grow during the years that tax credit extensions are available.
Over the coming decade, customer-sited solar capacity were forecast to add on average more than 8 GW a year. Over one-third of all new systems were expected to be built in California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/17/tool-sifts-data-to-pinpoint-prime-ci-sites-for-solar-and-energy-storage/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 17, 2021",Tool sifts data to pinpoint prime C&I sites for solar and energy storage,"Commercial real estate firm CBRE Group and Altus Power developed a tool to identify on-site solar and energy storage  opportunities to help building owners and occupiers meet their energy needs and reduce their carbon footprints.
The tool uses CBRE’s commercial real estate data platform and analytics to identify and model opportunities for commercial and industrial properties, community solar projects, and electric vehicle charging stations.
The real estate firm already collect data on more than 100 billion square feet of commercial real estate. Data include rooftop sizes and energy consumption information.
Using satellite imagery, the tool models building energy demand and potential power generation, and also identifies locations where solar energy and battery storage can be deployed.
A unit of CBRE plans a business combination with Altus Power that is expected to result in Altus becoming a publicly traded company.
In August, the California Energy Commission voted to require, starting in 2023, that solar and battery energy storage be included on many new commercial buildings, as well as high-rise residential constructions. Commercial buildings covered by the plan include offices, hotels, medical buildings, clinics, restaurants, schools, theaters, grocery stores, retail, auditoriums, and convention centers.
And earlier in November, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law bill A3352, which requires all new warehouses in the state to be built as solar-ready buildings. When first passed by the state legislature earlier this year, the bill defined a warehouse as any building 10,000 square feet or larger and that primarily is used to store goods for resale. That definition changed to 100,000 square feet or more.
Now, new warehouses built on or after July 1, 2022 will need to be optimized for solar. If the structure is intended to use hot water, then it also must allow for the installation of a solar water heating system.
