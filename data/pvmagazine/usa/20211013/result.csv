That’s according to Paul Wormser, vice president of technology at CEA, a solar PV and battery storage quality assurance, supply chain management, and engineering services firm.
Wormser said that much of the solar industry was surprised in late June when U.S. Customs and Border Protection action targeted a little-known player far upstream in the module supply chain with a Withhold Release Order (WRO). That order stemmed from what customs officials said were credible reports of the use of forced labor.
Both the House and Senate had taken action during 2020 related to forced labor allegations coming from the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China. A paper known as The Sheffield Report laid out damning details. And the Solar Energy Industries Association warned its member companies in late December of potential problems in the industry’s supply chain. (Read “Solar companies pledge to oppose forced labor in the supply chain.”)
So, although the WRO was not unexpected, its focus largely was a surprise.
That’s because Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., the focus of the WRO, is far up the supply chain at the raw metal stage of polysilicon production. The order instructed personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
U.S. solar players had generally expected Customs enforcement action someplace in the production midstream. Before the June 24 WRO announcement, there had been little need for solar companies to know where their suppliers’ suppliers had sourced their silicon metal.
“Customs shocked the world by focusing on Hoshine,” said Wormser. “There was not a single person expecting that.” He said that to date, no modules that have been detained at U.S. ports have been released.
As part of its work within the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Patrol enforces forced labor prohibitions through Section 1307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1307). That Act, which was passed into law back when Herbert Hoover was president, bars the import of any product that was mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced labor, including by forced or indentured child labor.
What took the solar sector by surprise was the decision to target the WRO at Hoshine and its role at the very start of the solar supply chain. For their part, Chinese officials deny the existence of forced labor in the country. As a result, Chinese anti-sanctions laws penalize domestic companies for following U.S. regulations that are opposed to Chinese law. In this case, China’s denial of forced labor makes it difficult if not impossible for related supply chain inquiries to move forward.
“It’s virtually impossible to prove there is no forced labor” in the supply chain, Wormser said.
Now, CEA is raising a warning flag that similar scrutiny could be trained on energy storage technologies. To be sure, no such action has yet been taken by Customs and Border Protection. But the complexity of the energy storage supply chain may be greater owing to the sheer number of components involved and the wide range of raw materials that are mined, refined, and processed.
Shawn Shaw, director of energy storage at CEA, said that China accounts for around 13% of global lithium mineral supply, but produces around 70% of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, with most headed for export. South Korea also is a large battery producer and exporter.
Once manufactured, an energy storage device may contain hundreds of individual components. If an enforcement action were to take place, importers would need to provide evidence Customs officials to prove that no forced labor was used at any stage of production, including all the way to the mine.
Not surprisingly, lithium supply chain issues are being asked about with more frequency by players in the energy storage sector. So is cobalt, Shaw said. And graphite that is used in anodes “comes from lots of different places” and could come under scrutiny, he said.
From a practical point of view, having greater insight into the supply chain can be a benefit should a product defect or failure occur. The challenges of root cause analysis can be eased somewhat if documentation is available that can point to how a component was fabricated, he said.
Financial institutions that put up money for energy storage projects are aware of the risks that a WRO action may pose. As part of their loan due diligence they may ask challenging questions about product origins, Shaw said. As a result of the lessons learned from the June WRO, supply chains are becoming “more thoughtful,” he said. And he added that supply diversification “is a good idea.” Besides possible trade action, energy storage customers are becoming more attuned to the carbon footprint of their supply chains.
“There’s growing consumer interest in ‘where was my product made’ and ‘how was my product made,'” Wormser said. At a minimum, he said all companies should review and update if necessary their forced labor code of conduct.

The pipeline is in a state that the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) lists as having a cumulative installed large-scale solar capacity of 64.4 MW.
The latest project is a three-site, 125 MW project being developed by utility LG&E KU. Recently approved by the PSC, the project is part of the utility’s Business Solar program. The program partners the utility with institutional, industrial, and commercial customers and enrolls them in a 20-year “Renewable Power Agreement.”

Participants included the University of Kentucky, which will be supplied with 44% of the project’s electricity.

Earlier this year, the PSC gave a green light for a 188 MW project developed by Acciona. That project will sell power into the PJM regional wholesale electricity market via an existing East Kentucky Power Cooperative transmission line.
In March, the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Green Invest program found partners in Facebook and General Motors. The two plan to purchase power generated by a 173 MW solar, 30 MW/120 MWh storage system.
Kentucky’s 815 MW five-year pipeline places it at 36th in terms of development rankings by SEIA, a step up from its cumulative capacity ranking of 47th in the nation.

The discussion flowed to a focus on energy equity, where Solar Energy Industries Association CEO Abigail Ross Hopper was joined by Dana Clare Redden, founder and CEO of Solar Stewards. Redden’s group focuses on energy equity and getting projects built in Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, overcoming the access and financial barriers that have held those communities back.

Redden said that Solar Stewards was born from her experiences in Georgia where she saw the imbalance between those who wanted to see the benefits of clean energy, but couldn’t realize them alone. She equated systemic oppression to bad policy and said that empathy is frequently missing from conversations of equity, when the two are inherently tied.
Hopper and Redden agreed that equity is not only an issue of justice, but of business opportunity. Better policy creates expanded opportunity for individuals to get involved and see the benefits of renewable energy, which means that more business is created. The two also went on to cite multiple studies which show that diverse businesses with diverse leadership are more profitable.
Both also expressed excitement at the solar and greater clean energy industries’ role as job creators in the energy transformation.
“We know how to put up solar panels,” said Hopper. “How do we transform our industry and our economy with this opportunity?”
Before the session closed, Redden highlighted Black Owners of Solar Services (BOSS), a group of peer partners including entrepreneurs, financiers, veterans, attorneys, engineers, contractors, developers, and others, working to combine and leverage their collective power to lead actionable solutions for sustained access to equitable opportunities in clean energy production, distribution, and storage for Black-owned businesses.
“There are a lot of us out here” said Redden. She said that the group’s work aims to dispel the myth that renewable business ownership and leadership are out of reach or inaccessible to BIPOC.
Redden later was joined by John Kemp, senior business developer with Avangrid; Melinda Fischer, manager of generation resource planning with JEA; Ivan Urlaub, chief of strategy and innovation with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association; and moderator Katie Chiles Ottenweller,  Vote Solar’s Southeast director.
The panel focused on thinking outside the box in terms of building and developing a diverse solar workforce, a process which all agreed must start from the top down.

That point was highlighted by Kemp, who offered Avangrid’s vision of building a sustainable workforce, which includes increasing representation in positions of authority, building a community of opportunity, and removing barriers that contribute to non-diverse workplaces.
The forum also recognized the efforts of Student ACES solar boot camp, a training and workforce development branch of ACES, a non-profit organization for former low-income high school athletes in Florida.
The program teaches participants the foundational skills to become workers in the solar industry, while also introducing them to the expectations and operations of the working world, in a way which prepares them for a lifelong career in the solar industry. 
Graduates of the program are guaranteed a job working for Moss Construction, a firm contracted by Florida Power and Light, and offers them careers in installation with a pathway to supervisory and higher positions.

The project is primarily located on 1,800 acres of Evraz Rocky Mountain Steel property in Pueblo. It is one of the largest on-site solar facilities in the U.S. dedicated to a single customer, with more than 750,000 solar panels. The plant recycles scrap metal to produce new steel products, including railroad track.
Kevin Smith, CEO of Lightsource bp, Americas said the project proves that even “hard-to-abate sectors like steel can be decarbonized.”
The Bighorn Solar project is currently generating electricity and is expected to come fully online in November.
Lightsource bp financed, owns, and operates Bighorn Solar and sells the electricity it generates to Xcel Energy under a 20-year power purchase agreement. As part of that arrangement, Evraz will receive energy from Xcel Energy through 2041. The project will enable Xcel Energy to abate 433,770 metric tons of CO2 emissions.
The steel maker is Xcel Energy’s largest retail electric customer in Colorado and one of Pueblo’s largest employers. The deal for fixed-rate power gives EVRAZ the low, predictable electricity prices it needs to stay in Pueblo and invest in its future there, keeping more than 1,000 jobs in the city.

Three solar facilities will be built in the state, covering about 55 acres in total. The arrays are expected to generate 20 million kWh of electricity for public housing authorities in Providence, Newport, Cranston, Smithfield, Warwick, Warren, Bristol, and Lincoln.
The agreement includes guarantees for savings against prevailing electricity rates. Rhode Island has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation, and the project is expected to lead to upwards of $30 million in savings over the next 20 years.
Veolia advised PHARI, and Nautilus was selected by the Board of Commissioners of each housing authority to be sole developer for the community solar projects from start to finish. Veolia, through its SourceOne brand, has been advising PHARI on energy decisions for over ten years. 
As long-term owner of the portfolio, Nautilus will oversee construction, and management and maintenance for 25 to 30 years. Construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2022.
“This was the first remote net-metering project in which a group of individual housing authorities worked together to leverage their buying power,” said Jason Su, structuring associate at Nautilus.
The energy generated from the projects will be fed into the grid of Narragansett Electric Co., a unit of National Grid.

A statement said this is a largely untapped field with potential for advancing the global commercialization of hydrogen as an accessible, affordable, and low-carbon energy commodity.
Shell and its partners—including McDermott’s CB&I Storage Solutions, NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, GenH2, and the University of Houston—plan to demonstrate that a large-scale LH2 tank, with a capacity ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 cubic meters, is both feasible and cost competitive at import and export terminals. Shell and CB&I Storage Solutions will both provide an additional $3 million each, for a total project fund of $12 million.
The consortium will collaborate to develop what they said would be a “technically innovative and economically viable” concept design for the large-scale LH2 storage tank. The group also will engineer and construct a scaled-down demonstration tank to test the design.
The project aims to advance the U.S. as a leader in LH2-based international supply chain development and facilitate the commercialization of both blue and green hydrogen export opportunities.
Shell will lead the project and provide guidance on hydrogen supply chain and safety. CB&I Storage Solutions will provide engineering, design, and LH2 construction storage expertise. GenH2 will design and manufacture a thermal testing device, known as Cryostat-900. NASA will work with GenH2 on novel testing development. The University of Houston will focus on creating detailed thermal models of the proposed insulation systems.
Shell said that the ability to transport hydrogen between countries via pipelines and ships will be a key element of the future energy system.

RatedPower, a Spanish technology company that pioneered software to optimize solar plant development, said it closed a $6 million financing round led by Seaya Ventures, a European venture capital fund and lead investor in unicorns such as Glovo, Wallbox and Cabify, and with participation of U.S. investors.
The investment will be used to drive the company’s international growth with a particular focus on the United States, accelerate the development of new products and functionalities, and “fulfill its mission to become the software and technology ecosystem” for renewables.
RatedPower was founded in 2017 by Andrea Barber, Miguel Angel Torrero, and Juan Romero after identifying the need for a tool that would transform the design and configuration of solar plants into a more automatic, agile, and efficient process. Its pvDesign software identifies the best plant configuration and generates detailed documentation rapidly and automatically.
Andrea Barber told pv magazine Spain that the company currently has customers on five continents. She said the U.S. is “the mecca” of software as a service (SaaS). She said the company will also use the investment to consolidate growth in Europe, with Spain as a spearhead, and strengthen its operations in Latin America and Asia-Pacific.
The new version of pvDesign that RatedPower launched in June calculates the CAPEX and LCOE of PV projects on the fly. The calculation tool is designed to allow customers to define and customize the price databases to get a faster quotation. This, together with an algorithmic model to obtain the estimated energy production of the plant, is intended to make the software a “solid tool for calculating the profitability of photovoltaic plants.”
In the last 12 months, RatedPower has attracted more than 1,300 users on pvDesign – a 150% increase in the use of the platform. The company said its users include Iberdrola, Engie, BayWa, AES, Clenera, Sungrow, Burns & McDonnell, Celsia, Shell, Samsung, and National Grid Renewables.
