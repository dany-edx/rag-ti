In preparation for launch, engineers unfolded the satellite’s five-panel solar wing to test it before it’s sent into space.
While the suite of instruments is impressive, the single 36-foot solar wing, which in orbit will be outstretched at the rear of the satellite, is essential as it will provide the power needed for the mission.
“We are extremely happy to say that the solar wing deployment test went very well. The timely and complete deployment of the large solar wing soon after launch is crucial to the mission,” said ESA’s Mehrdad Rezazad.
To perform the test, each of the five panels were supported by wires. After the launch, the five panels that make up the wing will be held together by ties, which will be cut by a set of thermal knives, thus unfolding the wing behind the satellite.
With the first solar array deployment test successfully completed, the various vibration and thermal-vacuum tests are next.

Arizona-based startup New Use Energy Solutions has unveiled SunTarp, a new line of portable frameless solar PV panels for off-grid and residential applications.
“We found that adhering multiple modules to a custom vinyl tarp allows the user to reconfigure the modules strings to accommodate 12, 24 & 48V off-grid systems all the way up to residential type all-in-one inverters that require over 120 Vdc to charge batteries. ,” the company’s COO, Lee Feliciano, told pv magazine. “Our module provider is US-based Merlin Solar.”
The flexible modules provided by Merlin Solar are based on monocrystalline solar cells with an efficiency of over 25% provided by US manufacturer Sunpower. Their power output ranges from 50 to 150 W and their weight spans from 1.2 to 2.68 kg.
Their open-circuit voltage is between 20.8 and 21.1 V and the short-circuit current is from 3.12 to 9.10 A. The modules can be curved to a maximum 30-degree arc and can be affixed by adhesive or grommets. The junction box is sealed and waterproof. Holes on panels are pre-drilled for fast mounting.
New Use Energy Solutions’ PV array is available in three versions; the TriFold SunTarp array, which combines three solar modules, weighs 6.8 kg and has a power output of 210 W; the 320 W FourFold SunTarp model that integrates four panels and weighs in at 10.8 kg; and the six-module HexFold SunTarp which has a power output of 410 W and has a weight of 20.4 kg.
“They store easily even in the trunk of compact cars, and we can scale them into larger arrays,” the company’s CEO, Paul Shmotolokha, stated. “Our modules are 30% lighter than traditional monocrystalline solar panels and easy to fold, carry and stow.”
According to the company’s website, the TriFold SunTarp array is sold at $906.53, while the FourFold SunTarp and HexFold SunTarp have a price of $1,318.45 and $1,806.13, respectively. “They provide way more power than the rather small tiny panel kits that small portable power stations provide,” Feliciano stated.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/22/georgia-power-plans-nearly-as-much-fossil-fuel-as-renewables-and-the-renewables-come-with-a-catch/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,GEORGIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 22, 2022",Georgia Power expands plans 9 GW of renewable energy by 2035,"The Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) recently approved investor-owned utility Georgia Power’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), a forward-looking roadmap for the utility that is released every three years.
The plan for 2028 calls for the retirement and decertification of all but two of the utility’s coal burning facilities. Replacing that coal capacity is a planned 2.3 GW of renewable energy. The 2028 plan also calls for 500 MW of battery energy storage.
The plan was recently revised in a vote before the PSC to increase the utility’s renewables plan for 2035 from 6 to 9 GW.
In addition, the PSC voted unanimously to create a collaborative “Distributed Generation Working Group.” The group is expected to be composed of representatives from utilities, the solar industry, and PSC staff, which will develop recommendations for growing the distributed energy market in Georgia.
“Distributed generation is the clear path forward for Georgia’s economy, workforce, and public health. We’re excited to see the commission recognize the crucial role of distributed generation in such a tangible way,” said Tully Blalock, senior vice president of SolAmerican Energy and policy co-chair of the Georgia Solar Industries Association (SEIA).
The PSC rejected another program, declining to expand Georgia Power’s popular monthly net metering program by as much as 15%, which could have brought rooftop solar within reach for 75,000 Georgia households. Commission Vice Chair Tim Echols, a champion for net metering expansion, brought the vote forward, which was rejected 3-2.
The net metering program was introduced as a pilot in 2020. Under the pilot, rooftop solar customers were paid a retail rate for excess electricity produced by their solar systems. The pilot showed popularity in Georgia and quickly reached its 5,000 customer limit in mid-2021. Advocates immediately began urging the PSC to lift the cap and expand solar access across the state.
“We applaud some of the Commission’s decisions today, and are optimistic that the Commission will address net metering in the upcoming Georgia Power rate case to bring affordable rooftop solar within reach for tens of thousands of Georgia families,” said Allison Kvien, Southeast regulatory director at Vote Solar. “Monthly netting empowers families to lower their monthly bills and contribute to a cleaner, more resilient energy grid through rooftop solar. We thank Vice Chair Echols and Commissioner McDonald for their leadership on this critical issue, and will continue our efforts to make solar affordable and accessible to all Georgians.”
The state of Georgia has seen $4.9 billion in solar investment and now houses 200 companies and over 4,500 jobs. The Solar Energy Industries Association ranks it 7th in solar deployment in the nation.
“Georgia took significant steps in expanding renewable energy development across the state today,” said Will Giese, Southeast Regional Director at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “The solar and storage additions to Georgia Power’s integrated resource plan will help ease the inflation pinch on Georgia families through the procurement of stable, low-cost clean energy. While the Commission missed an important opportunity to expand the state’s net metering pilot, it’s encouraging to see them create a distributed generation working group. In the face of rising energy prices, we will continue to advocate for solutions that expand clean energy access to all Georgia ratepayers.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/22/the-problematic-side-to-renewable-energy-credits/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 22, 2022",The problematic side to renewable energy credits,"Renewable Energy Credits (REC) are market-based instruments that represent the property rights to the environmental, social, and other non-power attributes of renewable electricity generation. RECs are issued when one megawatt-hour of electricity is generated and delivered to the electricity grid from a renewable energy resource.
RECs are designed to incentivize renewable energy buildout, but sometimes the way they are used in a process called “unbundling” can compromise that goal.
Take utility Georgia Power, for example, which recently expanded its renewable energy plans for 2035 to 9 GW, purchases only the null energy output from some renewable generating facilities that have contracted to sell that energy to them. Ownership of the associated renewable energy credits (RECs) is specified in each respective power purchase agreement. The party that owns the RECs retains the right to use them.
S&P Global said in a report that this type of purchase of RECs can be problematic as they make it appear that credit purchaser has invested in the physical buildout of renewables, when in reality they have not. Many corporations flaunt that they are switching to renewable energy and reduced emissions, but physically they have not made any changes.
The purchase of unbundled credits “can make it look as if a company’s electricity emissions have become zero, when they haven’t,” says Matthew Brander, senior lecturer of carbon accounting at the University of Edinburgh.
The sale of unbundled RECs is booming; today they are the most common form of green-power procurement in the voluntary market, said S&P. Some of the largest buyers are corporations, many of which celebrate their progress towards “net-zero” goals, but which may not be contributing as much to the energy transition as it appears.
Using RECs also allows a company to say it has reduced its scope 2 emissions simply by writing a check, while it can continue to put out greenhouse gases as before, said S&P.
“The reaction when you tell companies about this is mixed,” said Brander,” Some corporates are horrified when they find out about non-additionality. Others ignore it, saying they’ll keep buying unbundled RECs as long as existing standards allow them to do it, and as long as their peers do it.”
“We recommend members source more directly, through on-site generation or long-term agreements when possible,” said RE100 on a report on RECs.

In keeping with its intent to source low-carbon products domestically, the company has signed an agreement to source solar glass from Canadian Premium Sand (CPS).
“Following a tour of our planned facilities in Manitoba and meetings in Calgary with members of Hanwha’s management team in June of 2022, we are delighted to enter into an MOU with Hanwha regarding long-term supply of our low-carbon, patterned solar glass,” said Glenn Leroux, CPS president. “Hanwha’s North American solar glass demand requirements of over 3 gigawatts of module manufacturing represents over 80% of our planned Phase 1 production capacity.”
CPS will manufacture patterned solar glass in a new facility in Selkirk, Manitoba that uses the high-purity, low-iron silica sand from its wholly owned Wanipigow quarry leases. CPS intends to power the facility with renewable energy, which reduces the carbon footprint of the glass.  The company also intends to use recycled water in the manufacturing process along with waste heat recovery. The initial facility (phase 1) will have annual production of 20 million square meters or the equivalent of 4 GW of solar panel manufacturing demand. The location in Manitoba has room for 4 such facilities in total. CPS expects to be manufacturing at full capacity in the first facility by 2025.
As Qcells expands its manufacturing footprint in North America, the company sees “tremendous value in securing supply from a trusted partner that is proximal to our operations,” a company spokesperson said. “Additionally, the integrated nature of CPS’ operation with its wholly-owned sand resource and the use of renewable hydro-electricity in its manufacturing process offer excellent alignment with our low-carbon objectives.”
In May Qcells announced that its new solar panel manufacturing facility, expected to come online in 2023, will be located in Dalton, Georgia near where the company already operates a 1.7 GW module factory. In March, Hanwha Solutions, parent corporation of Qcells, announced that it was stepping up efforts to supply customers with “Made-in-America” products when it became the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major US manufacturer of polysilicon. Following its initial $160 million acquisition to acquire a 16.67% stake in REC Silicon in January 2022, Hanwha announced that it was acquiring an additional 4.67% stake from Aker Horizons in a deal valued at around $44 million.
Hanwha’s US initiative supports the Biden administration’s efforts to increase solar power generation by 40% and to decarbonize all electricity by 2035. Hanwha sees the enactment of the Solar Energy Manufacturing Act (SEMA) as critical to a US-based solar supply chain. While Hanwha had stated that it would “…implement a multi-phase, multi-billion-dollar expansion across the full solar energy supply chain” once SEMA was passed, the expansion has begun.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/22/california-rulemaking-to-pursue-demand-flexibility-through-dynamic-pricing/,"POLICY,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 22, 2022",California rulemaking to pursue demand flexibility through dynamic pricing,"The California Public Utilities Commission has voted 4-0 to institute a rulemaking to advance demand flexibility through electric rates.
Demand flexibility would allow consumers to reduce or shift their electricity use at times of peak demand in response to a price signal or other incentive, the Commission (CPUC) said in a news release. Enabling the use of price signals in this way is known as dynamic pricing, or “sending prices to devices.”
The demand flexibility measures to be considered in the rulemaking would reduce curtailment of renewable generation, said the news release, while enhancing electric system reliability, reducing system costs and customer bills, and enabling electrification of buildings and transportation. The measures would allow participation in demand flexibility by customers, community choice aggregators and direct access providers.
A  white paper and staff proposal on opt-in dynamic pricing released last month by the CPUC’s energy division additionally sees the approach as a way to enable fair compensation for the services provided by distributed energy resources.
The white paper “offers a promising approach to scaling demand flexibility,” said CPUC Commissioner Darcie Houck, in an online workshop Thursday that discussed the paper. Houck lauded the “tremendous time, effort and expertise” put into the white paper, and the leadership on demand flexibility from Aloke Gupta, a supervisor in the CPUC’s energy division.
Gupta said in the workshop that the CPUC will consider establishing policies and programs to add a “vast amount of flexibility.” He said the CPUC’s order instituting a rulemaking “calls out the six specific strategies” described in the energy division’s white paper “as a basis for enabling widespread adoption” of demand flexibility solutions.
Noting that California aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2045, Gupta said that alongside three strategies seen as key to achieving that goal—decarbonizing the power supply, electrifying end uses, and reducing demand through energy efficiency—he would like to elevate demand flexibility as another strategy “on an equal footing.”
Houck encouraged “all interested stakeholders” to engage in the rulemaking proceeding, as “we rely on the considerable knowledge and expertise of all of the parties involved, to help achieve the ambitious goals we have collectively set for California.”
The deadline for submitting opening comments will be 30 days from the CPUC’s July 14 vote to institute the rulemaking, said Andrew Magie, a CPUC regulatory analyst. The docket number is R.22-07-005.
A recording of the workshop will be made available.
