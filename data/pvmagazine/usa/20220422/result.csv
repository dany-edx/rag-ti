The changes clarify and enable third-party ownership arrangements for net metering, such as leasing, financing, and power purchase agreements. Prior to the amendments, the net metering regulation required the customer to own or operate the renewable generation system to qualify as an eligible generator.
“Our government has put families back in control of their energy bills and we will continue to give them more tools to keep costs down, including new ways to lower electricity costs,” said Todd Smith, Minister of Energy. “By allowing families and business to lease rooftop solar systems and benefit from net metering we are eliminating barriers, including up-front costs for customers, while at the same time supporting new jobs in our growing clean energy sector.”
Encouraging net metering creates new opportunities for renewable energy businesses, including installers, developers, and service providers, to offer distributed energy solutions, like rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources. In making the announcement, the ministry of energy office released a statement saying that the government hopes the amendments will encourage businesses interested in investing in Ontario to be able to set up their facilities in the province and have more options to meet renewable energy or sustainability targets.
“This regulatory clarity will enable our industry to move forward in providing Ontario consumers with more options to lower their energy costs and to reduce GHG emissions, while helping to drive job creation and growth in the province’s renewable energy sector,” said Robert Hornung, president and CEO, Canadian Renewable Energy Association. 
The government also introduced consumer protection measures that apply specifically to third-party ownership net metering arrangements. Some of these measures include disclosure requirements for businesses when dealing with homeowners and businesses, ensuring transparency for consumers.

Under the MFA, Catalyze and Stream will deploy solar, battery storage, and EV charging solutions across Stream’s development pipeline of over 40 million square feet, equivalent to over 450 MW of on-site solar and battery storage projects. Catalyze and Stream are initially considering 42 properties across the United States, in markets including California, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, and aim to deploy fleet EV chargers at many of the properties over the next few years.
“As the real estate industry moves ESG to the top of its priority list, owners are seeking simple, cost-efficient ways to integrate clean energy solutions and reduce emissions across entire portfolios,” said Steve Luker, Catalyze CEO.
According to Catalyst, the partnership will enable the company to de-risk Stream’s costs and supply chains and accelerate construction across the pipeline, allowing for more rapid clean energy development and emissions reductions than would be possible had Stream tried to bring renewable resources to its properties alone.
“Catalyze’s vertical integration, financial capabilities, and national expertise make them an ideal clean energy transition partner for our mission of addressing emissions at scale across our national portfolio,” said Adam Jackson, chief investment officer and chairman of the ESG Committee for Stream.
In September 2021, Catalyze acquired Sol Alliance, a solar sales and development firm that operates in the Northeast, in a move that brought Catalyze a project development pipeline of more than 80 MW. The company has stated long-term plans to acquire regional distributed solar development firms and alleviate strain on power infrastructure by developing sustainable, local power generation.

The Sunbank Project solar and storage project is set to consist of a community microgrid with a capacity of just over 26 MW as well as a 10 MW battery energy storage system for which Aspin Kemp has been selected as the EPC. While the duration of the battery storage system has not yet been chosen, it’s reasonable to expect somewhere in the ballpark of four hours. Polar is responsible not just for supplying hardware to the project, the company will also conduct the engineering the structural racking for the installation.
Once completed, the Sunbank Project is expected to reduce the city’s imports of electricity from 58% to 38%; meaningful progress as the whole of Canada looks to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.
“The Summerside Sunbank Project proves that jurisdictions of any size can play an active role in sustainability when they truly want to,” says Vishal Lala, Managing Director at Polar Racking. “We are thrilled to work with Aspin Kemp & Associates to advance the city’s clean energy goals by supplying the racking and foundation for this project.”
While usually a bit more tropical in nature, Polar Racking is no stranger to the hardware solution needs of island solar systems and microgrids. The company was selected by Sir Richard Branson’s BMR Energy group as its racking & foundation supplier and mechanical installer to rebuild a solar farm destroyed by hurricanes in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. BMR said it recognized that Polar’s PRU fixed-tilt racking system is engineered to handle heavy loads from wind, slopes, and a wide range of variable ground conditions.
Before that project, Polar Racking previously installed over 450 MW of rooftop and ground-mount solar racking across the Caribbean including Barbados, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Belize, and other islands. Elsewhere, Polar has worked on projects all over Canada and the US, including ongoing projects in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Minnesota, and California.

In its nine years in operation, the array has produced 16.20 GWh of electrical energy, providing 12.1% of the college’s usage in that time period.
The array has lowered the college’s electric bills, saving the college $314k over the past year, the second best year for savings with increasing electricity prices compensating for lost production.  To date the array has saved the college $2.5M on an investment of $3.35M.  Accounting for lost investment opportunities (endowment) the payback period for the array is now 17 years–the school is now more than halfway through paying for the array.
Professor Snowden-Ifft was instrumental in the design and development of the array and he continues to monitor it. Based on what he learned about solar energy in the US, he put together an interactive quiz, which we share with you here. Take the quiz!

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/22/governor-whitmer-announces-michigan-healthy-climate-plan/,"EMPLOYMENT,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MICHIGAN",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 22, 2022",Governor Whitmer announces Michigan Healthy Climate Plan,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined Liesl Clark, Director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, business owners, tribal leaders, and students at a large solar array in Traverse City, Michigan to announce the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan that proposes that the state would get 60% of its electricity from renewable sources and build infrastructure to accommodate millions of electric vehicles by 2030. This builds on the Governor’s plan set forth in 2020 that set a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.
The Governor positioned the new plan as a roadmap that would reduce emissions while also creating clean energy jobs, boosting economic development, and improving public health.
“If we follow the steps outlined in the plan and collaborate with public and private sector partners, we can build a Michigan where every Michigander has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and access to healthy, affordable local food,” said Whitmer. “Today, we are positioning Michigan to become the global center of clean energy innovation where workers can get good-paying jobs, from those that don’t require a college degree to careers in advanced engineering and science.”
The plan has been under development since 2020 when the Governor committed Michigan to achieving economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. This included interim reductions of 28% by 2025, 52% by 2030, and maintaining net negative greenhouse gas emissions after 2050.
The Michigan Healthy Climate Plan lays out the roadmap for how the state can reach carbon neutrality by 2050, prioritizing actions that must be taken in the next eight years. The following are the six pillars of the plan: Commit to Environmental Justice and Pursue a Just Transition
Since taking office, the Governor has begun taking steps outlined in the plan. She committed to powering all State of Michigan facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and attracted battery and electric vehicle manufacturing investments from automakers, who have added 21,600 jobs in the state. The Governor signed bipartisan budgets investing millions of dollars in clean energy improvements and proposed a budget that includes investing over half a billion dollars in climate action. Recently, Michigan state senators Polehanki and McCann introduced bills to establish a $500 charging equipment and $2,000 electric vehicle rebate to knock off nearly $10,000 off the price of an electric vehicle when combined with the federal tax credit.

Michigan is currently ranked 26th in solar installations in the country, with a growth projection of 2,388 MW over the next five years, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). In March of this year, a Vibrant Clean Energy study commissioned by Vote Solar found that GW-scale investments in distributed solar and storage would yield the lower cost between two approaches studied for Michigan to achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. In commenting on the draft of the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan, Vote Solar’s Will Kenworthy stated that the governor’s goals are achievable. Kenworthy noted that Michigan should “start now” to get to 50% clean energy by 2030, as “getting the first 50% is a no regrets policy” he said.
