California is now pursuing demand flexibility through real-time pricing, also known as dynamic pricing, in a regulatory proceeding.
The Oahu study modeled scenarios in which the optimized system is built at one point in time, while allowing pre-existing assets to be retained. The results showed how much renewable capacity would be selected in an optimized system designed with flat prices versus one with real-time pricing.
The study jointly solved for investment and real-time operations with reserves, either with or without real-time pricing, using the open-source Switch optimization model. “To our knowledge,” the authors say, “such dynamic equilibrium models have not been solved in the economics or engineering literature.”
The study assumed that electricity consumption would change by 0.1% with each 1% change in the real-time retail price. As electricity prices fell, consumption would increase, and as prices rose, consumption would decrease. They modeled the overall 0.1% “elasticity” value by assuming higher elasticities for commercial air conditioning using ice storage, commercial smart water heating, and municipal water pumping, and elasticities of zero for other uses.
The authors compared scenario outputs to calculate the increase in social benefits from using real-time pricing, defining social benefits as the sum of “consumer surplus” and “producer surplus”—two concepts from economics.
For two scenarios based on a Hawaiian Electric Company forecast of 2045 costs for renewables and storage, the increase in social benefits from real-time pricing in a 100% renewable system was higher (14%) when assuming commercial customers widely participated in real-time pricing, deploying thermal storage and automated demand-response systems, with zero participation by residential customers. When assuming less participation by commercial customers, the social benefit increase from real-time pricing was lower (9%). Commercial customers comprise over 70% of Oahu’s demand, the authors said.
“By some estimates,” the authors said, current renewable energy and battery technology costs already rival the Hawaiian Electric Company cost projections for 2045 that they used in the analysis.
“Conservative” estimates
“We believe the assumptions underlying these estimates are fairly conservative,” the authors said. The benefits of real-time pricing would be “much higher,” they found in a sensitivity analysis, “if we optimistically assume” a high overall demand elasticity of 2, “which is not observed in history but might arise in a future that is more automated, has more price variability, and prevalent free or near-free electricity.”
The authors did not explicitly account for the capital cost of equipment, such as ice or hot water storage and smart controllers, that could enable demand response. They stated that some measure of these costs is implicit in the elasticities, and the estimated gains to customers from real-time pricing provide an upper bound for customer capital costs that would be economic.
While the paper did not disclose the generator investments selected by the model for various scenarios, the authors said that real-time pricing provides efficiency gains by curbing peak demand and thereby reducing investment in rarely used peaking power plants, “and also reducing market power.”
Real-time retail pricing that reflects the “incremental cost and marginal willingness to pay” for electricity represents a “well-known but rarely implemented solution” to efficiently mobilize demand-side resources, said the co-authors, citing research dating back to 2005. Automated smart devices acting on customers’ behalf are already available, “but remain rare, because incentives are limited,” perhaps because “few utilities and regulators are aware of the potential.”
While real-time pricing benefits flexible demand types more than inflexible demand types, the authors said, they concluded after running multiple scenarios that “even inflexible demand types normally benefit from real-time pricing, and in some cases, nearly as much as flexible demand types.” They added that “many if not most customers” probably have both flexible and inflexible demands, and that flexibility will also depend on adoption of smart devices that enable automated response.
Continent-scale implications
Regarding the applicability of their findings beyond island grids like Oahu’s, the authors point to recent research suggesting that shifting of heating and cooling loads with thermal storage “might do more than transmission” as a mechanism for “flattening existing demand variability” across the continental United States.
To facilitate similar studies of additional locations, the authors said they are making their input data and model code publicly available.
The white paper is titled “Real-time pricing and the cost of clean power.”

This means that with a new firmware update, Generac PWRcell battery storage products can accept up to 7.6 kW of AC power generated by third-party PV inverters.
The Generac PWRcell battery backup solution features a modular design that can scale from a 3-module, 9 kWh capacity, 4.5 kW output, to a 6-module, 18 kWh, 9kW output. If more storage is needed, Generac reports that multiple PWRcell battery cabinets can be integrated to a single Generac PWRcell inverter for up to 36 kWh capacity and 11 kW continuous backup power. The PWRcell string inverters feature 7.6 kW and 11.4 kW models, with peak efficiencies of 97.3% and 97.7% respectively.
By enabling AC coupling, solar homeowners now have a choice of adding a DC-powered PWRcell solar-plus-battery storage system to their existing array, or they can connect a new or existing Generac Guardian home standby generator PWRcell solar-plus-battery storage system.
“Generac is proud to lead the way in envisioning the future of energy through a robust offering of market-leading power solutions that enhance energy resilience and independence,” said Aaron Jagdfeld, Generac president and chief executive officer. “We continue to grow our portfolio of clean energy products, expanding the capabilities of solar + battery storage solutions and giving our dealers and installers a wide array of options for their customers.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/10/quanex-releases-solar-panel-sealant-for-improved-durability/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 10, 2022",Quanex releases solar panel sealant for improved durability,"Houston-based Quanex announced it released a new product, the SolarGain Edge Sealant, a rubberized sealant for PV modules to protect against degradation due to moisture.
The Edge Sealant is a polyisobutylene butyl rubber adhesive with integrated desiccant designed to improve longevity, durability, and power retention over time.
Quanex said applying the sealant can prevent moisture ingress in modules, better protecting cells, connections, and conductive coatings. The company said it can delay loss of power over a module’s lifetime by significantly delaying any degradation mechanisms activated by moisture, and that it can extend the useful life of a module by 10 to 15 years. The sealant can also boost cell area increasing aperture efficiency and maintain strong performance in high-heat conditions.
Quanex said emerging trends in the PV module market are increasing the importance of moisture sealing. New technologies like perovskite solar cells and heterojunction (HTJ) cells have demonstrated promise of higher module efficiency but have shown greater moisture sensitivity.
While it is commonly assumed that crystalline silicon panels are not sensitive to moisture ingress over the long term, recent testing by the company has demonstrated SolarGain Edge Sealant’s ability to provide high levels of moisture protection in c-Si panels, extending lifetime power output.
Traditional ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulants have the potential to generate acid that can sap the panel of its power due to the corrosiveness of the acid when exposed to moisture over time. Alternative encapsulants like thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) have demonstrated higher potential to resist moisture ingress versus EVA but are considerably more expensive and difficult to handle during the assembly process.
The sealant product is backed by Quanex’s 50 years of experience in insulating glass sealant and spacer manufacturing designed to slow moisture entry between glass panes. These solutions demonstrate many of the same attributes required in solar module sealants, including UV resistance, flexibility through a wide variety of temperatures and the ability to delay the migration of moisture.

The US-based company’s residential whole energy storage system the Franklin Home Power system debuted in January of this year and integrates its lithium iron phosphate “aPower” battery with its aGateX intelligent control system.
The 13.6 KWh battery is compatible with any PV inverter technology, the company reports, and it can connect with existing solar systems while scaling up to 15 units for a total of 204 KWh of capacity. In the event of a power failure, its black start feature creates a micro-grid for the home.
With Franklin WH being added to Mosaic and GoodLeap’s Approved Vendor Lists (AVL), FranklinWH installers can now offer customers access to lower interest rates on energy storage systems. The two financing companies have provided more than $18 billion in loans, combined, for solar sustainable home improvements in the United States.
“FranklinWH strives to ensure that energy storage ownership is an affordable reality, ” says Gary Lam, FranklinWH US general manager and co-founder. “Excellent financing lets our installer partners boost sales and simplify operations while offering the best rates to customers. Secure and innovative finance platforms from Mosaic and GoodLeap streamline that process.”
To achieve AVL status with Mosaic and GoodLeap, the Franklin Home Power (FHP) system underwent what the company reports is stringent due diligence including proven product viability, strong market acceptance and sales forecast, and long-term warranty specifications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/10/catalyzing-solar-in-the-us-a-manufacturers-perspective/,"GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 10, 2022",Catalyzing solar in the US: a manufacturer’s perspective,"The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 through the US Senate once again highlights the issue of local manufacturing investment. The legislation will now go to the House and if signed into law, will provide important incentives that we expect will catalyze significant investment in US solar manufacturing, facilitate the creation of a stable domestic solar supply chain, and allow the US to aggressively pursue the decarbonization of its economy with less reliance on imported solar products. Such measures will provide much needed support to the existing local solar industry, and promote further investment and job creation in US manufacturing by Maxeon and others.
While there have been some bumps in the regulatory road getting to this outcome, I have confidence in the US market and its potential to become a solar hub.  In contrast to what some of my peers have said, I don’t believe we need to make a hard-line choice between investment in the US and other fast-growing markets such as Europe and India who are also focused on developing integrated upstream solar supply chains.  Each of these major growth markets offers its own unique opportunities and challenges that need to be carefully considered, but they share the common attributes of massive solar deployment targets and a strong desire to onshore a complete value chain. We see this localization across the globe as an exciting and positive trend.
To order to meet the Biden administration’s target of a carbon-free power sector by 2035, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), US solar capacity will need to rapidly expand from roughly 3% of US. electricity generation today to 30% by 2030. This 2030 target would see carbon emissions from the electricity sector reduced by 50% – a goal worth striving toward.
Moving forward
Although the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 faced procedural hurdles and was ultimately achieved along strictly partisan voting lines, there has historically been solid bipartisan support for growing the solar energy sector, both with respect to downstream deployment and upstream manufacturing.  I am convinced that after the legislative smoke clears, we will see the pace of solar deployment and local manufacturing grow meaningfully, and with increasingly positive support from all sides of the political spectrum, particularly as much of the activity is likely to take place in red states and counties.  .
Maxeon is well positioned and willing to help achieve these objectives. In April of last year we announced our intention to construct a 3 GW manufacturing facility in the South East of the US, pending the implementation of appropriate incentives and the successful application for a DOE loan. Since that time, we have conducted an extensive site selection process, completed preliminary engineering studies for our factory, and submitted a Part 2 application to DOE’s Loan Program Office. We are ready and excited to move forward with this project quickly. The DOE is very focused on fuelling innovation in solar power and adjacent industries. An example of this was the recent commitment of $56 million to supporting projects that reduce manufacturing costs and increase the ways in which panels are reused and recycled. We believe that our 3 GW US factory is the type of project that the DOE and the administration would like to support, and one that will ultimately achieve bipartisan appeal. Both domestic and global demand for our product is large and growing, and we are pursuing multiple pathways to serve this demand.
The demand is there
SEIA’s projections predict 35 GW of deployment over the next five years in California and Texas alone, not to mention rapidly expanding demand in the Eastern half of the country.
We have already announced supply contracts with major US power plant developers totalling almost 3.5 GW of backlog for Maxeon’s Performance-series panels, and our customers are clamouring for more.
The US residential and commercial solar markets are also extremely vibrant, and we are exceedingly focused on building our own DG channel to market in the US, similar to what we have achieved in Europe and Australia over the past decade.
One of the inescapable features of the energy transition is ever-increasing demand for electricity. Historical forecasts for future deployment have consistently been well short of actual volumes.  We saw global electricity demand surge in 2021, and according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) this was the largest one-year increase ever observed. Altogether this surge created strains in major markets, pushing prices to unprecedented levels and driving the power sector’s emissions to a record high, it is a reflection of an underlying trend that is sometimes referred to as “the electrification of everything”.
California is now the largest electric vehicle market in the US, which has added considerably to its electricity demand. As solar power becomes more prevalent in states like California, it tends to naturally cover mid-day and early afternoon electricity supply.  This shifts peak demand for other forms of generation into the evening hours as output from solar panels decreases. We and others see a huge opportunity for both large-scale solar power plants and individual customers to add battery storage to their solar systems to extend effective solar contribution into the evening and continue to increase overall solar penetration.
As we have already announced for Europe and Australia, we plan to also integrate unique battery storage capabilities into our residential solar system offers in the US – transforming the way customers in this market access solar energy and manage their energy footprint.
Deep roots
Ultimately, our confidence in the US solar market rests on the fact that we are connected to an over 35-year legacy in this country – preceding our spin-off from SunPower in 2020. We know the market, understand the customers, and have a nuanced appreciation for the policy environment.
As an American, I am very excited to see my country build a path toward establishing a solar supply chain. At Maxeon, we are confident that solar will form a key part of the US energy mix and are determined to be an increasingly significant and visible key player in its future growth, as we continue to innovate and power positive change.
