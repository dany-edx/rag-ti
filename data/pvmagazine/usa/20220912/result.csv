https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/12/sunpower-residential-solar-now-offered-in-ikea-california-locations/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2022",SunPower residential solar now offered in IKEA California locations,"IKEA shoppers at select California stores will now have a new option available to them: residential solar from SunPower.
Through the collaboration, members of the IKEA Family customer loyalty program will have in-store access to four custom designed SunPower solar packages, which all include a SunPower Equinox solar system, a 25-year warranty for power, product and labor, and a 10-year monitoring warranty. IKEA U.S. customers will work directly with SunPower to access its energy solutions, which contain all the products, services, and warranties that customers will need.
The collaboration brings IKEA’s strengths in retail and home living, and SunPower carries more than 35 years of solar industry experience. SunPower systems are backed by a 25-year warranty, covering everything from panels to racking to monitoring hardware. It has among the highest DC power output protection in the solar industry, claiming 92% DC power in year 25.
SunPower’s energy storage offering, called the SunVault, offers backup power and can perform other services like peak demand response. It is equipped with 6.8 kW continuous power, 13 kWh / 26 kWh rated energy capacity, and a 10-year warranty. It measures 26 inches by 63 inches by 15 inches and is rated for indoor or outdoor use.
With SunPower, making the switch to renewable energy at home can be completed in five steps:
Assessment: A SunPower Solar Advisor will assess the customer’s electricity bills, energy goals, and roof configuration so they can design a custom solar package to meet their needs. 
Quote: SunPower will provide a proposed system design based on the customer’s needs as well as financial products and incentives that may be available to them.
Site Verification: A SunPower installation professional will visit the home to assess the roof and ensure the system is designed to optimize solar production. Updates will be made to the final proposal to reflect any changes needed.
Installation: Once the proposal is signed, SunPower will work with the customer from installation to activation.
Enjoy the Sun: Sit back and enjoy the benefits of having solar.
The solar packages are available at eight IKEA California stores, including Emeryville, East Palo Alto, West Sacramento, Burbank, Carson, Covina, Costa Mesa and San Diego.
“To power more homes with clean, reliable and affordable energy, we need to make the process of switching to renewables convenient and easy,” said Peter Faricy, SunPower CEO. “We’re proud IKEA selected SunPower to bring the many benefits of solar to its customers, and we look forward to making their energy transition seamless. There has truly never been a better time to go solar.”
In addition to the California locations, IKEA has residential solar available in ten European markets, including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Poland and Portugal.
“At IKEA, we’re passionate about helping our customers live a more sustainable life at home. We’re proud to collaborate with SunPower to bring this service to the US and enable our customers to make individual choices aimed at reducing their overall climate footprint,” said Javier Quiñones, CEO & chief sustainability officer, IKEA US. Quiñones said IKEA’s goal is to expand the service at additional locations outside the select California retail sites in the future.
Ingka Group, a strategic partner in the IKEA franchise system, has invested in two solar facilities with 403 MW combined capacity in Utah and Texas and two wind energy facilities producing 859 million kWh of energy in Illinois and Texas. IKEA has set a goal to be “climate positive” by 2030, and has solar arrays on top of 90% of its store locations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/12/solar-site-imagery-software-provider-sitecapture-forms-new-alliance/,"ACQUISITIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2022",Solar site imagery software provider SiteCapture forms new alliance,"FotoNotes, a mobile software for residential real estate field operations, said it has acquired SiteCapture, a solar industry field operations software platform. The two will move forward with the name SiteCapture after the acquisition.
Kamal Shah, founder and CEO of FotoNotes, will continue as CEO of SiteCapture, while Christopher Doyle, founder of SiteCapture, has joined the board of directors.
“We launched SiteCapture to help streamline and lower costs in the solar installation process,” said Christopher Doyle, former CEO and founder of SiteCapture. “The combined entity will bring even better technology to the solar industry to further support our founding mission of improving solar processes.”
SiteCapture is designed to eliminate inefficiencies in capturing and managing data and photos in field service jobs. The company said SiteCapture can reduce field data costs by 10% to 20%, while cutting reporting times by up to 75%. The software has been used for more than 5 million jobs and has captured over 100 million photos. The software has been used by notable companies such as Sunrun, Omnidian, Trinity Solar, and more.
“FotoNotes and SiteCapture are long-time partners, achieving substantial success in our respective industries,” said Kamal Shah, CEO of SiteCapture. “This is the natural next strategic step in our mission to deliver the best field operations software platform for Solar, Residential Property and other field-service intensive industries.”
For solar contractors, the software has capabilities in site surveys, installation management, field-to-office communications, operations and maintenance (O&M), and reporting.
Technicians can complete site surveys with customizable forms and templates that outline the data necessary to capture in the field. Installers can manage crews, contractors, and installations from a single software, keeping projects organized and on-track.
Field-to-office communications allow field workers to capture critical solar site photos and data – then organize, edit and share, all from one application. The O&M feature allows users to create solar estimates in the field directly from a mobile device. The reporting feature enables configurable, branded solar reports with a click to keep customers and key stakeholders informed.
New Jersey installer PV Pros implemented SiteCapture’s software, and reported it cut down the technician’s field service reporting time by 75%, completely eliminated in-office administration and eliminated an extra 4 hours of work per site visit.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/12/heliene-to-source-solar-glass-from-canadian-premium-sand/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2022",Heliene to source solar glass from Canadian Premium Sand,"Heliene, a U.S.-based manufacturer of solar modules, has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Canadian Premium Sand Inc. (CPS) to acquire patterned solar glass from the CPS’s glass manufacturing facility being developed in Selkirk, Manitoba.
Heliene has experienced significant growth since starting its U.S. operations in Minnesota in 2017. The local supply of CPS glass will enable Heliene to meet accelerating solar demand while ensuring certainty and quality thanks to the supply of American-made components of its bill of materials.
“Following several months of progressive discussions and a visit to Heliene’s Mountain Iron facilities earlier this year, we are delighted to now enter into an MOU with Heliene regarding long-term supply of our low-carbon, patterned solar glass”, stated Glenn Leroux, company president and CEO. “Heliene’s anticipated glass demand in 2024 reflects over 40% of our production capability for Phase 1 of our facility. We look forward to working with Heliene as a strategic partner and supporting their future growth plans.”
The new facility being built by CPS uses the high-purity, low-iron silica sand from its wholly owned Wanipigow quarry leases. CPS intends to power the facility with renewable energy, which reduces the carbon footprint of the glass.  The company also intends to use recycled water in the manufacturing process along with waste heat recovery. The initial facility (phase 1) will have annual production of 20 million square meters or the equivalent of 4 GW of solar panel manufacturing demand. The location in Manitoba has room for 4 such facilities in total. CPS expects to be manufacturing at full capacity in the first facility by 2025.
Martin Pochtaruk, President of Heliene, comments, “Amid exploding solar demand and trade volatility, our customers seek peace of mind that they are receiving the highest quality, competitively priced solar modules exactly when and where they need them. Having CPS supply us with a low-carbon glass, free of any geopolitical pressures is an enormous leap forward in the right direction.”
In July, Hanwha also executed a MOU to purchase solar glass from CPS. Anticipated glass demand from both parties would represent in excess of 120% of our production capability for Phase 1 of its facility. Hanwha, parent corporation of Qcells, is establishing a domestic, low-carbon solar supply chain to support its solar energy growth strategy in North America, where it is constructing a manufacturing facility in Georgia to nearly double its total US production capacity to over 3 GW.
CPS said it continues to advance other development initiatives that will bring the solar glass project to a shovel-ready status, including detailed engineering, permitting, silica sand resource upgrading and testing and ongoing negotiations to convert other existing expressions of interest to commercial offtake agreements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/09/12/grid-experts-call-for-a-national-initiative-to-facilitate-a-high-der-grid/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2022",Grid experts call for a national initiative to facilitate a high-DER grid,"Current work by states to advance the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) is “piecemeal” and “inefficient,” as “each state has to essentially reinvent the wheel,” says a report from the Distributed Energy Resources Task Force of the Energy Systems Integration Group (ESIG).
To achieve the full grid benefits and pollution reductions that DERs can provide, the report says a national initiative on DER integration is needed.
Such an initiative could foster a transition to a high-DER electricity system, through “ongoing changes” in multiple areas, namely DER interconnection to the grid, distribution and transmission planning, data access and communication, distribution system operations, utility regulation, retail rates for electricity, and electricity markets.
The task force considers DERs to include not only distributed solar and storage, but also electric vehicles and responsive load.
States including California and New York are developing their own distribution-level solutions to DER integration, the report says, but such state-by-state work “will lead to a proliferation of disparate standards, terminology and approaches” to DER integration that will “generate confusion and increase costs,” and yield lower DER benefits to customers.
The first goal of a national initiative would be to identify “near-term, least-regrets” actions. As a first step toward that goal, the report recommends a process of establishing a “core set” of models for distribution system and market operations, based on a detailed mapping of grid functions to different actors in these different models. The report mentions California’s high-DER proceeding, which is considering these issues.
The report says that models for distribution system operators (DSOs) could include, at one extreme, a DSO managing its local distribution area, with a single transmission-distribution interface to ensure reliable real-time operation in coordination with the regional grid operator or other transmission system operator (TSO). At the other extreme, a TSO would extend its network model and operational capabilities into distribution systems and be responsible for all distribution system and market operations. The report also describes possible hybrid models between those two extremes.
After “near-term, least-regrets” actions were identified, the ESIG task force recommends “a structured dialogue” around DER integration challenges that will require more time to resolve.
Insights from the United Kingdom and Australia
A national initiative on DER integration could draw insights from similar initiatives in the United Kingdom and Australia, says a second report by the same ESIG task force, which describes those initiatives.
The UK initiative analyzed five different models for the types of services that distribution system operators (DSOs) would provide, using “the Smart Grid Architecture Model methodology and a licensed Enterprise Architect tool.” That led to identification of eight “no-regrets functional and system requirements for DSOs, independent of the market model.” The UK initiative is ongoing.
The initiative in Australia, a country with “world-leading uptake” of rooftop solar, was modeled on the UK project and used several of the same consultants and analytical tools. The initiative identified three “least-regrets” actions that distribution network service providers would need to implement “under any future conditions.” The initiative was conducted over three years and is now complete.
An earlier ESIG report outlined minor “no regrets” changes to distribution planning and operations, to enable owners of distributed solar and storage to participate in wholesale markets.
ESIG is a nonprofit organization that “marshals the expertise of the electricity industry’s technical community to support grid transformation and energy systems integration and operation,” the group says in its reports.
The ESIG report on a national DER initiative is titled “The Transition to a High-DER Electricity System: A National Initiative on DER Integration for the United States,” and is accompanied by a fact sheet. The ESIG report on initiatives in the UK and Australia is titled “Lessons Learned for the U.S. Context: An Assessment of UK and Australian Open Networks Initiatives.“
