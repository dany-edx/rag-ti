They found that agrivoltaic systems placed in adjacent proximity to the highway can be useful in rural areas, which is also where electric charging stations are most needed.
The study, recently published in Scientific Reports, looked at how agrivoltaic technology can be used to improve EV charging infrastructure to reduce range anxiety, which is the worry about making it to the next charging point.  In their analysis the team envisioned a scenario that had the highest traffic demand and the lowest photovoltaic generation, and the results showed that agrivoltaics could play a role in charging station infrastructure development.
In the study, a total of 231 rural highway access points were identified that had sufficient land area to service EV charging stations with energy generated by agrivoltaic installations. These areas are indicated with black circles Figure 1.

The team discovered that to meet the conservative estimate of EV charging station demand at 86% of highway access points through Oregon, 12,000 acres (18.75 square miles) of land would be required. Of the 231 highway access points identified for agrivoltaics, 220 (95%) have a distance between them that is less than 17 miles. The researchers looked at earlier research conducted in Croatia that indicated that people have less range anxiety if charging stations are less than 3.1 miles apart. And other research shows that gas stations tend to be 2.5 to 18 miles apart. The Oregon State team used this range as a basis in their scenario.
Based on the number of vehicles registered in the state of Oregon and how much carbon they emit each year, the team estimated that the potential for carbon reduction through agrivoltaic-powered EV charging stations is about 3.1 million tons or the equivalent to 673,915 vehicles removed from the road each year, if their approach were fully implemented.
Overall the Oregon researchers showed that servicing rural EV charging stations with agrivoltaics next to the highway is feasible, requiring only 3% of total land supply to power 86% of rural highway access points throughout the state.
As rural areas often lack the grid infrastructure to support charging stations, agrivoltaics enable the shift in energy production to the point of use. Oregon currently has 670 EV charging stations, and the researchers’ scenario adds another 231 charge points located in close enough proximity to reduce or eliminate range anxiety. Additionally, the team estimates that implementation of this approach could reduce annual carbon emissions from passenger vehicle use in Oregon by 21%.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/05/thin-film-solar-may-have-carbon-intensity-advantage-over-silicon/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 5, 2022",Thin film solar may have carbon intensity advantage over silicon,"Typically, when solar panels are evaluated, traditional metrics like efficiency, cost, levelized cost of electricity, and reliability are used as major benchmarks. As the global economy shifts to adoption of renewable energy, carbon emissions reduction must be kept under focus as a central goal of sustainable development.
Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are keeping that focus, and recently published new work in Joule that takes solar module assessment to the next level. The studies homed in on “embodied” energy and carbon, which is the sunk energy and carbon emissions involved in manufacturing a PV module. The team also evaluated energy payback periods, or the amount of time that it takes a solar array to generate the same amount of energy that was used to produce it.
“Green technologies are awesome, but as we are working to scale them up to an incredible magnitude, it makes sense to take a close look to see what can be done to minimize the impact,” said Samantha Reese, a senior engineer and analyst in NREL’s Strategic Energy Analysis Center.
In the report, the team evaluated two major types of solar cells: crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe). “We combined life-cycle analysis with materials science to explain the emission results for each technology and to examine effects of future advances. We want to use these results to identify areas where additional research is needed,” said Reese.
The report found that applying a cost to carbon could result in a $0.02/W to $0.04/W advantage in CdTe versus traditional silicon cells.
By looking at present-day carbon efficiency on the grid in countries that manufacture solar, the researchers found that a cleaner grid in specific regions can lead to half as much emissions as other regions that use more dirty technologies like coal to power the grid. And, though silicon-based solar cells currently dominate the market, emerging thin-film PV technologies like CdTe and perovskites provide another path to cutting carbon intensity in half again.
“If we want to hit the decarbonization goals set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as much as a sixth of the remaining carbon budget could be used to manufacture PV modules,” said NREL researcher Matthew Reese. “It’s a massive amount of manufacturing that has to be done in order to replace the energy sources being used today.”
Recently, Maxeon Solar Technologies announced the milestone of exceeding the energy payback period 100 times over the 40-year life cycle of its Maxeon 3 series of solar panels and an energy payback period as little as 47.5 days.
“One of the big strengths of PV is that it has this positive feedback loop,” said Nancy Haegel, center director of NREL’s Materials Science Center. “As we clean up the grid—in part by adding more PV to the grid—PV manufacturing will become cleaner, in turn making PV an even better product.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/05/energy-output-is-over-100-times-the-input-needed-to-manufacture-solar-panels/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,SINGAPORE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 5, 2022",Energy output is over 100 times the input needed to manufacture solar panels,"Maxeon Solar Technologies, a major PV module producer based in Singapore, revealed the results of a third-party energy payback performance evaluation of its Maxeon 3 panels in its 2021 annual sustainability report. 
Energy payback is the period required for a renewable energy system to generate the same amount of energy that was used to produce the system itself. The assessment considers the cumulative energy demand over all the life cycle stages of solar panels and considers local grid efficiencies for different global locations. 
The test found that Maxeon 3 solar panels had an energy payback period ranging from 0.13 to 0.45 years for ground mounted module, and 0.27 to 0.92 years for a residential rooftop system. For ground mounted panels, the energy payback period can be as little as 47.5 days. 
Spread over the 40-year performance warranty on the panels, the energy output exceeds the input more than 100 times over its lifetime, marking a significant milestone for the sustainability of PV technology.
“Maxeon strives to maintain its sustainability leadership position in the solar industry by continuing our development of more efficient, sustainable and longer-lasting panels that can ensure easy access to solar for all. As more countries and corporations pledge to achieve net-zero emissions, renewable energy will play a pivotal role in enabling this transition. Maxeon is delighted to be a key player in the race to achieving net-zero by supporting the growing demand for solar energy coupled with social and governance best practices.” Jeff Waters, Chief Executive Officer of Maxeon Solar Technologies
Sustainability Report 2021
Maxeon shared in its 2021 sustainability report that it delivered 899 MW of clean energy in 2021, namely its solar panels. The company’s impact led to over 52 million tons of carbon emissions abatement that year.
It committed to decreasing both the energy intensity and carbon intensity of manufacturing its panels from 2020 levels by 10% in 2025 and 20% in 2030. It also seeks to cut water use by 5% and waste creation by 20% by 2030.
For social goals in its ESG report, the company reported an industry-leading low rate of workplace safety incidences, and it has zero cases of non-compliance with human rights laws. It seeks to boost its traceability even further by 2025 by putting its supply information on blockchain, making supplier data is available within 4 hours of inquiry.
In 2021 the manufacturer introduced the Air panel, a thin, flexible module designed to be adhered to low weight load bearing commercial roofs, which the company said represents a 4 GW market unserved by traditional solar panels that are too heavy for such structures.
The panel manufacturer also announced it joined the Singapore Low Carbon Network as an inaugural member as part of PwC Singapore’s Asia Pacific Centre for Sustainability Excellence. It formed new partnerships with Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore and National University of Singapore for continued advancement of its technology.
“With less than ten years left to meet the UN’s 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, renewable energy will be a key engine powering both Singapore’s and the world’s decarbonization agenda. We warmly welcome Maxeon Solar Technologies to the United Nations Global Compact and look forward to working alongside them to take decisive action for the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Esther Chang, Executive Director, Global Compact Network Singapore.

The report covers all types of customer-sited renewable energy, but the vast majority of interconnected systems are rooftop solar systems, and the data contained is almost entirely rooftop solar data.
In 2021, Florida interconnected 40,395 new residential solar systems totaling nearly 342 MW of added capacity. The additions bring the state to 130,947 total residential solar systems representing just under 1.2 GW of overall residential solar capacity. At the end of 2020, the state registered 90,552 systems with a total capacity of 835 MW, so the additions in 2021 represent a growth of just under 45% in new systems and roughly 41% in added capacity.
FL PSC released new rooftop solar #s late Friday for calendar year 2021:
– 40,000+ new systems statewide. 130,947 total.
– 44.6% annual growth from 90,553 in 2020.
– Avg % of Florida IOU customers with solar: 1.23%
– FPL lags other IOUs at 0.66% (0.79% with Gulf added)
— Scott Thomasson (@scotthomasson) July 5, 2022

In pulling some additional data, Scott Thomasson, a Tallahassee-based clean energy attorney and policy strategist shared that 1.25% of Floridian investor-owned utility customers now have solar energy systems installed. Florida’s investor-owned utilities include Duke Energy Florida, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Gulf Power (owned by FPL), and Tampa Electric company.
The growth of Florida’s rooftop solar market in 2021 alone was significant, and this progress is set to continue into 2022 and beyond, especially since Gov. Ron DeSantis’ April veto of House Bill 741. HB 741 would have phased down the value of net metering and opened the door for utilities to add fixed charges to solar customer bills.
Had the bill been signed by Gov. DeSantis, starting in 2023, payments to solar customers would have regress from a retail rate to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a minute fraction of the retail rate. The phase out was set to slash payment rates to solar customers by 50% in four years and would drop further still to the avoided cost rate by 2029. The bill would have also allowed for fixed charges to grid connected solar customers starting in 2026, with no limit on the fixed charges outlined in the bill text.
The veto of the bill was described by the Solar Energy Industries Association as a “major win for energy freedom and Florida’s clean energy economy.”

Solar generation across the five utilities will rise to only 9% by 2030, and wind generation will reach just 1%, the study found. Gas generation will continue to increase through 2030, while coal generation will decline from 12% to 6%.
SACE reviewed the most recent ten-year resource plans for the five utilities, which indicated modest clean energy progress through 2030. If each utility’s progress then continued at the same rate, they would meet their announced clean energy goals by 2071 or later, the study found, as shown below. In comparison, SACE said, the scientific consensus is that global emissions must peak by 2025, decline rapidly, and reach net-zero by 2050 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, citing a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The IPCC report was “really clear” that the first step to achieving the targets it laid out is to stop building new fossil fuel infrastructure, said Maggie Shober, director of utility reform at SACE, in a webinar. The SACE report graphed the projected decarbonization path for each utility, in comparison to pathways to zero by 2030 or 2050, as in the graph below for Southern Company.

While new fossil gas plants planned by many of the utilities have lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal plants, Shober said, upstream methane emissions from gas production and distribution, which SACE estimated at 1% to 5%, “make the math a lot more difficult to justify those new gas plants.” The cost of solar continues to decline, while the cost of storage is declining rapidly, she added.
Words and deeds
SACE highlighted each of the five utilities’ recent actions with regard to renewables deployment, stating that:

Shober said in the webinar that citizens could influence their utility’s pace of decarbonization by working to make utilities’ resource plans better, both through involvement with groups like SACE, and by learning who are the regulators for their utility, finding out where they stand on decarbonization, and getting involved in choosing those regulators, where possible.

The two signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which Compass Minerals would supply LGES with as much as 40% of the company’s planned annual phase-one lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide production from its lithium brine development project at its Ogden, Utah facility. Per the terms of the MOU, Compass Minerals would commit for seven years, starting in 2025, with an option to add more once the development project is complete.
LG’s energy solution business provides battery solutions for electric vehicles and hybrids, mobile battery solutions for power tools and IT equipment, and energy storage solutions for grid-scale, commercial, and residential batteries. Its residential battery, the LG Chem, has held a significant market share position in the United States for several years.
Compass Minerals reported that it is pursuing the development of an approximately 2.4 mMT lithium resource on the Great Salt Lake in Utah, at its Ogden facility.
“Our lithium vision is to support the North American battery market by accelerating the development of a sustainable and secure domestic lithium supply chain,” said Chris Yandell, head of lithium for Compass Minerals. “Entering into this commercial relationship with a proven manufacturing leader like LGES will help enable that vision, as well as assist LGES in solidifying its U.S. supply chain.”
Compass Minerals is the first US-based lithium producer to partner with LGES, and the MoU comes at a critical time with the Biden Administration looks to strengthen the US supply chain and manufacturing capabilities.
“Securing key raw materials has become critically important, in order to maintain our lead position in the global battery market,” said Dongsoo Kim, Senior Vice President of Procurement Center at LG Energy Solution. “LGES will make sure to support establishment of steady supply chain in North America, while it continues to seek and acquire environmentally friendly produced battery-grade lithium worldwide.”
Previously, LGES had agreed to purchase up to 150,000 tonnes a year of North American made battery-grade lithium as part of a six-year “take-or-pay” agreement from the Vancouver-based Sigma Lithium in October of last year.
LGES is manufacturing batteries in a plant in Holland, Michigan, with double-digit gigawatt-scale production lines being added to the facility, according to Jorg Jurgens, director of energy storage systems. This adds on to an earlier announcement from LG that it is investing $1.7 billion to increase the production capacity for battery cells and packs fivefold from 5 GWh to 25 GWh at its Michigan plant.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/05/modeling-inverters-and-weather-oh-my/,"MARKETS,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 5, 2022","Modeling, inverters, and weather – oh my!","Fourteen groups, including kWh Analytics, have come together to release the 2022 Solar Risk Assessment (SRA). This document brings attention to the challenges that have resulted in reduced electricity generation at solar power facilities.
The report found that when it comes to the money, 92% of lost earnings – before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) – are a result of reduced electricity generation. Thus, the report attempts to pick apart why generation fell short of projected goals.

kWh Analytics cites three main challenges: 
The report suggests that p99 events, which are supposed to happen once every hundred years, are happening every six years. kWh says that developers’ probability estimates are simply unrealistic, and suggest looking for better, data driven projections.
The greatest loss of revenue came from inverters being down more often than developers projected. A report by NovaSource, which manages 20 GW of utility-scale solar facilities, found that 60% of generation losses were due to downed inverters.

The group looks at failure rate and mean time to repair (MTTR) when measuring their inverters. They found an interesting nuance: inverters fail more, and encounter longer repair times during the first two years. After the first two years, failure rates and repair times improve.
The facility manager of NovaSource suggests that the repair timeframe challenge during the first two years is due to a misalignment of warranty and responsibility during those early hardware periods. During this window, manufacturers have a greater warranty responsibility and put greater limitations on what the contractors can do to inverters to attempt to repair or replace.
Interestingly, after the first two years of inverter life, the amount of uptime increases greatly – to over 99%. This is likely due to electronic failures being weeded out in the field versus in the factory quality check, as well as the discovery and repair of any errors made during installation.
A separate analysis within the report found that 45% of utility-scale solar under management – 9.9 GWac of capacity – was run by inverters whose manufacturers had gone out of business. The big names are easily recognized: GE, AR, ABB, Kaco, and Schneider. All of these companies are still around, but they’re not manufacturing inverters in this space anymore.

The analysis found that this ‘abandoned’ capacity measured between 1.9 and 2.7 million MWh in production losses, valued between $97-174 million per year in 2017 and 2018.
It is suggested that the repowering of facilities will require more hardware and will need to occur earlier than financial models initially projected. And when adjusting from one inverter model to another, it is sometimes required to rewire portions of the solar field to meet the new requirements.
NovaSource, an O&M company with many gigawatts of capacity under management, noted:
Solar facilities with equipment from discontinued inverter manufacturers saw average inverters perform at 85% technical availability. In contrast, industry standard aims for 97% to 99% power plant availability.
NovaSource and kWh Analytics say that these inverter issues – reduced availability, and out of business manufacturers – are good reasons for developers and asset owners to mitigate risks by testing inverter units in the warehouse before deploying them. They also recommend stocking these units more aggressively.
Additional generation and O&M factors that were considered in the analysis:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/05/hybridizing-floating-solar-with-hydropower/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 5, 2022",Hybridizing floating solar with hydropower,"NREL scientists have tried to quantify the operational benefits of combining floating PV generation with hydropower plants.
In “Enabling Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FPV) Deployment,” the researchers considered both the long- and short-term combination of the two energy sources. In their proposed system configuration, the hydropower facility would rely on a grid interconnection capacity that equals its installed capacity. The floating PV array, meanwhile, would be 50% of the nameplate capacity, with its tilt angle set at 11 degrees.
The scientists considered PV curtailment on an hourly, daily, and seasonal basis. They said that the hybridization of the two energy sources could provide benefits from the plant level to the system level.
“Actual hydropower plant flexibility can vary significantly by reservoir size, number of generator units and their characteristics, environmental constraints, and within seasons,” they explained. “For the purpose of our study, we assumed that hydropower was only constrained by available water and a ramp rate.”
They found that the combination of floating PV and hydropower could reduce solar curtailment. “At a system level, the cost optimal operational decision is to maximally utilize low-to-zero marginal cost resources by dispatching solar and conserving hydropower resources for later in the year if the hydropower is flexible enough to do so,” they said.
Floating arrays connected to hydropower facilities could also generate more electricity, thanks to curtailment reduction.
“At the diurnal scale, results suggest that full hybridization could lower generator
operations and maintenance costs and reduce cycling for gas-fired generation by taking advantage of more hydropower flexibility,” they said. “At the seasonal scale, results suggest that hybridizing FPV leads to more optimal use of water resources with hydropower generation reduced in the wet season to conserve water for use during the dry season.”
Looking forward, the NREL researchers said more work is needed to assess system costs.
“This kind of analysis would require more spatially and temporally resolved data, as well as a production cost model that can model at a sub-hourly timescale,” they said.
A similar study was published last year by a research group from the Islamic University of Technology, in Bangladesh. They showed that the two energy sources could be perfectly optimized and that PV could compensate for water shortages during the winter, while hydropower could compensate for poor yields from the floating array during monsoon season.
Scientists have conducted several studies in recent years on the combination of the two technologies. Past NREL research showed that linking solar with hydro in a full hybrid system configuration at every hydroelectric facility in the world could result in the deployment of 7,593 GW of combined generation capacity.
