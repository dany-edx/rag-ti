https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/21/taxing-the-sun-experts-call-for-changes-to-potential-california-rooftop-solar-killing-proposal/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 21, 2022",“Taxing the sun”; experts call for changes to potential California rooftop solar-killing proposal,"Net Energy Metering (NEM) has been a critical policy in launching the California rooftop solar market, which has grown to a robust 1.3 million homes covered in panels, representing about 50% of the US residential market. It also helped launch distributed commercial rooftop projects, another key part of California’s race to electrical decarbonization.
That effort may be at risk now, as the proposed NEM 3.0 to be reviewed by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) includes cost-prohibitive measures. A recent survey of 4,000 active home solar shoppers found that 95% of homeowners are no longer interested in buying solar after viewing the cost assumptions of the new rate plan.
The proposal includes roughly an 80% reduction in the payment for excess solar energy sent to the grid, and tacks on an $8 per kW monthly charge for all solar customers, regardless of whether they have battery energy storage or not. A common-sized 8 kW system would be charged $64 a month, a fee that makes solar a non-option for most customers. In a ROTH Capital webinar, hailed grid expert Dr. Ahmad Faruqui condemned the proposed decision, calling it instead a “proposed dystopia” that extends a solar array’s payback period to an untenable 20 years or more.
The entire NEM 3.0 proposal can be viewed here.
Recently, Environmental Working Group (EWG) hosted a webinar with leaders from Environment California, Stanford University, Coalition for Environmental Equity and Economics, and EQ Research, marshalling their wide range of expertise to assess some of the potential damage from the proposal, disprove false assumptions in the proposal, and share that they have submitted alternatives.
EWG president Ken Cook kicked off the talk, holding back no punches, saying that the proposal is a monopoly-protecting move by California utilities. “We want California rooftop solar democratized,” he said.
Cook turned the conversation over to Laura Deehan, state director Environment California (Environment America), who joined her colleagues in calling the fixed grid access charge of $8 per kW a “solar tax.” Deehan said, “If we want clean energy, we shouldn’t be taxing the sun.”
In the ROTH webinar, Dr. Faruqui said the fee was an absurd penalty to solar customers. He said, “Why should someone buying carrots at the grocery store have to pay more because they also grow carrots at home?”
In 2016-2018, the state of Nevada went through massive oscillations in rooftop solar deployment after a similar (though less steep) net metering value reduction was approved. A $35 solar penalty fee, and a 75% drop in fees led to a nearly 90% drop in rooftop deployment growth in the state.
Unfortunately for Californians, the proposed NEM 3.0 is expected to be worse than Nevada’s changes. EQ analyst Ben Inskeep shared that EQ modeled the Nevada value loss in solar to be 57%, but in California, based on conservative assumptions, PG&E solar customers are expected to lose 71% in value, SDG&E customers 64%, and SCE 57%.
EQ said NEM 3.0 leads to an estimated 57-71% overall reduction in residential solar savings rate under conservative assumptions.
On top of this, Inskeep said the proposal creates complexity, a barrier for both customers and installers. Over the course of a year, EQ estimated that each customer will have 576 different export rates to manage. Regional installers will have to keep track of these rates and use them to justify savings estimates. Installers working over multiple environmental zones would have even more export rates, adding further complexity.
Environment California modeled the impact of the proposal, and found that rooftop solar could prevent the development of 148,000 acres of land. This is based on a state regulator estimated deployment of 28.5 GW of rooftop solar through 2045 in order to meet clean energy goals. That is an area about half the size of Los Angeles that could be preserved.
In October 2020, Newsom issued an executive order to protect 30% of California’s natural land and water areas by 2030, up from the 22% that is protected currently. Rooftop solar can help minimize conflicts between the state’s conservation and clean energy goals, said Environment California.
Mark Jacobson, fellow and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, said rooftop solar is important in protecting human health and minimizing risks. Replacing overhead wiring, overloaded transformers, and natural gas piping, rooftop solar replaces harmful and dangerous infrastructure from the built environment.
“The argument this proposal will help disadvantages communities is wrong… it will disproportionately kill them,” said Jacobson.
Jacobson pointed to the 2010 San Bruno natural gas explosion that killed eight people and cost PG&E over $2.2 billion. In 2017 alone, PG&E’s downed transmission wires were found at fault for massive wildfires, sticking the company with a $7.5 billion bill and leaving many Californians without homes. These costs incurred by the utilities are harmful to all Californians, as the financial fallout from these disasters is picked up by ratepayers in the form of a higher bill.
Jacobson said the continued use of new dirty energy sources will raise California’s air pollution death rates above the current level of 12,000 per year. Most of the additional deaths will occur in the Los Angeles basin and Central valley, where pollution levels already rank highest in the state, he said.
Esperanza Vielma of the Coalition for Environmental Equity and Economics (CEEE) joined the webinar, highlighting the action being taken by CEEE and other grassroots and advocacy organizations to fight for their communities.
Vielma said CEEE submitted a proposal to the CPUC, outlining potential job losses, and bringing attention to the limitations of the “market transition credit” that was pitched as a relief provision to disadvantages communities. The market transition credit offsets a small portion of the fixed grid participation charge for ten years. However, EQ noted the provision only offsets about 10% of new costs for PG&E customers, and 17% of SCE customers’ new costs. Plus, the ten-year provision steps down 25% in value each year, offering little relief.
Vielma noted that SDG&E customers are conspicuously left out of the market transition credit altogether. She said GRID Alternatives, CEEE and other community organizations submitted proposals asking for the inclusion of SDG&E and for improve transition credit values, but they were denied.

On January 13th, the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) organized a protest of the proposal, and over 1000 protestors demonstrated in front of the CPUC, and nearly 2000 more gathered in Grand Park, Los Angeles. Of the 230,000 US solar workers reported by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), as many as 68,000 jobs are put at risk by NEM 3.0, said IREC.
Following the rally, and numerous statements from industry leaders, experts, and advocates, Governor Gavin Newsom commented at a press meeting that there was still “work to be done” on the proposed decision.
January 27th has been marked in red ink on many calendars as the day the proposed decision may be passed. However, this may change, as EQ Research analyst Ben Inskeep shared that the the CPUC’s publicly-released schedule does not have NEM 3.0 on the docket for the 27th. This means the proposal could reach a vote as early as its next scheduled meeting on February 10th.
Tea-leaf reading here may suggest that an alternative proposal is being considered, said Cook. Deehan said, “We are hopeful the CPUC and Governor’s office will make the right choice and not pass NEM 3.0 as proposed.”

Horizon Solar and White Wing Ranch Solar are a pair of projects currently under development in Texas and Arizona, respectively. Located in Frio County, Texas, just south of San Antonio, the Horizon Solar project will have a generation capacity of 200 MW. Construction of the facility is expected to begin in September 2022 and be completed by December 31, 2023.
Located in Yuma County, Arizona, just west of Phoenix, the White Wing Ranch Solar project will have a generation capacity of 160 MW. Construction of the facility is expected to begin in May 2023 and be completed by June 30, 2024.
Each of the solar projects will utilize First Solar modules, as Leeward has an existing solar supply deal in place with First Solar.
In January 2021, it was announced that First Solar would be selling a 10 GW utility-scale solar project platform to Leeward Renewable Energy Development for $261 million, which officially closed in April 2021. The deal included the Rabbitbrush, Madison, Oak Trail, Horizon, and Ridgely projects, all of which were in different stages of development and pre-construction at the time, and the 30 MW Barilla Solar project, which is operational.
Under the terms of the deal, Leeward also bought 650 MW of First Solar’s Series 6 PV solar modules for its additional development opportunities, while the project acquisitions brought with them purchase orders for 888 MW of Series 6 modules. Leeward’s acquisition also included 242 MW of Series 4 modules safe-harbored under the solar investment tax credit (ITC) program, 148 MW of which were previously booked.
Verizon and Leeward have an existing relationship through previously signed REPAs for the 196 MW Big Plain and 100 MW Oak Trail solar projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/21/six-terawatt-hours-of-energy-storage-needed-for-zero-carbon/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 21, 2022",Six terawatt hours of energy storage needed for Zero Carbon,"The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has released its sixth paper – Grid Operational Impacts of Widespread Storage Deployment  – in their Storage Future Series. The purpose of the document is to analyze some of the effects of energy storage on the power grid as it evolves toward five unique scenarios in 2050.

The scenarios analyzed include the Reference Scenario, which follows all default pricing and technology assumptions by NREL. These assumptions can be found in the document, and other papers referenced, in full. NREL also examined the four following scenarios:

As noted in table A-1 above, even the Reference Scenario includes a lot of wind and solar – 20.4% and 28.8% of all US electricity, respectively. Solar PV generation projections among the five scenarios range from a low of 28.8% to a high of 46% in the High Natural Gas/Low Battery Cost scenario.
Interestingly, the Zero Carbon pathway predicts the third highest total of solar power out of the five scenarios at 33.4%. The solar is complemented by the highest wind volume in this scenario at 37.3%.
Energy storage power capacities range from 213 GW to 932 GW, with the average duration ranging from 4.7 to 6.5 hours. The chart below shows this volume being deployed in power, with its hourly rating specified by color. As time goes on, we see the longest duration batteries – and by far the highest total volume of product – installed in the 2040s as we approach the 2050 end year of the analysis.

The total volume of storage in the batteries ranges from 1.3 TWh to just over 6.0 TWh in the 94% renewable electricity, Zero Carbon, scenario. Several years ago, a different group of researchers suggested that the United States could get to 80% wind and solar with approximately 5.4 TWh of energy storage.
The researchers revealed some nuances between the various scenarios. For instance the Zero Carbon scenario results in large amounts of curtailment of wind and solar nearly 24 hours a day, all year round. This leads to the batteries actually being used less than in other scenarios because the wind and solar is always running, and in its over producing nature, meets the grid demands often.
Furthermore, as the volumes of renewables grow, it becomes clear that storage’s charging needs most aligns with solar power’s generation curves, due to solar’s daily predictability. The report notes that oftentimes wind power will over-generate for days on end, far longer than the energy storage hourly durations considered for this document.
An expected outcome was that even though energy storage’s capacity factor is relatively low across all scenarios – the actual time spent outputting electricity is only 10-20% – its capacity factor exceeded 75% during the top 10 net load hours across all scenarios and years.
The authors compare these capacity factors and the utilization technique of batteries to a recent analysis of combustion turbine generators in the United States – often referred to as peaking plants – which had an average capacity factor of 11% in 2019.
The authors pointed out several key benefits that energy storage delivered beyond simply offering electricity on demand.
The image above shows how additional storage decreases the number of times fossil fuel generators needed to start up. Avoided starts greatly reduce the overall cost of providing energy, as well as the amount of particulate released by burning fossils. This is due to the cold start-up period of peaker plants being less efficient.
On average, energy storage also increased powerline utilization rates. However, these utilization rates varied widely depending on location. Some regions saw greater powerline usage as these locations exported more energy than they were using. Areas with strong local balance between generation, storage, and demand saw lower powerline utilization as little was imported or exported.
Of course, the fact that storage was able to charge up with the overgeneration of wind and solar in the Zero Carbon scenarios was its greatest benefit.
Also seen was that diurnal storage – 12 hours of output and longer – does have an increasing opportunity as 2050 is reached, and 100% clean electricity is approached. However, longer term storage wasn’t analyzed in this report; however, might be in future documents from NREL.
As an aside, one can currently purchase 3.08 GWh worth of Tesla Megapacks for just over $1 billion. At these prices, 6 TWh would cost about $2 trillion. The Gross Domestic Product of the United States in 2021 was about $23 trillion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/21/duke-energy-launches-bring-your-own-battery-study-for-resilience-testing-in-florida/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,FLORIDA",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 21, 2022",Duke Energy launches ‘Bring Your Own Battery’ study for resilience testing in Florida,"Duke Energy Florida has launched an innovative ‘Bring Your Own Battery’ study to learn more about customer use of battery technology and explore opportunities to leverage existing battery energy storage systems to improve grid resiliency. Eligible participants are residential Duke Energy Florida customers who currently have batteries installed in their homes to provide backup power in case of an outage.
During the 12-month study,  Duke Energy will be able to call on the energy stored in these devices to support the grid during times of peak demand. The expectation is to reduce energy costs for participants and give customers the opportunity to participate directly in the company’s transition to clean energy
“Batteries are an exciting technology that will play a significant and evolving role in how energy is delivered to customers now and in the future,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “With the introduction of studies like BYOB, we are developing ways to provide even greater value to our customers while improving energy resiliency and advancing solar technologies in Florida.”
Duke Energy is working with vendors including Sunrun, Generac, SolarEdge and Virtual Peaker. These companies will offer existing battery customers in Florida the opportunity to participate in the BYOB battery study, for which they will be compensated monetarily, according to a spokesperson for Duke Energy.
“We want to provide innovative solutions that increase grid resilience and expand home backup power options,” said Mary Powell, Sunrun chief executive officer. “Sunrun’s partnership with Duke Energy will provide affordable, clean, backup power solutions for households in Florida, while also supporting grid reliability at the community level. This study is an example of how collaboration can accelerate the transition to a clean energy future.”
Duke Energy Florida, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, owns a diverse generation mix of natural gas, coal and renewables. The company has clean energy goals of at least a 50% carbon reduction by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Duke reports that it is on track to own or purchase 16,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2025, and is investing in major electric grid upgrades and expanded battery storage, and exploring zero-emitting power generation technologies such as hydrogen and advanced nuclear.
Last fall Duke announced a project with Honeywell to test flow batteries, which use an electrolyte to convert chemical energy into electricity for storage and deployment. That project is scheduled to begin this year at Duke Energy’s Emerging Technology and Innovation Center in Mount Holly, North Carolina.  Another study, announced last year, is a partnership between Duke and Malta Inc., in which the two companies plan to test a novel approach to turning coal-fired plants into energy storage solutions.
This story was updated on Jan. 21, 2022 to note that participants will be monetarily compensated.
