And, depending on when construction begins on a project, a certain journeyman to apprenticeship ratio must be met.
In a recent Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) webinar on the IRA, the registered apprenticeship programs (RAPs) were described as “structured work based learning programs that prepare and train workers for a specific occupation, and meet the needs of employers for skilled workers”.
For those considering starting an apprenticeship program, one resource is Adaptive Construction Solutions, which is a clean energy hub that recently won a U.S. Department of Labor grant. The hub focuses on assisting employers in creating and registering their own apprenticeship programs.
New programs are springing up across the country such as Real World Academy in New Jersey and the Sustainability Hub in Illinois. Rethink Electric is a contractor in Illinois that specializes in solar installation and electrical services, and it launched an apprentice program back in 2017 to train its own workers. Recently the company is experiencing great interest in its apprenticeship program and the company reports that its 2023 class is the largest to date with 23 apprentices learning the ins and outs of solar installation and electrical work.
“The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act signed by Governor Pritzker in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Biden in 2022 both contribute greatly to the current momentum in the Illinois solar market,” said Dawn Heid, CEO of Rethink Electric.
The merit-based apprenticeship cohort, called Rethink Electrical Advanced Program (REAP), is an education program in which participants are paid employees of Rethink Electric, often earning prevailing wage. Apprentices are assigned to jobs that help them learn the basics of solar construction, including how to use the tools, how a jobsite runs, and completing OSHA 10 safety certification. For the next 4 years afterward, participants follow a traditional paid electrical apprenticeship that includes classroom work and hands-on job training, with the goal of graduating to a journeyman level.
“Solar can be complicated and at times dangerous, which makes apprenticeship programs much more important,” Heid said. “The people involved put in a serious commitment. We need to develop them into skilled construction professionals to make sure our jobs are completed correctly.”
Apprentices in the REAP program come from multiple referral sources throughout the state, and its director of education reaches out to local high schools and partners with pre-apprenticeship programs through the Chicago Urban League Workforce Development Center.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/02/duke-deploys-solar-plus-battery-storage-microgrid-in-appalachia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH CAROLINA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Duke deploys solar plus battery storage microgrid in Appalachia,"A rural Appalachian town named for a thermal hot spring on the North Carolina-Tennessee border will soak up clean electrons from the sun and a large grid-scale battery system. Duke Energy completed construction on a 2 MW solar and 4.4 MWh storage project in Hot Springs, N.C., a town with population of just 500.
The Hot Springs microgrid provides grid reliability services to the electric grid, such as frequency and voltage regulation and ramping support and capacity during system peak power usage.
“Duke Energy has numerous smaller microgrids on our system, but this is our first microgrid that can power an entire small town if its main power line experiences an outage,” said Jason Handley, general manager of Duke Energy’s Distributed Energy Group.
The rural Appalachia town, named for a natural thermal spring at the confluence of the French Broad River and Spring Creek, was faced with limited transmission and distribution rerouting options should a power outage occur. During its testing phase, Duke Energy’s microgrid was able to pick up the town’s entire load from a black start without any help from the energy grid – using only the solar and battery storage to restore power. The microgrid served the town’s load while the company gathered data.
“Through energy storage and microgrids, Duke Energy can enable the integration of more renewables onto the grid and help improve reliability while keeping costs affordable for customers and the communities we serve,” said Handley.
Wärtsilä Energy, the Finnish energy company, supplied the battery energy storage system for the grid project. The microgrid utilizes Wärtsilä’s GEMS Digital Energy Platform, an energy management system for integrated control of both solar and energy storage resources.
In a recent interview with pv magazine USA, Andrew Tang, Vice President of Energy Storage & Optimization at Wärtsilä Energy, said the energy storage systems provider is on track to deliver 4 GWh of battery systems this year.  With momentum from the federal Inflation Reduction Act spurring increased activity for energy storage, Wärtsilä expects to see growth at about 20% CAGR per year from 2023 into 2024.
Wärtsilä’s grid storage systems are housed in a 1.5 MWh trailer cube, measuring 8 feet x 44 feet per trailer, meaning the Hot Springs battery system will use about three storage trailer units, Tang said.
The company’s U.S. storage business has seen steady activity in Hawaii, Texas, California, Arizona and Georgia, with assorted smaller dispatched systems also cropping up in the Southeast region, which Tang called a “hotbed for solar plus storage.”  
“The Hot Springs inverter-only-based community microgrid is a great step forward for Duke Energy and our customers. This project has reduced the need for equipment upgrades in an environmentally sensitive area,” said Handley. “We are using lessons learned from this first-of-its-kind installation to take to our other microgrids under construction in Indiana and Florida.”
So far Duke Energy has over 60 MW of microgrid projects s connected throughout its regulated areas around the Southeast region. In Asheville, N.C., Duke operates a 9-megawatt lithium-ion battery system at a substation site in the Rock Hill community. In Haywood County, N.C., the utility operates a 3.8 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery and 10 kW solar DC microgrid serving a telecommunications tower, located on Mount Sterling in the Smoky Mountains National Park.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/02/three-party-joint-venture-formed-for-250-mw-of-new-york-community-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,NEW YORK",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Three-party joint venture formed for 250 MW of New York community solar,"Three companies, Bullrock Renewables, NXTGenREA, and Delaware River Solar, have formed a joint venture to construct, own and operate a 250 MW portfolio of community solar projects in New York State.
The three expect the projects to be online by 2025. The portfolio will include 120 MW to be completed at the end of 2024 and 130 MW operational by March 2025. Combined, the three companies have delivered more than $1.5 billion of solar assets since 2012, making the group one of the largest private entities in the space.
New York remains one of the major markets for community solar in the United States, passing 1 GW of installed capacity in March 2022. The state has a goal of reaching 70 % of electricity generation from renewable resources by 2030. New York also targets 10 GW of solar by the 2030 deadline.
Bullrock Renewables is a Vermont-based company with over 130 MW of solar project development history in New England and New York. The company focuses on new development, construction, purchasing existing assets, and lending.
NXTGenREA will be providing its services via XGR, a new renewables and finance platform launched by the company. XGR is built on over 30 years of renewable technology tax enhanced investment experience. The company has financed over 300 solar assets since 2011 and is integrated with flexible tax equity partnerships.
Delaware River Solar, based in New York, has constructed over 45 community solar facilities and reached over 20,000 customers via its subscription service in six years of operation.
“Renewable energy, specifically solar, is boosting the economy, creating jobs, and leaving the world a better place,” said Ross Sanner, chief executive officer, Bullrock Renewables. “We look forward to continuing to expand our relationships in the clean energy sector as we continue to scale this exciting company.’’
Much of the community solar developed in the state has received benefits from the state’s NY-Sun program, a state solar incentive program for distributed generation assets. Since being launched in 2011, NY-Sun has put forth more than $1.8 billion to advance solar buildout in the state.
This funding has supported the installation of solar on the rooftop or property of 165,000 homes, spanning every county in New York, providing over $1.3 billion in incentives and leveraging $6.1 billion in private investment. It has led to over 2,500% solar growth in the State, and the delivery of enough renewable energy to power over 627,000 New York homes.
New York now houses 12,000 jobs in the solar industry and has driven down the cost of solar 70% in 10 years. NY-Sun has also funded $30 million for projects aimed at benefiting environmental justice and disadvantaged communities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/02/enphase-demonstrates-bidirectional-ev-charger/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Enphase demonstrates bidirectional EV charger,"Enphase Energy, known for its microinverters, announced a successful demonstration of its first bidirectional EV charger that enables vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) use.
The charger will work in conjunction with the Enphase Energy System, which includes IQ microinverters, the IQ Gateway and system controller. These are all managed by the Enphase app, where homeowners can see the flow of energy and see the level of charge of the EV battery. By leveraging the power of the microinverter to convert DC power of the car to AC  power of the home, the bidirectional charger connects to EV, and both charges and discharges the car battery. The IQ microinverter converts DC power of the car to AC power of the home.
The Enphase bidirectional charger can be used in three ways:
An Enphase Bidirectional EV Charger connects to an Enphase Energy System in a similar fashion to an IQ Battery
The bidirectional charger requires 240 V AC, and it can connect directly to the grid or through IQ System Controller. Enphase cautions, however, that when connected directly to the grid, some V2H features are disabled. The company says that its EV charger is expected to work with electric vehicles that support stands such as CCS (combined charging system) and the Japanese charging standard, CHAdeMO.  At present, separate demonstration prototypes are made for CCS and CHAdeMO. It supports 200 VDC to 1000 VDC for EV batteries.
Enphase is working with EV manufacturers to bring this revolutionary technology to market. A timeframe for release has not been announced.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/02/colorado-utility-delays-stalling-out-rooftop-solar-projects-for-six-months-or-more/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Utility delays stalling out rooftop solar projects for six months or more,"Colorado residents and solar installers have accused Xcel Energy, operator of utilities in eight states, of dragging its feet in the interconnection process for rooftop solar projects.
“They have no urgency to put them in because, as soon as they put them in, that meter profit goes down,” said Paul Webster, a Colorado resident. Webster had an array installed just before winter, and it is sitting on his roof, inactive, waiting for Xcel to move forward on a simple meter installation.
Colorado installers report that it is taking six months for the utility to install net energy meters to enable projects to connect to the grid. This presents a challenge to many customers, as delays often lead to a higher rate of cancellations and reports of bad customer experience.
Permitting, inspection, and interconnection represent 8% of the U.S. residential solar cost stack. Based on data from its members, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates that a one week delay in system installation due to permitting, inspection and interconnection processes increases the client cancelation rate by 10%.
“We have a nice sunny day out there right now and I’m paying for my electricity,” said Webster. “I have 18 panels on my roof and I’m paying for electricity after I paid for the solar install.”
“It’s been just a disaster from start to finish – projects lost, projects delayed, weird error messages. Every residential rooftop company that works in Xcel is dealing with this,” said Mike Kruger, president and chief executive officer of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association.
Kruger says the delays are hurting hundreds of customers who are paying for systems they can’t use. Solar installers are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars as most aren’t paid until the project is actively producing energy.
Doug Southard, owner of Southard’s Solar Energy and Construction, has been in business for 17 years, but he said the “financially devastating” delays are causing him to struggle to keep the business in operation. Southard has 29 customers waiting on the utility, some of whom have had dormant solar arrays sitting on their roofs since May 2022.
“With no end in sight, with continued frustration, and continued impact on customers and businesses, it’s time folks with regulatory and legislative power to do something,” said Kruger, calling on the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to take action.
The Colorado PUC said it is investigating the delays, but declined to say whether it would take any action.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/02/ev-batteries-alone-could-satisfy-short-term-grid-storage-demand/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",EV batteries alone could satisfy short-term grid storage demand,"From pv magazine global
With gigawatts of batteries on wheels expected to enter electricity markets around the world this decade, much ink has been spilt debating the theoretical benefits of V2G technology. While it has been around for over a decade, the sector has been struggling to identify a viable commercial model and make V2G attractive for EV owners reluctant to cede control of their vehicles.
However, numerous analyses and trials have shown that a two-way flow of electricity from EV batteries could deliver substantial opportunities for both soaking up excess renewables generation and releasing electricity back into the grid to manage issues in real time. And now a new research paper adds further evidence of the technology’s potential.
According researchers from the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Leiden University, in the Netherlands, and the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), EV batteries alone could be used to satisfy short-term grid storage demand across most regions by as early as 2030.
In their assessment, the researchers considered both EV batteries in the vehicles that can be used via V2G and after the end of vehicle life, when they are removed and used in stationary storage. They estimated a total technical capacity of 32-62 TWh by 2050.
“This is significantly higher than the 3.4 TWh to 19.2 TWh required by 2050 in [International Renewable Energy Agency] and Storage lab scenarios,” said the paper.
In addition to quantifying the global EV battery capacity available for grid storage using an integrated model incorporating future EV battery deployment, the researchers also factored in battery degradation and market participation which for V2G may vary regionally depending on future market incentives and infrastructure, along with other factors.
Their focus was on the main EV battery markets of China, India, the European Union, and the United States, and what was called the “Rest of the World region.” In what they describe as conservative estimates, the researchers assess that low V2G participation rates of just 12% to 43% are needed to provide short-term grid storage demand globally without any second-use batteries in stationary storage.
If it is assumed that only half of second-use batteries are used on the grid, the required participation rate of V2G drops to below 10%, the researchers found. They discussed their findings in “Electric vehicle batteries alone could satisfy short-term grid storage demand by as early as 2030”, which was recently published in Nature Communications.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/02/13-european-pv-equipment-makers-pitch-their-machines-to-u-s-pv-manufacturers/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",13 European PV equipment makers pitch their machines to U.S. PV manufacturers,"Representatives of 13 European PV equipment makers, mostly from Germany, met with U.S. PV manufacturers in a daylong conference and networking event in Washington, D.C.
VDMA Photovoltaic Equipment, a section of the VDMA trade group representing the machinery and equipment manufacturing industry in Germany and Europe, organized the event in cooperation with U.S. institutions.
The meeting’s purpose was “essentially to matchmake between EU equipment suppliers and PV manufacturers expanding in the U.S.,” said Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra-Low Carbon Solar Alliance, an event co-sponsor.
Parr told the international gathering that with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the U.S. is incentivizing, for the first time, both PV manufacturing and deployment, over “a clear 10-year runway.”
The U.S. market opportunity for PV equipment manufacturers is $1 to 1.5 billion through 2030 for capital equipment alone, said Lawrence Heath, a consultant with McKinsey, not counting profit margin or add-on contracts for operation and maintenance. That projection is based on an assumption that the U.S. would add 50 GW of PV manufacturing capacity by 2030, he said.
Christian Staudt, a partner at McKinsey, showed a bar chart of the countries of origin for key components in the PV supply chain, with China shown in red, and said “taking geopolitics aside, no one would design a supply chain like this and say ‘That’s a resilient supply chain,’ because if anything goes wrong in the red color, this is breaking down.”
The U.S. will need to install 100 GW of PV per year by 2030, said Markus Beck, a program manager at the Solar Energy Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy, citing DOE’s Solar Futures Study. “Currently, ingot, wafer or cell manufacturing depend on technology transfer” of equipment into the U.S., he said.
“This has to be sustainable in the long term,” he said. “This cannot be just put it in the ground, and then when IRA disappears, it fails. That means you have to be competitive.” Even if the U.S. can produce domestically 50% to 60% of the PV modules needed, he said, 40% of modules will still be imported, so domestic producers “will have to compete with the importer,” and to do that “you have to have strong, reliable partners,” he said.
VDMA Photovoltaic Equipment described a panel discussion at the event as focusing on “technological sovereignty by strong US/EU friendshoring relationships in light of the Inflation Reduction Act.”
The 13 participating European PV equipment makers, and their primary technologies, are:
VDMA members have been involved in 30 projects totaling 72 GW of PV capacity in the past two years, said Puzant Baliozian, a project manager with the organization.
Stating one more reason for domestic production, Parr, with the Ultra-Low Carbon Solar Alliance, said that some PV modules are produced with carbon emissions at half the level of other modules, or less, and that buyers “increasingly recognize this and value it.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/02/sunpower-signs-three-california-multi-family-building-associations/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,PROCUREMENT,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",SunPower solar to top three multi-family buildings in California,"SunPower, a residential solar and energy storage provider, signed three new California multi-family housing customers to its multi-family solar business, underscoring progress toward providing solar to a larger group of people in apartment dwellings.
Builders of apartment buildings can reduce out-of-pocket expenses required to install solar by taking advantage of state and federal incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and distribute the economic benefits back to residents. Income generated from the sale of solar energy by the building owner can help offset the solar investment more quickly.
U.S. housing developers are expected to build 4.3 million new apartment units over the next 12 years, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council and National Apartment Association. SunPower helps builders lower their operating costs and build sustainable residences with solar-as-a-service by using solar systems and storage.
SunPower’s three new multi-family customers are:
The Grupe Company
Atop the 248-unit Brix 325 Apartments in Santa Rosa, Calif., SunPower’s solar systems are projected to save Grupe residents 10% or more compared to sourcing power directly from their local utility. Stockton, Calif.-based Grupe will include solar credits and electricity costs alongside the tenant’s monthly rent. The Brix 325 Apartment complex is ready to lease by spring 2023. 
“By incorporating solar into our homes since 2005, our residents can avoid rising utility rates while doing the right thing for the environment,” said Mark Fischer, president of Grupe.
HomeFed Corporation
SunPower is finalizing the design of two San Diego, Calif., apartment buildings for HomeFed, a Carlsbad, Calif.-based developer owned by Jefferies Financial Group. Once complete, the Artisan at The Village of Escaya and Luminary at Cota Vera buildings are expected to generate 1.5 million kWh of clean energy in the first year of operations from 2,300 SunPower panels. This is projected to increase the total net operating income by $16 million and property value by over $9 million over the lifetime of both systems.
Metonic Real Estate Solutions
SunPower recently signed a new agreement with Metonic to power the Millennium Apartments, a low-rise community in Palm Desert, Calif. The project will include 2,200 SunPower panels, 18 solar carports, and dozens of EV charging stations that can provide an additional  revenue source for Metonic, which is based in Omaha, Neb. This 330-unit apartment community will help support the increasing demand for housing in the Coachella Valley region.
SunPower’s multifamily projects are typically under 1 MW per rooftop project, with 200 kW to 700 kW being an average range, a SunPower spokesman told pv magazine USA. All the builders are using SunPower’s Equinox panels known for their sleek design and high efficiency.
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, projects smaller than 1 MW qualify for a 30% investment tax credit without any specific workforce requirements, a major catalyst for the deployment of solar on multi-family buildings such as Grupe, HomeFed and Metonic’s units in California.
In December, the California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to cut the average export rate in California for rooftop solar energy from $0.30 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, making the cuts effective on April 15, 2023, in what’s referred to as Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM).  The April deadline for projects has spurred numerous California developments to file for new project permits and have projects installed ahead of time as the value of rooftop solar will change to $0.05 per kWh to $0.08 per kWh, several solar industry sources told pv magazine USA recently.
Richmond, Calif.-based SunPower traded at $18.07 per share this afternoon, down 23.2% from $23.53 per share on December 14, a day before the NEM 3.0 ruling was passed by the CPUC. The company trades for a $3.14 billion market capitalization, and reports its Q4 2022 financing earnings on Feb. 15, 2023.
