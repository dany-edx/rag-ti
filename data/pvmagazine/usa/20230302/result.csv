https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/02/important-code-requirements-and-recent-developments-for-pv-systems/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 2, 2023",Important code requirements and recent developments for PV systems,"In the first article of this series, the evolution of UL 1741 was outlined, including updates to IEEE 1547. It’s also relevant to understand the specific safety requirements regarding how PV circuits connect to inverters. These additional safety requirements are necessary to comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC). Three topics will be discussed in this article: PV direct current (DC) ground fault, PV DC arc fault and rapid shutdown.
The NEC, also known as NFPA 70, governs all electrical installations in the U.S. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) first published the code in 1897, which is now revised every three years. Conceptually, this code could be a uniform standard across the nation. In practice, individual states determine when to adopt any version of the NEC, creating a varied patchwork of regulation based on location.
The current adoption status is tracked by the NFPA – a regularly updated enforcement map of the U.S. can be found here.

This map illustrates that as of December 1, 2022, shortly after the publication of the 2023 edition of the NEC, only 25 states were enforcing the 2020 edition of the NEC, with all others enforcing an older edition. Article 690 in the NEC is focused on PV systems. This article first appeared in the 1984 edition of the NEC, 15 years before UL 1741 was published. The three topics of this article come from NEC article 690: PV DC ground faults are covered in NEC 2020 section 690.41(B), PV DC arc faults in 690.11, and rapid shutdown in section 690.12.
Ground fault detection
PV DC ground faults, in either positive or negative circuits, can happen for many reasons. Factors can include manufacturing defects, installation methods, rodents, project age combined with environmental stresses, and degradation of materials. Innovation in technology and materials has reduced these issues, but there is still risk. Reductions in the number of DC connections and improvements in wire management methods can further reduce ground fault occurrences.
PV DC ground fault detection is an important safety feature that indicates when either the positive or negative conductor unintentionally establishes a lower resistance (fault) path to ground. This can become a hazard because the fault can allow current flow through the fault path, often consisting of exposed conductive parts of the PV system. Originally, PV inverters were designed with transformers to boost converted alternating current (AC) voltage to the higher utility service levels. This transformer provided galvanic isolation of the DC side of the PV system from the AC conductors of the premises wiring system and its grounding electrode system. Because the PV array DC circuits were referenced to ground on the DC side of the inverter, the first ground fault detection was simply detecting current flow through the DC ground reference, such as by a fuse in the ground reference path.
The rapid adoption of transformer-less inverters coincided with concerns about fuse-based ground fault detection. Once the transformer was removed, the fuse-based method of ground fault detection was not possible since the PV array DC circuits could no longer reference the ground on the DC side of the inverter. To work with the transformer-less inverters, a two-part ground fault detection system was developed. This system verifies high resistance of both PV conductors to ground and monitors residual current for leakage.
The improved method more readily identified faults and changes that indicate PV system degradation. The updated detection method was incorporated into UL 1741 as a Certification Requirements Decision (CRD) for smaller non-isolated systems in 2010.
Key Take Away: Robust, sensitive ground fault protection tailored to transformer-less inverters is well established.
Series arc fault detection
Series PV DC arc faults can occur when a circuit conductor is broken, or a connection is opened while current is flowing. This has been a problem with DC connectors, such as when they are not securely mated. Other potential series arc sources include manufacturing defects, improper installation, environmental stresses, and pairing different manufacturer’s connectors, known as mismatching.
Arc fault detection for PV DC ground circuits operating at 80V DC or greater first appeared in the 2011 edition of the NEC. The original listing process for DC arc fault interrupters UL 1699B, was published as an outline of investigation in 2011, but did not become a full Edition 1 standard until 2018. The full standard updated testing methodology to improve the performance and reliability of devices successfully achieving this listing.
The arc fault requirements that were added in section 690.11 required detection and interruption of a series arc. Once detected, the series arc should be extinguished by stopping all current flow in that circuit. Opening a PV DC circuit connection is a function that is straightforward for an inverter to perform. It’s possible for the inverter to provide all the functionality required by code (detection and interruption) internally. This can also be achieved via external devices designed and certified for PV DC arc fault detection and interruption. Correct detection of an arc, while ruling out false positives generated by things like the opening of a DC disconnect, is not an easy task. SMA was the first inverter manufacturer to achieve listing to UL 1699B in 2012 and, along with other manufacturers in the industry, has updated and improved the performance of devices carrying out this critical safety feature in the decade since.
Key Take Away: Code has required arc fault protection for more than ten years, and UL testing standards have been updated to greatly improve the performance of listed devices.
Rapid shutdown
Starting in 2014, the NEC included section 690.12 for rapid shutdown of PV systems. The rapid shutdown requirement was designed to reduce the potential for firefighters working near a PV system to be shocked by energized wiring that may be concealed from them.
Originally, conductors outside a 10-foot boundary of a PV array, or penetrating a building of 5 feet or more, were required to reduce voltage (to 30V or less) and power within 10 (later 30) seconds of the initiation of rapid shutdown. Equipment performing this task only had to be listed, but not listed to a rapid shutdown standard.
The 2017 NEC greatly expanded section 690.12. The biggest modification was the addition of rapid shutdown requirements internal to the array boundary (reduced to one foot around the array). Three options for compliance are allowed, use of any one of which fully satisfies the requirement.
The first option was to have the array certified as a rapid shutdown PV array. This required a safety standard that had not been written. In the 2020 NEC, this first option was revised to require a certified PV hazard control system and an informational note referred to UL 3741 PV Hazard Control. This standard was published in December of 2020, almost four full years after this “option” for compliance was introduced into code.
The second option required conductors within the array boundary to be limited to 80V DC or less within 30 seconds. Compliance under this option required inserting module level electronics (MLE) underneath each module, such as DC/DC optimizers or microinverters. Unlike the first option, devices applicable to a PV system allowing compliance under this option were available at the publishing of the 2017 NEC, resulting in the de facto requirement of module level electronics to comply with 2017 NEC 690.12(B)(2).
The third option was added to consider building integrated PV (BIPV) or other systems that would not have any exposed wiring methods or conductive parts and be installed more than 8 feet from any grounded conductive parts.
Since the publication of UL 3741, there have been several manufacturers (system integrators and racking suppliers) that have obtained a UL 3741 certification. UL 3741 allows for different methods of PV hazard control and defines the evaluation required to determine acceptable risk levels of PV arrays using these methods.
Compliance with UL 3741 can be obtained by using specific levels of physical and or fault protection to remove the need for inserting any electronic devices in the DC string, or through the use of module level electronics or string voltage limiters.
Using protection methods (such as better wire routing and securing to keep wiring from faulting to frames or racking) without requiring the use of electronic devices has the added benefit of reducing ground fault risk and reducing the number of DC connectors. The concern of arcs caused from mismatched connectors resulted in the 2020 NEC adding in 690.33(C) the requirement that mating connectors either be identical type and brand or listed and identified for intermatability. Reducing the complexity of the PV system will increase the reliability, reduce injury risk and decrease likelihood of fire.
Key Take Away: Rapid shutdown requirements are not changing rapidly in the NEC. However, many more options for compliance are becoming commercially available with the publication of UL 3741.
There is a noticeable lag between when code requires changes and when testing and listing standards are established to ensure commercial devices can provide that safety feature. In the final article of this series, we will discuss an area of code that is newer and changing very rapidly – requirements for energy storage systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/02/u-s-solar-workforce-to-double-in-less-than-a-decade/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 2, 2023",U.S. solar workforce needs to double in less than a decade,"A transition to a carbon-free energy sector is going to take a large, well-trained workforce, and readying that workforce may pose a challenge in the near-term. The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) said 89% of solar firms reported in 2021 they’ve had difficulty finding qualified applicants.
Solar now represents 59% of the clean power capacity in development, gaining 4% in share from 2021 to 2022, said the American Clean Power Association. To reach the federal goal of 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, the solar workforce will need to more than double from 255,000 to over 538,000, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
What’s more, for projects to receive the full 30% base Investment Tax Credit, rather than just 6%, Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a requirement that 12.5% of a project’s labor hours must be from qualified apprentices participating in an apprenticeship program. Qualified programs must be registered with the Department of Labor (DOL) or a state equivalent.
(Read: “Inside the IRA: How does prevailing wage affect my solar tax credit?”)
While the DOL reports over 600,000 registered apprentices nationwide, solar industry members say there are not enough apprentice programs across the nation to meet demand for solar jobs.
“The IRA legislation provides a ‘good faith’ exception for the apprenticeship requirement if a company’s hiring request is rejected by a registered apprenticeship program, or if the apprentice program fails to respond within five days,” said community solar developer Nautilus Solar in a whitepaper, “but questions about the logistics of that exception remain.”
Nautilus Solar suggested that standardizing the prevailing wage could help address uncertainty about tax credit requirements. The company said engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) costs continuing to “skyrocket” in recent months may artificially increase prevailing wage comparisons, and therefore may falsely burden wage standards developers are asked to meet.
The whitepaper recommends increased investment in education and training programs to attract more workers, partnering with local schools, vocational schools, and community colleges to promote careers in the solar industry, and raising awareness to change societal perceptions about highly skilled, trade positions.
Solar accounted for 39% of all new electric generating capacity additions in the first half of 2022 and is expected to triple in cumulative capacity in five years. Effective training will be needed to achieve this goal, and developers will likely shoulder raised EPC costs as the new prevailing wage requirements are met.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/02/solar-tower-pilot-project-shows-benefits-of-vertical-installations/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 2, 2023",Solar tower of power shows benefits of vertical installations,"A Canadian solar tower capable of withstanding Category 1 hurricane winds (75 – 95 mph) has shown to be commercially viable without damage and positioned at a 90-degree angle, performed positively with minimal power loss.
Three Sixty Solar Ltd., a Canadian commercial and utility solar developer, published a white paper this week that provides background on the solar tower’s initial 16 months in operation.
The company has indicated that each of its early-stage towers can produce up to 250 kW of clean energy, while future towers could be installed at multiple megawatts of power capacity in grid applications.
Located in Kelowna, British Columbia, the company installed the Solar Tower demonstration project in October 2021, and reported that erection of the tower took place in five working days using a bucket-lift crane for handling mounting systems and sticking photovoltaic modules onto using racking hardware.
Although the company did not disclose the height or power metrics of the Kelowna demonstration project, a company video on its website indicates that the tower system can be deployed in 40 to 120 feet height towers, and occupy a land area of 144 to 900 square feet on a concrete foundation.
Following an early autumn storm which brought 75 mph winds and several days of extreme rain and wind gusts, on November 17, 2021 the developer reported no damage to the Solar Tower, as many in the nearby Kelowna community were without power and closed schools for a matter of days. The PV panels were inspected and remained firmly intact and the tower structure remained in as-built condition.
In late 2021, government agency Environment Canada reported the strongest wind gusts occurring in Kelowna, B.C., were recorded at 84 mph. Into the winter months the developer reported “no wind-driven snow had stuck to the (vertically mounted) panels,” with no inhibition of power production as typically occurs in flat, ground-mounted solar systems, according to Three Sixty Solar’s report.
“As predicted, the vertical positioning of the panels allowed all snow to slough off the tower, allowing the panels to operate at their full efficiency,” the developer noted.
During the summer of 2022, temperatures reached 102 degrees (F) during excessive drought and wildfires in western Canada, and the Solar Tower continued to operate without interruption nor energy capacity losses.
Three Sixty Solar performed a soiling test evaluation, where they concluded that a primary factor in soiling and loss of power on typical ground-mounted systems is caused by the tilt of the panels up to 40 degrees, citing a report called “Effect of Tilt Angle on Soiling of Photovoltaic Modules,” published by Arizona State University’s PV Lab from 2014. However, the ASU report provided no soiling studies for arrays mounted from 40 to 90 degrees.

During a January 2023 operations and maintenance inspection, the company wetted and cleaned the Solar Tower using a soft cloth. At the time, it measured the voltage from the panels at 77.5 volts with a current of 6.1 amperes. Immediately after cleaning, no change was measured to either the voltage or current, indicating no soiling on the panels after over a year on operations.
Other key benefits of the Solar Tower demonstration are the space-saving impacts of the vertically-mounted array compared to ground-mounted systems, which require up to 6 acres of land to produce 1 MW of electricity. To provide the same amount of energy, the company’s tower configuration frees up 85% to 90% of the land use for other purposes such as farming, the company reports.
The company said it achieved 10% power increase from the company’s patent-pending internal venting system. The system uses a “stack effect” air flow vent with opening at the top of the tower, cooling the array for improved performance.
Future tower projects can be installed with on-site energy storage, telecom equipment, EV charging stations, lighting and surveillance equipment, according to the company’s video.
Three Sixty Solar says future Solar Tower projects could be installed in urban environments with limited space for renewable energy developments, as well as farmland where land use is critical for the customer’s business.  Mountainous terrain and island countries provide additional opportunities for the Solar Tower, the company said.
In Somerset, California, German-designed Sunzaun vertical solar arrays were installed at a vineyard. Installer Sunstall developed the facility, which was composed of 43 450 W modules connected to a microinverter and two batteries. Vertical solar arrays have been tested in Germany, France, Sweden and Japan as well.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/02/agrivoltaics-can-provide-food-and-energy-for-growing-world-population/,"RESEARCH,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 2, 2023",Agrivoltaics can provide food and energy for growing world population,"Agrivoltaics, the co-location of solar PV with crop production, solves at least two critical needs. Solar provides the renewable energy needed to mitigate climate change effects while meeting global energy demands. And crops grown alongside solar helps to feed the burgeoning population, anticipated to grow to nearly 10 billion people worldwide by 2050 according to the United Nations.
Cornell researchers examined agrivoltaics to find out if there is merit to the perception that co-located sites will see major tradeoffs between food and energy production. The study showed how solar and crop production can not only exist side by side, but how the co-location improves the microclimate and surface temperature of solar PV modules.
The researchers developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) microclimate model, which they evaluated against experimental data to investigate the effects of panel height, light reflection (albedo), and how much water is evaporated (evapotranspiration) in a solar PV site. The results were published in reported in Applied Energy.
“We now have, for the first time, a physics-based tool to estimate the costs and benefits of co-locating solar panels and commercial agriculture from the perspective of increased power conversion efficiency and solar-panel longevity,” said lead author Henry Williams, a doctoral student in Cornell Engineering.
The team demonstrated an agrivoltaic facility with soybeans growing under solar modules mounted about 13 feet high exhibits solar module temperature reductions of up to 18 F (10 C), compared to a solar farm mounted at just 1.6 feet over bare soil.
The researchers noted that as modules experience efficiency losses between 0.1 and 0.5 % per degree above 77 C, the implication is that solar conversion efficiency is greater when solar is mounted above crops compared to exposed soil or gravel. In addition to efficiency improvements, years of reduced operating temperatures will lead to improved solar module lifespan, according to the researchers, which they believe speaks to the long-term economic potential of agrivoltaic systems.
“There is potential for agrivoltaic systems – where agriculture and solar panels coexist – to provide increased passive cooling through taller panel heights, more reflective ground cover and higher evapotranspiration rates compared to traditional solar farms,” said senior author Max Zhang, professor in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, “We can generate renewable electricity and conserve farmland through agrivoltaic systems.”
In addition to the noted benefits, pairing energy and crops solves the land use issues faced by both solar developers and large-scale farmers. According to a previous research study from Zhang’s group, about 40% of utility-scale solar farm capacity has been developed on agricultural lands in New York state, while about 84% of land deemed suitable for utility-scale solar development is agricultural.
“As you decrease the solar panel operating temperature, you can increase efficiency and improve the longevity of your solar modules,” said Williams, “We’re showing dual benefits. On one hand, you have food production for farmers, and on the other hand, we’ve shown improved longevity and improved conversion efficiency for solar developers.”
With global food demands expected to increase by 50% by 2050, according to the World Resources Institute, and the need to mitigate the impact of climate change, agrivoltaics appears to offer a myriad of benefits, the study concludes.
“Up to this point, most of the benefits from agrivoltaic systems have revolved around hot and arid climate zones,” said Zhang, also the Kathy Dwyer Marble and Curt Marble Faculty Director for the Cornell Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, “This paper is taking a step toward evaluating the viability of agrivoltaics in climates representative of the Northeastern U.S. in relaxing the land-use competition the world faces.”
This article was updated to correct the temperature reduction mentioned as 50 F (10 C), which should be temperature reductions of up to 18 F (10 C).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/02/second-life-ev-batteries-as-grid-scale-storage/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 2, 2023",Second-life EV batteries as grid-scale storage,"As of 2021, global sales of EVs have reached 16 million as demand continues to accelerate, said the International Energy Agency. The transportation energy transition has only just begun. Most batteries retired from EVs still have about 70% of their capacity remaining, said Smartville, making them an ideal candidate for second-life uses.
This is the opportunity that San Diego-based startup Smartville looks to seize, by repurposing EV batteries as grid-scale energy storage to store renewable energy. 
“Our second-life energy storage product repurposes EV batteries to reliably store power from solar and wind,” said Antoni Tong, chief executive officer of Smartville. “The outcome is that the system can sustainably power our communities, lessening our dependence on external energy sources.” 
The startup announced it received a $5.9 million grant from the Department of Energy (DOE) to scale this service. The grant came as part of a $75 million funding package made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which awarded a total of 10 projects that advance EV battery recycling and reuse efforts. 
The product, called MOAB, can hold between six to 10 battery packs with a nominal rating between 200 kWh to 500 kWh. 
The company’s proprietary suite of software, hardware and diagnostics comes with a performance guarantee for stationary storage, serving enterprise and utility customers. 
“We realized early on that the only way to grow a real market for this type of technology is to be able to absolutely warranty or guarantee the performance,” said Mike Ferry, president of Smartville. 
“We validated our technology using battery modules obtained by disassembling EV battery packs, and we cycled modules of different chemistries from different automakers. As a result, we now have software and hardware that can use batteries of different states of health within the same system and we’re able to improve total system state of health over time,” said Ferry.
Ferry said Smartville sees benefits in focusing on repurposing battery packs rather than performing disassembly and repurposing battery modules. The company said labor and cost for disassembly is prohibitive when reaching a MWh or GWh scale. 
Smartville said it will apply the DOE funds to accelerate commercialization of its repurposing product. The company first plans to achieve UL certification for the technology and will follow with a 4 MWh demonstration project. The demonstration will locate the repurposed battery with an existing central California power plant in an identified disadvantaged community. 
The startup was launched out of the University of California, San Diego, starting with a $2 million DOE loan through the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy program.
The company reported it will be installing another prototype system at the end of Q2 with Southern Company. While Smartville has other early-stage projects in the works, the company is focusing on certification, commercialization, and scaling its manufacturing in the coming year.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/02/california-evaluates-impacts-of-an-rto-and-its-effects-on-state-energy-goals/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 2, 2023",California evaluates impacts of an RTO and its effects on state energy goals,"Expanding the California grid operator the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) into a regional transmission organization (RTO) would save California money, but some have expressed concern that the associated governance changes could reduce the state’s autonomy over many policies, a report said.
The state legislature requested the report from CAISO, asking for a review of existing studies on the impacts of expanded regional grid cooperation in California that focuses on “key issues that will most effectively advance the state’s energy and environmental goals.” At CAISO’s request, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reviewed the studies and prepared the report.
NREL reviewed studies on the most comprehensive mode of regional cooperation, namely an RTO, as well as three other options—energy imbalance markets, day-ahead markets, and coordination of resource adequacy.
Most studies summarized in the report focused on four types of benefits from regional cooperation: reduced production costs, reduced resource adequacy costs, efficient transmission planning, and reliability benefits.
NREL reported that one study, “The state-led market study” by Energy Strategies, estimated that a West-wide RTO would reduce production costs by 6.4% by 2030, yielding $833 million in annual production cost savings. CAISO has said that the Energy Strategies study is among those that it considered most relevant for the report, in a January response to stakeholder comments.
“The literature generally notes” that expanded regional cooperation would help California meet its clean energy goals more effectively than without expanded regional cooperation, NREL said, citing specific studies.
At the same time, NREL said “the literature suggests strongly” that for CAISO to become a multi-state RTO would require changes to CAISO’s governance, adding that several stakeholders also stated this view in comments on a draft version of the report.
For some study authors, expanding CAISO to become a regional RTO “raises concerns that California would have less autonomy over many policies.” NREL said that all other U.S. multi-state RTOs have an independent governing board elected by RTO members.
Currently CAISO is publicly governed. In contrast, the grid operator PJM, an existing multi-state RTO with a large backlog of interconnection requests for renewables and storage, grants 80% of members’ voting power to generation, transmission and distribution owners and suppliers, using a weighted voting formula.
NREL also reviewed the option of two sub-regional RTOs: CAISO and a second RTO that included other Western states. NREL turned again to the Energy Strategies study, reporting its estimate that for either an RTO or a day-ahead market, California would save more with one regional market than with two.
Because joining an RTO is voluntary, NREL cautioned that the quantitative outcomes of the studies included in its review, all of which assumed universal participation, “are best interpreted as an upper bound of potential benefits under ideal conditions and universal participation.”
Discussing other regional coordination options, NREL reported that existing regional coordination through the voluntary Western Energy Imbalance Market, operated by CAISO, has yielded savings of $3.4 billion since 2014.
As for a regional day-ahead energy market that did not require participants to become RTO members, NREL said the Energy Strategies study found that such a market would reduce production costs, but only one-eighth as much as a single West-wide RTO would.
A Western Resource Adequacy Program now being implemented, after being approved by federal regulators last month, will pool resource adequacy across multiple states while retaining state authority on the mix of resources, NREL said, noting that some technical studies demonstrated this could reduce the cost of resource adequacy.
NREL will hold a public stakeholder call on March 8, 2023 to discuss the report, titled “The impacts on California of expanded regional cooperation to operate the Western grid.”

Reactivate, a nationwide solar training program that uses the Building Equity in Solar Training (BEST) protocol has opened in Chicago to meet the needs of an expanding industry.
In partnership with Grid Alternatives, Solar Energy International (SEI), Jobs for the Future and local partners Elevate and the Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County, Reactivate launched a workforce training program focused on the implementation of a nationwide equitable workforce training program that will provide skills-based training and certifications for Chicago residents seeking a career in solar, energy storage and EV charging.
“Utopia Hill and the Reactivate team spearheaded and sourced several organizations to put this project together that will start in Chicago and spread to other cities across the country,” said Adewale OgunBadejo, vice president of workforce development at Grid Alternatives.
BEST is an outcomes-based workforce training program that places importance on quality and a commitment to an equity-driven model. This process includes working with local partners to ensure that individuals from underserved and disadvantaged  communities have the support to enroll, complete training, enter a career with family sustaining wages, and overcome additional barriers.
Additional BEST support includes paid training, tutoring, transportation assistance, childcare assistance, and case management. Trainees to the program include women, members of the BIPOC community, justice-involved individuals, and individuals from energy transition communities.
The training platform uses industry training framework developed to provide multiple certifications such as the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) installer certification, OSHA 30, First Aid/CPR, as well as operator training, general building trades training, and customized content tailored both to occupational demand and to the needs of the target populations.
There is also an emphasis on leadership development, problem-solving, teamwork, and a high work ethic. The program uses a mix of classroom training and hands-on training approaches, which Reactivate views as critical to ensuring trainees are ready to enter the solar workforce upon graduation from the program.
“We were honored to have been invited to share our 30+ years of providing industry leading solar training and curriculum development in support of this initiative,” said Chris Turek, vice president of business development, SEI. “As the clean energy economy grows, it is critical that we ensure a diverse and equitable workforce shape the future of the solar industry.”
Reactivate, in collaboration with its five partnered agencies, is currently running the BEST program in Chicago. The first cohort of  individuals entered a 16-week program in February 2023, with an expected graduation in June 2023. During the program trainees will have the opportunity to meet with several employers including those working on Reactivate’s portfolio of community solar projects in the Chicago area.

In February, Solstice Power Technologies, a customer management platform for community solar development, began enrolling subscribers on three low-to-moderate-income (LMI) community solar projects developed by Reactivate, a joint venture of developer Invenergy and Lafayette Square, an impact investment fund.
Reactivate’s program is specifically for income-eligible residents whose household must verify as 80% or less of the Area Median Income (AMI). Prospective enrollees can check if their household meets the AMI qualifications on Solstice’s website through the “See If You Qualify” prequalification form.
Lafayette Square and Invenergy formed Reactivate in January 2022 as a community solar energy platform supporting development in underserved communities. The platform will finance, acquire, develop, and operate solar energy projects primarily serving LMI communities and areas disproportionately affected by the clean energy transition.
According to Reactivate, the company isn’t limited to community solar projects, and will also develop small-scale utility solar projects, energy storage, building electrification, and EV charging infrastructure. Beyond project financing and development, the company attests that it is focused on creating development, construction, and operational focused jobs while focusing worker training efforts on traditionally underrepresented segments of the workforce and those transitioning to the renewable energy industry.
