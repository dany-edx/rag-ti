The Crimson Solar Project will deliver power through the Southern California Edison Colorado River Substation.
The solar project will be a photovoltaic facility owned by Sonoran West Solar Holdings, LLC, a unit of Recurrent Energy which itself is owned by Canadian Solar. The facility will occupy around 2,000 acres of BLM-administered lands some 13 miles west of Blythe, in Riverside County.
According to a 720-page scoping document filed with BLM in 2018, the project would include an estimated 2 million solar modules. The project would be designed and laid out primarily in 2 MW increments, each of which would include an inverter-transformer station. Up to four substations would transform voltage from the 34.5 kV electrical collection cables to 230 kV.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/03/residential-marketer-reaches-settlement-over-solar-sales-allegations/,"LEGAL,RESIDENTIAL PV,NEW JERSEY",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 3, 2021",Residential marketer reaches settlement over solar sales allegations,"More than two and a half years after it opened an investigation into 21 consumer complaints, the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs reached a settlement with NRG Residential Solar Solutions.
In it, the company agreed to pay around $69,000 to resolve allegations that it used deceptive sales practices to mislead New Jersey consumers into leasing solar energy panels, failed to deliver promised energy savings, and made misrepresentations regarding servicing, installation, and financing. The practices were in violation of New Jersey’s Consumer Fraud Act and related consumer protection regulations.
The company stopped marketing and installing solar panels in February 2017, but continues to service existing customers.
As part of the settlement, NRG agreed to change its policies and practices, and enter binding arbitration to resolve pending consumer complaints, as well as new consumer complaints for the next year.
NRG also agreed to offer two consumers who filed complaints with the Division the option to have the solar panels uninstalled and removed from their home at no cost.
The Division opened its investigation after receiving complaints alleging that NRG, among other things, failed to deliver promised savings, failed to timely make repairs after damaging roofs of consumer homes during installation, improperly delayed the installation and activation of solar energy systems, and failed to honor provisions in consumer lease agreements.
Under the terms of the Consent Order, NRG agreed to make changes to its business practices, which include:
The $68,951 settlement includes $30,000 in civil penalties, $20,197 for investigative costs and attorneys’ fees, and $18,754 in consumer restitution. The restitution will be paid to two consumers who documented roof repairs needed after the installation of solar panels and one consumer who leased a solar system that NRG failed to activate.

First Solar and Nel will initially collaborate to develop an integrated power plant control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The development of this network architecture is critical to enable optimization of PV-electrolyzer hybrid projects, resulting in low total cost of hydrogen and electricity. After that, the two will explore  ways of optimizing and integrating technology throughout the solar and hydrogen production plant.
In statements, both companies stressed their desire to deliver the lowest total cost of solar to hydrogen possible. Both also noted that First Solar’s low-carbon production of its cadmium-telluride modules was significant for keeping emissions low.
Because the partnership is so recent in nature, no project timelines have been released as of yet.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/03/most-lmi-solar-programs-lack-strong-evaluation-metrics-report-says/,"POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 3, 2021","Most LMI solar programs lack strong evaluation metrics, report says","A growing number of state and local governments, utilities, and non-profit organizations are promoting solar power to reduce energy bills for low- and moderate-income (LMI) households.
Now, a new study from Berkeley Lab looks at how those programs are being evaluated. It finds LMI solar programs are mostly young, operate on tight budgets, and vary considerably in their design and stated goals. As a result, the report said that well-designed program evaluation “is critical to better understand what is working, what could be improved, and how to maximize program impacts under budget constraints.”
The report said that at least 41 active programs in 21 states have made funding commitments totaling well over $1 billion. The programs provide favorable financing to eligible households, give upfront or production-based incentives, or create LMI set-asides in broader distributed solar programs. A growing number are community solar projects that credit the value of the generation to the bills of eligible customers.
The report, An Assessment of Evaluation Practices of Low- and Moderate-Income Solar Programs, said that “only a few of the programs” have undertaken rigorous third-party evaluations, looking at both processes and impacts, and analyzing internal and external data sources. While these are best practices in evaluating utility energy efficiency programs, they are not common in LMI solar programs.
The report said that around one-third of the programs have made evaluation reports public. Instead, most programs issue progress reports that summarize basic metrics such as program expenditures and installed solar capacity, often to show compliance with laws and regulations. A smaller number tally the number of jobs created, bill reductions, and power generation.
The quality of the evaluations often hinges on whether the programs follow a number of best practices. For example, clear, specific, and measurable program goals help define what and how to evaluate performance. Building consistent data collection and analysis into program operations enables the program to perform a continuous evaluation that feeds back into improved operations. Given the importance of social outcomes in LMI solar programs, evaluations can also focus on non-energy benefits such as improved wealth, health, and safety.
The report said that collecting multi-dimensional data that directly aligns with program goals and can measure progress allows for a more detailed look at correlations and causations. The study expands on this point by exploring statistical methods that can tap publicly-available data as a low-cost way to increase the rigor of evaluations.

Mammoth Solar 1 would include 480 MW of capacity, and would be the first phase of a planned development that would cover more than 12,000 acres in Starke and Pulaski counties.
Mammoth Solar 1 is expected to begin construction during the fourth quarter and reach commercial operation by the second quarter of 2023. It will sell energy into the PJM market.
The developers touted the benefits of removing so much farmland from active production to make room for the solar project, including reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers and the reduction of around 1 billion gallons a year of water used for irrigation.
AEP Energy supplies electricity and natural gas for more than 500,000 residential and business customers in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Israel-based Doral LLC was founded in 2019 as a joint venture between Doral Group and Clean Energy Generation. Doral currently has more than 3 GW of projects under development and 30,000 acres of land control, mainly in Midwest and Mid-Atlantic U.S.
Indiana is a growing market for utility-scale solar. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects the state to install nearly 4 GW over the next five years. That would be good enough for the 8th most expected capacity additions of any state in the country.
In recent months, Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO), announced a series of deals for solar energy as the utility transitions away from coal-fired generation.
In March, the utility signed a build-transfer agreement for the 200 MW Elliot Solar project, set to be built in the southwestern part of the state with Capital Dynamics. The project. Capital Dynamics will construct the project and NIPSCO will enter into a joint venture once construction is complete.
The company also announced 900 MW over three projects: the 200 MW Cavalry Solar project, paired with 60 MW of energy storage; the 265 MW Dunns Bridge Solar I project; and the 435 MW of solar and 75 MW of battery storage Dunns Bridge Solar II project.
NIPSCO also signed a long-term power purchase agreement for 280 MW of the power generated by Capital Dynamics’ upcoming Gibson Solar project and a build & transfer agreement for the 200 MW Indiana Crossroads Solar Park .

The project would include 300 MW of solar capacity built at a cost of $1,373 a kilowatt, and 165 MW of battery energy storage built at a cost of $1,436 a kilowatt.
Wisconsin Electric Power could own a 75% share of the project, Wisconsin Public Service would own 15% and Madison Gas and Electric would own 10%.
The price includes the capital cost of the solar facilities, storage system, transmission interconnection costs, and owners’ costs. The solar-plus-storage projects would be built near Madison.
Both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service plan to retire older, less efficient fossil fuel plants, and invest more than $2 billion in natural gas generation, renewable generation, and storage resources. Likewise, Madison Gas and Electric will need more than 250 MW of new capacity by 2024 due to previously announced retirements of older assets and expiration of existing power purchase agreements.
Koshkonong would be developed by a unit of Chicago-based Invenergy. The project would use between 566,037 and 730,188 silicon PV modules fixed to horizontal single-axis solar trackers. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2022.
Talen Energy said it is developing 1 GW of stand-alone battery storage projects in three states. The battery projects range from 20 MW to an expected 300 MW and are expected to be developed over the next three to five years on Talen-owned land and using legacy fossil generation and transmission infrastructure.
The company’s first two planned battery storage development projects are 20 MW projects adjacent to its coal-fired H.A. Wagner (Baltimore, Maryland) and Camden, New Jersey generation facilities. The Wagner facility is set to stop burning coal by the end of 2025. The Camden battery project is expected to serve as an added capacity resource adjacent to this natural gas generation facility. The company said it expects to begin construction on the storage projects later this year.
Researchers from the Energy Department’s Sandia National Laboratories tested airborne dust particles to test the safety of a concentrating solar power technology, and found that the dust is below hazardous levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

A Sandia team recently received $25 million from DOE to build a pilot plant that will use the technology, known as a high-temperature, falling-particle receiver for concentrating solar power.
The falling-particle receiver works by dropping dark, sand-like ceramic particles through a beam of concentrated sunlight, then storing the heated particles. The particles cost about $1 for 2.2 pounds and can get hotter than conventional molten-salt-based concentrating solar power systems, increasing efficiency and driving down cost. The DOE’s goal is to drive the cost of electricity from concentrating solar power down to $0.05 a kWh, comparable to conventional fossil-fuel-based power.
One problems is that the re-used particles can eventually break down into fine dust. The EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulate tiny dust particles, finer than talcum powder, that are known to pose a risk for lung damage.
Last fall, researchers used sensors sitting a few yards away from the falling-particle receiver, and sensors hanging from 22-foot-wide, tethered helium balloons to measure the particles that were released as it was operating at temperatures above 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Comparing the results, researchers found that the concentration of tiny particles was much lower than EPA limits. The researchers said it would take an emission of particles 400 times greater than what was measured in its tests to get close to the EPA standards.
