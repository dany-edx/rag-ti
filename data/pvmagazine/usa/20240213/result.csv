1,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/13/blue-skies-ahead-for-evs-and-the-energy-metals-that-power-them/,"BATTERY,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA,UNITED STATES",,2024-02-13,Blue skies ahead for EVs and the energy metals that power them,"The sky is not falling in the lithium sector, but what is moving markets is misinformation and misinterpretation of sales trends. Lithium carbonite is a vital critical element for electric vehicles. So when Ford and General Motors reported demand for their EV’s fell short of projections in late October 2023, pandemonium broke out with bearish news reports on the future of EV’s and its underlying key critical elements including lithium and cobalt.
With the U.S. in an election year, is it any surprise that the energy metal conversation got hijacked by political strategists looking to rain on President Biden’s green energy parade? The move to accelerated decarbonization is not a partisan issue; it is about the survival of our planet.
Every new major innovation experience hiccups on the way to mainstream adoption, but the EV market has had stratospheric growth.
Electric cars’ fast lane trajectory
All-electric car sales in the United States continue to increase at a strong clip, outpacing the general car market. “A record 1.2 million U.S. vehicle buyers chose to go electric last year, according to estimates from Kelley Blue Book with 1,189,051 new electric vehicles (EVs) put into service. Experian/Automotive News registration data reports that the total number of Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) registrations during the first eight months of 2023 were 754,811, 64% higher than a year ago, and about 7.3% of the total market, up from 5% at that time in 2022.
With the U.S. government planning to end purchases of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, downstream end users will soon be entirely dependent on the guaranteed long-term availability of steady supplies of lithium carbonate (battery-grade lithium).
Why low prices cure low prices
Today’s low lithium prices disrupt the applecart of mining and exploration. A thinning of the (lithium) herds may be on the horizon this year with the ‘perfect storm’ of low lithium carbonite prices and limited access to new capital. Marginal prospectors and junior miners will exit stage left as even major producers curtail projects.
The ‘lithium mania’ chapter officially came to an abrupt close on January 17th when the world’s largest producer, Albemarle Corp., announced a reduction in project spending. With the price of battery-grade lithium carbonate descending in the last 12 months, widely attributed to oversupplied markets in Asia, the ‘mania’ subsided and ‘depression’ arrived. Prospectors and juniors drawn to lithium, akin to the dot.com euphoria in the ‘90s, pulled back in record numbers delaying or suspending projects.
So, where does that leave us with availability to lithium, sourced from geopolitically friendly regions? Will our brine, hard rock, and claystone ‘rockstars’ have access to the capital needed to bring projects to fruition in geopolitically friendly regions of the world?
Foundation of our environmental future
Our world will transition from fossil fuels and the demand for lithium will increase in the coming decade. Canada is paying $30 billion in incentives to build three battery plants which require battery-related energy metals including lithium. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $6 billion in incentives to support R&D and production of batteries in the US, as well as supporting the creation of a domestic supply chain. America’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates $10 billion to support construction of clean energy tech factories and retrofitting existing factories to make clean energy equipment and components including R&D support, US battery production and the creation of a domestic supply chain.
Divestment from China Crucial to Western Nations’ Environmentally & Fiscally Sound Future The US recognized 50 minerals, including lithium, as critical to the nation’s future and security. Since 2020, many Western nations’ divestment from China, a Goliath in energy metals mining and processing which controls nearly 60% of the world’s capacity for processing raw lithium products into battery-grade chemicals, has resulted in China scouting the world for mining assets in regions that do not have geopolitical conflicts with the world’s second most populous country.
Lithium subject to vagaries of spot market pricing
Much of the volatility around lithium prices is because most lithium products are traded using long-term contracts with wildly varying differentials between prices achieved for lithium carbonate from a specific mining project as compared to China’s spot lithium carbonate CIF Asia price, with the spot price shedding light on price movements on a shorter-term basis.
China is the world’s largest consumer and producer of lithium carbonate, and our future depends on North America taking that mantle back. With China calling the shots on commodity pricing, they are the primary factor contributing to spot lithium price instability. Questions about credibility of their information has paved the way for market manipulation and presented major challenges for investors in forecasting market movements. We also see China continuing to stockpile their lithium inventory in a “move analysts see as an effort to alleviate fears of a shortage.”
With the political and economic imperative to decouple from China’s economy, the United States and other geopolitically friendly nations must provide the raw materials for the industrialized world’s green energy revolution.
While the United States holds about 8 million metric tons of lithium in reserve, ranking it among the top five countries in the world, right now only a fraction of the world’s supply is produced at one solitary lithium brine mine in Nevada called Silver Peak, run by Albemarle Corp. America has some of the world’s highest quality, battery grade lithium carbonite, waiting to be developed.
Lithium’s future is green
Benchmark Intelligence forecasts price stability in 2024 but that the “lithium market balance remains fragile” with “only a single major project delay throwing this narrow surplus into a deficit.” Benchmark “estimates the market will return to deficit from 2028, with prices expected to react 12 months ahead of the deficit emerging. They expect the deficit to reach 390,000 tons in 2030 and 1,900,000 tons by 2040.
The current reverses in lithium pricing “provides a good buying opportunity for lithium stocks as demand growth over the next decade should support long-term prices, according to Wilsons Advisory with BloombergNEF projecting global demand for lithium to grow nearly five times by the end of the decade.
Armed with the ability to bring substantial new lithium production and refining operations online, we will be able to meet surging demand from the lithium-ion battery and energy metal supply chains. We will see higher prices for lithium carbonite that ensure today’s low prices will cure today’s market doldrums.

SolAmerica specializes in developing, engineering, procuring and constructing utility and commercial-scale solar projects across the U.S. The company plans to use First Solar’s modules for its portfolio of community solar facilities, three commercial and industrial solar plants and various other solar projects across the South, Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The company has finished more than 100 projects and has an additional 500 MW in active development. 
The 455 and 480 watt 6 Plus modules have an efficiency of up to 19.0%. The bifacial modules are made from cadmium telluride chemistries and have SpeedSlots that the company says reduces installation time and mounting hardware costs. First Solar’s Series 7 bifacial modules offer a more significant form factor and innovative back rail mounting system to increase efficiency and lifetime energy performance while reducing installation time.  
The 550 watt Series 7 modules have an efficiency of up to 19.7%. First Solar states that the increased capacity reduces balance of system costs associated with labor, permitting, interconnection, inspection, land, and building due to the higher amount of watts per install.
The Series 7 modules also have a protective coat of zinc covering their steel back rails, allowing them to be mounted closer to the center of rotation on a tracker. First Solar says this installation style improves the mechanical efficiency of the motors and dampener as well as space efficiency because longer tracker rows allow for more watts per motor, dampener and torque tube. The Series 7 modules are made in the U.S. and are configured for the domestic utility-scale market. 
 “SolAmerica is all-in on buying American solar, and this agreement is the centerpiece of that commitment,” says Tully Balalock, the CEO of SolAmerica.
The modules are scheduled to be delivered in 2024 and 2025. 
First Solar says it is the first solar module manufacturer to have its product included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT). The global registry helps purchasers decipher an offering’s environmental impact by assessing how various aspects of its lifecycle impact nature. Products are ranked as Gold, Silver or Bronze based on EPEAT’s ecological performance criteria. 
First Solar has approximately 6 GW of operational capacity in the U.S. First Solar hopes to increase this figure to 14 GW domestically and 25 GW globally by 2024. The company opened a factory in Ohio last year and plans to expand its capacity in the state by 0.9 GW and build new 3.5 GW manufacturing plants in Alabama and Louisiana. 
“First Solar is proud that SolAmerica Energy has selected our technology,” said Dana Kennard, the director of business development at First Solar. By powering their near-term pipeline with American-innovated and manufactured solar, SolAmerica directly supports U.S. manufacturing and the domestic supply chain.”

4,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/13/solar-actuators-the-brains-and-brawn-behind-solar-trackers/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,GUEST POST,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TRACKERS,UNITED STATES",,2024-02-13,"Solar actuators, the brains and brawn behind solar trackers","Solar tracker design has become more challenging than ever as some utility-scale solar projects require larger module arrays, while others contend with complex terrain, unique environmental conditions, and ongoing pressure to control costs.
The actuation system in utility-scale solar trackers, the part that drives the tracker motion, will have an outsized impact on project performance. But many solar professionals may struggle to spot the differences between one actuation system and another. How can you know if the actuation system in your next project will be optimized according to need?
An actuator or drive should not be viewed as a one-size-fits-all component. It’s not a good idea to source actuation systems by comparing some data points on a product spec sheet and assuming that all similarly sized drives are alike. First, be sure to understand the solar project’s structural requirements and the torque demands that will be placed on the actuation system throughout its operating lifetime.
Basics of torque
Torque is a measurement of the force that causes something to rotate around a point. It is most often expressed in kilonewton (kN) for solar applications since one kilonewton represents approximately 224.8 pounds of force (lbf). This measurement is used to size the torque required to rotate something, like a 15,000-lb. array of solar modules attached to a steel tube for example. Torque is also measured by the force needed to hold that same array in a stationary position ensuring the array can survive forces such as wind or imbalances of the array when tilted.
It’s essential for large-scale solar projects to optimize actuation systems according to structural loads and other design parameters. Oversizing the actuation system means taking on unnecessary added costs for the project. Under sizing the system means taking on unnecessary risk, putting plant reliability and longevity in jeopardy.
Why torque matters
During normal operations, single-axis tracker systems can be expected to make small changes in module tilt angle throughout the day to optimize energy output. In the early morning and the late afternoon, the module array may point as much as 60+ degrees from horizontal. The system might also perform backtracking, reversing the tilt angle to reduce energy losses due to shading. Or it might make other adjustments to optimize yield using bifacial modules or to account for variable terrain. All these conditions can apply forces that measure in the hundreds of kN or tens of thousands of pounds of force.
Torque plays a critical role in enabling systems to carry out routine maintenance and respond to extreme weather. Technicians might need to reposition the array to inspect equipment, perform module cleaning, carry out vegetation management, or complete other tasks that increase yield and maintain system uptime. The threat of hail may require the array to be tilted more than 70 degrees to mitigate damage, at the same time ensuring there is enough torque to withstand the increased impact of wind due to the increased tilt angle.
For a system that rotates twice a day reliably for 25+ years, the potential for failure is always present. What do you do if actuator system performance might become less reliable long before the project reaches its expected lifetime?
To safeguard projects from system failure, from having to choose between replacing drives or reverting to a fixed-tilt configuration, product engineers can design in a margin of safety. The safety margin should come from a robust set of field data and thorough, solar-specific testing.
What’s in your actuator?
One of the biggest mistakes you can make when considering what actuator to use would be to evaluate a drive based on a single number and relying on generic engineering and testing not specific to the operating conditions for solar infrastructure. Testing procedures for different applications can vary considerably, even if they generate similar numbers on the product datasheet. You ought to know inputs and outputs. How were the test results derived? How applicable are they to large-scale solar applications?
Product engineers who test actuation systems for solar tracking applications design test plans based on real-world scenarios. Following the concept of Pareto efficiency, engineers look for opportunities to increase loads for one set of scenarios without decreasing loads for other scenarios. This process continues until it reaches an optimal state where no further improvement can be made without an equivalent tradeoff.
Engineers perform static and dynamic testing to measure all the ways that actuation systems perform under various loads. They perform accelerated life testing to detect failure points in the lab faster than would be possible out in the field. They also monitor system performance throughout testing so we can analyze results and improve understanding of how systems will respond to conditions at the project site.
To make sure the system you are designing as tracker manufacturer or specifying as an EPC or developer is optimized according to need, work with suppliers who provide project-level consultation. Make sure your supplier understands solar applications and builds drives specifically for solar infrastructure. Without test results or the underlying data to support the figures you see on a product spec sheet, ask yourself: What else don’t I know about this drive?
