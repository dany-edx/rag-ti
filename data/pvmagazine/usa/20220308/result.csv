In the program, each municipality has its electricity supply contracts negotiated through Joule, with the option to have 100% renewable energy as its default energy source.
Later in the year, Joule launched the country’s first community choice (opt-out) solar program in the villages of Brockport and Lima, NY, signing up each village’s entire population under the program to leveraging the collective buying power at a scale large enough to secure better terms through a single competitive bidding process with solar providers.
The two intertwined programs allow the state to make significant progress on its renewable energy goals, keep its solar development pipeline robust, and ensure affordable electricity is available to as many New Yorkers as possible. Residents and businesses are also free to opt-out of the program at any time and receive their electricity from their utility’s existing generation portfolio.
In a program update, Joule estimates that its electricity supply customers saved $7 million from July 2021 through February 2022, with $3.4 million in savings accruing in February alone from participants in the Central Hudson utility zone due to the utility’s expected 46% rate hike for electricity. In Rockland Country, Joule’s program participants saved more than $2 million through January 2022 since the program’s November 2021 launch.
Beyond the bill savings for participants, the programs has helped to avoid more than 650,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions since July 2019, the equivalent of the amount of carbon sequestered by 825,000 acres of forest in one year.
As of the end of 2021, Joule’s community choice aggregation programs have made available clean energy at fixed, competitive rates to 800,000 New Yorkers in 44 municipalities across the state, while more than 3,500 customers have chosen to opt-in to community solar programs.
These 3,500 customers include the town of Southampton which is set to be the first municipal community solar project to be fully-subscribed through the opt-out CCA program. Kearsarge Energy Limited Partnership will now build the solar project on a municipally-owned brownfield site, and the town will automatically distribute all solar credits generated to low- to moderate-income residents, delivering guaranteed electricity bill savings to those who stand to benefit most.
Joule shares that in 2022, the two programs are set to launch for more than 56,000 customers across 15 New York communities: Black Brook, Canton, Gardiner, Geneva, Henrietta, Highland Falls, Highlands, Honeoye Falls, Nelsonville, Rhinebeck, Roseboom, Saugerties, Southampton, Suffern, Waddington, and West Haverstraw.
In 2020, New York added 549MW of community solar capacity according to NYSERDA, leading the nation. More than 90% of the state’s 2.7GW pipeline of projects under development that have been awarded NY-Sun incentives, and are expected to come online in the next two years, are community solar, comprising more than 800 projects.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the next five years will see the US community solar market add more than 4GW of total capacity.

That’s part of the thinking behind sending three Wood Mackenzie analysts to Puerto Rico, where they’re helping install solar and gaining real-world knowledge of renewable energy that they can share with local utilities. The trip is also in support of a new initiative to support the Let’s Share the Sun initiative.
Let’s Share the Sun Foundation facilitates the use of solar energy in poor communities throughout the world. One of its most recent projects is in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, where three quarters of the electrical power for the island is generated from petroleum, and natural disasters have weakened already shaky infrastructure. The project in Adjuntas involves installing 60 solar panels and batteries on five homes that lack consistent energy access with limited or no connection to the electricity grid.
In addition to helping with the installations, the analysts will be hosting energy-transition related webinars to raise awareness and funds to help support the project. The funds are being matched by Wood Mackenzie and its parent company Verisk.
“We have already seen the positive impact of this initiative. Just a few days ago, we visited a beneficiary who was amazed they didn’t need to run a generator to keep their oxygen machine running during an extended outage,” said Bernadette Jordan, executive director of the Let’s Share the Sun Foundation.
In 2019, Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricardo Rosselló signed PS 1121, which sets a 100% by 2050 renewable electricity mandate for the island. In February 2022, the government of Puerto Rico and three US federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding to align federal funds with local policies. NREL recently announced the launch of a study to evaluate paths for Puerto Rico to reach 100% renewables. NREL reported that Puerto Rico has 20GW of utility-scale solar potential, mostly along the coasts, and 20GW of distributed solar potential. Solar + Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA) president PJ Wilson estimated 10GW of solar could meet Puerto Rico’s energy needs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/08/plans-announced-for-a-us-lithium-ferro-phosphate-battery-gigafactory-network/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 8, 2022",Plans announced for a US lithium-ferro-phosphate battery gigafactory network,"A new company, American Battery Factory (ABF), announced plans to set up a network of lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery fabrications across the United States. Incubated by Lion Energy, a mobile battery and solar generator provider that reported $100 million in sales in 2021, ABF brings forward an executive team backed by a company with ten years of energy storage experience.
American Battery Factory said it is in active dialogue with battery pack integrators, and forthcoming agreements and the first manufacturing site will be announced in the coming months. The company is a US-owned manufacturer targeting a vertical supply chain. It said currently China manufactures 77% of the global lithium cell production. Bringing the fabrication to the US aligns with federal supply chain stability and independence goals, said ABF.
Last June, the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced $200 million in funding for EV development and the battery supply chain. Its vision for the next decade is the establishment of a secure battery materials and technology supply chain.
The DOE is directing the $200 million in funds via a blueprint by the Federal Consortium of Advanced Batteries, which outlined five goals. First, to secure access to raw and refined materials and discover alternates for critical minerals. Second, to support the growth of a United States material-processing base to meet domestic battery demand. Third, to the nation’s electrode, cell, and pack manufacturing sectors. Fourth, to enable end-of-life reuse and recycling at scale. And fifth, to advance U.S. battery technology leadership through the support of R&D, STEM education, and workforce development.
ABF said its batteries will qualify for “US-made” requirements and will support the above DOE goals. It said the batteries have applications in grid-scale, commercial, and residential energy storage, select EVs like trucks, agricultural vehicles, trams, e-bikes, etc. The batteries could also be used in US military and defense applications, with the benefit of reducing foreign dependence.
LFP batteries decrease risks of fires compared to traditional lithium batteries and exceed the lifecycle of a lead-acid battery by as much as ten times, said ABF. Lead-acid batteries typically last about two to three years, while the company said its batteries will work for 20-30 years and 10,000+ life cycles.
ABF said it will manufacture LFP batteries in a series of rapid-deploy factories called “Sprung Structures.” The structures could host 300-1000 US manufacturing jobs per location. The “factory in a box” facilities are built with LEED-certified fabric membranes, take only weeks to construct, and can be built for as little as half the cost of traditional construction, said ABF. It said the expandable structures can allow factories to scale from 3GWh to 15GWh annually.
“Our vision is to make it possible for all individuals, neighborhoods, companies, utilities, states and sovereign entities to store and deploy the energy source of their choice through battery storage,” said Paul Charles, President and Chief Executive Officer at ABF.
The LFP batteries do not contain cobalt or nickel, which the company said are the most toxic and combustible elements in today’s EV batteries. Cobalt is also a known conflict mineral that has been tied to child labor, so ABF’s exclusion of the element leads to more ethical sourcing.
The company is currently developing a workforce, partner network, and has assembled a management team with a century of combined experience in battery chemistry, technology, finance, law, supply chain management and manufacturing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/08/cybersecurity-for-distributed-energy-and-inverter-based-resources/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 8, 2022",Cybersecurity for distributed energy and inverter-based resources,"UL, a global safety science leader, released a report, co-authored with the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), titled “Cybersecurity Certification Recommendations for Interconnected Grid Edge Devices and Inverter Based Resources.”
Cyber threats have become commonplace. For example, just two weeks ago thousands of internet users in Europe lost service when a satellite operator experienced a “cyber event”. The same attack also knocked nearly 6,000 wind turbines offline in Germany and Central Europe, with a combined output of 11GW. The growth in grid edge distributed energy resources (DER) offers a potential new target for cyberattacks, hence the need for certification testing procedure that identifies gaps in DER cybersecurity functionality and mandates secure features at the device, network, and system level.
Distributed energy resources include any grid-connected energy storage and generation technologies and their associated flexible loads such as solar, battery storage, wind turbines, and fuel cells, among other resources essential to grid operations. The cyber-threat increases when the resources have communication capabilities.
The certification testing procedure can potentially be used in a US industry standard to help manufacturers develop effective approaches to cybersecurity and to help in the development of third-party conformity assessment programs for cybersecurity testing and certification. While standards are not yet in place, this report includes recommendations.
In the meantime, the report acknowledges that “utilities, aggregators, and equipment manufacturers could consider implementing and testing against appropriate elements of existing cybersecurity standards and guidelines as they become available. As a start, they could align their cyber defenses to NIST’s Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.”
Currently, there are no cybersecurity certification requirements to which manufacturers and vendors can certify their DER and IBR devices against an established and widely adopted cybersecurity certification program. The development of these new cybersecurity certification requirements will provide a single unified approach that can be taken as a reference for performing the testing and certification of DERs before being deployed and while in the field, said Kenneth Boyce, senior director for Principal Engineering, Industrial, group at UL.
With support from DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, UL will continue working with NREL on developing requirements to support cybersecurity certification standards for DERs and IBRs. NREL and UL are currently working on an Outline of Investigation for a standard that will apply to energy storage and generation technologies on the distribution grid, including inverters, EV chargers, wind turbines, fuel cells, and other resources essential to advancing grid operations.
The new requirements will prioritize cybersecurity enhancements for power systems dealing with high penetration inverter-based resources, including those interfacing with bulk power systems for periods of instantaneous high wind, solar and hybrid/storage generation. It will also help ensure cybersecurity is designed into new IBR and DER systems.
“UL supports the development of a cybersecurity certification program because, not only will robust cybersecurity be introduced to the electric grid, but it will also help to ensure the concept of security by design is being followed for new DER systems,” said Danish Saleem, senior researcher for energy cyber-physical system security at NREL.
The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)’s Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards now include cybersecurity requirements with hefty consequences for violations, but having cybersecurity standards and certification will enable corporate security specialists to implement best practices to prevent violations in the first place.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/08/3gw-distributed-solar-and-2-1gw-distributed-storage-in-michigan-by-2035-under-a-low-cost-scenario/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MICHIGAN,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 8, 2022","3GW distributed solar and 2.1GW distributed storage in Michigan by 2035, under a low-cost scenario","The average Michigan customer could save $773 per year through 2050 compared to current utility plans, if the state electrified transportation and heating to meet Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s clean energy executive directive, and made optimal investments in renewables.
Those savings could be achieved through the lowest-cost of three scenarios modeled by Vibrant Clean Energy using its WIS:dom-P optimization model, in a study commissioned by Vote Solar.
Retail rates in Michigan would fall from 11.4 cents/kWh in 2018 to about 7 cents/kWh in 2030 in either of the two decarbonization scenarios. The savings would result from adoption of efficient electric vehicles and heat pumps, more rapid displacement of fossil generation with low-cost renewables balanced with storage, and the spreading of fixed utility costs over the larger demand created by EVs and heat pumps.
The decarbonization scenario with the lowest costs went a step further to co-optimize transmission and distribution investments, yielding modest additional rate savings through 2050 by deferring distribution system capital investment.
Distributed solar in Michigan would reach 3GW by 2035 in the lowest-cost scenario, while distributed storage would reach 2.1GW. Current utility plans call for no additional distributed solar or storage beyond minimal existing levels.
While distributed solar and storage would be higher under the lowest-cost scenario, utility-scale solar would be lower, at 3.6GW in 2035, versus 7.8GW under current utility plans.
The study found tremendous untapped land-based wind capacity in Michigan, with the lowest-cost scenario adding 21GW of wind power by 2035, compared to 4.4GW under current utility plans.
The modeling “supports increasing and incenting local solar-plus-storage,” said Will Kenworthy with Vote Solar, in a webinar presenting the study.
The study, which Vote solar submitted in its comments on the draft Michigan Healthy Climate Plan prepared by Governor Whitmer, showed that the governor’s goals are achievable, said Kenworthy. Michigan should “start now” to get to 50% clean energy by 2030, as “getting the first 50% is a no regrets policy” he said. Vote Solar supports a Michigan renewable energy standard of 50% by 2030, a goal stated in Michigan’s draft plan, he said.
In a key adjustment, the model counted the goal of the utility Consumers Energy to reach 90% decarbonization by 2040 as part of the utility’s current plans, and so added in the “current plans” scenario 1.8GW of utility-scale solar to the amounts shown in the utility’s resource plan and that of utility DTE, from which Consumers imports power. The resource plan proposed by Consumers through 2034 “falls well short of reaching its own decarbonization goal by 2040,” the study says.
The planning models used by Michigan utilities are “insufficient,” said John Delurey with Vote Solar, on a webinar presenting the study, and the utilities should use a model more like Vibrant Clean Energy’s model, with its ability to identify the savings potential from distributed solar and storage.
VCE’s model combines capacity expansion modeling and production cost modeling, Kenworthy said. The two types of modeling are sometimes conducted using separate models.
The VCE study used costs for generation capital and O&M from the NREL ATB 2020 “advanced” cost projections, and used fuel costs from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook High Oil and Gas supply scenario.
Vibrant Clean Energy has previously conducted optimization models for the entire US and for “a couple of other states,” Kenworthy said.

The portfolio consists of 16 solar projects in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and it represents one of Greenbacker’s single largest acquisitions to date. Each of the projects within the portfolio reached commercial operation between the fourth quarter of 2016 and second quarter of 2017, has a long-term power purchase agreement in place with an offtaker, and is between five and 15MW in capacity.
As for the portfolio’s remaining 51% ownership interest, that is held by the project’s original developer, Enel Green Power North America.
The acquisition brings Greenbacker’s total portfolio of renewable energy assets to over 2.6GW of generating capacity, and also marks Greenbacker’s second portfolio acquisition the last month. In February, Greenbacker announced that it had purchased a 20MW pre-operational solar portfolio from TUUSSO Energy, a Seattle-based utility-scale solar developer.
Those three projects, all clocking in at 6.7MW, represent Greenbacker’s first assets in Washington state, though they will not be completed until later in the year.
Just prior to that news, Greenbacker announced that it purchased a 16.3MW operational solar portfolio from developer ECA Solar and Alliance Fund II, a sustainable infrastructure fund. The portfolio, located entirely in Massachusetts, comprises 16 rooftop solar projects with each installation ranging in capacity from 0.3MW to 4.2MW.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/08/longi-releases-hi-mo-5-snow-load-test-results-suggests-module-superiority/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 8, 2022","LONGi releases Hi-MO 5 snow load test results, suggests module superiority","Glass is a very challenging material to study. Under minor deformation, its macroscopic properties are reversible, while its microscopic configurations are irreversible. In simple terms – repetitive heat cycling and/or mechanical deformation of glass weakens the material in ways that cannot be measured without inducing failure. As a result, large format solar panels – greater than our prior commercial standard of roughly 2m2 (roughly 6.5’ by 3.25’) – have questions of longevity to be answered.
Results of the inhomogeneous snow load test have been released for the LONGi Hi-MP solar panel. The test simulates a beamless racking installation, in which the glass back of the module floats under its own strength and does not gain support from the racking structure.

The larger format solar panels – 2.6 m2 (28 ft2)- were able to reach or exceed 6400 pascals (Pa) of force before failing (130 lb/ft2) The press release notes five units were tested, and one of the units reached 7400 Pa.
Per an internet search of ‘what does the water in snow weigh’, light snow might weigh 7 lb/ft2,  whereas compacted drift snow – which might build at the base of a solar panel – could weigh 20 lb/ft2 or more.
One limit to a standard mechanical stress test is that it doesn’t specifically focus pressure in the ‘lower’ half of the solar panel, whereas in real world settings that load shifts toward the edge with the deepest snow accumulation. Thus, the creation of the inhomogeneous snow load test, which places increasingly larger weights on the panel, in this case, installed at at 37°.

As module size increases, the local pressure and bending moment begins to increase exponentially. LONGi also tested a 3.1 m2 module – the size of a large format 210 mm solar cell based module – which failed at 4,600 Pa. LONGi recently announced that they had come to a sizing standardization agreement with JA Solar and Jinko Solar for 182mm solar cell based panels. The standardization agreement, among other items, sets the size of 72-cell products at 2,278 × 1,134mm (2.58 m2), with 78-cell panels set at 2,465 × 1,134mm (2.79 m2).
The press release from LONGi is part of the ongoing discussion amongst manufacturers as they settle in on the next generation of solar cell and panel sizing

LONGi included a table sharing the amount of glass deformation that would occur before the module actually breaks. Panel deformation matters because it can crack solar cells, and cracked solar cells lower module performance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/08/anti-rooftop-solar-net-metering-bill-passes-in-florida/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 8, 2022",Anti-rooftop solar net metering bill passes in Florida,"In a hard blow to the budding solar rooftop industry in Florida, the state legislature passed House Bill 741, which phases down the value of net metering, and opens the door for utilities to add fixed charges to solar customer bills. Advocacy organizations FLASEIA, Vote Solar, and environmental groups in the state said they will now call on Governor Ron Desantis to veto the bill.
Once the law takes effect in 2023, payments to solar customers will regress from a retail rate, like the one they pay utilities at around 10 cents a kilowatt, to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a fraction of the retail rate. The phase out will slash payment rates to solar customers by 50% in four years and would drop further still to the avoided cost rate by 2029.
The bill also allows for fixed charges for grid connected solar customers starting in 2026. The broad language in the bill does not set a limit on the fixed charges. Similar fees were proposed in the now-stalled California Net Energy Metering 3.0 and were described as “a tax on the sun.”
“This bill is a nightmare for anyone who believes in energy freedom and the rights of people to choose the energy that works for them and their families. Net metering has helped over 100,000 Florida homeowners make that choice, and utilities are now banking on the state government to strip those rights away and pad their monopoly hold on electricity. Florida has seen its solar industry grow to employ 11,000 people and generate over $10 billion in economic activity. States that enact bad legislation like this will see much of that business growth disappear, and we’re urging Governor Desantis to veto the bill and maintain Florida’s place as a national energy leader. This is a simple choice between helping the monopolies and helping the people.” Will Giese, southeast regional director, Solar Energy Industries Association.
The bill had been faced with bipartisan opposition from Florida voters. A Mason Dixon poll showed 74% of Republicans and 94% of Democrat respondents wanted net metering to remain intact. In the same survey 68% of respondents said they think utilities should make it easier to install rooftop solar, not harder.
Founded on the idea of the “cost shift,” the bills are pitched as a protection for non-solar customers from raised rates through cross-subsidizing solar customers. Studies completed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that 40 of the 43 states and Washington D.C. with net metering programs have a negligible cost increase attributed to solar.
The Berkeley study found that cost pressures from net metering don’t start making a tangible effect until solar penetration reaches 10%. Florida is nowhere near this figure, with 0.86% of households currently topped with solar. Read more about the “cost shift” and a utility-funded coalition that spread the idea in California here.
