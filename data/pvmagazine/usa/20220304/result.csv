Corvias,the project developer is a solar installer headquartered in East Greenwich, RI. Corvias has been a partner for 20 years to the US Military under the Department of Defense’s Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) program. Upon completeion of approximately 350 additional solar systems as part of its second phase of its solar project at Fort Riley, there will be panels on more than 1,600 homes on the base.

The project is being completed in two phases, and when both are complete they will offset an estimated 40% of annual electricity consumed by on-post family housing and is expected to generate 15,000MWh in the first year of full operation–enough to power more than 1,300 homes annually, or the equivalent of planting six million trees or saving 450,000 gallons of fuel.
“This achievement reflects our continued commitment to the Department of Defense (DoD) and to energy conservation,” said Corvias Managing Director Peter Sims.
A third phase will begin later this year and will include Onyx Construction, a vertically integrated renewable energy developer headquartered in New York City that has over 184MW of operating assets as of February 2022, . The plan for this phase is to complete two ground mount solar arrays within the housing community. When all three phases of the program is complete, about half the homes on the Fort Riley base will be powered by solar.
The completion of this three-part project will help advance the DoD’s goal to provide 100% of each military installation’s critical-mission energy load by the end of 2030.

About 4,600 Iowa homeowners have received credits.
But a vast portion of customers, nearly 3,000, who believed they would receive a credit, are standing by on waitlists. The program was so popular that the $5 million appropriated for the fund dried up, and now customers are waiting for their credits.
The credit is issued to residential and commercial customers in the state. The Gazette reported that Gary Groman of Cedar Rapids invested $35,000 in a solar array, expecting $4,700 in credits from the state and $9,000 from the federal investment tax credit.
Christopher Rants of the Iowa Solar Energy Trade Association said, “You’ve got folks who didn’t just go buy solar yesterday. You have people on the waitlist who made their investment two years ago and were expecting their credit because at the time they made their investment the credit was ongoing.”
The Iowa legislature is now working on a bill that is aimed at covering the tax credits, but it is not expected to extend the program. This is despite the fact that Iowa’s governor Kim Reynolds said the state has a surplus of revenues, and that historic tax cuts have been approved in the state recently.
Iowa Democrats are calling for more than just relief to the wait list and are hopeful an extension can be crafted. “I think this is the lowest bar,” Rep. Eric Gjerde, D-Cedar Rapids, said at the HF 2395 subcommittee hearing.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) ranks Iowa 30th in the nation in solar deployment with an estimated 440MW installed. An estimated 700-1000 people are employed in the solar industry in Iowa, and SEIA projects a 5-year growth of 980MW for the Hawkeye State.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/04/autonomous-laser-system-clears-birds-from-solar-installations/,"MARKETS & POLICY,O&M,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 4, 2022",Autonomous laser system clears birds from solar installations,"Bird Control Group sells an autonomous laser deterrent that has been shown to reduce specific bird populations in sensitive areas by more than 99%. The company is confident enough to guarantee at least 70% fewer birds! The company is currently developing a machine learning algorithm that will further increase the laser system’s effectiveness.
The lasers are class 3B, with an output power of 5 and 499 milliWatts. Class 3B can be hazardous for the human eye when exposed directly and for an extended period. Bird Control Group states that their deterrent products have an expanded beam, which ensures that only a small percentage of the laser’s potential can enter the eye.
The unit can plug into standard 240 volt electricity, or run on its own 24V solar + battery standalone system. The beams are green because birds perceive green lasers best, and they have an effective distance of 300 to 600 meters in full sun. At night, the lasers can be effective as far as 1.5 miles away.

The coverage area was larger than we expected, so in order to confirm the area that a unit could potentially cover with the laser, we consulted Wolfram Alpha’s math engine to double check our πr2 results.
“What is the area of a circle with a 300 meter radius?” – Wolfram’s answer is 69.87 acres. This suggests that a single unit placed in the middle of a 6.5MWdc community solar facility could relocate a daytime bird population.

Here in New England, gulls can be a nuisance, as they are known to drop quahogs onto solar panels. And even when they’re not directly damaging panels, the birds’ droppings can be a nuisance – covering panels, roofs, and cars in droppings and clogging drains. A laser installed on a roof in the Netherlands in 2014 showed a 90% reduction in seagull activity, a figure that ought to raise a few eyebrows among solar developers and owners of larger solar power facilities near oceans and lakes.
 
For crop protection, most bird problems were addressed at dawn and at dusk, when birds were actively feeding. The reduced sunlight at these times also helps the laser work more efficiently.
In their online videos, the company notes that a standalone unit costs around $20,000 with the 24-volt solar panels, battery, controller, and wiring. Alternative bird control devices rely on noise, like propane cannons or bird squawkers. These devices are cheaper, (a professional squawker is around $1,600), but your neighbors won’t appreciate the noise, and after a while most birds learn to ignore them anyway.
Another excellent use for these devices is to limit the spread of avian influenza from wild to farmed populations on free-range poultry farms. When lasers were tested on such farms during the day and night, the university team found a decrease of 99.7% in wild ducks visiting the area. Other wild birds decreased their visits by greater than 96%.

When the laser was turned off, wild geese returned to the surrounding grass pastures.
For farmers and solar developers seeking to integrate agrivoltaics, and may be concerned with damage and contamination from bird feeding and droppings – the unit has already been proven effective across several agricultural scenarios. Berries, grapes, sunflowers, sweetcorn, and many other farmed products are delicacies for local bird populations. Despite the temptation, birds at these sites were well deterred by the lasers.
One sweetcorn farmer said that he believes his system paid for itself in the first year, by decreasing his sweetcorn losses 70%.
The Frankfurt Airport is using the handheld, manual version of the laser. The airport is surrounded by forests and grassland that birds love. They have extensive experience dealing with birds, and are of course conscious of the hazards lasers present to pilot’s eyes when operating aircraft. Wildlife Control Coordinator Jürgen J. Ebert explains that the device’s patented Horizon Safety System, “makes it easier for authorities to permit the use of [the] laser at airports.” Prior to using the Aerolaser, the airport used pyrotechnics, shotguns, and loudspeakers. The best results were found among birds that tend to sit on the ground more.
The company now believes its product will fit in well with the solar industry, especially as the market shifts toward agrivoltaic systems.

SolaREIT offers land financing options, headlined by its pre-paid solar land lease, which offers immediate lease payment to landowners for siting projects on their property.
The company works directly with landowners and developers to provide liquidity for land under operating solar assets, while offering fixed, stable revenues to investors. Its pre-paid leases are another product offering that provides near-term liquidity to landowners while maintaining the long-term ownership of the land within their family.
SolaREIT also works in agrivoltaics, co-locating farming and other agricultural uses with solar facilities.

“Community and commercial solar is in real need of increased financial options and access to more capital,” said Gautam Chandra, managing director of SolaREIT. “This investment confirms the strong interest from the largest and most progressive institutional investors in this sector.”
The pre-paid land lease was introduced in May 2021. Landowners can be paid upfront for between 10-30 years of payments.
“The mid-sized and commercial solar sector has been underserved for years but holds tremendous promise”, said Chris Miller, managing director of Nuveen, “Increasing capital flexibility into this segment can have a significant impact on the market growth of solar, and ESG focused investments such as SolaREIT can help create value for our clients today and preserve value for tomorrow’s world.”
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates solar could cover as much as 3 million acres by 2030, creating a large market opportunity for real estate investment firms like SolaREIT.

Primergy selected Kiewit Power Constructors Co. as Gemini’s engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partner and IHI Terrasun Solutions as the integrator for the project’s 380MW/1,520MWh lithium-ion battery, also one of the largest known to pv magazine.
According to Primergy, the two companies were chosen due to their “decades of experience in construction and installation, product development, procurement and systems integration in the renewable energy and power sector.”
As for the solar hardware, the project will utilize over 1.8 million of Maxeon Solar Technologies’ high efficiency bifacial solar modules. Maxeon’s bifacial panels use shingled cell panel technology in bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large format 8-inch G12 wafers. The modules offer efficiency of over 21%, enhanced shade tolerance, and power ratings of up to 625W.
“The final selection of equipment supply and construction partners for Gemini has been a long, detailed and thoughtful process,” said Managing Partner of Quinbrook, David Scaysbrook. “The Quinbrook and Primergy teams have worked diligently to evaluate each supplier’s credentials and track record from an ESG perspective in accordance with Quinbrook policies. This includes detailed supply chain investigation and materials sourcing to ensure we have procured responsibly, especially in a challenging market and regulatory environment for solar and storage equipment.”
Slated for completion in 2023 with operations beginning shortly thereafter, the Gemini project is expected to create approximately 1,000 local jobs, which will be sourced through union participation. Specifically, on-site construction workforce is expected to average 500 to 700 construction workers, with a peak of up to 900 workers, supporting up to an additional 1,100 jobs in the local community and injecting an estimated $712.5 million into the economy during construction, according to previous updates from Primergy and Quinbrook.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/04/mitrex-releases-the-solar-brick-a-solar-integrated-building-facade/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,CANADA",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 4, 2022",Mitrex releases the Solar Brick–a solar-integrated building facade,"Mitrex, a Canadian solar technology manufacturer, is launching the Solar Brick. This solar-integrated surface looks just like a brick wall, but embedded lie solar modules.
Mitrex Solar Brick facades can be made up of 330W solar panels, which are constructed in the same manner as Mitrex’ other BIPV panels. As shown here, the panels are backed by an aluminum honeycomb sandwiched between layers of solid aluminum sheets, making it both
lightweight and durable.

 
The monocrystaline solar cell is topped with a glass façade in various designs, and the the surface is coated with patented anti-reflective and anti-soiling coatings. The standard panel sizes range from 2-3.5 ft. by 4-6.66 ft. and they can customize panel sizes up to a maximum of 6.5 ft. by 12 ft. The glass is customizable and other looks include granite, porcelain, brick, wood, or customized graphics.

There’s also a design that mimics roofing tiles. Mitrex said its Solar Brick is suitable for new construction projects or retrofits of older structures, including recladding or over-cladding.
“Our mission is to transform how we build our structures—electrically-powered buildings are a logical and sustainable solution to combat climate change,” says Mitrex CEO Danial Hadizadeh.
Mitrex solar facades are being put the test in an installation on a building in Etobicoke, Toronto.
