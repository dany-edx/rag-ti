It would simplify the tax code, consolidating dozens of energy-related tax provisions into three streamlined incentives – for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation – all with an eye toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
It includes an enhanced solar investment tax credit (ITC), a stand-alone energy storage ITC, and additional tax incentives for transmission, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, among others.
A provision of a clean energy bill in Congress would repeal a half-century-old policy that has underpinned the solar industry’s business model.

That provision is the repeal of the half-century old policy requiring investor-owned utilities (IOU) to spread the benefit of federal investment tax credits to ratepayers over the life of the asset. In tax code parlance, this provision is called “normalization.”
The reason Congress initially passed the normalization rule was to prevent utilities from double-dipping on their capital investments. For example, with normalization, an IOU could realize the full value of a tax credit in the first year of the asset’s life, giving a windfall profit to shareholders. In future years, if that same utility was not achieving revenue expectations to meet their guaranteed rate of return, they then would propose raising rates despite having realized the tax credit windfall in the first year of the asset’s operation.
By requiring the benefit of the tax credit to be spread over the life of the asset through tax normalization, Congress ensured that shareholders and ratepayers would equally benefit from the tax credit, not just those that were there on day one of the asset’s useful life.
Changing the ITC normalization rule would devastate the competitive environment for solar project developers.

Changing the ITC normalization rule would devastate the competitive environment for solar project developers that has facilitated the market’s explosive growth over the past decade. An anti-competitive playing field would stifle the very market that the legislation’s sponsors are trying to facilitate. It is why the Solar Energy Industries Association has come out in opposition to changing the tax normalization rules, despite their general support of other provisions in the bill.
To understand why changing the ITC normalization rules would have such a significant impact on the competitive landscape for solar project developers it requires a brief explanation of how the policy impacts the market today.
The investor-owned utility business model is to make capital expenditures that are then recouped through their rate base, plus a guaranteed rate of return. Each of these capital expenditures must be approved by a regulatory body, typically the public utility commission. That approval process, in simplified terms, is effectively a net present value or an LCOE analysis.

Solar energy projects do not typically clear that analysis, so utilities have usually not been able to attain approval to acquire and rate-base solar projects. The reason that utility-sponsored solar projects are not typically able to clear this analysis is because they are not able to take advantage of the ITC in the same way that developers and independent power producers can due to normalization rules that require spreading the value of tax credits over a long period of time.
So, even though utilities have tax appetite for the ITC, they are unable to take advantage of it due to the time value of money; tax credit money, in this case.
This normalization rule is the primary reason that utilities, which still must meet growing demand and mandates for renewable energy, instead enter into bilateral power purchase agreements with project developers. It is because they are unable to fund the capital expenditure to build and own solar projects due to their inability to use the ITC.
For the U.S. to meet its ambitious climate goals, we need more – not less – competition in the power generation market.
But by removing ITC normalization, Congress would be propping up the artificial monopoly rights on power generation that utilities have traditionally enjoyed. It would mean the end of the business model of project development that has allowed solar to proliferate nationwide.
And, in the long run, the starving of competition in the market would lead to less valuable projects and higher costs for consumers, not to mention hindering the overarching societal objective of lowering greenhouse gas emissions through cleaner power generation. Developers beware of this wolf in sheep’s clothing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/07/report-assesses-the-budding-market-of-distributed-solar-storage/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2021",Report assesses the budding market of distributed solar + storage,"Energy storage paired with solar in “behind-the-meter” (BTM) applications reached roughly 550 MW in 2020, representing about 17% of all U.S. battery storage capacity installed during the year, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
Berkeley Labs reports residential installations made up about two-thirds of all solar-storage BTM capacity, partly because almost all residential storage is coupled with solar.
Roughly 3,200 MW of storage capacity was added in the U.S. through 2020. Roughly 1,000 MW (30%) was behind-the-meter, and of that, 550 MW was paired with solar. Residential storage was coupled with solar in 80% of projects, while non-residential BTM storage included solar in 40% of all projects. Around 19% of all utility-scale/front-of-the-meter storage capacity was paired with solar.

Despite growth nationally, storage attachment rates of BTM solar installs remain low, the report said, with 6% of residential, and 2% of non-residential systems choosing to attach batteries at install.
Some states and utility territories had much higher storage attachment rates, especially Hawaii. There, roughly 80% of all residential and 40% of non-residential PV installations were paired with storage in 2020. The attachment rate was attributed to the state’s transition away from net metering.
Image: Berkeley Labs
California also showed relatively high attachment rates, driven by a combination of direct cash rebates for storage equipment, and by concern related to wildfire-driven power outages, said Berkeley Labs.
Income had some correlation with storage attachment rates at the residential level, the report said. In California, PV+ storage residential customers had median incomes 66% higher than their area median income, while stand-alone PV adopters were 41% higher.
Schools made up a markedly larger share of PV + storage systems (25%) than for stand-alone PV (8%). Berkeley Labs attributed that to a unique value for resilience, and relatively large loads for the sector.
Retrofits, or the addition of batteries to an already-active PV system, did not occur with relative frequency, except in California. For residential systems, 25% of paired systems were retrofits, and 38% of non-residential solar + storage facilities were the result of a retrofit.
Storage retrofits were being added to PV systems of all ages, but typically ware installed on systems that were less than three years old. In about 10% of all retrofits additional PV capacity was added, the report said.
Berkeley Labs said the residential storage market was dominated by two brands in 2020, the Tesla PowerWall, a 5 kW/ 13.5 kWh, 2.7 hour unit, and the LG Chem, a 5 kW/ 9.3 kWh, 1.9 hour unit.
Most residential systems consist of a single battery, though the share of multi-battery installations has nearly doubled from roughly 20% to 40% from 2017 to 2020. PV systems paired with storage tend to be slightly larger than stand-alone systems, with the median case being
roughly 1 kW larger in size.
On the non-residential size, there was a greater diversity of battery suppliers, though the Tesla Powerwall commanded roughly half of the segment. Storage sizing in paired applications ranged widely, but the median values were 100 kW and 200 kWh, and most batteries were about two-hour duration.
PV systems in paired applications were generally much larger than stand-alone in the non-residential BTM market, with a median system size of 200 kW for paired vs. 40 kW for stand-alone.
BTM installers were increasingly found to offer storage along with their solar installations. In 2020 50% of all active residential installers reported completing at least one paired project. The report said that the market for solar plus storage remains considerably more concentrated than that of stand-alone solar.
Ten firms comprised roughly 60% of all U.S. residential PV and storage installs in 2020.  Sunrun and Tesla each accounted for about a 20% share. Most others in the top 10 were local firms in Hawaii and California.
Installer-level attachment rates varied from firm to firm in California, suggesting a wide array of divergent business and marketing strategies.
Non-residential BTM solar-plus-storage remained relatively specialized, the report said, with about 17% of firms having completed at least one system through 2020. Tesla stood out with more than 200 cumulative installations, though in recent years its market share has shrunk to 10%, the report said.
Berkeley Labs synthesized data from National Renewable Energy Laboratory studies, Tesla online quotes, the WoodMackenzie monitor report, and other sources to arrive at typical price figures for including storage with a BTM system.
It found that the incremental cost of adding batteries to PV averaged about $1,ooo/kWh of storage. This varied by source from about $700-$1300/kWh, and ranged much more widely for individual projects. The installed price-premium for residential PV landed at $1.20/W, with sources ranging from $1.15-$1.50/W, and individual projects also showing a much wider price premium range.
Berkeley Lab also analyzed the value-to-customer of adding storage. It was found that the benefit depended largely on which utility service area and state the project was located in. On average, the financial value of adding storage was estimated to be $500-$1000/kWh.
Berkeley Labs said this finding suggests co-adoption was likely driven by non-financial considerations, like the value of resilience during power outages.
By contrast, on the non-residential side, the customer-economics fared better. The report estimated present-value benefits ranging from $1,200-$2,000/kWh. This was due partly to the availability of accelerated depreciation, and partly to the fact that these buildings can avoid relatively high electricity demand charges by using smart storage export techniques.
LBL also analyzed how much backup power can be expected from a residential system. It found that a standard configuration 7 kW system paired with 5 kW/10 kWh battery storage could serve, on average, about 60-80% of a customer’s daily consumption over the course of a year. These values vary seasonally, and vary even more dramatically on a day to day basis due to cloud cover.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/07/heres-how-you-can-help-bring-emergency-solar-to-new-orleans/,"COMMUNITY,DISASTER RECOVERY,LOUISIANA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2021",Here’s how you can help bring emergency solar to New Orleans,"The Footprint Project is seeking hardware and monetary donations to construct solar power plus energy storage mobile microgrids to be deployed in New Orleans. The non-profit can be reached via its Contact Us page.
The group is currently raising $50,000, via a DER Task Force initiated GoFundMe, to purchase and deploy this solar+storage hardware into New Orleans. As of press time for this article, they’ve raised more than $45,000.
Hurricane Ida on August 29 knocked out all transmission power lines that support the greater New Orleans region. Estimated reconstruction timelines were initially estimated at greater than two months. Specific areas within local electricity utility Entergy have been given tentative electricity restoration time frames through the end of September.
Footprint Project is working to set up mobile solar and storage throughout New Orleans to complement the diesel/gas generators that are being deployed by others. Typical sites include community centers, medical centers, and fire stations, as well as street corners and parking lots so people can charge cell phones, medical and mobility devices, and use wifi.
California battery manufacturer SimpliPhi’s Matt Roberts said that it sent a pallet of batteries, and is also working with the Footprint Project. Roberts said the company will donate 1% of all revenue to high human-impact energy projects.
And now that Solar Power International in New Orleans has been cancelled, companies that were sending pallets of material for the exhibit hall are being solicited to swap palletized goods for products that will help bring New Orleans back online.
The Footprint Project said it has deployed 45+ kW of mobile solar and 170+ kWh of mobile battery storage to at least 10 disaster response and recovery missions, providing emergency clean power access to 14,000 people.
On its website, the Footprint Project shares assessment forms, computer animated designs (CAD), and hardware specification sheets. The group has designed and deployed two sets of hardware.
One is a 5’x8’ aluminum trailer that couples six commercial solar panels with 3.8 kWh of energy storage. The design stored in the group’s Google Drive share notes a total hardware price just shy of $30,000.
The space and energy resources that are contained in the unit are listed on Footprint’s website as being viable for shelter, water, communications, operations, food, administration, and emergency health services.
Footprint provides plans for a second, smaller flat-packed solar trailer as well. The unit costs approximately $8,500 when fitted with 3 kWh of batteries and four solar panels.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers, along with the Idaho National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories will develop the hybrid plant at NREL’s Flatirons campus in Arvada, Colorado.
The multi-megawatt facility will explore the ability of hybrid (solar and wind) power plants to operate as fully dispatchable and flexible energy sources when paired with energy storage. NREL said these hybridized power plants would be able to operate in day-ahead and real-time energy markets and provide essential reliability and resiliency services to the grid.
Many kinds of storage options will be tested, including batteries, pumped hydropower, flow batteries, hydrogen, kinetic storage, and ultracapacitor energy storage.

Hybrid plants benefit operators through economies of scale by sharing infrastructure, permitting costs, and siting costs, said the researchers.

Additionally, the project will develop advanced control strategies and explore forecasting techniques. Sophisticated controls can improve dispatchability and capacity factors of variable generators like solar and wind by taking advantage of their complementary nature, often with minimum or zero transmission buildup, said NREL.
The project looks to provide strategies to reduce renewable energy curtailment, a problem for solar in states with high capacity, as well as increase overall production, and smooth variability.
According to NREL, hybrid renewable sites are dynamic, and can provide essential reliability services as well as new types of services in an evolving energy environment. For example, hybrid systems can provide black start services, can operate in islanded mode, and can participate in power system restoration schemes.
Results from the FlexPower study will be available through the public domain. The labs will share the project’s controller architecture and control codes, energy hybridization-potential assessment maps and databases, regional impact studies, reports, publications, and webinars.
The facility will also be available as a test bed for control and equipment vendors to study hybrid controls and hardware, as a venue for workforce education, and as a validation platform for standardizing hybrid technologies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/09/07/oya-begins-work-on-140-mw-new-york-community-solar/,"COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,NEW YORK",TIM SYLVIA,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2021",OYA begins work on 140 MW New York community solar,"OYA Solar has begun construction on a five-project portfolio of community solar installations, all located in Upstate New York.
Specifically, the projects will be constructed in Jefferson, Livingston, Onondaga, and Oswego Counties, all of which border Lake Ontario.
These five projects, totaling 25 MW in capacity bring OYA’s active New York construction pipeline to six total projects, joining the 7 MW community solar project being constructed on State Route 122A in Franklin County, already under construction.
The effort will not stop with these six projects, however, as OYA said it expects to build another 140 MW of community solar projects in New York by the end 2022.
OYA has been making a significant community solar development push in New York as of late, and, in June, the company closed on an exclusive co-development agreement with Omni Navitas to develop, construct, and own 600 MW of community solar projects across the Northeast U.S., at least 240 MW of which will be located in New York.
This builds on OYA’s already substantial North American development pipeline which, prior to the closing of this deal, sat at 2 GW of community and utility-scale solar.
According to OYA, its upcoming community solar pipeline represents roughly 12% of the New York’s entire community solar development pipeline. That is a sizeable share of total development for any state, and is especially significant considering New York is the state that installed 549 MW of community solar capacity in 2020, the most in the nation.
Community solar represents more than 90% of the state’s 2.7 GW two-year pipeline of projects under development that have been awarded NY-Sun incentives, comprising more than 800 projects.

Local fire crews were called around 8 pm to a reported structure fire, but no fire was found. News reports said that first responders instead found battery racks that had been scorched and wires melted. Fire crews remained on the scene into Sunday.
In a statement, Vistra said that the storage facility experienced “an overheating issue with a limited number of battery modules.” The incident affected the facility’s Phase I 300 MW /1200 MWh system.

Vistra said that risk mitigation and safety systems “worked as designed” and detected that modules were operating at a temperature above operational standards. The company said that targeted sprinkler systems were activated and aimed at the affected modules. Vistra said that the overheating was “controlled and contained” without the need for outside assistance.
Vistra said it would keep the entire facility offline as it investigates the root cause of the incident in partnership with its engineering contractor, Fluence, and battery manufacturer, LG Energy Solution. Vistra was uncertain on the timing of the return of the facility, pending an investigation and any needed repairs.
A spokesperson for Vistra told pv magazine in an email that the company cautioned against insinuating that the batteries caused the incident. “We are very early in our investigation and have not determined a root cause,” the spokesperson said.
The Phase II 100 MW system, which is located in a separate building on site and entered service in August, was not affected by the event. It is currently available for operation.
The 300 MW Moss Landing facility that suffered the battery overheating event entered service in December. The adjacent second phase entered service in mid-August and included 4,500 TR1300 battery racks from LG Energy Solution.
When the second phase entered service, LG said that its lithium-ion-based batteries met fire safety standards, and that its racks had been tested to verify compliance with UL9540A (Standard for Safety Test Method for Evaluating Thermal Runaway Fire Propagation in Battery Energy Storage Systems), to ensure any fire event would not be propagated to adjacent battery racks.
The TR1300’s rack design also meets the American Society of Civil Engineers’ ASCE 7-16, assuring its stable operation even during external environmental changes such as seismic tremors. The standard is now part of the California Building Code.
LG has been working to improve its battery technology since an April 2019 accident involving one of the company’s utility-scale lithium-ion battery arrays at an Arizona Public Service location. A thermal runaway event there caused an accumulation of gases in the container that housed the batteries. Those gases ignited when first responders opened an access door to investigate reports of smoke coming from the container. Two firefighters were seriously injured.
In late May, LG Energy Solution said it would replace, at its own cost, lithium-ion battery cells used for certain energy storage products that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program came after overheating incidents were reported.
The company said in a statement that it determined that there were issues in the early production processes for electrodes used in potentially affected batteries. Reports said the batteries were produced at the company’s Nanjing factory in China. The replacement program could cost around $350 million.
New batteries will incorporate manufacturing process improvements. The company said it also would implement remote modifications to reduce the potential for overheating while owners wait for their replacement units. LG Energy Solution also will update its battery diagnostic and control software. And it said that field inspections would be undertaken to monitor and minimize the potential for further incidents.
This article was updated on September 7 to clarify that Phase I of the facility entered service in December 2020 and was affected by the overheating incident.
