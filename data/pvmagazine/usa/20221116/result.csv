Power outages and the desire for backup energy storage has been pushing solar adoption as well. Technavio projects the market for U.S. solar may grow by 10% compound annual growth rates through 2025, reaching $5.99 billion in incremental growth by the end of that year.
However, the U.S. market faces a problem with soft costs, a barrier that other major nations’ markets have largely overcome. Soft costs represent any cost not tied directly to the cost of hardware itself. In the U.S., soft costs represent 65% of the project, said the Department of Energy (DOE).
Shawn Rumery, senior director of research at SEIA, said since 2014, residential system costs have come down 25%, but soft costs have dropped only 15%. Customer acquisition and overhead costs have risen 31% in the same time period, Rumery said.
Customer acquisition is difficult in the U.S. as residential solar crosses “The Chasm” in the technology adoption curve, a popular model for analyzing the time it takes for a new technology to be widely accepted by the general public.
The concept is that as a technology is adopted, expectations and customer profiles shift. Early innovators and early adopters, the first 15% or so to adopt a new technology, are highly motivated to adopt solar, perhaps as tech enthusiasts, environmentalists, or by other less financially-focused motivations. As you cross from the early innovators to the middle 30% of adopters, you encounter the early majority. This is the customer base that is motivated by pragmatic reasons, like wanting to save money on electric bills and having backup power during outages.
Crossing the chasm is considered the most critical moment in the adoption process, when a technology is accepted by the general public, and the momentum of a technology becomes essentially unstoppable. For solar to cross the chasm, it must meet the expectations and needs of pragmatists.
A short, painless project cycle with faster installation times and lower costs are two important parts of meeting these needs. These two needs underpin why SEIA and DOE have targetting permitting as an area of improvement.
Permitting, inspection, and interconnection represent 8% of the U.S. residential solar cost stack. Based on data from its members, SEIA estimates that a one week delay in system installation due to permitting, inspection and interconnection processes increases the client cancelation rate by 10%.
SEIA wrote on the subject, “The total direct and indirect cost of permitting for a residential system is on the order of $1/watt (or $6,000 – $7,000 per system) for residential solar PV systems. Outside the U.S., soft costs and specifically permitting costs are much lower.”
SEIA is currently working in partnership with DOE to nationally roll out SolarAPP+, which offers instant permits and slashes costs. In a pilot of five jurisdictions across diverse residential solar market characteristics and needs, SolarAPP+ reduced overall project times by an average of 12 days.
DOE also partnered with the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and the International City/County Management Association to develop the SolSmart program, offering targeted, no-cost technical assistance to communities across the U.S., aiding municipalities in becoming solar-ready and streamlining local processes.
Also within the SolSmart program and other DOE efforts are community engagement plans that aim to educate and reach pragmatists, cutting down on customer acquisition and marketing costs. The community engagement plans help cut predatory practices and set reasonable expectations for the solar installation process, making for a better customer experience.
A good customer experience is more likely to lead to a referral, generating more business and accelerating the adoption curve. Referrals are so valuable, in fact, that many residential installers and their affiliates are willing to shell out for them. Third-party lead generator SuperGreen Solutions recently announced it would pay $1,000 per customer referred that moves forward with an installation.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes a provision to chip away at residential soft costs as well. For systems less than 5 MW, the IRA makes interconnection costs eligible for the 30% investment tax credit.

Silicon gas segment sales were down about 19.5% in the same timeframe to 586 MT in Q3 22 from 728 MT in Q3 21.
The company, which is based in Norway, reported $36.7 million of Q3 22 revenues, a 1.4% improvement compared to $36.2 million a year ago, while it reported negative $13.8 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a wider loss compared to negative $3.7 million adjusted EBITDA in Q3 21.
“Although earnings for this quarter are disappointing due to reduced gas shipments, record high energy costs, and a complex non-recurring planned production shut down, long-term megatrends remain in place for REC to be in a strong position for long term success with the correct product mix, locations and accessible production capacity,” said Kurt Levens, chief executive officer of REC Silicon.
REC Silicon pointed to ongoing supply-chain constraints affecting global shipments and order timing, while its flat-panel display production utilization forced demand deferrals.
As a result, the company expects flat-panel production and supply-chain disruptions to persist in the near term. The company said it would be forced to implement price increases in 2023.
Long-term business drivers include data, mobility and automotive content production as well as increased demand for silicon in electric vehicle batteries and the reshoring of advanced semiconductor production thanks to incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Moses Lake restart
REC Silicon’s Moses Lake facility in Washington state was shut down in mid-2019 when China imposed steep tariffs on U.S.-made polysilicon, in retaliation for tariffs imposed on Chinese-made solar panels in 2013. In its Q3 22 report, REC Silicon confirmed it will restart solar polysilicon production at Moses Lake in the U.S. state of Washington in Q3 23, following Hanwha’s decision to acquire a 16.67% stake in the Norwegian manufacturer in late 2021.
The company reports that Moses Lake’s ramp up will see the facility at 50% capacity utilization by mid-2024, with full capacity production on track for Q4 24.
In November 2021, Hanwha Solutions bought 21.9 million shares in REC Silicon ASA from Aker Horizons in addition to approximately 48.2 million new shares in REC Silicon through a private placement. As a result, Hanwha Solutions and Aker Horizons both own approximately 16.67% in REC Silicon.
REC Silicon shares traded at NOK 18.09 ($1.82) per share today, up 20.6% from NOK 15 ($1.72) per share a year ago, while the company has a NOK 7.61 billion ($762 million) market capitalization.

An international research group led by Spain’s DLR Institute of Solar Research has developed Radguard, a novel system that measures soiling losses in PV systems.
Radguard uses a lamp to illuminate a pyranometer or PV reference cell for about 45 minutes at night. The lamp is protected from soiling by a 25-cm collimator. The scientists said this is crucial for the correct functioning of the device, as well as the fixed position of the lamp.
“By comparing the irradiance measured at night with that of another night when the sensor was clean, the soiling loss can be derived,” the scientists said. “Several 45-minute long measurements are combined to detect erroneous soiling measurements caused by dew, rain droplets on the radiometer, or other effects that might only be present in some of the various measurements.”
They placed the RS2600 pocket lamp on one end of a 90-degree angle structure. On the other side of the structure, they used a corresponding sensor, a CM11 pyranometer, and an NES SOZ-03 reference cell with textured cover glass. They also used a Campbell CR1000 data-logger to collect data on the reference cell’s short-circuit current and the pyranometer’s voltage.
“The batteries of the lamp are replaced by a power supply that is controlled with a common time controller that switches on the lamp during one or more 45-minute intervals at night,” said the academics.
The group validated the new technique in four-month testing held in outdoor conditions, which it claims showed an accuracy that is close to that of the reference method, which however includes the daily cleaning of the reference devices.
“The measured soiling losses were compared to soiling losses derived by comparing the test radiometer to a clean device of the same model,” the scientists said. “The deviations between the data sets were found to be below the expected uncertainty of the reference data with low biases of <0.3%.”
They described the new technique in “Autonomous measurement system for photovoltaic and radiometer soiling losses,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research team includes academics from Sweden’s DLR Remote Sensing Data Center, Spain’s CIEMAT Plataforma Solar de Almería, and Germany’s DLR Institute of Remote Sensing Technology.
“In the future, the method will be tested at further sites and in longer measurement campaigns that are now under preparation,” they concluded.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/16/50-states-of-solar-incentives-alabama/,"BATTERY,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,INSTALLATIONS,INTERVIEW,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ALABAMA,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"NOVEMBER 16, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Alabama,"The pv magazine USA tour of solar incentives state by state last stopped in Tennessee, and now moves onto Alabama.
Nicknamed “The Heart of Dixie,” Alabama lacks the framework that Georgia, Florida and other Southern states now share for rooftop solar, while the state’s striated utility market makes for limited development of large utility-scale and corporate offtake projects.
Post-pandemic, the state of Alabama has started to increase its mix of utility-scale solar development to baseload generation resources. In 2021, the state deployed 294.8 MW of utility solar projects, a value that may not seem like much, but is larger than the previous five years combined.
Solar industry advocates continue to point to the state’s regulator the Alabama Public Service Commission entrenchment with the fossil fuel industry as well as the region’s reliance on natural gas as harbingers for slow change for the residential solar and distributed energy markets in the state.
With the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) operating in Alabama’s northern belt, public utility Alabama Power (owned by Southern Company) operating in the Capitol region’s mid-section, and some 22 rural electric cooperatives operating elsewhere across the state, it’s difficult to not associate Alabama with a stifled or dislocated market for growth in the distributed energy marketplace.
Solar Tax Blues
Alabama’s utility regulator has a history of restraining rooftop solar for residential and commercial applications.  In April, the Alabama PSC sided with Alabama Power’s increased ‘Capacity Reservation Charge’ from $5 to $5.41 per kW deployed per month, which for an average 5 kW system equates to a $25 monthly fee payable to Alabama Power for Alabamians to go solar.
The state’s utility-scale solar development rules date back to the federal PURPA legislation from 1978, and the Alabama PSC enforces a maximum 80 MW size limit for utility and commercial project development.
It’s worth noting that Alabama’s two biggest solar projects – Muscle Shoals Solar (296 MW) and Black Bear Solar (130 MW), built over the last year by Orsted and BP Lightsource – are located outside of the PSC’s jurisdiction in TVA and  Alabama Municipal Electric Authority service territory, respectively.
IRA Help on the Way
Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, a distributed energy advocacy group, said the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and other bipartisan legislation could create a market for behind-the-meter distributed generation (DG) activity, as well as local manufacturing opportunities in the state over the next one to two years.
For 50 kW to 1 MW systems, Tait said commercial and industrial (C&I) customers could receive a federal rebate to offset the cost of deploying rooftop solar and storage systems, which–in the absence of state rebates or cost incentives for DG systems–C&I customers can at least benefit from a partial cost recovery from federal rebates attached to the IRA.
“For DERs, many utilities are saying “we’re closed off,” rather than take slim benefits, but we hope that the IRA will open some eyes that DERs are coming no matter what,” Tait said. “I’m certainly less hopeful Alabama Power catches some religion out of it.”
Once a historic hub for the automotive parts market, Alabama saw signs of life in August with Mercedes-Benz announcing a $7 billion commitment to invest in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Full-scale production of the automaker’s all-electric EQS SUV model is slated to begin in late 2022 in Tuscaloosa, while Mercedes first invested in Bibb County, Alabama in 2017 to assemble EV components.
Anovion Battery Materials was one of 20 corporate recipients of federal grant funding under the Department of Energy’s $2.8 billion stipend from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for the sourcing of North American battery components.  Chicago-based Anovion is receiving $117 million of DOE funding to produce a synthetic graphite anode material at a 35,000 ton facility in northern Alabama for use in lithium-ion EV batteries and energy storage applications.
“We are receiving an increasing number of phone calls from people asking about the IRA being a tool to explore commercial opportunities in the state,” said Tait.
Landmark Projects
Alabama’s small solar exposure is largely characterized by large-scale projects built for corporations in pursuit of environmental and social governance goals (ESG), like the Muscle Shoals Solar (295 MW) project in Muscle Shoals, Alabama for Facebook owner Meta, and Hollywood Solar (150 MW) for Google.
Both utility projects are powering the technology giants’ data centers and are located in Tennessee Valley Authority’s northern Alabama territory, which is not governed by the project limitations imposed by the state’s utility regulator.
According to SEIA, Alabama got a bump up to number 19 in the country for solar development with the installation of Muscle Shoals Solar in 2021, but has since dropped to number 31 in the United States with 577.9 MW of solar installed to date.
With 35 solar companies operating in the state, Tait and regional distributed energy advocates are hopeful that the IRA legislation will spur interest in clean energy manufacturing finding a hub in the Heart of Dixie, which in turn could spur a change in the state’s policy framework for solar installations in years to come.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/16/solar-industry-sends-letter-to-commerce-requesting-rejection-of-tariff-case/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 16, 2022",Solar industry sends letter to Commerce requesting rejection of tariff case,"A coalition of more than 240 solar and energy storage companies have signed on to a Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) letter imploring U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to reject a petition for new anti-circumvention tariffs applied to goods shipped from four Southeast Asian countries. 
The investigation was ignited by a petition filed by a small California-based solar module manufacturer, Auxin Solar. Auxin requested that the DOC review solar panel imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, alleging that the nations that are suppliers of 80% of U.S. polysilicon modules are harboring tariff-avoiding Chinese products. If found in violation, tariffs as high as 50% to 250% of the cost of shipped goods could be applied. 
Following the announcement that Commerce would take up the investigation, SEIA cut its forecast for solar installations in 2022 by 46%. DOC recently announced that the preliminary determination, originally expected to be made on November 28, 2022, has been pushed to December 1, 2022. The industry now writes to Secretary Raimondo imploring her to reject the case, thereby reestablishing a steadier supply of solar modules to support the clean energy transition. 
In June, President Biden placed a two-year pause on solar tariffs, but a determination on the Auxin petition is still due. 
“President Biden took a crucial near-term step over the summer to free up a gridlocked solar supply chain, but companies won’t be able to capitalize on the administration’s landmark climate policy if this baseless case isn’t thrown out,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA. “The Inflation Reduction Act has launched a steady stream of manufacturing investments in the United States, but more tariffs will only undermine this success.” 
SEIA said the Auxin petition “lacks legal merit.” It said solar cell and module manufacturing requires specialized equipment and is an intensive process. Due to this “significant and major” manufacturing work done in the Southeast Asian countries, the case does not meet the standard for circumvention, said SEIA. 
“The manufacturing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act put SEIA’s goal of 50 GW of U.S. solar production by 2030 within reach, but Commerce could crush demand with unjustified tariffs,” wrote SEIA. 
SEIA said an affirmative determination of the Auxin petition or further delays would create uncertainty for U.S. solar businesses, stifle deployment, and limit solar jobs. “It would also undercut efforts to address the existential threat of climate change,” wrote SEIA. 
“We urge you to issue a negative preliminary determination and ensure the U.S. solar industry can continue to deliver economic and environmental benefits for years to come,” said the letter in closing.

JinkoSolar has achieved a 23.86% conversion efficiency for a new n-type monocrystalline solar PV module. The panel is based on its TOPCon mono cell technology, which achieved a record efficiency of 26.1% in mid-October. The results, which were confirmed by Germany’s TÜV Rheinland, builds on the company’s previous record of 23.53%, set in July.
“The module adopted JinkoSolar’s latest TOPCon cell technology and advanced welding and packaging technology and achieved conversion efficiency of 23.86%,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The advanced welding and packaging technology effectively reduces the internal resistance loss of the module, while significantly improving conversion efficiency. In addition, this lab result has the practical foundation to be introduced into mass production, and technically set the direction for mass production of subsequent advanced products.”
In January 2020, Jinko said it managed to improve panel performance by applying a new anti-reflection coating and advanced metallization technologies. It also incorporated New Tiling Ribbon (TR) technology into the cell design, to eliminate inter-cell gaps. At the time, the panel power conversion efficiency was 22.39%.
Its new solar module features solar cells with a 267.72 cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate, grown using the Czochralski method.

The team will initially supply Tier-1 modules to the U.S. market and has plans to build a solar module manufacturing plant in the U.S. with an expected 1.2 GW annual capacity.
Philadelphia Solar currently operates a 580 MW solar module and mounting structure factory in Amman. The company reports that its facility uses state-of-the-art automated robotic production lines to produce high-efficiency PERC solar cells with positive tolerance power output.
The joint venture, Trading Philadelphia Solar, plans to establish the U.S. manufacturing arm of Philadelphia Solar modules by the end of this year, with full U.S. production by 2024. The company intends to first produce 400- and 530-Watt mono-PERC solar modules for residential and utility-scale markets, with plans to move into heterojunction technology in 2025. The location of the manufacturing facility will be announced in December.

“As the solar market continues to expand, we are delighted to partner with Translucent Energy to undertake this transformative step for our business, first by growing our exports to the USA, and secondly through our planned 1.2 GW panel factory in America,” said Mohammad Shehadeh, CCO of Philadelphia Solar.
The CEO of Translucent Energy, Nour Mousa, is a founder of Desert Technologies, a solar module manufacturer in Saudi Arabia. In addition to this joint-venture, Translucent Energy also makes a containerized solar and storage system, called Tau, for microgrids and off-grid situations. The plan is to establish U.S. manufacturing for the Tau system as well.
“With global supply chains facing unprecedented disruption, many U.S.-based solar developers are struggling to find a reliable and cost-effective source for their solar panels. The exceptional response we are seeing from developers demonstrates that our joint venture addresses a key market need,” said Mousa.
While Philadelphia Solar is currently getting cells and wafers from Thailand, the partners plan to manufacture ingots, wafers, and solar module in the U.S.
In addition to its manufacturing expertise, Philadelphia Solar develops, designs, constructs, owns, and operates utility-scale commercial and industrial photovoltaic plants in the Middle East. The 23 MW Al Badiya solar-plus-storage system in Jordan is one of its largest projects.

The installation will make the building net zero.
The Red Cross New Jersey region will reduce its own electricity needs, while also helping New Jersey reach its decarbonization goal of procuring 50% of its energy from renewable generation by 2030.
The solar array will provide on-site power for use by the nonprofit, while a future solar facility will utilize a community solar project located at an off-site location that will provide local subscription access to residents of the township.
The Red Cross’ first rooftop system will produce roughly 2.7 GWh of electricity over the next 20 years, the equivalent of powering 19 homes.
“The savings generated by building this solar system atop our roof will allow us to commit even more resources to providing quality support to communities and families in need,” said Rosie Taravella, regional chief executive officer of American Red Cross New Jersey Region. “As a humanitarian organization that serves families and communities impacted by climate disasters, our goal is to minimize our own environmental footprint.”
Ecogy will sell the power produced by the system back to the Red Cross through a power purchase agreement. In exchange, Ecogy will retain the Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SREC) generated for each MW of solar energy produced.
Formed in 2010, Ecogy develops distributed generation and community solar projects for small businesses, non-profits, municipal entities and places of worship in about 11 Eastern states, the District of Columbia and Caribbean market.
In April 2021, the American Red Cross made a climate pledge to lower its carbon emissions and invest in renewable energy systems across its operations network and assist in the production of clean energy assets in communities affected by climate change.
