Harvested rainwater can be used for irrigation. The product is designed for flat roofs or ground-mounted systems. 
The compact system requires only eleven inches between rows of panels, significantly cutting down the amount of space that is normally required for erosion control by planting vegetation. The company said the solution requires half the land to produce the same amount of energy as conventional racking systems.
The product is currently under development and was launched by a Small Business Innovation Grant from the US Department of Energy Solar Technologies Office.
Don Scipione, president of Roll-A-Rack will introduce the innovation in a presentation, “Stormwater Management for Solar Arrays” at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources 2022 Ohio Statewide Floodplain Management Conference, Aug. 24 to 25, in Columbus, Ohio.
The rain harvesting feature of the rack adds on to Roll-A-Rack’s innovative design, which is centered around its roll-forming installation machine that performs similarly to gutter installation devices. The design has direct implications for membrane flat roofs, which are generally unable to house solar arrays due to the need for making penetrations that compromise the roof’s structure.
To avoid damaging the structural integrity of a membrane roof, the company installs a 12-inch metal channel rack that is distributed across existing roof ballast while securing the solar panels. The rack can be as thin as 22-gauge, and roll-formed. Roll-A-Rack said it supports 50 psf snow loads and 37.5 psf wind uplift. The company said automated install is feasible for its product.
Roll-A-Rack said its solution reduces racking and installation costs of traditional systems by 30%. It said the material costs are 50% less than conventional racking systems, and that installation time and labor costs are reduced by 65%. 
The company is currently taking applications for beta testers of the product, with applications ending this month. The first 100 kW of racking will be provided for free, and operations staff will be trained at no cost. The test site would become a case study for the company, and the facility may be used for marketing purposes.

Similarly to Delaware, Maryland generates less than 5% of its electricity from solar resources, however this has more to do with the state’s higher population than it does a lack of commitment to solar, at least historically. Maryland, thus far, has installed roughly 1.5 GW of solar, good for 18th in the country, according to data from Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). 
Maryland’s strong start to its solar commitment has slowed down considerably since its peak in 2016, and the state is only expected to install just over 1 GW of solar in the next five years, which currently projects to be 31st in the nation over that time, according to SEIA.
In April, the Maryland Legislature passed the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022, which speeds up Maryland’s current goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 40% of 2006 levels to 60% by 2031, and it establishes 2045 as the state’s goal for becoming carbon neutral. While Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has said he won’t veto the bill, he won’t sign it either, choosing instead to let it pass on its own.
The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) called the Act “one of the nation’s most robust climate and clean energy policies”, and said it’s legislation that other states can model as it “meets the moment and puts us on track for a sustainable, equitable future.”
The majority of solar capacity installed in Maryland has come through residential projects, so let’s take a look at some of the policies driving residential solar adoption in the Old Line State.
Residential solar
In addition to the federal investment tax credit of 26% for the cost of equipment installed, homeowners in Maryland who choose to go solar are able to sell their excess generation back to the grid at the full retail electricity rate, as part of the state’s strong net metering policy.
Net metering is available to all customers throughout the state until the aggregate capacity of all net-metered systems reaches 3 GW, up from the old peak of 1.5 GW. Net metered system size is set at 2 MW cap, though customers that use electrical service for agriculture may aggregate all of their meters to be served by a single project.
Residential solar systems in Maryland are fully exempt from both state and local county property taxes. Maryland also offers a statewide Residential Clean Energy Grant Program, which provides grants to homeowners who install a number of renewable generation technologies, including solar systems. Administered by the Maryland Energy Administration, homeowners who install a residential solar system of at least 1 kW in capacity are eligible for a rebate of up to $1,000.
C&I initiatives
Like residential customers, commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Maryland also have access to the state’s strong net metering policy, so long as their installations remain under 2 MW and do not generate more than 200% of the property’s electrical needs.
C&I customers also have access to grants for installing solar systems over parking lots with EV chargers. Such customers must install a minimum of 75 kW of solar canopies over the parking lot with a minimum of four Level II or Level III EV chargers. The program offers grants up to $600 per kW of PV installed, with a maximum cap of $300,000 per project and a total budget, as of Fiscal Year 2021, of $1.6 million.
Community solar
In 2021, regulators in Maryland unanimously voted to expand the capacity of the state’s community solar program as well as improve access for low- and moderate-income (LMI) customer participation in the state’s Community Solar Pilot Program.
According to the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the expansion of the program will allow community solar to power the equivalent of an additional 6,840 Maryland homes annually. The expansion also changed development regulations, allowing community solar projects to be built on clean-fill construction sites, transforming previously unusable industrial locations into clean solar energy generation sites.
Building on that commitment to community solar, in 2022, the Maryland legislature passed a pair of bills targeted at increasing the amount of eligible projects, and increasing the incentive for such projects to be developed.
The first of the two is HB 1039, which exempts community solar projects from both county and municipal corporate property taxes, so long as the 50% of the electricity generated by the projects go to serve low- to moderate-income individuals and families at a rate which is at least 20% lower than the base electricity rate that these customers would be paying otherwise.
As it stands, 30% of the pilot program capacity is still set aside for low-to-moderate income customers wishing to participate and another 30% is set aside for project development on brownfield sites.
The bill also establishes additional tax incentives for the development of agrivoltaic community solar projects on rooftops, brownfields, landfills, and clean fills.
The other bill, HB 440, will expand the maximum capacity of a permitted community solar project from 2 MW to 5 MW, while also reducing the land requirements for siting projects. This provision pertains to projects developed on multiple, contiguous lots, rather than opening up new types of land zones for development.
Last time, the pv magazine tour of the 50 states of solar took us to neighboring Delaware, and next we will continue to travel through the DMV, stopping off in Virginia.

Power will be supplied from Brightnight’s Box Canyon Solar project located in Pinal County, Arizona, with the operational assets held jointly with Cordelio Power. The project recently cleared the permitting stage and is expected to become operational by 2025.
The project is expected to meet roughly 33% of SPPA’s peak capacity needs and 19% to 21% of SPPA’s total energy needs. It is expected to create more than 200 construction jobs and five permanent operations and maintenance jobs.
Box Canyon Solar is also expected to contribute more than $65 million to the K-12 educational trust through lease payments to the State of Arizona. BrighNight said the project garnered broad public support across the county following a community engagement campaign during the development process.
BrightNight CEO Martin Hermann said being selected for the partnership with SPPA was “emblematic of (our) customer-centric approach.” The company has an over 20 GW development portfolio across the United States and focus on creating renewable energy projects that create high-value jobs and generate power without added burden on local transportation and water infrastructure. The developer operates in both the United States and the Asia Pacific region.
BrightNight focuses on a hybrid model of clean energy, bringing together solar and battery energy storage and designing projects to be dispatchable, stable sources of power for the grid. The company said it has a long-term model of designing projects that suit the needs of a changing grid characterized by fossil fuel retirements, state portfolio requirements, increased electricity demand, and changing customer demand profiles.
The Box Canyon project represents the largest renewable energy investment by SPPA, a joint action agency that connects 21 constituencies, largely small utility companies. The organization served approximately 79,000 customers when it formed in 2014, spanning 41,732 square miles of rural Arizona.
“BrightNight was able to understand our long-term goals and propose a solution to meet the needs of our members and their customers, while remaining cost-effective,” said Dennis Delaney, SPPA project manager.

The Pure Signal technology works with its own rapid shutdown transmitters.
The DC power optimizer specialist said it specifically designed the new product for large, complex systems in the commercial and industrial solar segments.
“Designed to enhance powerline communication (PLC) signal quality, Pure Signal technology reduces the impact of electromagnetic interference in large-scale solar systems,” the manufacturer said. “Built on patented advanced rapid shutdown technology, Tigo RSS Transmitters with Pure Signal technology pair with an industry-leading list of third-party solar inverters, deliver a new level of design and installation flexibility for solar installers and EPCs, and enable significant reductions in balance of system (BOS) and labor costs.”
The device has a transmitter input voltage of 12 V and a transmitter input current of 1 A, with average and maximum power consumption of 0.85 and 5.5 W, respectively. It measures 38 mm x 41.3 mm x 90.9 mm and features an IP68 enclosure.
Tigo Energy said the device eliminates the risk of disturbances in programmable logic controller (PLC) signals, as so-called “crosstalk” can reduce the effectiveness of system communications in large-scale systems. The new product was certified by US-based Underwriters Laboratories and is compatible with hundreds of inverter models.
“The new generation of RSS Transmitters with Pure Signal technology are compatible with the company’s TS4-A-F and TS4-A-2F rapid shutdown product family and can be easily integrated into new projects or retrofitted into existing installations,” said Tigo Energy.

Carbon dioxide emissions have been cut by about 8.2 million pounds per year, said Tom Woodrow, Pittsburgh Airport’s senior vice president of engineering and infrastructure intelligence. And it is estimated that the airport saved $1 million in energy costs.
The 20 MW microgrid powers the entire airport and hotel, but it remains connected to the grid as an option for emergency or backup power if needed.
“We’ve lowered our energy costs, we’ve lowered our carbon output and we have guaranteed ourselves resiliency and redundancy. That’s really important to an airport,” said Christina Cassotis, airport CEO.
Due to the cost savings, the airport is considering doubling the number of solar panels from over 9,000 to over 18,000.
In addition to potentially doubling the size of the microgrid, the airport has a goal of achieving LEED Silver Certification with its terminal modernization program. It is also working on alternative fuel strategies, repopulating the honeybee population, and repurposing materials removed from the existing terminal.
“We are looking at using any and all materials in our new terminal that come out of, for example, ripping up the ramp and crushing the concrete—that will be the base layer of our roadway system,” said Cassotis.
The microgrid was recognized with the Innovation Award from Airports Council International and Fast Company Magazine’s World Changing Idea award.

Scientists from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed a sodium-ion battery (NIB) that can purportedly overcome the main challenge with such storage systems – the ability to hold a charge after repeated cycles of charging and discharging.
The researchers said this issue is strictly correlated to the instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is generated on the anode of lithium-ion batteries during the first few charging cycles, in order to prevent electrolyte decomposition and maintain cycling ability. The SEI layer should be well adhered to the electrode material, exhibit good electronic insulation properties, and be able to conduct lithium ions.
“The instability of SEI layers is a critical barrier for the long cycling performance of NIBs,” the US group said. “Electrolytes usually decompose at a low voltage to form the SEI on the anode surface. Ideally, the SEI should be electronically insulating but ionically conducting for ion transport, insoluble and inert with respect to the electrolyte to prevent continuous side reactions between the anode and electrolyte.”
In order to avoid SEI dissolution, the academics replaced the high-polarity carbonate solvent in conventional electrolytes with a new liquid solution with low polarity. It consisted of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) salt in a solvent mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and tris (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFP). This low-solvation electrolyte (NaFSI/DMC:TFP) was designed to operate in 4.2 V high-voltage sodium-ion batteries.
“The current electrolyte recipe for sodium-ion batteries results in the protective film on the negative end (the anode) dissolving over time. This film is critical because it allows sodium ions to pass through while preserving battery life,” the researchers said, noting that electrolyte also creates an ultra-thin protective layer on the cathode, which ensures additional system stability. “Our electrolyte lowers the solvation ability for SEI components and facilitates the formation of insoluble SEI components, which minimizes the SEI dissolution.”
he battery was able to retain 90% of its capacity after 300 cycles, with minimized SEI dissolution.
“Sodium-based batteries would be more environmentally friendly and less expensive once the technology is established,” researcher Jason Zhang told pv magazine. “The sodium-ion battery developed in this work is suitable for solar energy storage because it has advantages of long cycle life, low cost and materials abundance over lithium-ion batteries; it also has the feasibility for large-scale production using the existing infrastructure of  lithium-ion batteries.”
“We also measured the production of gas vapor at the cathode,” said researcher Phung Le. “We found very minimal gas production. This provides new insights to develop stable electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries that may operate at elevated temperatures.”
The US group described the battery in “Low-solvation electrolytes for high-voltage sodium-ion batteries,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. “Our findings provide a promising recipe for a battery that may one day power electric vehicles and store energy from the sun.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/19/gaf-energy-to-open-solar-shingle-manufacturing-facility-in-texas/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 19, 2022",GAF Energy to open solar shingle manufacturing facility in Texas,"Until the company’s 2021 renovation of a 112,000-squre-foot factory in San Jose, California, GAF Energy’s building integrated solar products were manufactured in South Korea. The reason for the move to the United States was to benefit from reduced risks associated with offshore production, including tariffs and rising transportation costs.
Shortly after the move, the company introduced Timberline Solar, a nailable solar shingle. These shingles are been assembled in that same San Jose factory, which has a capacity of 50 MW, annually. To meet what GAF Energy calls “tremendous demand,” the company announced that it is building a second factory—this time in Georgetown, Texas, which is about 30 miles north of Austin.
The new facility will increase manufacturing capacity by 500% and bring total production of the company’s solar shingle to 300 MW annually.
“The response from both consumers and roofers to our Timberline Solar roof has been tremendous and we’re thrilled to be expanding capacity to meet that growing demand,” said Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy. “We launched Timberline Solar because we believed that more consumers would choose solar if they had a more reliable, durable, and attractive option. The market has confirmed our belief—now we’re turning that belief into reality and building the future of clean energy here in the US.”
The Timberland Solar shingle was launched earlier this year and received three awards at the January  Consumer Electronics Show including its highest honor, the Best of Innovation award, for ‘Smart Cities.’ What sets the Timberland shingle apart from other solar shingles is that the roof system directly integrates solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials.
The 450,000 square foot manufacturing facility that GAF Energy is constructing in Georgetown will result in more than 260 new US-based, clean energy manufacturing jobs operating in shifts 24/7. And this is a city known for clean energy as in 2015, the municipal-owned utility, Georgetown Utility Systems, announced that it would buy 100% of its power from wind and solar farms by 2017.
“Georgetown has a long track record as a clean energy leader, so it is the perfect home for us to build the future of solar,” said DeBono.
Leaders in Georgetown have welcomed GAF Energy and its vision of “energy from every roof”. “We are pleased GAF Energy selected Georgetown as their destination for their facility,” Georgetown Mayor Josh Schroeder said. “Their innovative product is one that will change the market as we know it, and we are excited that it will be developed here in our backyard.”

The program is much the same as the proposal released in the winter, focused on increasing solar adoption across the board, while also improving access to solar for low- and middle-income (LMI) residents.
The net metering rate, at its base, remains below full retail electricity rates, at 2.5 cents/kWh over the deemed ‘avoided cost’ of solar. In this sense, avoided cost refers to the difference between the cost of solar generated by a rooftop and the cost of the utility procuring that energy from a different generation facility.
The PSC also confirmed the 2 cents/kWh adder for customers who are at or below 250% of the federal poverty line for any solar they choose to export, and this adder comes with no customer nor capacity limit. Both the avoided cost adder and the low-income adder will be legacy programs, available to any customer who signs up for 25-years from their sign up date.
Depending on a customer’s rate structure and the adders they qualify for, their exported electricity rate could end up higher than the retail electricity rate, and specific customer rates will vary.
The new net metering rules also include a requirement that each of the state’s investor-owned utilities offer a one-time $3,500 upfront cash rebate to any retail residential customer purchasing a renewable distributed energy project with a minimum size of between 3 kW and a maximum of 110% of the customer’s expected annual usage, that is used, at least in part, for self-supply.
Both of the adders, as well as the rebate, were created to “meaningfully enhance both access to and the adoption of distributed generation by the currently underrepresented low-income segment of customers.”
Low- and middle-income customers are typically dissuaded from installing solar due to the high upfront costs, rather than by low export rates that increase payback times, hence the inclusion of the upfront rebate.
The PSC also added to the program meter aggregation provisions, meaning that customers with multiple meters can use energy generated by one solar or other form of distributed generation (DG) system on any eligible meter of theirs. Eligible meters must be located on the same premises or within the service area of the customers’ current electric provider.
The number of customers that may participate in net generation has also been raised, with the previous hard 3% participation cap moving up to a 4% non-hard cap. Non-hard, in this context, requires utilities to seek regulatory approval to refuse additional DG customers if and when participation reaches 4% of the utility’s total system peak demand, which the commission may deny.
The new rules will be in place for at least five years from the start date of the order, unless total net distributed generation capacity reaches 4% of the utilities’ system peak demand, at which point regulators may choose to reopen the rulemaking for new changes.
Edit 7/19/2022: This article was amended to update the upfront rebate amount and to clarify rebate rate structures and maximum eligible project size. We apologize for the error.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/19/states-that-enable-distributed-storage-will-make-room-for-more-rooftop-solar/,"ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JULY 19, 2022",States that enable distributed storage will make room for more rooftop solar,"Energy storage can control when rooftop solar exports energy to the grid, and that “export control” enables the grid to host more rooftop solar—in some cases doubling a distribution circuit’s hosting capacity.
So says a toolkit designed to help states remove barriers to interconnecting distributed storage.
Yet in half of the states, connecting distributed storage to the grid is especially challenging as the interconnection procedures do not mention energy storage, said Sky Stanfield, a partner in the law firm Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger, in a webinar.
The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) presented the webinar, and led development of the toolkit. IREC is supporting states as they upgrade their interconnection procedures for distributed storage and solar-plus-storage.
Interconnection is becoming a “critical bottleneck,” said Stanfield, as the interconnection process “becomes slower and more difficult to navigate when there are many more projects in the queue at the same time.” In addition, the interconnection process was not designed “with the current realities in mind,” she said. “It’s sort of like we’re using dial-up internet to stream Netflix.”
States “at the very least” can start with ensuring that storage is included in their interconnection procedures, said Mari Hernandez, assistant director of IREC’s regulatory program, and “consider adopting language that would enable export-controlled systems.”
Interconnection is slow because the current interconnection process of reviewing one project at a time “can’t keep pace” with distributed energy resource market growth, especially for large projects, said Brian Lydic, IREC’s chief regulatory engineer. And an “efficient, faster process” is needed for the thousands of smaller projects that apply, he said. Existing fast track processes use “simplistic and conservative” screens, he said, that “can leave a lot of capacity on the table.”
IREC is active in public utility commission proceedings, said Lydic, and “where best practices exist and have been vetted elsewhere, it’s fairly easy” for a commission to take up such practices. Yet with continuing technical evolution of distributed resources, and as deployment accelerates, “we’re seeing issues that don’t yet have established best practices.”
Interconnection applications could be streamlined through standardized export controls, “such as the use of certified power control systems—PCS—or utility grid relays,” said Midhat Mafazy, regulatory program engineer at IREC. He added that IREC is developing a “decision option matrix” for regulatory decisions needed to adopt the IEEE 1547-2018 standard for smart inverters, and said that products meeting the standard are expected to be available in 2023.
Several categories of interconnection solutions will be discussed in depth in future trainings, said Radina Valova, vice president of IREC’s regulatory program: streamlined screening and study processes; fairer cost allocations; speeding the interconnection process—possibly through a group or cluster study process; incorporating the latest technical standards; increasing hosting capacity; and getting to a “more future-looking model of holistic planning” that proactively incorporates distributed resources, as electrification of transportation and heating proceeds.
IREC’s trainings will cover the same topics as the 211-page toolkit, released in March, which offers model language that states may use or adapt, to update their interconnection procedures. The toolkit was developed by a team including the utility-led Electric Power Research Institute, the California Solar & Storage Association, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and other partners. It is intended to serve as a resource for regulators, utilities, storage developers and other stakeholders engaged in the interconnection process, said Valova.
The US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office has funded development of the toolkit and the training series.

The suite is separated into two software solutions: Lead Capture AI and Aurora AI for Design and Sales Teams.
According to Aurora, Lead Capture AI allows companies to present AI-generated 3D solar estimates for homeowners with an address and utility bill estimate. By instantaneously showing how the system will look on a homeowner’s roof and the estimated bill savings it will present, it cuts down on the number of visits companies will have to make to a prospective customer’s house, and saves on excessive billing paperwork and savings estimations.
The other offering, Aurora AI for Design and Sales Teams develops rapid 3D project models, which the company claims are highly accurate. This allows sales professionals to more quickly create quotes and scales the capabilities of design teams by decreasing the overall workload of each individual design.
“While the demand for solar grows, solutions haven’t kept pace; most solar software products offer a choice between speed or accuracy. At the same time, solar buyers want a dynamic, fast, and personalized experience,” said Chris Hopper, CEO and co-founder of Aurora Solar.
These solutions will supplement the Sell Suite software that Aurora launched in Feb. 2022. Sell Suite includes tools to smooth the sales process and finalize projects, including a guided workflow that enables the sales rep to deliver an accurate proposal with all the project details including an interactive 3D design and financing options and an automated contract function.
In 2021, Aurora acquired Folsom Labs, the developer of the HelioScope software for the commercial solar sector, as part of Aurora’s mission to provide tools for residential to large-scale commercial solar companies, and for all teams within an organization.
