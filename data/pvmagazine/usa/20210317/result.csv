The goals were outlined by the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA), which is pitting itself against the state’s three investor-owned utilities over what it said is the future of California’s rooftop solar market.
CALSSA said the “battle” will take place at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in a regulatory decision later this year that will “make or break California’s continued leadership” in consumer solar at homes, apartments, schools, and farms. Proposals for changes to the state’s net energy metering (NEM) program were submitted to regulators on March 15.
“California is a solar state, but the utilities want to own the sun and keep it out of the hands of everyday people,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, CALSSA executive director.
CALSSA sought to paint a picture of a small-business-dominated solar industry that serves middle- and working-class people.

CALSSA also sought to paint a picture of a small-business-dominated solar industry that serves middle- and working-class people “from Clovis to Chula Vista” as opposed to the big utilities that the group said posted $20 billion in profits since 2012.
The group directed particular scorn at long-haul transmission lines that it said “carry electrons from power plants located hundreds of miles away” from load centers. Rooftop solar, Del Chiaro said, “helps cut down on the need to build these expensive transmission lines.”
Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison delivered a plan of their own to state regulators. It would address what the trio said is “an unfair and growing inequity” stemming from earlier versions of the NEM program. They said that electricity customers without solar systems pay about $3 billion more annually to “subsidize” existing rooftop solar customers.
The utilities claimed the alleged subsidy represents the costs of the electric grid that solar customers use, “but for which they do not pay.”
The utilities said that while they would not ask regulators to end the cost shift, their proposal, if adopted, “would ensure that this burden does not increase” as customers adopt new rooftop solar.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/17/developer-plans-175-mw-solar-project-on-former-coal-mine/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,MARYLAND",JOE BEBON,"MARCH 17, 2021",Developer plans 175 MW solar project on former coal mine,"Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) said it plans to build and operate a 175 MW solar farm on a former coal mine in Maryland.
Located in the Old Line State’s westernmost county, the Vindex/Arch Coal mining site closed recently after decades of operation. CPV said the proposed Backbone Solar Farm project would be on about 1,100 acres and produce enough solar energy to power around 30,000 average Maryland homes.
CPV has been conducting environmental, geotechnical, electrical, and engineering studies on the property since early 2020. The developer said it plans to file an application with state utility regulators for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build the project.
If approved, the project is expected to break ground in early 2022 and go online in mid-2023.
In mid-March, local county officials approved a resolution supporting the project. Other elected officials and local groups have also backed the plans.
CPV said the project would help Maryland meet its clean energy targets of 14.5% solar energy by 2028 and 50% renewable energy by 2030. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the state currently gets about 4.23% of its electricity from solar and has almost 1.3 GW of installed capacity.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/03/17/report-outlines-rooftop-solar-and-storage-for-75-of-puerto-ricos-power-and-at-a-lower-cost/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,PUERTO RICO",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 17, 2021","Report outlines rooftop solar and storage for 75% of Puerto Rico’s power, and at a lower cost","Adding solar and storage to every home in Puerto Rico, plus solar on commercial sites, could provide 75% of the territory’s electricity by 2035. And the cost of doing so could be lower than a base case that simply projects today’s grid and generation mix ahead to 2035, said a report from nonprofit groups Cambio and IEEFA (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis).
Rooftop solar on houses could reach 2.7 GW, paired with 2.5 GW of storage, with a comparable amount of solar on commercial sites. “Minimal upgrades” to the distribution system would be required, the report said.
The investments would be supported with $9.6 billion of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grid reconstruction funds. Money was allocated in response to grid damage caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 and is expected to be dispersed soon.
The 75% solar plan would shift the direction of Puerto Rico’s grid. A 10-Year Infrastructure Plan prepared by utility PREPA calls for spending the FEMA funds to harden PREPA’s centralized transmission and distribution systems. And money also would be used  to build new natural gas infrastructure. But no money would be directed toward renewable energy and storage, the Cambio/IEEFA report said.
The proposed 75% solar scenario shows that no need exists for new fossil fuel generation, or for converting existing units to natural gas, the report said. The scenario also would enhance resilience in future hurricanes, reduce fossil fuel costs, and require no transmission investment. If supported with federal funds, the rooftop solar scenario would yield average electricity costs of 15 cents per kWh, versus 21 cents per kWh now. Scenarios also were modeled for 25% and 50% solar generation by 2035.
The 75% scenario would exceed the standards of Puerto Rico’s Act 17-2019, which requires PREPA to obtain 20% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
The Cambio/IEEFA report is based on utility modeling analyses conducted by power systems analysis firm Telos Energy and utility data analysis firm EE Plus. The two firms used PREPA grid data that Cambio and IEEFA obtained through a public records request.
Telos modeled Puerto Rico’s grid using the production cost model PLEXOS, and also modeled transmission system power flow. EE Plus modeled distribution system power flows. In the report, Telos suggested achieving a reliable high-solar grid by introducing fast-frequency response synchronous condensers and grid-forming inverters, and conducting further study of grid reliability options.
Clean energy consulting firm Energy Futures Group used the grid modeling results to estimate costs. Solar and storage were modeled as being financed by PREPA at a 6.5% cost of capital, and a carbon price was assumed. Without a carbon price, and assuming no capital costs for new generation in the base case, the 75% solar scenario was slightly less expensive than the base case.
Energy Futures also analyzed energy efficiency measures that could cut consumption 25% by 2035. That efficiency target was proposed by Queremos Sol, a Puerto Rico coalition of community, environmental, and labor groups.
PREPA’s capacity expansion model “was not capable of simulating distribution system investments,” the report says, and PREPA instead assumed 13% of generation from rooftop solar by 2035.

For all of 2020, Apple funded 17 projects globally with a combined generating capacity of 1.2 GW.
In Reno, Nevada, Apple added 50 MW of solar capacity to serve one of its data centers. The project joins three other Apple-backed projects in the state with a combined 270 MW of capacity.
In Virginia, Apple worked with Etsy, Akamai, and SwissRE to support the development of 165 MW of solar PV capacity for delivery to the region’s grid.
The company also used a virtual power purchase agreement for 112 MW from an Illinois wind farm to cover its electricity use in the Chicago area. The project aggregated buyers, enabling other companies with less purchasing power to access the renewable energy.
And in Denmark, Apple completed work on two onshore wind turbines that are expected to generate 62 GWh each year. The power will support an Apple data center with any surplus energy going into the Danish grid.
The company issued its first $1.5 billion Green Bond in 2016. It added a second round of $1 billion in 2017. In November 2019, Apple issued its third set of Green Bonds and its first in Europe, with two bonds each at 1 billion euros (around $2.2 billion).
Apple said it has allocated more than half of its Green Bond spend — around $2.8 billion — and will continue to invest in projects that address carbon emissions. Last July, the company said it planned become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030.
GE Renewable Energy was tapped by Convergent Energy + Power to provide an integrated solar inverter and energy storage package that will use a DC-coupled system for a 123 MWh hybrid solar-plus-storage project across three sites in Upstate New York.
Construction has begun and is expected to reach commercial operation this summer. GE will also provide a 20-year service agreement.
The system will use a direct DC-coupled configuration, with a single inverter and single point of interconnection shared by the solar array and the storage system. The design is expected to help improve the system’s overall energy output while optimizing equipment and installation costs, and increasing the overall system reliability.
Restructuring the way perovskite solar cells are designed can boost their efficiency and increase their deployment in buildings and more, according to researchers with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells are made of layers of materials sandwiched together, with the top and bottom layers key to converting sunlight to electricity. The new cell architecture increases the area exposed to the sun by putting the metal contact layers side-by-side on the back of the cell.

Taking the materials on top away results in a higher theoretical efficiency because the perovskite is absorbing more of the sun,the researchers said.
Removing metal layers from the front surface also enables solar panels to be better integrated into building facades. The design improves aesthetics of the cell and enables manufacturing on a number of substrates that span glass to sheet metals.
Perovskites—which refers to a crystalline structure—as a solar cell have shown a steady climb in efficiency. The current record for a perovskite solar cell is 25.2%, accomplished with the traditional architecture.
Using the different cell architecture, the scientists were able to create a solar cell with an efficiency of about 10%. However, the architecture has a higher theoretical efficiency than the cells holding the current record for performance. Further refinements could enable a cell with an efficiency of 27%-28%.
The paper appears in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science and includes researchers from NREL and Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
