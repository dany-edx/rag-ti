https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/29/bluetti-launches-sodium-ion-solar-generator/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"DECEMBER 29, 2021",BLUETTI launches Sodium-ion solar generator,"BLUETTI, a Las Vegas-based manufacturer of solar energy facilities, solar generators, photovoltaic panels, and other solar peripherals, announced that it has launched a sodium-ion solar generator, dubbed NA300, and its compatible battery module, B480.
According to the company, BLUETTI’s first-generation sodium-ion battery excels in thermal stability, fast-charging capacity, low-temperature performance, and integration efficiency, despite slightly lower energy density than its lithium-ion counterparts. The solar generator and battery’s chemical components are also comprised of far more abundant materials than traditional lithium-ion batteries, lowering price and alleviating concerns of scarcity.
The sodium-ion power station comes with four 20-amp traditional wall plugs, as well as a 30-amp L14-30 output port, driven by the system’s built-in 3000W pure sine wave inverter.
Thermal stability has become a hallmark issue of lithium-ion batteries, ever since the Arizona Public Service (APS) battery failure and corresponding explosion that left eight firefighters and one police officer hospitalized in Surprise, Arizona in April of 2019.
According to BLUETTI, the system can charge to 80% state-of-charge (SOC) in less than 30 minutes at room temperature. In a low-temperature environment of -20°C (-4℉), it has an over 85% capacity retention rate and over 80% system integration efficiency.
BloombergNEF recently updated its technology outlook to include sodium-ion batteries, ,which the publication said could play a “meaningful role” in the greater storage landscape by 2030.
Bluetti plans to officially debut the NA300 & B480 Sodium-ion Battery Power station at CES 2022 on January 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/29/bromley-mountain-ski-resort-completes-solar-installation/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,VERMONT",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 29, 2021",Bromley Mountain ski resort completes solar installation,"A solar installation was recently completed at Vermont’s Sun Mountain, home of Bromley Mountain Resort. Dubbed Sun Mountain because it is one of Vermont’s only southern facing ski areas, the owners of Bromley see this as one more step in their sustainability plan.
The solar project was jointly developed by Burlington, Vermont-based Encore Renewable Energy and Tangent Energy Solutions and is located across the street from the ski area on land owned by the ski resort. The 615 kWdc solar project will generate enough electricity to power an estimated 70 households and offset the emissions of 120 passenger vehicles annually. What is not used by the year ‘round resort will go back into the grid to be used by the town of Peru and the surrounding areas.
“As a lifelong skier and winter sports enthusiast, I have seen firsthand how climate change is impacting winter here in Vermont. It’s inspiring to see and support Bromley’s leadership on implementing energy-saving and carbon-reducing measures,” said Chad Farrell, Founder and CEO of Encore Renewable Energy
Sunwealth , one of Encore’s strategic partners, financed the project and will own and operate it for the life of the system. This project is the 6th collaborative effort between the two companies, which has resulted in over $5MM of economic activity in Vermont.
“Our new solar array is allowing the Sun Mountain to generate clean, affordable and locally sourced energy from the sun and one more thing to celebrate this holiday season,” added Bill Cairns, President/GM of Bromley Mountain Resort.
For twenty years Bromley Mountain has shown a strong commitment to energy conservation through green initiatives, beginning with energy efficient snow making guns, launch of a unique “snowmaking index”, purchase of hybrid snow cat and Piston Bully. The base lodge lighting was switched to all-LED, insulation added and a new heat pump helps reduce the amount of oil used for heat. In 2017 Bromley Mountain won an Energy Leadership Award from Efficiency Vermont.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/29/stepping-up-in-2021-3-sustainable-electricity-and-corporates-critical-solar-role/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",BECKY BEETZ,"DECEMBER 29, 2021",Stepping UP in 2021: #3 Sustainable electricity and corporates’ critical solar role,"The market for corporate clean energy purchases – primarily solar and wind – skyrocketed to a record 23.7 GW in 2020, according to BloombergNEF (BNEF). Development over the past year has been particularly impressive, given the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing recessions. This underlines the increased appetite for sustainability in the business, consumer, and political realms with the falling costs of renewable electricity.
According to Kyle Harrison, BNEF senior associate, this upward trajectory continues in 2021. “Through April, companies have announced 7.2 GW of clean energy PPAs, ahead of the 4.2 GW signed in 2020,” he told pv magazine.
Corporates’ critical solar role: Since 2008, Apple, Google, Amazon, and others have led the charge in corporate procurement of renewables. Their action has meant the US has been the world’s largest market since 2008, with 11.9 GW of corporate power purchase agreements announced in 2020. However, other markets are beginning to pick up the pace.
RE100 and the corporate renewable electricity boom: In 2020, corporate renewables purchases hit a record 23.7 GW. Much of this growth has been led by a non-profit global initiative, RE100, which is headed by the Climate Group and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Launched in 2014, 316 companies from more than 175 markets have now committed to buying 100% renewable electricity. As part of the UP Initiative, pv magazine spoke to Mariana Daykova, senior manager of renewable energy at CDP and its interim RE100 lead, about the progress that has been made and what’s in the cards going forward.
BNEF’s bullish outlook for corporate clean energy procurement: Corporate clean energy procurement continues to set new watermarks. In 2020, companies announced a record 25 GW of clean energy PPAs throughout the world, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at BloombergNEF, addresses key questions about the long-term outlook for corporate procurement.
Achieving game changing growth: Corporate purchases of green electricity are at an all-time high. Pressure from companies, new entrants, and favorable legislative changes have combined to push the market further. Consequently, the business model landscape is evolving. As part of the UP Initiative quarterly theme on sustainable electricity supply, pv magazine has compiled a brief overview of the main models available (see table) and provided a more in-depth look into two of the most prominent: energy certificates and power purchase agreements.
The global expansion of clean energy access: Once a U.S.-centric phenomenon, corporations are now able to purchase clean energy at cost-competitive rates and at a large scale in most markets around the world. Power markets are being amended to allow for power purchase agreements, while alternative mechanisms like certificates and retail programs are near-universal. Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at BloombergNEF, discusses the growth in corporate clean energy procurement globally.
Supporting the corporate renewable electricity market: Corporate clean electricity purchases are finally taking off in many European markets, thanks to a number of renewable energy law reforms. Spain and Italy, in particular, are seeing growing numbers of transactions. However, is enough being done to support the corporate market? Hannah Hunt, impact director at RE-Source – a European alliance of stakeholders representing clean energy buyers and suppliers – looks at the forces driving change and asks which policy and regulatory reforms are critical to unlocking European corporate sourcing potential.
Trends in sustainable debt: While sustainable debt issuance has historically been dominated by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and mostly driven by green bonds from the energy and financial sectors, it has diversified in recent years and is now a global market with a huge range of issuers, thanks to the variety of instruments that have been created since 2007. Maia Godemer, BloombergNEF (BNEF) research associate, discusses this growth and its implications.
Corporate acceleration: With solar declared the cheapest form of power in history, and wind prices following a similar trajectory, corporate energy users are buying renewable power and investing in new capacity at scale. But more companies need to step up. Governments around the world must remove policy barriers and open new markets to competition from renewables if we are to reach the scale of investment needed to achieve a 1.5-degree world, according to Sam Kimmins, the head of RE100.
Different shades of green: Most long-term power delivery contracts with renewable energy systems involve the delivery of electricity through the public grid via off-site power purchase agreements. This leads to a key question: “How do I as a customer know when and if I am really using renewable electricity, and how can I prove that?” Simon Göß and Michael Claußner from Energy Brainpool GmbH & Co. KG, a European market research firm focused on energy trading, address these questions. They note how the development of green hydrogen is an opportunity to create more flexible power markets by fostering the adoption of renewables.
24/7 heaven: It’s what Google calls its “biggest sustainability moonshot yet” – 24/7 hourly matching – a new granular phase of renewable energy sourcing. The pursuit of 24/7 moves beyond buying enough renewable energy to match annual consumption, to matching consumption every hour of every day. Some say 24/7 matching could push up the price of renewables, but others say 24/7 is the only way to drive home decarbonization, minimize greenwashing, and create a truly net-zero energy system.
In January 2022, pv magazine will publish a white paper on corporate purchases of clean electricity. Watch out for more on this in the coming weeks! In the meantime, check out the coverage from our UP Initiative Q1 theme: Agri-PV from Dec. 27 and Q2 theme: Workers’ rights . The Q4 theme: Urban solar, will publish on Dec. 30.
In Q1 2022, we will turn our attention to the rise of e-mobility and how it can complement the renewable energy transition. Specifically, we will examine the role electric vehicles, trains, and two- and three-wheelers can play in greening the electricity grid.
