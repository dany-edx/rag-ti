Based in Washington, D.C., Foundation Solar is comprised of a team of solar industry veterans that have developed, acquired and managed over 6 GW of generation assets over the past two decades. The team brought their expertise together in 2019, founding Foundation Solar.
Lazard advised Hull Street Energy on the sale, while Foley & Lardner LLP was counsel to the private equity firm. Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP was counsel to Birch Creek Energy.
Hull Street Energy is a private equity firm specializing in the power sector and energy transition investments. The company has expertise in North American electricity infrastructure, fundamentals and grid operations, including fuel inputs, commodity contract structuring, renewable and fossil powered generation assets, energy storage, transmission and distribution systems, and electricity demand-side businesses.
Based in St. Louis, Birch Creek Energy was formed in 2019 and focuses on the development, financing, and ownership of utility-scale solar and storage projects. The company has developed 872 MW of solar assets and has a pipeline exceeding 8 GW across the MISO, PJM, ERCOT and Southeast markets.
Renewables M&A
Throughout 2020 and 2021, merger and acquisition activity for renewables surged as valuations for platforms, which included project portfolios and corporate development teams that manage them, reached all-time highs. Now with increasing capital deployment rates, there is a shift from majority platform M&A activity to transactions in which investors could take a minority stake
There is a growing trend of international players acquiring experienced U.S. developers with strong project portfolios, and CohnReznick Capital Markets said it expects this trend to continue in 2023. International independent power producers and infrastructure funds see acquisition as an efficient tool to enter or expand their presence in the growing North American market. Corporate M&A activity that includes developer experience and a portfolio of projects offers scale and transaction efficiency that the acquisition of individual projects aren’t able to match.
FTI Consulting said in a whitepaper that notable 2022 M&A transactions included Brookfield Renewable Energy’s acquisitions of Scout Clean Energy ($1 billion) and Standard Solar ($540 million), Enbridge’s acquisition of Texas wind developer Tri-Global Energy for $270 million, and German energy producer RWE AG’s acquisition of Con Edison’s Clean Energy Businesses for $6.8 billion.
The consulting firm said that 2023 deal flow is expected to remain strong, but creative solutions and investor flexibility will be needed as the market navigates persistent supply chain challenges, long interconnection queues, and high inflation rates, all of which will apply downward pressure on asset sales.
“With patience, we anticipate strong M&A activity in traditional renewable assets, platforms and emerging technologies trending toward the second half of 2023 and into 2024 as greater clarity and increased value creation are established,” FTI Consulting said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/28/wartsila-battery-passes-ul-9540a-fire-certification-milestone/,"BATTERY,MANUFACTURING,FINLAND,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 28, 2023",Wärtsilä battery passes UL 9540A fire certification milestone,"Wärtsilä Energy, a Finnish energy storage technology company, announced that its grid-scale energy storage system, GridSolv Quantum, has completed UL 9540A unit-level testing for fire safety.
The rigorous testing for the grid-scale lithium-ion storage systems involved heating battery cells to induce thermal runaway within Wärtsilä’s storage module. Performing fire tests reveals critical information to the manufacturer, first responders and asset owners about how the battery system reacts in the unlikely event of a cell failure.
The GridSolv Quantum system passed all performance requirements for Outdoor Ground Mounted equipment per UL 9540A standards by proving that if cells go into thermal runaway, it would not spread to other modules or, in worst case, adjacent units.
The storage system also tested a Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of below 25%, with no risk of deflagration in an explosion scenario. GridSolv showed no explosion hazards and no flaming occurred beyond the outer dimensions of storage system. Based on these safety milestones, Wärtsilä can now install GridSolv units less than ten feet from building lines and public places, per U.S. fire codes and standards.
The company received safety compliance and guidance from Intertek, Fire & Risk Alliance, Energy Safety Response Group and Energy Security Agency for the GridSolv fire and explosion risk testing.
“This milestone underscores our commitment to safety for our partners, customers, local safety officials, and local community members. We will continue to work closely with local fire services and first responders to ensure all safety precautions are met as we integrate ESSs globally,” said Darrell Furlong, director of energy storage product management and hardware engineering, Wärtsilä.
“These were some of the most manageable and low-hazard tests we have experienced to date,” said Dalan Zartman, chief pperations officer, Energy Security Agency. “It’s crucial that emergency services are involved in the testing of this kind of technology, and we congratulate Wärtsilä on passing the significant milestone.”
GridSolv Quantum is a fully integrated and modular storage system that solves many fundamental safety challenges such as thermal management, fire suppression, short circuit handling and interconnection communication. It achieved UL 9540 certification in April 2022.
An energy storage system (ESS) certified to UL 9540 is primarily comprised of a UL 1973-certified stationary battery that is evaluated for use with a power conversion system, such as a UL 1741-certified inverter, together as a system, according to a UL press statement.
Energy storage system developers ESS and KORE Power Solutions have also received UL 9540A fire safety approval for their Energy Warehouse and VPort storage systems, respectively, over the last year.
Wärtsilä’s GridSolv Quantum systems are composed of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are less prone to fire risk, adding an extra layer of safety, the company says.  The GridSolv is rated at 1,490 kWh of nominal power capacity and is shipped in 15.2 ton storage containers, measuring 6.8 feet width by 10.4 feet length, and 8 feet height, according to a product data sheet.

Based on recent analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the IRA is projected to help clean energy increase to a range of 71% to 90% of total U.S. generation by 2030.   
Successful implementation of the IRA will require a wide range of stakeholders—including state and local governments, non-profits, Native American tribes, private companies, and the public—to participate and stay informed about the emerging implementation of the IRA from more than a dozen different federal agencies.
To help these entities navigate the myriad of changes, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School in partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund launched IRAtracker.org.  The website is split into two parts: a database of all climate change-related provisions within the IRA and a tracker for how federal agencies are implementing these provisions.
Organized by each federal agency, the database offers summaries of each provision.  These summaries highlight what the agency is required to do and what entities are eligible to receive funding or participate in the program.  For example, the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Department of Energy (DOE) each received over $100 million in funding to expedite and improve environmental review protocol under IRA Sections 50301 to 50303. Section 22002 of the IRA appropriates about $2 billion for the USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), to promote renewable energy development for agricultural producers and rural small businesses.  Section 60103 creates a “Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” which appropriates $27 billion to the EPA to make grants for the deployment of zero-emission technologies.
The IRA tracker shows 72 actions already been taken by 11 different federal agencies.  These provide a brief summary of the action, involved entities, and which corresponding section of the IRA the action is connected to.  For example, in February the EPA issued guidance under section 60103 on grant funding opportunities under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for state, local, and tribal governments, along with non-profits.  This action is also aligned with Biden’s Justice40 Initiative which guarantees 40% of benefits from federal investments to disadvantaged communities.
This tracker will continue to be updated over time as almost every new concept that is being introduced will require guidance and clarification from relevant federal agencies.  With the majority of nearly $400 billion in funding IRA being dedicated to tax credits, implementation will require significant action from the Treasury department.
The Treasury Department has already issued 10 requests for comments including the much-discussed renewable energy investment and production tax credits, along with tax credits for EVs and energy efficient home retrofits.  The site is also tracking guidance for new programs like the low-income community bonus Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and wind projects, along with 23 other actions.  While these expanded sources of funding have generated significant excitement, much remains to be seen.  The broad nature of these new definitions and lack of clarity run the risk of creating uncertainty and delaying projects.   For the solar market, this is especially true of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the transferability of tax credits, and the definition of energy communities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/28/massachusetts-city-offers-ev-adoption-as-employee-benefit/,"EMPLOYMENT,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,MASSACHUSETTS",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 28, 2023",Massachusetts city offers EV adoption as employee benefit,"Nicole LaChapelle, the mayor of Easthampton, Mass., has partnered with MoveEV, a Somerville, Mass.-based electric vehicle technology company, to switch the city’s municipal-use vehicles to EVs and offer its employees an incentive for using EVs.
MoveEV’s artificial intelligence-driven technology helps make EV adoption accessible and affordable for corporations and municipalities.
An EV benefit program includes both education for employees as well as purchase incentives. MoveEV says that 84% of its customer employees have a car, so many will find tangible benefits to reduce the cost of buying an EV and charging infrastructure. The incentives offered can complement the current $7,500 tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act, which MoveEV points out is a real benefit that affects employees now, as opposed to a 401(k) plan, which by context cannot be accessed for years or decades. Moreover, EV ownership saves employees money as they don’t have to pay for gas, and EVs have been found to require far less maintenance than their fossil-fuel driven counterparts.
Easthampton claims to be the first city in the U.S. to offer its employees an EV adoption benefit and transition all city-owned vehicles to EVs at the same time. EV adoption will help move Easthampton toward achieving its Climate Action Plan goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.
The MoveEV partnership will collectively help city employees claim up to $3 million in federal and state incentives, and save $900,000 on gasoline per year. Swapping out conventional vehicles for EVs cuts an estimated 4.7 metric tons of CO2 emissions each year per vehicle on average and could remove 1,500 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year. For the city’s fleet vehicles, the planned transition over the next 5 to 10 years is expected to save the city $360,000 per year on gasoline alone, and will remove 600 metric tons of CO2 annually.
“In a fast moving industry, this public-private partnership with MoveEV gives Easthampton the technical support necessary to move toward vehicle decarbonization,” said LaChappelle. “Electric car by electric car, the city will see a measurable material impact – environmental and financial – while leveraging government and private incentives.”

The city of Easthampton plans an Earth Day event for its employees on April 20th, during which employees can test drive electric vehicles on site. The MoveEV employee benefits portal will also be showcased, which provides information on the costs of their current gas-powered vehicle and provides a step-by-step process to help them manage their EV transition and take advantage of federal, state, and local EV adoption incentives.
“Electric vehicles are a game-changer for the environment, and will also save the city and its taxpayers a tremendous amount of money,” said David Lewis, MoveEV’s founder and CEO.
According to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center, a database for EV charging stations, the city of Easthampton currently has 10 public EV charging station locations in operations by network operators ChargePoint and AmpUp.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/28/ultrathin-solar-cells-self-repair-radiation-damage-in-space/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ARIZONA,FRANCE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 28, 2023",Ultrathin solar cells self-repair radiation damage in space,"Solestial, a solar energy company for space, announced it received confirmation from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) that it has independently validated the ability of its solar cells to resist and repair from radiation damage. 
The testing confirmed that the silicon cells effectively anneal radiation damage under sunlight at 194 F (90 C). Annealing is the process of slowly cooling to remove internal stresses of a material. 
Solestial’s silicon solar cells open circuit voltage dropped by only 4% and maintained 96% of initial value after being exposed to radiation equivalent to 10 years in low Earth orbit and annealing at 194 F under one Sun illumination equivalent. The company said its 20-micron thick cells demonstrate over 20% efficiency.
The company said the tests demonstrate the feasibility of self-curing solar cells with substantially reduced radiation-induced degradation. This is particularly important for space-based solar cells, which are buffeted by high levels of radiation and are required to operate for long lifecycles. 
“Annealing of radiation damage in silicon is straightforward at high temperatures, for example, above 200-250°C, but this is not useful for applications in space as these temperatures are rarely, if ever, experienced in situ,” said Romain Cariou, space silicon solar applications expert, CEA. “The differentiation factor here is that Solestial’s cells can cure radiation damage at normal operating temperatures for solar panels in space.” 
Cariou said this response to irradiation cannot be found in current commercial cell technologies. Over the course of a 10-year mission, commonly used III-V multijunction solar panels will lose 10% to 15% of their beginning of life efficiency due to radiation damage alone. For conventional terrestrial silicon solar panels, the damage will be even greater at 35% to 40%. Neither III-V nor terrestrial silicon have shown independent laboratory validation of such significant low-temperature annealing, said Solestial. 
“We look forward to further testing with the CEA over the coming months to validate internal annealing results at even lower temperatures. We’re excited to show the space industry the myriad benefits of Solestial’s ultrathin silicon solar cells and blankets,” said Stanislau Herasimenka, co-founder and chief executive officer of Solestial. 
The company said another advantage of its technology is that it is silicon-based, while many other solar panels made from space are often made from rarer or more expensive materials like gallium arsenide. 
The Tempe, Arizona-based company has been developing its technology for over a decade, beginning its life in Arizona State University. It underwent a $10 million seed funding round in October 2022.  
The company said it has been focused on testing and validation of its technology, hiring, and converting hundreds of millions of dollars of letters of intent into binding contracts. Its commercial customers range from startups to major defense primes, and builds on a foundation of more than $2.5 million in small business innovation research (SBIR) contracts with NASA, NSF, and other government agencies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/28/oregon-research-highlights-zinc-metal-battery-improvements/,"BATTERY,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,OREGON",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 28, 2023",Oregon research highlights zinc metal battery improvements,"With more than 80% of the global lithium-ion battery supply steered towards the electrification of the automotive sector, research of non-lithium-ion battery alternatives provides insight into stretching the availability of battery solutions into both the EV and stationary energy storage market.
An Oregon State University research group has developed a zinc metal anode electrolyte that raises the efficiency of zinc battery cells to nearly 100%, a breakthrough as companies search for non-lithium-ion alternatives to supplement a growing U.S. energy storage market.
In a research report published in the Nature Sustainability journal, a team of 17 OSU researchers in collaboration with HP and an Oregon start-up company, Grotthuss Inc., examined a zinc metal anode capable of storing intermittent daily solar and wind energy on the electric grid.
Relying on a metal that’s safe and abundant, zinc-based batteries are seen as a possible alternative for grid energy storage to widely used lithium-ion batteries, whose production relies on shrinking supplies of rare metals such as cobalt and nickel. Cobalt and nickel are toxic and can contaminate ecosystems and water sources if they leach out of landfills.
“Zinc metal batteries are one of the leading candidate technologies for large-scale energy storage,” said Dr. Xiulei ‘David’ Ji, a professor in OSU’s Department of Chemistry and lead author for the report. “Our new hybrid electrolyte uses water and an ordinary battery solvent, which is non-flammable, cost-effective and of low environmental impact. The electrolyte is made of a dissolved mixture of inexpensive chloride salts, with the primary one being zinc chloride.”
The cost of electricity for energy storage systems using zinc batteries is only competitive with fossil-fuel-produced electricity if the battery has a long dur
During charging, zinc cations in the electrolyte gain electrons and get plated cations of thousands of cycles, Ji said. To date, zinc batteries’ cycle life has been limited based on poor reversibility performance of the cell’s anode. on the anode surface. During discharge, the plated anode gives up electrons for the workload by being dissolved into the electrolyte, said Ji.
Zinc plating and dissolution is an irreversible process in which a portion of electrons cannot be recouped during discharge, creating a problem in an area known as Coulombic efficiency, the report explains. Coulombic efficiency (CE) is a measure of how well electrons are transferred in batteries, the ratio of the total charge extracted from the battery to the charge put in the over a full cycle. For example, lithium batteries can have a CE in excess of 99%.
The new zinc metal anode electrolyte developed by Ji and his team, in collaboration with scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Penn State University and the University of California, Riverside, enabled a CE of 99.95%, a fraction of a percent improvement over the CE of traditional lithium batteries.
Dr. Xiulei ""David"" Ji is a professor in Oregon State University's chemistry department.
“The primary challenge with zinc batteries is that zinc reacts with water in the electrolyte to generate hydrogen gas in what is called a hydrogen evolution reaction,” Ji said. “This parasitic reaction causes a short cycle life and is also a potential safety hazard.”
To remedy the hydrogen evolution reaction, the Oregon State research group’s electrolyte restricts water’s reactivity and nearly shuts down the hydrogen evolution reaction by forming a “passivation layer” on the surface of the anode. A passivation layer is what enabled the initial commercialization of lithium-ion batteries in the 1990s, according to the report.
Ji credits Oregon State colleague Dr. Chong Fang for uncovering the electrolyte’s atomic structure by using advanced spectroscopy, and Alex Greaney at UC Riverside, for determining the passivation mechanism, respectively.
“Also, it is worth noting that the efficiency we measured is under harsh conditions that do not mask any damage caused by the hydrogen evolution reaction,” said Ji. “The breakthrough reported here heralds the near-future commercialization of the zinc metal batteries for large-scale grid storage.”
In addition to HP and Grotthuss, the research group was supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy.
Grotthuss is a spin-off corporation formed by Ji to commercialize the zinc metal anode technology and is currently seeking a full-time chief executive officer, according to social media.  In April 2020, the company received a $200,000 grant from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation to further research the technology for use in the energy storage market.
In November 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded $3 million to Ji to lead the development of a new, high-energy-density battery that does not rely on rare elements.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/28/summit-ridge-raises-tax-equity-for-50-mw-maine-and-illinois-solar-portfolio/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,POLICY,ILLINOIS,MAINE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 28, 2023",Summit Ridge raises tax equity for 50 MW Maine and Illinois solar portfolio,"Community solar developer Summit Ridge Energy lined up its second tax equity financing commitment from Foss & Company, raising $67 million for a 50 MW community solar portfolio of 13 projects under development in Maine and Illinois.
The investment utilizes the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Qualified Advanced Energy Project Credit program. Once guidance for low- and moderate-income community incentives and domestic content requirements program is finalized, the developer expects to expand its partnership with the tax investor to fund additional projects in underserved and traditional energy communities.
The funding supports a development pipeline to provide residential and commercial subscribers with clean energy and an opportunity to support the local renewable economy.  The company has raised $122 million in tax equity commitments from Foss since partnering with the institutional investor in April 2021.
“In addition to targeting robust cash flow and economic returns for our investors, this portfolio is expected to increase access to low-cost clean energy for thousands of families and small businesses in Illinois and Maine,” said Bryen Alperin, managing director of Foss & Company. “This investment will allow us to continue building upon our current partnership with SRE, as well as advance our long-term mission of supporting a renewable energy future for all.”
Summit Ridge started construction on the 50 MW portfolio early this year and expects to achieve commercial operations in 2024. Once operational, the projects will generate clean power and energy savings for residential and commercial customers across six utility service territories. Commercial customers include small to large businesses who will remotely subscribe to the community solar projects.
At the Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA) Finance, Tax & Buyers Seminar on March 21, Foss & Company’s Alperin told a tax equity panel audience that with the massive IRA legislation currently being disseminated and parsed out via guidance, “there’s more projects out there right now than investors.”  With additional guidance pending on transferability, or the selling of tax credits, and other incentives under the IRA, the solar project development market is currently in a bottlenecked pattern, with developers and investors both awaiting further clarity as projects get pencilled in, but not built, Alperin said.
Transferability was the number one topic at the SEIA Finance seminar this month, with many policy advisors including Seth Hanlon of the Department of Treasury saying that federal guidance on the tax credit transfer provision could come within a matter of weeks.  This year, companies with taxable income will be allowed to transfer investment and production tax credits, along with other tax credits, for cash to unrelated parties, and the proceeds from the transfer is not treated as taxable income.
Summit Ridge was formed in 2017 by Steve Raeder and Brian Dunn after the pair helmed SunEdison’s East Coast commercial and industrial solar business and served as vice president of the Hunt Companies’ distributed solar group, respectively. The company has developed community solar and rooftop distributed generation projects in Illinois, Maryland and Maine. In Illinois, the company has 250 MW of solar projects constructed and in development.  In July, Summit Ridge raised $175 million from Apollo Funds to fund geographic growth expansion and other initiatives.
In December, Summit Ridge partnered with the 548 Enterprise, Ecademy and Power52 Foundation to launch the “Sustainability Hub” on Chicago’s West Side to train more than 10,000 residents over the next decade.  The solar apprenticeship program is a 13-week (450 hour) training program targeting veterans, formerly incarcerated citizens returning to the workforce (returning citizens), and high school-aged adults from underserved communities. Summit Ridge is committing $600,000 in seed capital over the next two years for the program’s launch. To participate or learn more about a training program, visit  www.548enterprise.com/foundation.

The first phase of the project will provide 450 full-time jobs and is aiming for 1 GWh of annual production. EnerVenue says it expects to invest in excess of $1 billion to expand to more than 20 GWh per year across its domestic manufacturing sites in subsequent phases. The company currently has manufacturing facilities in Fremont, Calif.
“Locating EnerVenue’s gigafactory in Kentucky is a win for the commonwealth,” said Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. “Our leadership has prioritized bringing high-quality jobs to the region and this is yet another example of those efforts paying dividends.”
Shelby County offered EnerVenue a generous 25-year incentive package that includes property and wage tax rebates totaling $20 million. The state of Kentucky also offered EnerVenue more than $10.3 million in tax incentives for the first phase of the company’s ramp up. The tax rebates are intended to support growth in the county and incentivize future development as the gigafactory expands and adds additional jobs.
“As customer interest in EnerVenue’s storage technology soars, we’re excited to significantly scale battery production with our new state-of-the-art gigafactory in Shelby County,” said Jorg Heinemann, chief executive officer of EnerVenue. “Following a nationwide vetting process, Kentucky emerged as the ideal fit to build our new facility. The state and county governments were committed to bringing manufacturing and clean energy jobs to the region, and we look forward to working with them as we build out operations.”
EnerVenue, established in 2020, uses a nickel-hydrogen technology originally developed for aerospace applications. In 2017, Stanford researchers redesigned the nickel-hydogen vessel, moving it toward commercialization by improving performance and reducing cost. EnerVenue claims costs per kilowatt-hour for its nickel-hydrogen batteries as low as one penny, and capital expenditure costs are better than lithium-ion battery cells.  The company raised $125 million in a December 2021 Series A equity offering from  Schlumberger, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures and Stanford University, and advised by Barclays.  The funding round follows an earlier $12 million seed round that year.
What further sets nickel-hydrogen apart from lithium-ion is that the EnerVenue batteries excel in extreme heat and extreme cold. The company said its batteries operate best in ambient temperatures from -40 F to 140 F.  The battery purportedly comes with no risk of fire or thermal runaway and includes no toxic materials, so it is also recyclable.
The company claims that its batteries have a more than 30-year lifespan, can go through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation and offer exceptional overcharge, over-discharge, and deep-cycle capabilities. In October 2022 the company announced Capacity Assurance, which offers a 20-year/20,000-cycle warranty extension at no less than 88% capacity. While the batteries are designed to last 30 years, EnerVenue says that the extended warranty covers a project while it’s in its most critical payback phase and is offered with no hidden exclusions and simple operating terms.
EnerVenue reports that it has more than 7 GWh of customer commitments, including from Pine Gate Renewables, Nicon Industries’ Green Energy Renewable Solutions, and Schlumberger New Energy, among others.

The company is developing solar-specific software tools that, when combined with their groundbreaking “drone in a box” platform, will offer solar power facilities a permanent digital and thermal scanning presence on site.
Raptor and Skydio declined to provide pv magazine USA with explicit product specifications; however, a rough estimate suggests that this hardware package could cost mere thousandths of a cent per kilowatt-hour.

Raptor Maps announced that they are partnering with Skydio in the development of the Skydio Dock. This dock is set to be smaller and lighter than the $30,000 DJI Dock from a competing drone company. Skydio offers two versions of its hardware: the $1,100 S+ drone and the X2 Autonomous Drone, which includes a thermal camera and costs approximately $15,000 per unit. The X2 boasts a range of 6 to 10 km, depending on bandwidth, and can fly for 35 minutes per charge.
Raptor Maps released an infographic that suggests a starting price of approximately $50,000 for their system, with a projected ten-year lifetime. The graph increases from $50,000 to $100,000 over the course of 20 years, indicating that the service package that Raptor Maps sells along with the drone in a box will cost $2,500 annually.

If we consider a 100 MW solar power plant that generates an average of 161.5 GWh of electricity per year for the first decade, the levelized cost of electricity would increase by only three thousands of a cent due to the implementation of this unit (service price not included).
If the unit were to be permanently installed onsite, it is likely that it could qualify for the 30% Inflation Reduction Act tax credit.
According to Raptor Maps, the primary use of drones in the utility-scale solar industry is to scan for thermal anomalies. To facilitate this, the company provides a software suite that enables facility operators to make informed technical decisions based on a wealth of data.
Raptor Maps emphasizes the numerous benefits of their system, which include quarterly module inspections, substation and overhead line inspections, and reactive inspections. Additionally, the technology allows for monitoring of vegetation, fencing, civil works, and general security, ensuring comprehensive oversight of solar facilities.
