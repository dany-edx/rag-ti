The project will provide peak shaving services to the Pascoag Utility District and ancillary services to ISO-New England. It is the first battery energy storage system to be built by Agilitas in Rhode Island, and is planned to enter service by Q2 2022.
The project is being constructed to support Gov. Gina Raimondo’s 2020 executive order committing the state to meeting all of its electricity demand with renewables and non-fossil fuel resources by 2030.
Besides supporting the state’s renewable goals, the project is being constructed to avoid the more costly re-construction of existing transmission lines in the area.
With this project, Agilitas is now constructing over 40 MW of solar and over 70 MWh of energy storage projects in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/07/in-a-surprise-vote-arizona-utility-regulators-reject-a-clean-energy-plan/,"POLICY,ARIZONA",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 7, 2021","In a surprise vote, Arizona utility regulators reject a clean energy plan","Regulators in Arizona voted down new rules that would have required most of the state’s electricity providers to get all of their power from clean energy sources by 2050.
The 3-2 vote by the Arizona Corporation Commission reportedly was a surprise. The plan was backed by the state’s regulated utilities and was given initial approval by the commission on a 4-1 vote last November after three years of work.
The plan ran afoul of an amendment that turned requirements into voluntary goals. That change cost the support of the two Democrats on the panel.
The decision means Arizona utilities will held to renewable energy standards adopted in 2006. The standards require utilities to get at least 15% of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025.  The state’s two largest utilities have already announced voluntary plans to increase their use of renewable energy and cut carbon emissions tied to climate change.
The defeated proposal would have required regulated Arizona utilities to get half their power from solar, wind, and other renewable sources by 2035 and 100% from clean sources, including nuclear, by 2050. It took three years of work by the commission and its staff, which held hours of hearings and took thousands of public comments, to craft the rules.
The change was backed by the state’s largest utilities, but was opposed by Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, who backed legislation this year to strip  regulators of their power to set energy policy. That legislation stalled after utility Arizona Public Service (APS) publicly opposed the effort and a Republican senator said he did not support the change. With all Democrats opposed, the loss of that one Republican meant the proposal could not advance.
APS announced in January 2020 that it plans to get all its power from non-carbon emitting sources by 2050 and plans to end use of coal-fired power plants by 2031.
The utility gets about 25% of its power from the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating station west of Phoenix. It plans to add utility-scale solar power plants, increase battery storage, and looks to homeowners to add more rooftop solar panels to supply electricity.
Tucson Electric Power said last year it will retire its coal plants by 2032 and get more than 70% of its power from solar and wind by 2035.
Non-regulated Salt River Project said in early May that it planned to more than double its 2025 utility-scale solar commitment to add 2,025 MW of new utility-scale solar energy to its power system by the end of its 2025 fiscal year. The new goal is more than 1,000 MW beyond SRP’s original 2025 commitment of 1,000 MW, announced in November 2018.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/07/role-of-distributed-solar-at-issue-in-californias-net-metering-update/,"POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MAY 7, 2021",Role of distributed solar at issue in California’s net metering update,"Now that California gets over 22% of its electricity from solar, the state is again revising its compensation scheme for newly installed distributed solar.
Key parties in an ongoing rate proceeding, widely known as NEM 3.0, agree that new distributed solar should be compensated at lower rates than in the past. They disagree about what the new rates should be, with each party anchoring its proposal in a distinct philosophy.
Solar plus storage “will be the future of renewable distributed generation in California,” says a joint proposal from the national solar trade association Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and the nonprofit Vote Solar.
(Read “Clean energy advocates are ready to do battle over California’s net energy metering program.”)
Distributed storage is “necessary” for California’s wildfire-prone grid, and will also help manage distribution circuits as loads increase due to electrification, said the California Solar & Storage Association (CALSSA). Because existing solar providers are best able to install distributed storage at scale, the group said, the state’s distributed solar industry must be preserved by compensating self-generators at attractive levels.
Meeting California’s greenhouse gas reduction goals through utility-scale renewables alone “is not a realistic scenario,” said CALSSA, saying that transmission siting will be “extremely difficult,” and that based on recent experience, new transmission will be “enormously expensive.”
The Public Advocates Office of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) aims to benefit and “fairly compensate” homeowners who add solar based on the “actual value” of the energy, in a way that “supports electric service affordability for all customers.”
California has a dual mandate for setting electricity rates for self-generators. State law AB 327 calls for these rates to balance the costs and benefits of self-generation, while ensuring that customer-sited renewable generation can grow sustainably.
To balance costs and benefits, SEIA and Vote Solar proposed reducing compensation for self-generation below current “NEM 2.0” rates. New residential self-generators who are served by two of the state’s three major utilities would be required to use existing untiered time-of-use rates designed to promote electrification. Because those rates are lowest during sunny hours, they would provide a “strong incentive” for new distributed generation customers to include storage, the groups say.

CALSSA proposed a step-down of export credits below current retail rates for new residential self-generators, that would achieve a seven-year payback period. The group said its proposal would promote sustainable growth through a payback period “that customers find acceptable.”
The CPUC’s Public Advocates Office said that homeowners with new solar should be compensated at the utility’s avoided cost for their exported energy, through which they would “still receive a meaningful subsidy.” The office said that monthly bill savings would recover the system cost in 13-15 years, while solar panels retain 80% of their starting efficiency after 40 years, “so the system owner stands to accrue substantial long-term benefits.”
That office agreed with the proposals of a CPUC-commissioned white paper, which called for compensating export energy at avoided cost, adding “grid benefits charges” to cover distribution, transmission and public program costs, and gradually reducing export compensation from the current level. The office’s proposal would also provide storage incentives to existing self-generation customers.
CALSSA challenged that white paper’s analysis, saying it “unreasonably assumes the majority of utility costs are fixed,” and proposing alternative means to measure avoided costs, and to calculate the CPUC’s Ratepayer Impact Measure.
Both the SEIA/Vote Solar proposal and the CALSSA proposal would keep rates for new commercial distributed generation customers at NEM 2.0 levels.
The parties’ proposals are available in the California Public Utilities Commission docket for Proceeding R2008020.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/07/solar-101-how-to-find-and-evaluate-a-solar-contractor-for-your-rooftop-project/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 7, 2021",Solar 101: How to find … and evaluate … a solar contractor for your rooftop project,"The first articles of our Solar 101 series, (“Is my roof ready for solar?”) and (“Attaching your solar system to your roof”) examined how the age and physical characteristics of a roof affect the design and payback of a prospective solar system. We also discussed the design constraints resulting from wind, dirt, and precipitation.
And, in “Working the angles to maximize your solar system’s output”, we looked at the relationship between a panel’s latitude, pitch and azimuth to its solar electricity output.
Now, we’ll look at how to find a solid solar contractor to build your solar power system.
A well-designed solar system should last 20 or 30 years, or longer. The mounting hardware, which attaches directly to your home, will typically require drilling holes in your roof. But don’t fear. This guide for choosing the right contractor should help ease your concerns.
One rule of thumb: find someone experienced. Installing solar panels, like anything else, involves doing a set of similar actions over and over. Experience represents more than just the labor of attaching solar panels and the required electrical gear. For instance, experience usually indicates:
Recent research by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Berkeley Lab suggests that more experienced contractors offer better pricing.  This chart from their annual Tracking the Sun report doesn’t explicitly break down experience, but it does show how pricing can vary by contractor.

Experienced solar contractors have a truck filled with various odds and ends leftover from prior solar jobs. These little components often mean the difference between finishing a project in a day or two, versus two or three days with several trips to the local hardware store mixed in.
The question then becomes, how do we find an experienced solar contractor?
First off, ask your friends. And – as strange as it may sound – knock on the door of someone who has already installed solar power and ask them. These folks have real experience with a contractor, and can give you a tip or two as you ask questions of prospective contractors.
If you know contractors who have done good work for you already, ask them who they would hire to install a solar system on their roof. Roofing and electrical contractors often have pre-existing relationships with solar contractors because their businesses have a lot of cross-over. Your HVAC contractor may also have a good working relationship with a solar contractor. And finally, local Professional Engineers, or “PE”, (specifically structural and electrical) will have knowledge of the local solar contractors because they have to sign off on solar design drawings.

Another technique is to reach out to your local town hall to learn who the local permit office likes to deal with. Be sure to ask which solar contractors always seem to submit the right paperwork. This question may be more important than it appears, because paperwork is a huge part of a solar installation.
And one last technique: call your local contractor supply houses. Again, the supply houses have relationships with contractors that buy the most hardware from them. For this call, come prepared with a few key questions: Who pays their bills on time, who’s been in business the longest, and who is most organized?
One way to vet a contractor is to simply call them and see how they follow up with you. Their follow-up will give you an idea about the quality of service you might receive later in the process.  Be sure to call an actual local contractor, and not a sales organization that will simply hand the lead off to a contractor.
A few items to consider when the contractor representative shows up:
After reaching out to locals and others in the know, the next place to go is Google. But beware: Companies – and especially sales organizations – specialize in placing themselves high up the Google search results.

Contractors, on the other hand, specialize in building things. Many good builders lack grammar and/or web development skills. Look the other way and evaluate them on attributes that matter: reliability, knowledge, experience, and work product. 
The one place that this author regularly sends people is SolarPowerWorldOnline’s Top 500 list. You’ve got to be smart, however, about using this list.
First, make sure you choose your own state because the default list is national. Second, recognize that companies pay a fee to get on the list. And third, consider that the companies near the top of the list are likely the largest national companies. 
A second path to follow without cold calling is to use EnergySage. Contractors submit their profile to the company, must have at least 10 installations with positive reviews, and are regularly re-vetted.
Here’s the key value kicker from EnergySage: After you submit your address, you will get a few quotes from contractors who  know very well that they are competing with at least two or three other contractors. This will likely force these contractors to work their numbers to be competitive.

Contractors pay commissions to EnergySage; about $1,000 if the customer ends up installing. However, that commission is comparable to what a door to door salesperson might make.
Of course, you should also consider the largest national name brand companies, with Sunrun, Sunnova, and Tesla being the big three these days. These companies all have unique offerings, and also some similar products, so research each of them and their offerings to know which might best fit your needs.
Sunrun and Sunnova are best known for their solar lease products. In essence you rent your rooftop to them in exchange for a “free” solar power system. Tesla’s main business is to sell you a system that you fully own, whether it be standard solar panels or their new Solar Glass roof product. Both Sunrun and Sunnova will also sell, but their system costs typically don’t compete with Tesla’s pricing model.
The compromise: when you choose a large national company is that you’re a number. You will likely get the cheapest price for residential solar hardware from Tesla, but there also will probably be less personal interaction and system optimization.
A small local company might not be able to provide the lowest hardware prices, but it likely will put more effort into customizing a design to fit your specific application. And always keep one eye open. Some mid-sized companies will quote twice as much as their competitors.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/07/sunrise-brief-more-community-solar-is-added-in-minnesota/,"BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 7, 2021",Sunrise brief: More community solar is added in Minnesota,"United Renewable Energy and New Energy Equity finished work on three community solar gardens in Minnesota, adding 4.3 MW of capacity to power local businesses and school districts by subscription. Subscribers receive bill credits from the utility, giving them the benefits of solar energy with no equipment purchase, maintenance, or solar panels required on their own premises.
New Energy Equity has developed over 130 projects in Minnesota, totaling more than 160 MW. United Renewable Energy has participated in more than 40 MW of those projects. United Renewable was responsible for the engineering, procurement, and construction on the three new projects. Kenyon Energy will supply permanent financing.
The 20 MW St. Joseph Solar Farm, developed by Indiana Michigan Power in partnership with the University of Notre Dame, entered service in northern Indiana, near South Bend.
The facility is the utility’s fifth, and largest, solar project. The university committed to buying 40% of the renewable energy certificates produced by the solar farm.
After a delay due to the Covid-19 pandemic, construction began in July 2020. The project includes 57,720 First Solar modules and occupies 210 acres of utility-owned land.
The utility owns and operates five solar farms, six run-of-river hydroelectric facilities, and buys power from three wind farms. It also operates the 2,278 MW D.C. Cook Nuclear Plant in Michigan.
Rapid recent cost declines for solar and wind now mean that the combined fuel, maintenance, and other costs of most existing coal-fired power plants are higher than the all-in costs of new solar and wind projects, accelerating the retirement of those fossil-fired plants.
A new report from Energy Innovation compares the economics of each coal plant in the U.S. against the expected economics of potential new solar and wind plants, using publicly available data.
It found that almost three-quarters of the 239 GW of coal capacity that was online in 2019 was either uneconomic compared to local solar or wind or was slated for retirement within five years. Out of the 235 plants in the U.S. coal fleet, 182 plants, or 80%, are uneconomic or already retiring.
LS Power said it completed its acquisition of distributed energy infrastructure solutions provider GI Energy, which is rebranded as Endurant Energy. The newly branded business unit supports microgrids, battery energy storage systems, and integrated eco-districts. Its portfolio ranges from single-technology energy retrofits to large-scale microgrids integrated with resource management and smart-city infrastructure.
In a statement, LS Power said it intends to invest a “substantial amount of additional capital” to advance Endurant’s offering. Endurant joins LS Power’s other distributed energy resource companies, including CPower Energy Management and EVgo.
Endurant is based in Chicago, with offices in New York City as well as Anaheim and West Hollywood, California.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/07/pattern-of-decide-announce-defend-for-rural-solar-must-change-researchers-say/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 7, 2021","Pattern of ‘decide-announce-defend’ for rural solar must change, researchers say","Solar power developers need to explore using lower quality agricultural land for solar energy, incentivize dual-use options, avoid concentrated solar development, and engage communities, according to new research from Cornell University in New York.
Farmland is a prime target for solar development in part because it is generally flat and cleared, the researchers said in a forthcoming paper to be published in Renewable Energy.
The paper focused on New York State’s clean energy goals, which will require an additional 21.6 GW of utility-scale solar energy capacity. The researchers said that goal can’t be met without using lower-grade agricultural land and dual-use (agrivoltaics) options.
To date, around 40% of current solar energy capacity has been developed on agricultural land, the researchers found. In addition, 84% of land identified as suitable for future solar development – about 140 GW – is agricultural.
Keeping solar farms from becoming too concentrated will likely help mitigate negative economic activity. This kind of concentration leads to agricultural land conversion and then sparks a negative reaction for businesses that depend on farming.
The researchers found growing public opposition in rural communities to utility-scale development projects. Easing public concerns though community engagement is essential for sustainable growth of solar in New York, they said.
In a related development in early May, local officials in Culpeper County, Virginia unanimously rejected a 150 MW solar facility following a public comment period. Of the 30 people who spoke about the proposed plant, 23 opposed it. Some claimed that the project would ruin the rural nature of the area, the environment, and historic resources.
Meanwhile in Indiana, AEP Energy, a unit of American Electric Power, and Global Energy Generation signed a power purchase agreement enabling work to start on the first phase of the 1.65 GW Mammoth Solar project. The project would cover more than 12,000 acres in northwest Indiana. The developers are touting the benefits of removing farmland from active production, including reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers and the reduction of around 1 billion gallons a year of water used for irrigation.
The Cornell researchers found that in New York State, more than 80% of land containing large installations is private land where developers sign a lease with private landowners, then approach the broader community. This decide-announce-defend approach “arouses protective actions from the wider community,” the researchers said.
The researchers recommended that energy companies build a better relationship with the nearby community. They said it is “easier to engage and educate the community, rather than defend actions.”
