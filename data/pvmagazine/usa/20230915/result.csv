Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The goal is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
The report noted a steep uptick to consumers showing interest in storage in order to self-supply solar generation, suggesting that lowered net metering rates are discouraging export of local, clean electricity. Nearly 40% of consumers reported self-supply as a reason for getting a storage quote, up from less than 20% in 2022. Backup power for outages and savings on utility rates were also listed as top reasons for including energy storage in a quote.
Attachment rates of batteries in residential solar projects have climbed steadily  in 2020 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and in 2022 that rate climbed over 17%.
Warranty periods can offer a look in installer and manufacturer expectations of the life of a battery. Common warranty periods are typically around 10 years. The warranty for the Enphase IQ Battery, for instance, ends at 10 years or 7,300 cycles, whatever occurs first.
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between 5-15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20-30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.

Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimized. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/15/how-to-decrease-the-risk-of-battery-energy-storage-system-fires/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",How to decrease the risk of battery energy storage system fires,"A report by Firetrace International states that negative media publicity covering recent fire incidents resulting from faulty energy storage systems is sowing public opposition, and the suppression specialist offers ways to reduce fires and suppress the opposition.
As battery energy storage systems proliferate in the U.S., so do the reports of battery fires or overheating batteries. From the Salt River Project to a Tesla installation, these fires make the news. The American Public Power Association use these fires, which mostly have lithium ion batteries, as an opportunity to reiterate earlier comments by the Arizona Corporation Commission stating that lithium-ion chemistries used in battery storage facilities created unacceptable risks. They said the fire brought fresh attention to safety issues tied to energy storage.
Firetrace International says that negative coverage such as this has led to the postponement of domestic energy storage infrastructure projects. Due to such fires, the report says that insurance companies are now less inclined to cover energy storage projects. Those that do provide coverage have increased premiums, implemented higher excesses or denied 100% coverage. The report notes that this is despite the Electric Power Research Institute’s database showing that domestic energy storage failure incidents have decreased from 16 in 2018 to six as of July this year.
To help energy storage companies regain investor, policymaker and public trust in battery energy storage systems, Firetrace outlines  ways in which manufacturers, developers and operators can decrease the risk of common fire hazards. Some of these include separation of battery containers and other major equipment, ensuring that EPC contractors understand battery storage technology, having a sufficient water supply to the site, making sure that local fire departments are familiar with the installation, and more.
The report also cites the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), which says water-based suppression systems are the most effective way to cool an energy storage system fire. The NFPA recommends that buildings housing energy storage systems install NFPA 13-compliant sprinkler systems.
In addition to a water suppression system, Firetrace recommends a battery management system and grouping energy storage units into small segments limited to certain amounts of kilowatt hours and spaced from other segments and walls.
“There are fire suppression companies who claim their systems can suppress Li-Ion battery fires and prevent thermal runaway,” says Brian Cashion, engineering manager, Firetrace International. “We don’t believe the industry can make these claims yet because there is no publicly available test data proving these claims in real world test scenarios and doing so risks a second wave of public scrutiny. It is crucial we get the solution right.”
In addition, the report suggests that manufacturers implement monthly preventative checks and thermographic testing, keeping spare parts handy to minimize interruptions should upgrades be implemented. Since domestic storage fire regulations vary from state to state, different rules inform design and installation practices, which the report says can decrease system safety and quality. The report also notes that the NFPA suggests that systems housing enough batteries in a confined space with the capacity to generate an explosion should install prevention systems or deflagration venting per NFPA 69, Standard on Explosion Prevention Systems and NFPA 68, Standard on Explosion Protection by Deflagration Venting.
Regulations are also important to note, however, the report points out that they are “developing haphazardly with a state-by-state approach.” For example, each state can have a different fire code, which means that energy storage systems can be designed differently depending on where they are located. For example, as of April 1, 2021, there were eight states on the 2012 cycle, 23 states (plus the District of Columbia) on the 2015 cycle, 17 states on the 2018 cycle, and two states (California and New York) on the 2021 cycle.
Furthermore, solar and energy storage design and engineering consultancy Mayfield Renewables has noted that some U.S. states adopt the International Fire Code (IFC) for energy storage, while others adhere to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/15/heat-pump-design-to-reduce-footprint-of-solar-thermal-installations/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",Heat pump design to reduce footprint of solar thermal installations,"From pv magazine global
A group of scientists led by the University of Guanajuato in Mexico has developed a new methodology to reduce the area needed for the deployment of solar thermal systems installations (STIs) by linking them with heat pumps.
The proposed system consists of a solar collector network, a storage system, and two heat pumps assisted by the solar collectors themselves.
In the paper “Heat and electric power production using heat pumps assisted with solar thermal energy for industrial applications,” published in Energy, the research group, which also includes academics from Texas A & M University in the United States, said that they considered irradiance conditions, the target temperature, and the operation time to design the solar collector network.
“The target temperature of the network is the temperature of the heat pump evaporator, and the target temperature of the heat pump is the process temperature,” they explained, noting that the collector will provide the heat load required by the evaporator, at the evaporation temperature. “The heat pump refrigerant, through isentropic work, will raise the temperature and pressure to supply the heat load at the process target temperature.”
The proposed approach was simulated for a sugar mill that also produces bioethanol and electricity from sugarcane bagasse. The scientists considered two solar-assisted heat pumps to supply the heat and the power of the second generation (2G) bioethanol production process.
For electrical production, the scientists modeled a system that uses thermal energy to heat water, which is then heated by the heap pump evaporator. Then, using R600a as the working fluid of the heat pump, the heat is utilized for an organic Rankine cycle to create electricity.
As for heat production, the system uses thermal energy to heat the evaporator of the heat pump, and the heat produced by the pump is then used in the production process of second-generation bioethanol.
Through their analysis, the researchers found that the heat pumps helped reduce the area needed for the STIs by 85%. “A reduction of 2885 m2 was achieved in the absorber area of the solar collector network to produce heat,” they specified. “The reduction in absorber area to produce power was of 586,918 m2.”
The simulated system was also able to produce power at a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.3435/kWh compared with that of fossil fuels estimated at $0.761/kWh. As for heat, the system was able to achieve $0.1257/kWh compared to $0.124/kWh for fossil fuels.
“The process is feasible, because costs to produce process heat are significantly reduced by 20–30% considering the cost of the heat pump; the simple payback time is 6.5–12.3 years,” the US-Mexican group noted.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/15/solar-for-water-deionization/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",Solar for water deionization,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) in Canada have developed PV-powered water purification technology based on capacitive deionization (CDI), which is a technique being increasingly used for removal of ionic as well as polarizable species from water and is commonly utilized for the desalination of water with a low or moderate salt concentration.
The technology is also claimed to have low operational cost, enhanced energy efficiency, and less water rejection compared to conventional purification techniques.
“Our new technology does not require a storage media in between the PV panel and the CDI desalination cell,” the research’s corresponding author, Alaa Ghamrawi, told pv magazine. “It relies on a dedicated algorithm for the application of Photovoltaic energy to the desalination process, as well as a new MPPT technology based on flow adjustment and not electrical power conversion.”
The system prototype uses a photovoltaic panel equipped with a diode and a shunt resistor. The panel is DC-connected to a membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) cell that creates a short circuit or applies reverse voltage on the electrodes when the maximum concentration of ions is reached during adsorption.
The MCDI cell also uses the flow rate as a control parameter. “The variation of the flow rate will be an essential factor to adapt the
MCDI cell impedance and eventually the load applied on the PV panel,” the scientists explained, noting that they were able to control this flow rate to optimize the power produced by the solar module via a new algorithm, which they called Maximum Salt Adsorption Tracking (MSAT).
After testing the prototype under different operating conditions, the researchers found that the PV-powered MCDI cell was able to produce 28 liters of desalinated water on a sunny summer day, compared to 24 liters for a conventional MCDI unit. They also found that the MSAT tracking efficiency is 98.6%, which they claim is comparable with conventional MPPT.
“Conventional MCDI cells require more costly MPPT controllers for a high performance,” Ghamrawi explained, referring to the economical gains of a direct DC connection. “The battery cost for each CDI cell is about $200 for a 200AH device. Then, there is also the cost of the controller which is approximately around $10 and the MPPT micro-controller costs more than $20.”
The proposed system is described in the paper “Maximum salt adsorption tracking in capacitive deionization cell powered by photovoltaic solar panel,” published in Desalination. “For the time being, we have started the commercial design by developing the electronic board and the system components,” Ghamrawi said.
