That was the view of experts who took part in the American Council On Renewable Energy’s (ACORE) Capital Flows and Tax Equity in a Climate-Focused Economy panel discussion on June 15.
The panel was moderated by Kieth Martin a partner with Norton Rose Fulbright; and included commentary from Anad Dandapani, executive director with JP Morgan; Ja Kao, ACORE Board Member; Guarav Raniwala, managing director with GE Energy Financial Services; Himanshu Saxena, CEO of Starwood Energy Group; and Martin Torres, managing director and head of the Americas for BlackRock’s Renewable Power Group.
As far as tax equity is concerned, the name of the game is pandemic recovery and supply chain disruptions. The Covid-19 pandemic  exacerbated the supply chain issues that have been affecting all industries since mid-2019. According to the panel, these issues are expected to continue for the next 24 months.
Tax equity costs have also fluctuated widely over the past 24 months, as energy projects exhibit a larger range of risk and greater volatility than before. There is also an influx of niche or unexplored technologies that are likely to be advanced by the Biden administration, among them offshore wind and carbon capture. These technologies pose a problem, however, as tax equity investments are typically steered toward proven technologies that investors are familiar with, since these investors are risking their own capital. 
Direct pay has been floated by the administration, backed by the Solar Energy Industries Association, and included in two key pieces of renewable infrastructure legislation.

One effective tool to alleviate this impending stress on tax equity markets would be implementation of a direct pay option for renewable energy tax credits, said Saxena.
Direct pay has been floated by the administration, backed by the Solar Energy Industries Association, and included in two key pieces of renewable infrastructure legislation: the Green Act and the Clean Energy for America Act. Direct pay also may simplify the economics of emerging technology projects like offshore wind and carbon capture. It would do so by allowing them to innovate quickly and become more economically mature and attractive for investment. 
Another concern is whether there will be enough electrical demand to meet the new supply, especially if states invest in nuclear plants and eventual carbon-capture retrofits of coal plants to keep them economically viable. Saxena said that carbon credits will not be enough to keep coal plants alive and that inefficient generation in all forms will go by the wayside. While many utilities are accelerating coal plant retirement dates, those dates don’t match the increased renewable capacities that are expected to come on-line.
For the remaining capacity difference, the panel agreed that electrification of transportation and industries will be looked upon to close the gap. The amount of electrification needed to achieve a carbon-free power sector by 2035, and a net zero-emissions economy by 2050, was estimated by the panel to increase national electricity demand by anywhere from 25-35%. Panel members warned, however, that those figures could be optimistically high.

These policies took center stage at the American Council on Renewable Energy’s (ACORE) Finance Forum Fireside Chat on June 15, which brought together experts federal experts together to discuss the administration’s agenda for energy and climate.
The conversation was moderated by ACORE COO, Bill Parsons, and featured participation by Bobby Andres, senior policy adviser, Majority Staff of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee; Alice Lin, budget and tax policy adviser for the House Ways and Means Committee; and Candace Vahsling, associate director of Climate, Energy, Environment and Science for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. 
Much of the discussion focused on the policies included in two pieces of legislation working their way through Congress: the Green Act and the Clean Energy for America Act. The Green Act looks to establish and expand incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, including an energy storage tax credit and renewable fuel tax credits. The Clean Energy for America Act proposes a dramatically simpler set of long-term, performance-based energy tax incentives that are technology-neutral and promote clean energy in the United States.
A central theme in the discussion was that 2021 is a year of opportunity to enact meaningful, long-term policy that will drive investment in renewables;  to make progress on renewable development pipelines; and to make the impending energy transition a just and equitable one.
The panel members of this Fireside Chat session said that an unprecedented buildout of renewable energy is necessary to achieve a carbon-free power sector by 2035, and current tax incentives won’t get the country there.
Both Andres and Vahsling agreed that the best way to push investment is by creating long-term certainty around incentives. While increasing, and (in cases like the Investment Tax Credit) returning credits to their original rates will help, investments are made for the decade, not the day, and certainty is an important part of investment and project planning. Any meaningful policy will have to be thinking about the implementation and effect of these credits in long-term.
Lin urged a whole-government approach to increasing project investment attractiveness, which would include the expansion of technology block grants and accelerators.
The idea of a long-term outlook isn’t just one of making sure the right credits are in place for the right period of time. The phaseout of those credits is vital, with Parsons noting that, after a certain point of decline, credits no longer spur investment and development.
In response, Andres said that the purpose of the Clean Energy for America Act is to set climate policy through incentives using a framework that can hold long-term. Any zero-emission technology would receive the same amount of support, which, in turn, would make those technologies less expensive. By using incentives to lower overall long-term costs, these technologies can remain attractive even without subsidies.
Lin added that, in order to take advantage of current market opportunities, developers need to have long-term confidence. A concrete phasing schedule of credits is key to establishing this confidence.
Another phenomenon that has recently caused developers headaches is the stress on tax equity that began before the Covid-19 pandemic, but was exacerbated in the past year. While that stress was supply driven, Parsons said that the coin is expected to flip, and that demand-driven stress is imminent.
A policy solution that potentially could alleviate such stress is one that has been in the forefront of Biden’s climate policy: direct access to tax credit funds.
Direct Pay has been pushed for by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) as a necessity for the solar industry, and is a tool that Andres described as straightforward and effective. The issue with tax equity is that it requires another entity to put its capital at risk. That means investors tend to focus on technology that they’re familiar with because it’s proven. As a result, newer technologies often are unable to secure financing. The direct pay idea would open the door more for more innovative technologies and smaller companies to succeed.
Another policy point that all the speakers agreed on was the need for investment and support to expand transmission and distribution infrastructure, so that the full potential of renewables can be achieved to deliver power effectively to load centers. All agreed that the U.S. currently can’t meet its renewable deployment goals without additional transmission buildout.
Vahlsing said that improved transmission infrastructure is essential for reliability, but added that significant logistical and financial hurdles exist. By targeting support directly for transmission projects, rather than including transmission in other energy expansion measures, these once daunting projects become areas of focus for innovation and can be tackled effectively.
The three speakers also agreed that the country has a responsibility to ensure that energy investments benefit disadvantaged communities and provide new opportunities for former fossil fuel workers who may be displaced by the transition.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/15/department-of-energy-announces-200-million-in-new-funding-for-batteries-and-evs/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 15, 2021",Department of Energy announces $200 million in new funding for batteries and EVs,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $200 million in funding to support new vehicle development, both in EVs and connected vehicles, as well as the battery supply chain.  
Every segment of the battery supply chain is under focus in this project, reaching from sustainable mining and processing to manufacturing and recycling. The DOE says the funds will lead to thousands of new jobs across the country and will aid the U.S. effort to being a global leader at each level of the storage supply chain.  
The U.S. currently depends on the import of advanced battery components, which leaves the nation exposed to supply chain vulnerabilities already being experienced by the solar industry. 
Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm announced the funds in a recent roundtable, pointing to the newly published National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries 2021-2030 as the guiding force behind the investment. 
Developed by the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries (FCAB), the blueprint highlights a need for teamwork between the federal government, academic institutions, national laboratories, industry stakeholders, and international allies. Its vision for 2030 is the establishment of a secure battery materials and technology supply chain that supports long-term U.S. economic competitiveness and equitable job creation, increased decarbonization, the advancement of social justice, and the support of national security. 
The lithium battery blueprint lists five goals to achieve its vision. First, to secure access to raw and refined materials and discover alternates for critical minerals. Second, to support the growth of a United States material-processing base to meet domestic battery demand. Third, to the nation’s electrode, cell, and pack manufacturing sectors. Fourth, to enable end-of-life reuse and recycling at scale. And fifth, to advance U.S. battery technology leadership through the support of R&D, STEM education, and workforce development. 
The funding also seeks to make electric vehicle innovations in order to decarbonize the transportation sector, which is currently the largest culprit in carbon emissions nationwide. 
This additional funding adds on to the DOE’s Vehicle Technologies Office’s (VTO) $62 million package for reducing emissions and increasing efficiencies for on- and off-road vehicles announced this April. 
The VTO will support expansion of EV infrastructure and charging and host community-level EV demonstrations that can lower barriers to EV adoption. Such demonstrations include piloting EV car-sharing and installing EV charging within multi-unit housing, among others. 
All project submissions must include a diversity, equity, and inclusion report, addressing underrepresented groups in STEM, advancing equity within the project team, and producing benefits for underserved communities.

The technology is called SiFAB and is expected to offer faster charge times, smaller battery size, and an extended battery life for EVs, portable electronics, energy grid storage, and aerospace. The product is currently in advanced testing and reportedly has performed well in multiple battery systems. 
Unifrax said that SiFAB includes micron-sized silicon fiber with a nanoporous structure that is compatible with conventional mixing equipment. 
SiFAB will be produced in a facility in north central Indiana and could create up to 74 new jobs by the end of 2023, the company said. A $1.1 million conditional tax credit will be awarded to the manufacturer by the Indiana Economic Development Corporation as a performance-based credit to be paid once Indiana residents are hired. 
Unifrax has a history of manufacturing inorganic fiber materials at scale, and has previous experience supplying the materials to electric vehicle manufacturers.

The report said that residential solar was down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2020, but up 11% from the first quarter of 2021 with 905 MW installed. The report credited “healthy sales pipelines” that spilled over into the first quarter.
Commercial solar and community solar volumes fell from Q4 2020, as is typical for these market segments. Commercial solar rose 19% over Q1 2020 and community solar fell 15% from Q1 2020.
Utility-scale solar set a record for first-quarter installations at 3.6 GW. Texas made up the largest share of this capacity, with more than 1.4 GW of installations.

A total of 6.2 GW of new utility-scale solar power purchase agreements were announced in Q1 2021, on par with Q1 2020. The total utility-scale contracted pipeline has grown to nearly 77 GW, the report said.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the solar industry will continue to break annual installation records every year for the next three years before the investment tax credit (ITC) fully phases down under current law. Another 160 GW of capacity will be installed between 2021 and 2026, bringing the total operating PV fleet to over 250 GWdc by the end of 2026.
Texas led all states with 1.52 GW of new solar capacity in Q1, more than it added in all of 2019 and three times more than any other state. Indiana, Virginia, Michigan, and Iowa were among the top 10 solar states this quarter. Indiana rose from 32nd in terms of new installed solar capacity in 2020 to 4th as of the first quarter. Meanwhile, Georgia fell from 7th place to 38th over the same time period.
The report also calls attention to rising costs in the solar industry and helps to explain the dynamics at play. It said that “compounding cost increases across all materials started at the end of Q1 and are beginning to affect installers now.” (Read “Supply chain constraints are starting to hit the solar industry, SEIA says.”)
Stem Inc. entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for a new financing partnership with CleanCapital. Under the terms, the two will work to develop a framework in which Stem will provide support for smart energy storage services—including storage hardware and Athena smart energy software—to developers as CleanCapital’s preferred energy storage provider. Stem will have right of first refusal for all of CleanCapital’s storage projects that the parties originate together.
The proposed partnership will focus on mid-market commercial energy storage and small utility front-of-meter (FTM) projects up to 30 MW across the United States. The partners will target commercial & industrial end users and electric cooperatives.
In April, CleanCapital announced a $300 million corporate investment commitment from Manulife Investment Management to expand its portfolio of clean energy assets. With Stem as its new partner, CleanCapital expects to actively pursue investments in standalone energy storage, solar retrofits to add storage, and new-build solar plus storage projects.
Heliogen said it raised $108 million in two funding rounds to back the deployment of its Sunlight Refinery, a concentrated solar energy system that aims to make carbon-free energy for high-temperature heat, power, and green hydrogen.
The company recently closed $83 million in funding, a round that is in addition to $25 million raised in the previous round. Among the new investors are steel and mining company ArcelorMittal, utility holding company Edison International, Prime Movers Lab, Ocgrow Ventures, A.T. Gekko, private investment partnership of industry-leading families 8090 Partners, Gordon Crawford, and technology, consumer, and media-focused investor Rashaun Williams.
Heliogen said its baseline system will provide industrial-grade heat that will be capable of replacing fossil fuels in processes including the production of cement, steel, and petrochemicals. Its technology is also expected to enable power generation through the addition of a supercritical CO2 turbine and green hydrogen fuel production in combination with an electrolyzer.
Ameresco Inc. said it will deploy a $19 million project for Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico and the Defense Logistics Agency Energy that includes a 1.9 MW ground mount solar array, smart controls, and other energy conservation technologies.
The project is expected to convert 4% of Cannon’s electric energy usage to onsite renewable resources. Planned improvements include upgrades to existing transformers, direct digital controls, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment.
Cannon is expected to save around $1.1 million in the first year and $33 million over the course of the performance period. Construction is set to begin in the third quarter and reach completion by by the first quarter of 2023.SE

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/15/supply-chain-constraints-are-starting-to-hit-the-solar-industry-seia-says/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 15, 2021","Supply chain constraints are starting to hit the solar industry, SEIA says","Increased commodity prices and delivery delays are beginning to affect portions of the U.S. solar industry, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie in their Solar Market Insight Report for the first quarter.
The report said the most significant impact of the current supply environment is on utility-scale projects that are under development. Developers are approaching offtakers to renegotiate their power purchase agreements (PPA) in an effort to increase prices or relax in-service dates. The report said that, so far, efforts to increase PPA prices on existing contracts “have not been very successful in a hyper-competitive market.”
The report said the price of steel has more than doubled since the pandemic began. This has led to increased prices and lowered availability of solar racking equipment and trackers. Here, too, this has mostly affected utility-scale solar projects but has also impacted carport installations, which require more steel support structures than other solar projects.

The report said that polysilicon supply and demand are “barely balanced,” meaning that small production errors can make an outsized difference. This has led to stagnant or increasing module costs (depending on the manufacturer), reversing, the report said, a decades-old trend of module cost declines.
Generally, a lag exists between changes to commodity prices and subsequent changes to solar system prices. The extent to which commodity price increases are passed onto customers can vary. But through Q1, the effects on installed solar system prices have been marginal, the report said.
Over the last several quarters, critical components for solar equipment – polysilicon, steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips, copper and other metals – have become increasingly supply-constrained. But increasing demand for solar, combined with pandemic-related macroeconomic realities (such as increased shipping costs, microchip availability, and a residential home renovation boom) have led to increased commodity prices and delivery delays.
Equity research firm Roth Capital Advisors warned clients in a May 16 research note that current price pressures could delay as much as 15% of planned 2021 utility scale solar development.
“With everything at elevated levels, some projects will get pushed,” the firm said.
Roth Capital said that U.S. utility scale module pricing six months ago for delivery in the third quarter of 2022 was on the order of $0.25 per Watt freight on board (FOB), or $0.27/W delivered duty paid (DDP).
The report said price increases for manufacturers may not be felt immediately by customers due to time lags in procuring equipment and long-term supply agreements.

In a quarterly earnings statement, Albuquerque-based Array Technologies, which makes single-axis trackers, said the industry is dealing with increases in steel and shipping costs that are “unprecedented both in their magnitude and rate of change.” It said that compared to the first quarter or 2020, spot prices of hot rolled coil steel more than doubled in the first quarter of 2021. It said prices have continued to increase in the second quarter with spot prices up “over 10% since April 1.”
Array said that steel makes up almost half of its cost of goods sold. And because it does hold large inventories, “a significant increase in the price of steel over a short period of time can negatively impact our results.”
The company said it was passing through higher commodity and shipping costs to customers, fixing commodity prices with suppliers, entering into long-term contracts with freight providers, further diversifying its supply base, and increasing order lead-times to give it more time to procure raw material.
Senior executives at Canadian Solar said during a early June webinar that they believed polysilicon prices have peaked, and that speculation that had been driving up prices is no longer having a significant impact. The executives stopped short, however, of saying when they thought poly prices might ease.
In its first quarter earnings call, Canadian Solar said the price of polysilicon had tripled over the past 12 months. The company mitigated the impact in part by raising module prices, which it said saw a “near double-digit percentage increase” compared to the fourth quarter. The company also said it prioritized margins ahead of shipment volumes.
The SEIA-WoodMackenzie quarterly market report said that average system prices remained relatively stable from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021, despite the supply chain and logistics constraints. The impact from these bottlenecks had not yet fully made its way into system prices as of Q1. Important raw material inputs to the solar supply chain include steel, aluminum, and copper.

Price increases for manufacturers may not be felt immediately by customers due to time lags in procuring equipment and long-term supply agreements. Further, manufacturers may still be estimating how much of these price increases they want to pass along to the customer, and how much they decide to absorb.
As a result, in Q1 2021, system pricing fell both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter across all market segments. System pricing fell quarter-over-quarter by 1.1%, 2.9%, 3.7% and 3.6% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.
Impacts from commodity price increases and equipment delays vary by market segment, the report said. For example, the effects on distributed solar have been “more muted.” The report said that “a few additional cents per watt in module costs represent a relatively small percent increase” in total costs for residential and commercial installers. And many developers have work pipelines strong enough to accommodate a few weeks’ delay in equipment deliveries.
The report warned that “compounding cost increases across all materials are just beginning to affect installers.” Developers of distributed solar-plus-storage projects have started to report months-long installation delays stemming from constrained battery supplies.
