The prices of solar modules in all technological classes were lowered slightly again at the end of 2023. This is probably the last time this will happen over the long term and only affects in-stock items already in Europe.
PV modules that first have to be shipped or are still traveling by sea are already being offered by many suppliers at prices that are between €0.01 ($0.01)/W and €0.02/W higher. The reason is ongoing tensions in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Houthi militants have been attacking merchant ships there for weeks, preventing them from entering the Red Sea and transiting through the Suez Canal. Many shipping companies will avoid the region – the key trade route between Europe and Asia – until the conflict, which is related to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, is resolved.
The alternative route circles the southern tip of Africa and is about 6,000 kilometers longer. The costs of transporting a container from China to Rotterdam have already almost tripled. The fact that module prices have not risen further is only due to the fact that demand remains somewhat contained at the moment.
In Germany and central and northern Europe, lower demand is mainly due to the ongoing cold wave and the uncertain political situation in some countries. In Poland, for example, the newly elected government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk has not yet become operational due to continuous interruptions and protests by members and supporters of the old government. 
If we look back at the forecasts for 2023, expectations for a drop in PV component prices starting in the second half of the year have been fulfilled. In the case of modules, the price decline has been even faster and more severe than even experts could have imagined. Thanks to the fall in the costs of PV installations, high installation figures were also achieved in the second half, especially in the small installations sector in Germany, although demand had decreased significantly compared to the previous year.
At least in the first three quarters, the backlog that still existed for many installers was cleared. Overall, construction of new PV capacity in Germany increased by almost 100%, from 7.5 GW to more than 14 GW.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited reduction in bureaucracy announced by German politicians, especially for the construction of larger PV parks, has not yet materialized, which has somewhat slowed down new construction in the commercial and utility sectors. The rapid drop in module prices has also caused a wait-and-see attitude, and the completion of some projects has been postponed to the future. There is currently little talk of a bottleneck in the installation market, but old problems could resurface at the end of the year, as soon as the market recovers.
Many offers from last year currently have to be adjusted downwards, as PV components have become cheaper and competition has intensified. Even for small- and medium-sized complete installations, not all excessively high prices should be accepted uncritically and without negotiating the price.
The improvements in favor of an accelerated expansion of renewable energies that the ruling coalition government has long expected in Germany are summarized in the so-called “Solarpaket 1,” which should have been approved at the end of 2023. However, it was postponed until the current year due to the budget debate, with the exception of three new regulations that mainly affect wind energy.
If the amendments to the law as presented are approved at the end of January, capacity will increase. The regulations provide for the granting of the right to lay cables (landowners must grant operators of renewable energy systems a right of way if necessary to be able to lay a connection cable from the system to the connection point to the network), priority will be given to the construction of ground-mounted systems in disadvantaged areas, so that less high-quality arable land has to be used. The category “special solar installations” will include floating PV, photovoltaics on wasteland sites, parking lots, agricultural photovoltaics. Repowering for self-consumption on rooftops will be allowed beyond technical defects or damage to the modules.
With component prices currently at historic lows, this opens up considerable additional sales potential for suppliers.

An eager grad student recently asked me, “How do you handle all the seemingly bad news for solar and difficult pathways to get it all done?” I have a simple answer: you just have to be willing to run through a few brick walls.
Having recently attended the second annual AgriVoltaics Europe conference, in Amsterdam, I am realizing that the United States has run through enough brick walls with regards to agrivoltaics in the last three years to almost be caught up with Europe, at least in terms of policy.
The United States has responded tremendously to agrivoltaics in recent years. There is now a 1.3 GW agrivoltaic array in northern Indiana, in New York state, which will deliver its first specialty crop array in 2024 and the Shines program, in Illinois, has more than 50 projects which are choosing to include agricultural production within half of their arrays. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) says that there is nearly 6 GW of agrivoltaic generation capacity operating in the United States, ranging from solar panels on grazing pasture to crop fields. In Amsterdam I was unable to get a concrete answer about how many megawatts of agrivoltaic capacity there is in Europe and the United Kingdom, so kudos is due to the NREL for aggregating the data at a national scale for the United States.
I would expect the small-scale, “distributed generation” programs in Illinois, New Jersey, and Maryland alone to increase their generation capacity by a gigawatt over the next 18 months and there are many more gigawatts in the pipeline at the utility scale.
In Europe, there may be more specialty-crop and commodity-crop installations but countries in the European Union are still struggling along without an overarching definition of agrivoltaics. This is leaving nations to develop their own definitions and to do more work than necessary to develop technical specifications. The United States is in a similar spot but has an opportunity to clarify the definition of agrivoltaics at the federal level through the cross-party Baldwin-Grassley Protecting the Future of Farmland Act. At Lightstar, we are hopeful that a definition of agrivoltaics will be included in the 2023/24 Farm Bill. A definition would supercharge the agrivoltaics market in the United States and streamline many questions that remain at a local level.
Europe is dealing with an increasing energy cost burden and there is a similar position in the United States because both markets still rely on a natural gas supply that is deeply vulnerable to political and economic unrest. One remark that stood out at the AgriVoltaics Europe conference was, “the end of incentives for solar in Europe is here.” That reality is driving more off-the-shelf racking to be deployed and such projects don’t look dissimilar to many configurations already used in the US utility and distributed-generation markets. I was consistently told by attendees in Amsterdam that the opportunity to scale agrivoltaics further lies in momentum, in the United States, for using two-in-portrait solar panel configurations, although, Italy did just approve €1.7 billion ($1.84 billion) in incentives for agrivoltaics.
That will go a long way because Italy maintains flexible design standards and will award incentives to projects that are a minimum of 6 ft 8 in off the ground. The height of two-in-portrait arrays in the United States is typically at least seven feet. Italy is incentivizing smart solar design without increasing materials costs dramatically.
Obviously the United States has more farmland than Europe but the fact remains that each US state is land constrained because of the finite amount of electric grid interconnection capacity and productive farmland.
It was also incredibly helpful to see large European energy companies such as RWE and EDF doing distributed-generation projects in northern Europe – that region has the same solar yield as the middle of Quebec. With our more generous solar yields, south of Canada, we know that we can grow food and produce solar at the same time. In fact, we can do it at scale. That is, provided the industry and local decision makers have sufficient courage.
The United States has utilized the last 15 years of research built up in Europe to correctly size agrivoltaics for the United States market. In my final presentation at the conference in Amsterdam, I joked that Europe may have started it but we’ll do it faster – and bigger. That’s the American way.

Lithium metal batteries could offer far better energy density and much lower weight than lithium-ion technology thanks to the replacement of heavier graphite with lithium metal as anode. However, one of the biggest challenges in the design of these batteries is the formation of dendrites on the anode’s surface, causing the battery to rapidly degrade, short, and even catch fire.
Researchers at Harvard John A. Paulson SEAS have developed a new lithium metal battery that withstand at least 6,000 charging cycles and can be recharged in a matter of minutes.
Their research not only describes a new way to make solid state batteries with a lithium metal anode but also offers new understanding into the interface reaction between lithium and materials at the anode in these type of batteries.
“Lithium metal anode batteries are considered the holy grail of batteries because they have ten times the capacity of commercial graphite anodes and could drastically increase the driving distance of electric vehicles,” said Xin Li, Associate Professor of Materials Science at SEAS and senior author of the paper. “Our research is an important step toward more practical solid-state batteries for industrial and commercial applications.”
In 2021, Li and his team offered one way to deal with dendrites by designing a multilayer battery that sandwiched different materials of varying stabilities between the anode and cathode. This multilayer, multi-material design prevented the penetration of lithium dendrites not by stopping them altogether, but rather by controlling and containing them.
In the new research, Li and his team stop dendrites from forming by using micron-sized silicon particles in the anode to constrict the lithiation reaction and facilitate homogeneous plating of a thick layer of lithium metal.
In this design, when lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode during charging, the lithiation reaction is constricted at the shallow surface and the ions attach to the surface of the silicon particle but do not penetrate further.
“In our design, lithium metal gets wrapped around the silicon particle, like a hard chocolate shell around a hazelnut core in a chocolate truffle,” said Li.
These coated particles create a homogenous surface across which the current density is evenly distributed, preventing the growth of dendrites. And, because plating and stripping can happen quickly on an even surface, the battery can recharge in only about 10 minutes.
The researchers built a postage stamp-sized pouch cell version of the battery, which is 10 to 20 times larger than the coin cell made in most university labs. The battery retained 80% of its capacity after 6,000 cycles, outperforming other pouch cell batteries on the market today, the reserchers reported in Fast cycling of lithium metal in solid-state batteries by constriction-susceptible anode materials published in nature materials.
The technology has been licensed through Harvard Office of Technology Development to Adden Energy, a Harvard spinoff company cofounded by Li and three Harvard alumni. The company has scaled up the technology to build a smart phone-sized pouch cell battery.
Li and his team also characterized the properties that allow silicon to constrict the diffusion of lithium to facilitate the dynamic process favoring homogeneous plating of thick lithium. They then defined a unique property descriptor to describe such a process and computed it for all known inorganic materials. In doing so, the team revealed dozens of other materials that could potentially yield similar performance.
“Previous research had found that other materials, including silver, could serve as good materials at the anode for solid state batteries,” said Li. “Our research explains one possible underlying mechanism of the process and provides a pathway to identify new materials for battery design.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/16/solarapp-speeds-solar-permitting-for-more-than-160-communities/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 16, 2024",SolarApp+ speeds solar permitting for more than 160 communities,"With solar permitting one of the bottlenecks to the buildout of clean energy across the U.S., Solar Automated Permit Processing Plus (SolarApp+) is helping local communities streamline the process.
SolarApp+ was released in 2021 by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). The free web-based platform was developed for the purpose of lowering the costs and timeframe associated with solar permitting, and is said to cut about 12 days off the permitting process. The software has been approved for both solar photovoltaic systems and battery energy storage. 
“SolarAPP+ ensures solar projects meet code requirements, enhancing safety while significantly shortening cycle time and accelerating the trajectory towards our climate goals,” said Mark Rodriguez, executive director of the SolarAPP+ Foundation, which is responsible for SolarAPP+’s long-term stewardship.

When launched, the DOE set a goal of having 600 communities using SolarApp+ by 2023. And while actual use has fallen far short of that goal, the 160 communities that are using it have approved more than 32,800 projects, saving more than 33,000 hours of permitting staff time without sacrificing safety or code compliance.
“We are very proud of the impacts SolarAPP+ has had,” said Jeff Cook, SolarAPP+ Program Lead at NREL. “The rapid adoption by local governments across the country proves that safe, automated permitting is not only possible, but delivers immense benefits to local governments, homeowners,  and contractors. We encourage all communities to consider piloting SolarAPP+ to see what it can do for you.”
By accelerating the permitting process, SolarAPP+ is playing a role in helping the U.S. meet its goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035. Local governments can learn more about SolarApp+ here.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/01/16/solar-season-slows-wind-power-rises/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,COLORADO,MONTANA,SOUTH DAKOTA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 16, 2024","Solar season slows, wind power rises","The Energy Information Administration (EIA), a division of the U.S. Department of Energy, released its Electric Power Monthly report for the first ten months of 2023. The data shows consistent growth in solar power, supported by high installation volumes in 2023, and a notable increase in wind power output toward the end of the year.
PV Intel data indicates that from January to October 2023, solar power accounted for 5.78% of U.S. electricity, an increase from 4.98% during the same period the previous year. This marks a 16% increase in solar power generation over the previous year.
During the rolling twelve-month period, (November 2022 to October 2023), solar generation contributed to 5.36% of the U.S. total electricity, rising from 4.63% in the previous October. This also represents a 16% increase, over a somewhat different time period.

Source: PV Intel
In another perspective, for October alone, solar power’s share of total generation held just above 6%, and is expected to decline, similar to the 29% decrease observed in 2022.
If 2023 concludes with an estimated 16% increase in solar generation, it would be the second-lowest growth year since 2018, which saw only a 15% increase. This modest growth in 2018 was essentially a hangover following the boom in 2016, which saw a remarkable 53% growth over 2015. Assuming a steady 16% growth rate, 2023’s solar generation is projected to reach approximately 5.46%. However, this figure could be slightly higher, taking into account the significant capacity of solar installations deployed as the year progresses.

Source: PV Intel
Despite achieving 5.78% so far in 2023, the rate is expected to decline during the winter months. For example, in October 2022, solar generated 4.98% of all U.S. electricity, but by year-end, this figure had dropped to 4.7% due to decreased generation in November and December, which coincides with the year’s shortest days.
Fortunately, this decrease in solar output aligns with an uptick in wind generation. As shown in the graph above, when solar output decreases in November and December, wind generation starts to increase, peaking in March. In October, wind and solar combined produced 16.78% of U.S. electricity generation.
October also saw several states achieving remarkable growth in solar generation compared to the previous year. South Dakota, for instance, experienced an extraordinary surge with a 3,605% increase in solar generation. Montana also saw a significant rise of 398%. These dramatic increases were largely due to the commissioning of large, utility-scale solar installations, which dwarfed the states’ existing solar capacities.

Source: PV Intel
Most states registering high growth in solar generation started from a baseline of less than 2% of their electricity derived from solar. This low starting point means that even the addition of a single large facility can have a significant impact on its overall solar output. However, states like New Mexico, Colorado and, to a lesser extent, Delaware, have experienced growth from higher base percentages. For example, Colorado’s solar generation grew by 49% due to the commissioning of seven utility-scale solar facilities, including two major plants with capacities of 325 MWac and 248 MWac.

Source: SEIA
It is important to note that monthly data can sometimes include anomalies that may affect its reliability. For instance, a recent decrease in jet stream activity on the West Coast led to lower moisture levels, affecting areas from California to New Mexico and the Midwest. As a result, irradiance levels were 10% higher than usual in October.
With more than 30 GW of solar power expected to be deployed in 2023, the EIA’s 860-M form, known as the “Monthly Electric Generator Inventory,” is especially active. In October alone, the document reports that 36 utility-scale solar power facilities were commissioned, adding a substantial 2,466 GWac of capacity.
