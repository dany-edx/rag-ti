Alongside NEBS, Agilitas will also acquire two operational ISO-New England (ISO-NE) merchant battery systems and one front-of-the-meter battery system in Maine, all totaling 25 MWh in capacity. The two merchant batteries were commissioned as the first continuous storage systems in Maine, while the front-of-the-meter battery system in Rumford, Maine, achieved commercial operation today, clocking in at 5 MW/10 MWh.
This acquisition marks Agilitas Energy’s expansion into battery energy storage operations, including participating in the ISO-NE day-ahead and real-time energy markets, operating reserve markets, frequency regulation market, and the forward capacity market. One of the three systems also serves as a peak load reducer for a municipal electric company alongside participating in ISO-NE’s wholesale marketplace.
Elsewhere in New England, Agilitas has begun pre-construction work on what is expected to be the largest stand-alone battery energy storage project in Rhode Island, a 3 MW/9 MWh lithium-ion system in Pascoag. Including that project, Agilitas is developing 300 MW of solar and energy storage projects throughout the Northeast, including 46 MW of storage and 40 MW of utility scale solar under construction in Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island. All of that capacity is expected to go online in 2022.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/03/carbon-capture-expansion-a-key-action-in-achieving-net-zero-emission-goals/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 3, 2021",Carbon capture expansion a key action in achieving net zero emission goals,"IHS Markit’s Clean Energy Technology analytics team says the next 30 years will need to see a doubling of large-scale carbon capture capacity every five years.  
The recent influx of decarbonization policy targets is generating a pipeline of new carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects. IHS Markit said there are 23 large-scale projects under construction, financing and design that may double CCUS capacity by 2026.  
CCUS technologies capture and compress carbon dioxide from power generators or industrial facilities, and store it underground, or deliver it for other applications.  
The technology, which is still considered to be in a nascent stage, is projected to reduce between 4% to 20% of global carbon emissions by 2050. That means CCUS will need to grow at record rates to hit these targets, the firm said. 
CCUS projects have encountered difficulties in becoming operational in the past decade. Sixteen large-scale projects have gone live, and 20 have been cancelled. Around 75% of current operational capacity is categorized as large-scale. IHS said a lack of regional carbon storage regulation and high capital costs stymie growth.  
The IHS Markit team said that one potential solution to the high-cost problem of CCUS is industrial clustering. Localized networks of industrial emitters with shared storage and transport infrastructure will benefit from economies of scale, they said. Other growth drivers are expected to come from increased awareness of CCUS and expanded capture policies, as well as from technological innovation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/03/solar-and-wind-gain-prices-fall-as-pjm-auction-secures-future-capacity/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 3, 2021","Solar and wind gain, prices fall as PJM auction secures future capacity","PJM Interconnection said that renewables, nuclear, and new natural gas generators saw the greatest increase in cleared capacity as part of the regional grid operator’s annual capacity auction. Coal units saw the largest decrease.
This year’s auction procured 144,477 MW of resources for the period June 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023, at a total cost of $3.9 billion. The auction produced a price of $50/MW-day for much of the PJM footprint, compared to $140/MW-day in the most recent auction in 2018. Prices were higher in some regions due to transmission limits.
Grid operator PJM said that solar and wind resources “significantly increased” their capacity contribution. A total of 1,728 MW of wind cleared in the auction, representing an increase of 312 MW over the previous capacity auction. Solar increased by 942 MW over the previous capacity auction, with 1,512 MW clearing.
These capacity values represent a total capability of these resources to provide as much as 11,761 MW (nameplate) into the PJM system.
The PJM capacity auction, called the Base Residual Auction, procures power supply resources in advance of the delivery year to meet electricity needs in the PJM service area, which includes all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, and includes around 65 million customers.
Auctions are usually held three years in advance of the delivery year. The 2022/2023 auction was originally slated for May 2019, but was postponed as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission considered new capacity market rules, specifically the Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR).
The total procured capacity in the auction represents a 19.9% reserve margin.

Nuclear generators cleared an additional 4,460 MW when compared to the last auction. Coal generators, meanwhile, cleared 8,175 fewer megawatts.
The total procured capacity in the auction represents a 19.9% reserve margin, compared to a 14.5% required reserve for the 2022/2023 delivery year.
PJM said that in five areas–ComEd, Duke Energy Ohio & Kentucky, the Mid-Atlantic Area Council (MAAC) region, Eastern MAAC region, and Baltimore Gas & Electric (BGE)–capacity prices were higher than the overall PJM price.
For ComEd, the price was $68.96/MW-day; for Duke Energy Ohio & Kentucky, the price was $71.69/MW-day; for MAAC, the price was $95.79/MW-day; for Eastern MAAC, the price was $97.86/MW-day; and for BGE, the price was $126.50/MW-day.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/03/solar-101-the-obvious-and-not-so-obvious-state-solar-incentives/,"POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 3, 2021",Solar 101: The obvious… and not so obvious… state solar incentives,"The next step in our Solar 101 series is to look at state-level incentives that can make a big difference in your project’s financial prospects.
Multiple revenue streams affect the payback period of a solar power project. We’ve already discussed three of them: savings from electricity generation, federal tax credits, and net metering. Soon, we’ll show how these revenue streams combine to cover the $21,000 average cost of a solar power project.
If you live in a state without solar incentives, then this article might apply less to your project. For example, while California offers net metering and produces more solar electricity than any other state, it doesn’t offer a specific solar incentive. Similarly, there are no incentives offered by the “Sunshine State” of Florida, nor for the Longhorns down in Texas.

Those three states are the largest in the country, totaling 90 million of the 328 million people in the country, according to the U.S. Census website. If you’re one of those 90 million, you can still use the tools outlined in this article.
For example, many cities offer their own solar incentives and renewable energy loans, not to mention important legal protections. And of course, all states are still eligible for federal-level solar incentives.
You can explore the tools available in your home state several ways. The first – and most important – is to communicate with your contractor. Your contractor will know your incentives well, because it’s their job to show a project’s best financial return on investment.
A second tool – often challenging to navigate – is your electricity utility’s website. As you work through the installation process, you might have to access the website to download or submit documents. Reading through and interacting with your utility’s web resources is time well spent, as it provides valuable information about local laws and procedures. Keep in mind that some states, like Massachusetts, share their solar incentives on a government website instead of a power company website.
A third – and the best tool to learn about your state incentives, in this author’s opinion – is the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIREusa.org). This is the same tool we used to research your state’s net metering laws.

The DSIRE team published a high level map above, along with an article that summarizes the many laws; however, because there are so many solar incentive laws around the country, it’s difficult to put all the information into one image.
Keeping that complexity in mind, let’s do a quick walkthrough on how to find the information that matters for your solar project.
Once these steps are complete, you should see a list of solar-focused incentives and laws that apply (mostly) to residential solar power. Clicking on these individual links will give you detailed information on the topics, including links to applicable legislation.

Take a moment to examine all of these incentives and laws thoroughly. Keep in mind that many of them are not standard “incentives.” For example, Massachusetts offers a “property tax exemption.” In Florida, homeowner associations may not stop you from installing solar power. And in Colorado, there’s no sales tax on residential renewable energy installations.

After you focus on solar related laws and incentives, return to step #1 (above), and browse through the energy related laws in your state. Some states offer electric vehicle incentives, heat pumps, lighting, efficiency, and other clean energy-related support.
And one final pitch for the DSIRE team. If you are a solar professional looking for a simple, centralized document of all laws related to solar, energy storage, and/or electric vehicles , check out the  DSIRE Insight informational package. It is delivered in PDF and spreadsheet format that allows for fast browsing.

Formed in 2013, the group is an association of owners, operators, developers, suppliers, and investors supporting policies and regulations that promote microgrid deployment.  
MRC calls for a level playing field, market access for microgrids, and compensation for services. The group says that microgrids offer proven technologies that are safe, reliable, and clean alternatives to traditional resources like backup diesel generators.  
Customer-driven decarbonization is a key element in accelerating the adoption of renewable energy, according to MRC. The nonprofit said it supports a regulatory environment that fosters business model creation and innovation in which microgrids can operate in concert with the larger grid. MRC said that microgrid development leads to local job creation and small-business growth. 
A microgrid is a localized energy system that can operate together with the larger grid or disconnect from it and operate autonomously. MRC suggests that because of this independence, microgrid deployment will provide resiliency during storms or other crises where the main grid is not supplying power. 
Industry leaders from ENGIE North America, Schneider Electric, Bloom Energy, and operators including Princeton University, among others comprise the group. In 2016, MRC was integrated into the International District Energy Association (IDEA). MRC uses IDEA platforms for communications, conferences, education, and to accelerate MRC growth. MRC then re-invests net proceeds from IDEA-backed conferences back into advocacy for the industry.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/03/genius-award-for-a-student-designed-portable-solar-carport/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 3, 2021",Genius award for a student-designed portable solar carport,"A student from New College of Florida, Antonia “Toni” Ginsberg-Klemmt, won a $10,000 OZY Genius Award for what she calls Gismo Power, a mobile solar carport with an integrated electric vehicle charger.
Ginsberg-Klemmt’s Gismo Power is a foldable solar carport that’s entirely mobile and can be folded for storage in a garage, in the event of a hurricane or any other extreme weather occurrence. In operation, the appliance can fit up to 24 solar modules on its frames, which can be angled or lowered depending on the position of the sun at any given time.
(Like our coverage? Sign up for our free daily newsletter.)
The appliance also utilizes a SolarEdge Inverter/EV charger. This is connected to a 50ft extension cord, which serves as the plug for the Gismo Power to connect to the grid.
The OZY Genius Award is a $10,000 prize awarded to 10 college students pursuing “projects or ideas that have a positive impact on society.”

According to Ginsberg-Klemmt, the idea to create a portable solar EV charging carport came from the recognition that her school’s campus had no EV charging stations on the residential side, and as a way to avoid getting in an uncomfortably hot car after a long day of classes.
Because Gismo Power doesn’t have an attached battery system, the appliance must be connected to the grid, so it does not waste the electricity being generated when not charging a vehicle. While on the grid, however, the system acts just like any rooftop solar installation, sending excess generation back to the grid and paying for itself via net metering.
Ginsberg-Klemmt said that the decision not to include a battery at this point in time was decided by a desire to not increase the final price of a Gismo Power unit. She said she sees the unit as a generation solution for renters or members of homeowners associations that are solar averse, as well as people who may want to invest in rooftop solar, but do not have a suitable roof or have one that would need extensive repairs/modifications to host a system.
As of now, Ginsberg-Klemmt owns the only Gismo Power prototype, although she is working to construct a more powerful version for New College of Florida. Once that project is complete, Ginsberg-Klemmt plans on beta testing a handful of systems before pursuing any manufacturing or commercial scale. She estimates that the system would cost around $20,000, but that may not be reflective of the final price after beta testing.
Ginsberg-Klemmt is also pursuing OSHA & UL certification and generic permitting for the first grid-tied electrical appliance to generate electricity. This process includes improvements to electric code compliance and usability improvements. Once those benchmarks have been achieved and commercial scaling becomes a reality, Ginsberg-Klemmt plans to produce a “startup series” of 10-100 units, while also starting the “Gismo Power Factory,” a manufacturing facility.
And if Ginsberg-Klemmt’s name rings a bell, you may remember her father who took Florida Power and Light to the state Supreme Court over the denial of a petition to improve the net-metering regulations in the Sunshine State.
Taking a page from her father’s book, Ginsberg-Klemmt said that Gismo Power gives potential customers the opportunity to avoid the permitting and approval process that can bog down residential solar installation times.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/03/florida-town-decides-to-gut-net-metering/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 3, 2021",Florida town decides to gut net metering,"In a fairly unprecedented move, Green Cove Springs, a town in Florida has passed an ordinance to halve the net metering rate that solar customers receive.
In the vast majority of net metering cases, any changes to compensation are made at the state level, with cities, especially cities with a population under 10,000 like Green Cove Springs, seldom taking the responsibility into their own hands.
As it stands, the ordinance lowers customers’ net metering export credit from the current rate of eight cents per kWh to four cents per kWh. Local solar advocates have denounced the ordinance, saying that lowering the credit will throw current customer payback calculations into disarray and will dissuade others from investing in solar down the line.
According to local press, the city of Green Cove Springs’ representative to Florida Municipal Power Agency’s (FMPA) Board of Directors and Executive Committee addressed these arguments by sharing the opinion that solar incentives, at the local, state, and national level, should be removed altogether.
The representative, who is not affiliated with FMPA backed this claim by citing the amount of land required for projects, waste and emissions related to mining, and concerns over decommissioning procedure as aspects of solar that citizens have to “turn a blind eye to,” despite the first and third points not applying to rooftop solar.
In response, FMPA has shared with pv magazine that city representative’s opinions regarding renewable energy are not reflective of the views and opinions of FMPA, adding that the agency strongly supports renewables and is looking to bring more on-line.
As it stands now, the ordinance only applies to Green Cove Springs, though there are concerns among local renewable energy advocates that the decision could create a domino effect where other neighboring towns follow suit by stripping away their incentives.
EDIT 6/3/21: This article has been amended to clarify the relationship between the city of Green Cove Springs’ representative to FMPA’s Board of Directors and Executive Committee and FMPA, as the original article referred to the representative as an employee of FMPA. We apologize for the error.

The company said the repayment of the 2021 convertible bond, in addition to the repayment of a CEDA loan in the second quarter, reduces its recourse debt and improves its expected return on invested capital. It said that its balance sheet now provides flexibility to allow it to capitalize on growth opportunities, including expanding its residential market footprint.
A bill that could potentially cripple California’s residential solar market failed to pass the State Assembly in a vote on June 2. It could come up for a reconsideration vote on Thursday.
The bill, AB 1139, would make major changes to net metering in the state. Its author, San Diego Assembly member Lorenza Gonzalez, said that subsidizing solar owners raises rates on others, which she calls unfair.
The bill has gained nationwide attention and is broadly opposed by solar and clean energy advocates.
The California Solar and Storage Association said it was pleased that the Assembly rejected AB 1139, which it called a  “utility profit grab bill.” The association said the legislature “saw through the smokescreen of negativity” as an effort by the state’s investor-owned utilities to “change the rules in their favor” so they can “profit off the energy created by solar consumers and eliminate a growing competitor in the energy market.”

Monolith Materials said it received new investments from investors led by South Koreas-based SK Inc. and including NextEra Energy Resources and Perry Creek Capital. This round included additional investment from Azimuth Capital Management, Cornell Capital, and Warburg Pincus.
Olive Creek 1 in Hallam, Nebraska is Monolith Materials’ first commercial-scale production facility designed to produce approximately 14,000 metric tons of carbon black annually along with “green” hydrogen.
Monolith said it plans to collaborate with SK on expanding global markets and work with NextEra on North America growth opportunities.
Monolith Materials was founded in 2012 and developed a process technology that uses renewable energy to convert natural gas into hydrogen and a solid carbon material called carbon black, a raw material in the automotive and industrial sectors. The company is currently in the operating stage of its first commercial-scale production facility in Nebraska. The company recently announced its plans to produce ammonia at a second-phase production facility nearby.
In January, SK invested about $1.6 billion in Plug Power, a provider of hydrogen fuel cell and fueling solutions, and specified its partnership to enter the Asian hydrogen market.
Bakken Energy and Mitsubishi Power Americas signed a partnership agreement to develop a “blue” hydrogen hub in North Dakota. It would include facilities to produce, store, transport, and consume hydrogen, and would be connected by pipeline to other hydrogen hubs being developed across North America.
Blue hydrogen is derived from natural gas with the carbon dioxide emissions captured and sequestered.
Bakken Energy is working with Basin Electric Power Cooperative and its Dakota Gasification unit on the potential redevelopment of the Great Plains Synfuels Plant near Beulah, North Dakota. The goal is to make the facility one of the largest producers of blue hydrogen in North America. The project is in due diligence, and specific details are confidential until that phase is complete.
The synfuels plant has been buffeted in recent years by low natural gas prices. Last fall, Basin Electric’s directors approved a 10-year forecast that projected net losses of about $63 million at the synfuels plant for each year of the forecast. The index that Basin uses to sell natural gas indicated prices below $3/dekatherm through 2026. Pricing for urea, ammonia, and diesel exhaust fluid also were forecast to be flat, impacting the plant’s product output.
Meanwhile, revenues for the plant during the forecast period averaged $452 million annually, around $60 million less than was forecast in 2019. About 70% of the plant’s revenue comes from products other than natural gas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/03/ihsm-clean-energy-insights-high-module-prices-and-shipping-costs-jeopardize-2021-installation-outlook/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 3, 2021",IHSM clean energy insights: High module prices and shipping costs jeopardize 2021 installation outlook,"IHS Markit currently maintains its 181 GW installation forecast for 2021. Our down case scenario for 2021 is 156 GW (down case still 9% growth Y-o-Y) with demand spill over to 2022 and uneven impact of higher costs across different markets.
The current environment poses a significant threat, but it is too early to tell what the consequences will be since the solar industry has faced other crisis before (e.g. COVID-19 in 2020) and showed extreme resilience and continued growth despite all challenges.
The price on module raw materials started to rise in July 2020 and has significantly impacted module costs from Q4 2020. Market expectation was that production costs would decline from the second quarter of 2021, dropping module quote prices, but we have seen just the opposite. The supply chain is experiencing further price peaks for some materials in Q2 2021 including polysilicon, copper, or steel, among others. The rise of raw materials is putting additional pressure on module makers who are only passing part of this higher cost into customers and adjusting utilization rates to control the rise of materials due to an overheated market.
In this high-price PERC environment, we are seeing a revival of demand for multicrystalline BSF, a technology that was being phased out, and that has seen its demand and prices increase in some utility markets (e.g. India, Middle-East) and even in C&I applications. The IHS Markit view is that this increase in demand and prices for BFS multi is a short-lived phenomenon triggered by extraordinarily high PERC prices and multi will continue its phasing out in 2022, remaining a product for some niche markets due to lower efficiencies.
While the trade imbalance between China and Western markets is not a new phenomenon, the rapid surge in goods demand in Western markets from very low demand during lockdowns to high demand during relaxations of COVID-19 restrictions and reopening of economic activity has caused serious challenges to logistics. Freight costs have increased 3-4 times in the last 3 quarters for shipments from China to Europe or the Americas and IHS Markit projects the situation will not dramatically improve this year.
This is a global phenomenon that is impacting all industries (semiconductors, automotive, consumer electronics…). The most recent IHS Markit global survey of manufacturers found that the stretching of supply chains in the last quarters has extended delivery times to the highest level in more than 20 years of data availability with delays being most pronounced in Europe, United States, and Taiwan. Solar PV is one of the most impacted due to the high concentration of manufacturing in China. Freight costs and long lead times might challenge solar project completions in 2021, delaying projects to 2022. Higher freight costs are also impacting other system components like trackers, which are a high-weight and low-value component, with final impact on total system CAPEX.
In this high-price environment that started in Q3 2020, international developers are putting off procurement in the hope that equipment and freight prices will be lower in 2022. Extreme volatility in raw materials, module prices and freight costs are not helping manufacturers nor developers to close contracts whose terms change on a weekly basis.  Given long lead times, if procurement is delayed beyond the summer, the risk to the 2021 installations outlook will become a reality.
In previous years, if demand slowed down around the summer and inventories grew, this triggered a price decline that quickly reactivated the procurement process. This year, however, even if inventories start growing and manufacturers would be willing to scarify margins, this would still have a small impact on the total module cost for a developer. Module costs for a developer will still be high due to the unchanged high cost of freight that will remain flat or could even increase in the second half of the year with the reactivation of economies in Europe and the United States.
High component and high freight costs are having a direct impact on CAPEX and project IRRs, which is expected to continue in H2 2021. This could be the first year where global average solar CAPEX might not decline after major Y-o-Y reductions in the last decade. Although developers are trying to delay procurement as much as possible, there is a significant part of the project pipeline under PPA contracts or schemes that require completion in 2021. In some cases, developers are accepting lower IRRs than originally forecast. In others, EPCs might decide to pay penalties for project delays – which could represent a lower cost than proceeding with building on time in the current price environment. The final decision depends on a variety of factors (company type, contract terms, possibility to lower other CAPEX contributors, etc) and cannot be generalized.
IHS Markit forecasts that Europe and India are the regions that are at a higher risk of underperformance. Europe faces the highest risk of being the most impacted by high component pricing, costly shipping, and long lead times since regional market growth hinges on the progression of the highly sensitive utility-scale segment and many contract negotiations and shipments are now paralyzed. The US market is at a lower risk since it is less price sensitive, but it is also being impacted by long-lead times and the surge in freight costs and higher prices that could push some project completion to 2022.
Finally, despite a low-connection first quarter, mainland China—unburdened by shipping challenges—should stay on course to grow on a Y-o-Y basis. However, IHS Markit remains cautious that additional module price increases, some recent bidding prices reached higher than 1.70 RMB/W, could put at risk the 2021 installation forecast that is strongly skewed to the second half of the year.
