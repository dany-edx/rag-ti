In Q4 2021,  the report outlines that commercial sector installation capacity dwarfed residential installation capacity by a ratio of 3 to 1, with solar development especially concentrated in Public Service Enterprise Group territory. For the calendar year 2021, New Jersey’s largest residential solar developers were Vivint Solar (acquired by Sunrun), Trinity Solar, and Vision Solar. In the commercial sector, EnterSolar led the pack, followed by Distributed Solar Operations and Smart Citizens LLC. Community solar development was led by Solar Landscape, Altus Power, and CEP Renewables.
From Q3 to Q4, the state saw a massive spike of new solar projects turn into a significant dropoff in installed capacity, igniting concerns of a potential, long-term downward trend.
One of the chief reasons cited for this potential downturn is a familiar foe: interconnection backlogs. All of New Jersey falls under PJM Interconnection, and PJM recently proposed a two-year pause on reviewing interconnection requests for its eastern US regional transmission network, as the operator looks to work through its more than 1,200 energy project backlog, with most of these projects being solar and many being in New Jersey.
In a recent survey, nearly 90% of renewable developers surveyed by LevelTen said that interconnection timelines and costs represented the biggest barrier to achieving 40% solar by 2035, a goal of the U.S. Department of Energy. New Jersey itself has a goal of achieving 37% solar power across the state by 2050.
The news is not all doom and gloom, however, and a series of legislation and renewable programs passed and enacted in 2021 are providing hope that the Q4 2021 downturn will just prove to be a blip on the course to greater renewable adoption.
The study firstly cites the state’s A3352, signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy on November 9, which requires all new warehouses in the state to be built as solar-ready buildings. The law defines a warehouse as any building 100,000 square feet or larger primarily is used to store goods for resale, and now new warehouses built on or after July 1, 2022 will need to be optimized for solar.
The report also points to this past fall’s decision by state regulators to transition the two-year-old pilot community solar program to permanent status. Regulators awarded 78 MW across 45 projects during the pilot program’s first year, exceeding a 75 MW goal. While the pilot required that at least 40% of all approved projects reserve at least 51% of their capacity for low- and middle-income households, all of the approved renewable energy projects met that goal.
Year two of the pilot program doubled the amount of capacity, with the 150 MW available. It carried the same carve-out for low- and middle-income customers. The program was modified as regulators looked to reduce time and costs for developers to enroll customers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/24/doe-deep-dives-into-strategies-to-solve-clean-energy-supply-chain-issues/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",DOE deep dives into strategies to solve clean energy supply chain issues,"Supply chain problems helped drive up the cost of solar power equipment last year, but are expected to ease in 2022, according to analyst Wood Mackenzie. The U.S. Department of Energy is examining the issues surrounding the overall clean energy manufacturing supply chain, and recently published “America’s Strategy to Secure the Supply Chain for a Robust Clean Energy Transition”. The strategy is part of a US government approach to chart a course for revitalizing the economy and domestic manufacturing by securing the country’s most critical supply chains.
Today, the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) released seven deep-dive assessments of clean energy manufacturing supply chains. Each of the seven assessments, one of which is solar, focuses on a different technology or resource that will help the Biden Administration achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
“The transition to a clean energy economy cannot proceed without a steady supply of the materials and components required to manufacture clean energy products,” said Kelly Speakes-Backman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for EERE.  “The assessments released today highlight the wealth of opportunities that will come with domestic supply-chain expansion, including new jobs, new manufacturing infrastructure, and faster, cheaper deployment of clean energy technologies.”
The deep dive into how to achieve leadership in the solar PV supply chain makes the case that the US is the second largest global PV market and that developing US photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing could mitigate global supply chain challenges and benefit the climate as well as US workers, employers, and the economy. Significant growth can be stimulated by incentives that offset the higher cost of manufacturing in the US, and the assessment points out that existing polysilicon production facilities can focus on producing solar-grade polysilicon. And it details other areas of the supply chain that are ripe for expansion from ingot to wafer to thin film and silicon cell manufacturing.
With domestic solar production costs about 30 to 40% higher than off-shore, the assessment acknowledges that companies will need financial support and suggests that costs and benefits should be equitable, social responsible and sustainable.
Specific strategies for executive action and recommendations for Congressional action to spur domestic manufacturing include:
• Enact legislation to provide tax incentives to support domestic manufacturing, including incentives for building new facilities and for the
ongoing operation of those facilities. Silicon ingot and wafer production should be prioritized.
• Enact legislation to encourage domestic solar adoption and deployment. Extend and revise credits for clean energy deployment, such as the
Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to provide stronger incentives for solar projects that support domestic manufacturing and increase family-sustaining jobs.
• Coordinate trade policy across the US government to create fair conditions for the US solar industry and its workers.

The company was incubated at Energy Impact Partners, a global investor in sustainable energy transition.
Aspen also entered into agreements to develop or acquire 48 community and distributed solar projects totaling over 200MW across California, Maine, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania. The company said it connects its services to consumers and businesses across all income levels and hard-to-reach property types.
The company originates its own projects and partners with local developers to accelerate deployment. “We look forward to innovating with our key stakeholders as we develop and finance distributed generation solar, storage, and electric vehicle charging projects during this critical climate decade,” said Jorge E. Vargas, Managing Partner at Aspen Power Partners.
Late in 2021, the Biden administration set a target to power 5 million US homes with community solar projects by 2025. This represents a 700% increase in current capacity. In New York, a framework of 10GW of distributed solar by 2030 was initiated by Governor Kathy Hochul.
The Aspen team brings over $1 billion in renewable energy project financing experience, with expertise across development, construction, and asset management disciplines. It was founded by Scott Delaney, David Berv, Dan Gulick, Jackson Lehr, and Jorge Vargas.
Energy Impact Partners
Aspen’s incubator, Energy Impact Partners (EIP), has made over 80 investments exceeding $2.5 billion in the energy decarbonization transition. The company estimates its work thus far will save over 2.8 MT of carbon emissions.
Image: Form Energy
EIP notably invested in Form Energy, the Boston-based startup that develops long-duration grid-scale iron-air batteries. The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air and create rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
Form said the batteries can store electricity for 100-hour durations at full systems costs competitive with active power plants. At full-scale production, Form said the modules would deliver electricity at one tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.
(Read: “Multi-day iron-air batteries reach commercialization”)
EIP is also an investor in Enchanted Rock, a microgrid deployer, Arcadia, a community solar platform, and Urbint, an AI-backed energy management company.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/24/where-renewable-energy-policies-are-working/,"MARKETS & POLICY,NET METERING,POLICY,CALIFORNIA,MASSACHUSETTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",Where renewable energy policies are working,"According to the Community Power Scorecard, released by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), four states lead the country in renewable energy policies: California, Massachusetts, New York, and Illinois.
The 2022 edition of the Community Power Scorecard grades each state on whether its energy policies give individuals, cities, and communities the choice to build clean energy wealth locally, rather than relying on utilities. The scoring is based on a compilation of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, DSIRE, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, PACENation, SolarReviews, and Vote Solar, as well as the data the ILSR tracks on community solar, community choice aggregation, and state legislative changes in general.

State policies that contributed to higher scores include customer-friendly net-metering policies, interconnection rules that encourage distributed renewable energy, allowing for community choice in energy sources, letting communities set energy efficiency codes, and the ability for cities to negotiate utility franchise contracts and fees.
In the 2022 Community Power Scorecard, 4 states excelled, 9 states and the District of Columbia saw above average scores, 9 were average, 15 were mediocre, and 13 states received failing grades.
“Many cities have ambitious climate or community resilience goals, but their path forward is limited by state policy. When states remove barriers and provide innovative policy options, communities can make decisions that maximize local benefits in the transition to clean energy,” said Maria McCoy, ILSR Research Associate and lead author of the Community Power Scorecard.
How the top four earned the grade
California and Massachusetts both got an A, scoring 40 out of 44 points. Both states support community-choice aggregation, community solar, solar/storage mandates, third party financing, and net metering (although California’s net metering policy is in peril). California also allows cities to start PACE financing programs and set more stringent building codes.

New York also received an A, with a score of 38 out of 44 points. New York enables community choice aggregation and has a community solar program.
Illinois received an A, with a score of 37 out of 44. The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) boosted Illinois’s grade to an A this year, and CEJA
established a stretch building energy code for cities to adopt.
Who failed?
Louisiana, Kentucky, Idaho, and South Dakota all received a grade of F. Louisiana scored only one point out of 44, finishing last, again. (It has been last or tied for last since 2019.) Kentucky scored three points total. In 2021, state legislators passed a bill that will undercut net metering: solar generation will not offset energy use and is compensated at a sub-retail rate. Idaho scored one point higher than Kentucky because it has an acceptable net metering policy and it preempts communities from banning gas hookups. South Dakota received four points–a bit better than Louisiana and Kentucky because it doesn’t lose points for poor interconnection standards or preempting gas bans.
Along with a comprehensive ranking of all 50 states, the Community Power Scorecard highlights state leaders in 9 geographic regions of the country.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/24/plans-finalized-for-lithium-extraction-project-in-arkansas/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,ARKANSAS",TIM SYLVIA,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",Plans finalized for lithium extraction project in Arkansas,"Standard Lithium and its strategic partner, LANXESS Corporation, have come to terms on an agreement that Standard Lithium asserts will streamline and expedite the development of the first commercial lithium project in Arkansas, which is to be constructed at an operational Lanxess facility in El Dorado, in the southern portion of the state.
The lithium deposit that Standard Lithium is targeting stretches in an arch-like shape from north Texas to the Florida Panhandle, all located 6,000-7,000 feet below the surface. The area is reportedly larger than the Permian Basin, an oil-and-gas-producing area located in West Texas and the adjoining area of southeastern New Mexico.
According to the agreement, Standard Lithium will control all development of the project leading up to and including the completion of the Front End Engineering Design study. Standard Lithium will hold, at a minimum, a 51% majority equity stake in the project and will also retain 100% ownership of its South West Arkansas Project, another proposed lithium extraction facility, and all intellectual property related to that venture.
Lanxess will, via a series of commercial agreements, provide the brine supply for the project, the project site lease, rights of way, infrastructure, and other services for the project. In return, the company will have the right to acquire some, or all of the lithium carbonate off-take produced at the commercial plant.
In a prepared statement, Standard Lithium CEO, Robert Mintak, revealed that the company plans to have a feasibility study for the El Dorado site completed by the end of 2022.
Harnessing the vast quantities of lithium deposits in Arkansas has become a part of national plans to evolve and decarbonize the energy and transportation industry. DOE and the Biden administration have identified the need to establish a secure end-to-end battery materials and technology supply chain that supports long-term U.S. economic competitiveness, equitable job creation, and national security, and lithium provides a pathway for part of that chain.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/24/dhl-deploys-solar-on-its-fleet-trucks/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",DHL deploys solar on its fleet trucks,"Shipper DHL Express announced it plans to deploy solar panels on 67 of its delivery trucks in an effort to cut fuel use and limit carbon emissions. The company said the TRAILAR solar arrays will reduce CO2 emissions by 1000 kg per vehicle.
The solar array will be used to charge the truck’s battery, power lift gates and other ancillary services. This reduces load on the system’s alternator, reducing the fuel use of heavy-duty trucks.
“We’re aiming to improve the lives of people where they live and work, using cleaner pickup and delivery solutions – such as electric vehicles and cargo cycles, and now augmenting our truck fleet with this innovative solar solution,” said DHL Express U.S. CEO Greg Hewitt. “This is another strategic step in our drive forward to decarbonization, and over time reducing all logistics related emissions to net zero by 2050.”
Transportation is estimated to contribute 21% of global emissions, and road travel accounts for three-quarters of transport emissions. Most of this comes from passenger vehicles, which contribute 45.1%. About 29.4% comes from trucks carrying freight, so about 6.1% of global emissions share comes from ground shipping.
The TRAILAR system is equipped with telematics for detailed reporting on the entire system, including battery health, ancillary equipment charge, and overall fuel savings. It continuously manages the battery through a charge controller, maintaining optimum battery levels even when the truck is off. This constant care of charge level reduces wear on the battery and alternator, directly lowering vehicle maintenance costs.
The company said it has implemented the solution within many of its fleet operations at business units that operate in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Last May, the company announced an accelerated roadmap to the decarbonization of its operations, which involves an Opex and Capex investment of $7.8 billion over the next ten years.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/24/reclaiming-power-as-a-buyer-in-a-tight-pv-module-market/,"GUEST POST,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",Reclaiming power as a buyer in a tight PV module market,"For nearly two decades, I’ve watched the solar market cycle from boom to bust and back as government policies and new technologies disrupt the PV module supply chain. The industry has grown in spite of ongoing uncertainty. But at what cost? When demand for modules is high and supply is constrained, buyers believe they are at the mercy of their suppliers. They often accept whatever is available instead of the equipment they want.
Every quarter, PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) teams up with Exawatt to assess PV module market conditions and inform buyers for our joint report, the Solar Technology and Cost Forecast. We anticipate continued supply chain challenges in 2022 for three primary reasons:
#1 Raw materials
Raw material shortages and cost increases reduce product availability and increase prices. While the sky-high polysilicon prices observed in 2021 will finally peak and fall, we expect them to remain above 2019/2020 levels. High silver prices mean manufacturers will aim to use less silver for cell solder pad metallization. Some will use less silver required than is required for reliability. Limited cost-effective silver supply could also stunt the production of high-efficiency cell architectures such as TopCON and heterojunction.
#2 Trade policy
Trade restrictions related to forced labor concerns and import tariffs increase the risk of delayed deliveries and limited module availability. In late 2021, several major Chinese manufacturers entirely ceased module shipments to the US. We anticipate US buyers will look further to non-China supply in 2022.
Manufacturers will respond with new manufacturing capacity in India, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The US should see a flurry of new factories announcements if Congress passes climate legislation currently under consideration, particularly the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. New factories, especially in regions that lack a trained PV manufacturing workforce, are more likely to experience quality issues as production ramps and employees are trained.
#3 Shipping
Although trans-Pacific shipping rates have dropped from their September 2021 peak, ports remain congested. New COVID variants have tempered expectations for significant near-term rate declines.
Buyers will start underwriting shipping costs when manufacturers refuse delivered duty paid (DDP) contracts that guarantee all-inclusive prices for modules delivered to the project site. Increased lead and shipping times and less certain delivery timeframes are also likely.
The market is already responding to these trends. In 2022, I expect large-scale PV module buyers to expand procurement from so-called “2nd tier” manufacturers, source from new factories, and accept bills of material (BOMs) with unfamiliar components. To be clear, these are not best practices – they are compromises on quality for the sake of project execution.
The good news
While many aspects of today’s tight market are beyond the control of PV module buyers, they can still take action to safeguard quality. Instead of waiting for module issues to become operational problems that reduce revenue, they can act to prevent and isolate quality issues while the cost of fixing them is relatively low. These are the five most important quality controls when procuring PV modules in a constrained market:
1.Leverage PVEL’s Product Qualification Programs (PQPs) for Technical Diligence
Many lesser-known manufacturers produce high-quality PV modules, but not all.  PVEL’s PQPs are rigorous performance and extended reliability tests that help buyers validate products for procurement. Reports are available at no cost to downstream project stakeholders. Buyers should contractually require that the PV module factory and BOM matches products tested in PVEL’s PQP.
2. Conduct Production Oversight
Buyers can require a third party to oversee production for their projects. When an objective observer from a credible inspector like PI Berlin is on-site, quality control issues are less likely to occur. Issues are transparently recorded if they arise. The process allows PV module buyers to ensure manufacturers keep commitments to utilize specific materials or quality controls.
3. Test PV Modules in the Field Upon Delivery
Independently testing PV modules in the field as they are removed from containers helps buyers determine if damage occurred in manufacturing or shipping. PVEL visually inspects and EL images PV modules in the field to identify cell defects, microcracks, and other issues.
4. Test PV Modules in the Lab Upon Delivery
Batch testing, or lab-testing a random sample of PV modules produced for a project, allows buyers to retroactively assess product quality before field issues arise. If serial defects or quality control problems are revealed, buyers can pursue warranty claims and other contractual remedies.
5. Require Contractual Remedies
No matter how high the price, buyers have the money – and that is a form of power. Limited product availability does not prevent buyers from mandating commercial remedies for quality problems in supply agreements. These remedies can include discounts, the provision of additional spares, expanded warranty terms and even product replacements based on test results.
The big picture
The solar market is cyclical. Buyers have less power than vendors today, but this dynamic is certain to reverse before too long. There are always benefits from PV module diligence, but it is especially important when supply constraints make certain procurement risks unavoidable. With transparent data about the equipment they purchase, install, and operate, asset owners can realistically predict the energy yields, revenues and maintenance requirements of their assets over time.

The Center made the request in a letter to commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and in comments in a FERC proceeding. Rooftop solar advocacy groups Vote Solar, Institute for Local Self-Reliance and Solar United Neighbors signed on to the letter.
It is “common” among utilities to charge ratepayers for “hundreds of thousands, and even millions, of dollars” of utility dues to the industry association Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the Center said in its comments. In one example, the Center said that EEI ran a multi-day training session for utility executives to learn how to defeat state and local clean energy policies, citing research by the Energy and Policy Institute. EEI has an annual budget of about $90 million.
The Harvard Electricity Law Initiative said in comments to FERC that EEI has “opposed net metering rules or bills through social media campaigns that have targeted people in Maine, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Kentucky.” In Arizona and Michigan, the Initiative said, utilities have “more directly funded campaigns against various net metering proposals, or have primed the public to oppose policies favorable to rooftop solar.”
Also submitting comments supporting a change in FERC policy were the attorneys general of Michigan, Massachusetts, and Virginia, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission, said attorney Jessica Bell on Twitter.
FERC initiated its proceeding to seek comment on the recovery and reporting of industry dues and expenses, in response to a March 2021 petition from the Center for Biological Diversity.
EEI and three other trade associations “simply declined to respond” to the “specific questions” FERC had asked them in the proceeding, said Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard’s initiative, on Twitter.
If FERC made the rule change requested by rooftop solar advocates, investor-owned utilities could still fund anti-solar advocacy, but only at the expense of their shareholders, not their customers.
Of FERC’s five commissioners, currently three are Democrats and two are Republicans.
