A vote was to be held on August 17, but after hearing the concerns of residents who wanted to support clean energy in their town, the Granville Town Council decided to delay the vote.
Councilmember Laura Mickelson said the town expects to make a decision later this year, and the Council is currently engaging with solar industry members and citizens to build a plan that better supports the town’s transition to clean energy.
As solar has gained in popularity in the town, the Council set out to create a formal set of building codes and regulations that would help retain the historic character of the village. The initial public hearing led to two concerns being raised by citizens related to glare and solar on one-story buildings. These concerns led to a ban of solar installations on one-story buildings and installations that were deemed to cause glare.
Solar advocates pushed back on these ideas in the August hearings, arguing that glare is a subjective phenomenon that would be difficult to regulate. Plus, glare from solar panels is significantly lower than other common surfaces like steel, glass, and water. After all, the point of solar panels is to capture sunlight, not reflect it.
As for the single-story restriction, solar advocates found this to be far too prohibitive, and not representative of the personal desire of its residents. Jeremy King, a Granville resident and director of sustainability at Denison University determined the village is home to 1,589 structures, 535 of which are single-story homes. Another 154 are deeded as one-and-a-half stories. Over one-third of buildings would therefore be banned by the original draft of the ordinance.
A revision to the ordinance is now underway. Sustainability experts Power Clean Future Ohio are advising alongside interested residents. The cohort is actively researching other midwestern towns’ solar policies. While the visual aesthetic impact of solar panels was codified in the original draft, the new draft is instead focused on safety.
“Aesthetics is not a criteria,” said resident Ken Apacki, “Trying to decide if something looks nice is too hard, too vague. We need to look more at physical measures that regard safety.”
Apacki and his cohort aim to advise a new ordinance that eliminates ambiguities for applicants seeking permit approval from the Commission. Specifically, the cohort seeks changes like not requiring Commission review if panels don’t face the street and enabling streamlined permitting of residential ground-mounted systems.
Village manager Herb Koehler said it goal of the new ordinance, expected to be released to the town this year, will try to find a balance between the historic quality of the area while supporting sustainability goals.
“We hope that Granville will focus on becoming a solar community,” said resident Carol Apacki. “People should be encouraged to do so. We need to become a more resilient community with the looming threat of climate change.”
The story of Granville, Ohio is an example of how advocacy at the local level can make a significant impact on the buildout of clean energy. The Department of Energy offers resources and training for boosting solar power in your community.

The CyberForce Competition, led by DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory part of DOE’s CyberForce Program, focuses on developing the next generation of cyber defenders, which DOE says are in short supply. DOE estimates that unfilled cybersecurity careers will reach over 1.8 million by 2022.
“Cybersecurity is critical in the energy sector as our systems become increasingly interconnected and complex,” said Puesh Kumar, director of DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER). “Preparing the cyber professionals of the future is as important as improving the technology we use to protect our infrastructure. The CyberForce competition is an unparalleled opportunity for students to gain real-world experience as they test their cybersecurity skills to protect energy infrastructure.”
Cyber threats have become more commonplace in recent years. For example, in February, thousands of internet users in Europe lost service when a satellite operator experienced a “cyber event”. The same attack also knocked nearly 6,000 wind turbines offline in Germany and Central Europe, with a combined output of 11GW. In the same month a hacker breached a water treatment plant in the U.S. and a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May led the company to shut the pipeline down temporarily and saw people panic-buying gas into scarcity across the Southeast.
The potential damage to rooftop solar, batteries and other distributed energy resources is also real and growing, according to a recent DOE report. DERs now total 90 GW of capacity in the U.S.,and are expected to grow to 380 GW by 2025, the report said.
Past cyberattacks on renewable generation indicate the risk of attacks on DERs, said Meg Egan, a control systems cybersecurity analyst with the Idaho National Laboratory, in a recent DOE cybersecurity webinar. Three nations are capable of cyberattacks, as are criminal groups, she said, noting 10 cyberattacks on large-scale renewable generators or renewables firms since 2019 worldwide.
This year’s competition, held last week both virtually and in person in Illinois, capitalized on the expertise of current national laboratory staff that had previously hosted four successful cyber defense competitions. The competitions involve interactive, scenario-based events, where participants engage in cybersecurity activities including methods, practices, strategy, policy, and ethics.
In this year’s scenario, students were charged with helping the EV manufacturer secure the systems of its recently acquired solar installation. When the installation appears compromised, the students must assess its vulnerabilities and develop a series of innovations to protect and strengthen it against existing and future attacks.
The competition uses realistic components, such as cyberphysical infrastructure, lifelike anomalies and constraints, and actual users of the systems who engage students in compelling emergency scenarios. Participants are scored on their “out-of-the-box” and innovative ideas and defenses, which stem from the real-world constraints provided in the scenario. One such constraint, for example is “no budget,” in which participants develop a working defense using zero dollars and ensuring that the system’s intended purpose is not deprecated.
The competition is managed by the DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER), with Argonne as the lead national laboratory providing leadership, planning and subject matter expertise. In addition, DOE national laboratories Idaho National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories are partnering with Argonne to provide technical support.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/08/50-states-of-solar-incentives-tennessee/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 8, 2022",50 states of solar incentives: Tennessee,"Tennessee is home to utility Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a government-owned utility that is famous for waging historic landmark court cases against the proliferation of clean energy. There is a distinct lack of support for distributed rooftop solar for small and medium businesses and homeowners. Instead, the state’s small solar exposure is largely characterized by large-scale projects built for corporations in pursuit of environmental and social governance goals (ESG).
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), serves 10 million people across an 80,000 square mile territory in the southeast U.S., extending beyond its home state borders. The company stated goals of targeting up to 10 GW of solar by 2035, and more than 200,000 EVs on roadways by 2028. The utility expects to have about 2.8 GW of solar in TVA operation by 2024.
However, the company’s 2021 sustainability report disclosures reveal that TVA owns only 1 MW of operable solar capacity and reports no ownership of wind energy assets, as of the FY 2021 report. TVA instead has developers play the role of owner-operator, so that they can access the federal investment tax credit incentive, an option that TVA, as a government entity, cannot access.
While TVA released a request for proposal (RFP) this summer for up to 5 GW of new clean energy, much of it is expected to be nuclear energy and hydropower, which already represents a large part of the utility’s asset base. TVA currently has 5.38 GW of renewable energy capacity, nearly all of which is hydropower.
(Read: “Lawsuit challenges TVA’s anti-solar ‘never-ending contracts’ with its utility customers”)
TVA said its Green Invest program has led to nearly $3 billion in solar investments since 2018. A large driver of growth in this program is through contracts with large corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook), and others.
In total, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said Tennessee has 608 MW of installed solar capacity through Q2 2022. The state employs over 4,000 people in solar, and there has been an estimated $918 million in solar investment in the state, said SEIA.
Incentives
Tennessee does little to support the buildout of distributed, rooftop solar, which is hailed as a solution for increased grid resilience, improved environmental impacts, and bill savings for individuals and small businesses.
Currently, the state does not offer net metering, or the buyback of excess solar production, which is often critical to the economics of rooftop solar. It also has no standardized rules for interconnecting a rooftop system with the electric grid. TVA instead offers a program called dual metering, which is explained in the graphic below.
Tennessee has a solar easement law, which protects a homeowner’s right to have open access to the sun on their roof, preventing others from constructing objects that shade panels.
While most states allow solar to be property tax-exempt, instead caps the amount that can be taxed. The assessed value increase of your property for tax purposes may not exceed 12.5% of your installed costs for solar. It also exempts sales taxes for equipment and materials purchased by commercial and industrial customers.
The most support for solar will be found at the federal level. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) was just extended long-term and added a direct payment provision. The ITC provides a 30% credit for the cost of the installed system.
Landmark project
The 150 MW Elora Solar project, which was led by NextEra Energy Resources, marks one of the largest solar installations in the state. The project reached commercial operations in May, 2022. Construction of the 500,000 panel system lasted 17 months and created approximately 250 jobs.
The project was in partnership with Facebook to power operations at Meta’s datacenter hub in northwest Huntsville, Tennessee, northwest of Knoxville.
“TVA is building a greener future that leaves no one behind in the new clean energy economy,” said Doug Perry, TVA senior vice president of commercial energy solutions. “This public-private relationship demonstrates the strength of TVA’s community energy model to attract high-quality jobs into the communities we serve while helping businesses meet their sustainability goal.”

Richmond, California-based SunPower reported on Tuesday a more than 63% year over year increase in financial performance, with Q3 revenue increasing to $470 million from $414 million in Q3 ‘21, while net income increased to $139 million from a $73 million net loss in Q3 ’21.  Like other residential solar companies, SunPower continues to see more customers turning to solar as U.S. retail energy prices continue to escalate by 14.3% year over year through August.
For its fiscal year 2022 guidance, SunPower reiterated plans to conclude the year with 73k to 80k customers, while generating $90 million to $110 million in net income.
SunPower highlights
With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the solar ITC credit boosted to 30% through 2032, SunPower pointed to the serviceable market for residential solar expanding by 40 to 50 million homes with SEIA and Wood Mackenzie projections citing 7.3 GW of incremental installed capacity to be added on from 2023 to 2027, the equivalent of 900,000 new homes with solar systems.
SunPower cited additional market tailwinds from the IRA, including a 30% new standalone energy storage ITC credit starting in 2023, as well as ITC adders for single-family leases or PPA and multi-family residences, as new sources of customer accretion for the company.
SunPower shares traded at $16.86 today, down from $31.87 a year ago, for a market capitalization of $2.94 billion.

The requirements could involve standards, best practices, and procedures for testing and analysis.
The DOE initiative, which also encompasses cybersecurity for large-scale solar, is known as “Securing Solar for the Grid.” A DOE report on the topic calls for the distributed energy resource (DER) industry to engage in such discussions.
As deployment of rooftop solar, batteries and other DERs increases, the potential damage from a cyberattack on DERs also increases, says DOE’s report. DERs now total 90 GW of capacity in the U.S., and are expected to grow to 380 GW by 2025, the report said.
Past cyberattacks on renewable generation indicate the risk of attacks on DERs, said Meg Egan, a control systems cybersecurity analyst with the Idaho National Laboratory, on the webinar. Three nations are capable of cyberattacks, as are criminal groups, she said, noting 10 cyberattacks on large-scale renewable generators or renewables firms since 2019 worldwide.
In two potential scenarios of a cyber attack, an attacker could use ransomware to take control of multiple DERs, or could use a supply chain attack on an aggregator, or on another party that sends directions or updates to DERs, to influence the operation of the DERs.
In two other scenarios, a “botnet” could infect enough DERs with malware to enable the attacker to create unanticipated power swings on the grid, or a “worm” could spread from one DER to a higher-level distributed energy resource management (DERM) system, which could then send a false command to many DERs and instigate power instability.
To be resilient against attacks, DER systems “should be designed, built and operated by means of an enforced zero-trust model,” where data and commands are validated “using cryptographically secure mechanisms informed by standards, testing and vulnerability assessment,” said the DOE report. A key step toward that goal, the report said, is to publish and implement DER cybersecurity guidelines being developed as IEEE Standard 1547.3, once that standard is finalized.
DERs are increasingly participating in stabilizing regional grids and ensuring reliability, said the DOE report. This role of DERs is the result of both the smart inverter standard known as IEEE 1547-2018, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 2222 that opens wholesale markets to aggregated DERs. Yet the two-way capabilities that enable DERs to help support the grid also open opportunities for cyberattacks, the report said.
Guohui Yuan of DOE said that both states and FERC will have a role in adopting DER cybersecurity standards.
The DOE report is titled “Cybersecurity considerations for distributed energy resources on the U.S. electric grid.” DOE said it would post the webinar slides on the report’s landing page.
