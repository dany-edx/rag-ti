After three years of sequential price increases each quarter, PPA contract prices declined 1% from Q1 to Q2, 2023. Solar PPA prices have increased 25% year-over-year in Q2.
“While 1% is a small change, this is the first time since Q1 of 2020 that we’ve seen the market-averaged continental solar PPA price decrease,” said Gia Clark, senior director of strategic accounts at LevelTen Energy. “It’s a promising indication that conditions are starting to stabilize.”
Developers have been challenged by inflation, supply chain complexity, rising interest rates, and regulatory uncertainty over the last few years. Despite these issues, the industry is a year removed from the Inflation Reduction Act passage, and developers are beginning to incorporate benefits from the legislation into their strategies.

Increased mobility in the solar supply chain is also likely contributing to the Q2 solar PPA price trends, said LevelTen. Over 12 GW of PV modules crossed the border into the U.S. during Q1 2023 alone, compared to only 29 GW imported during all of 2022, reported Wood Mackenzie.
Meanwhile, wind PPA prices continue to climb due to low supply, rising 13% in Q2.
“As a result of permitting and interconnection issues, fewer wind projects are entering the market compared to solar,” said Clark.
However, LevelTen expects wind demand to resume. “Repeat buyers are looking to wind to diversify their portfolio, and those with hourly matching targets rely on wind to generate clean electricity when solar can’t.”
In the first half of this year, LevelTen Energy tracked 11.9 GW of clean energy capacity contracted via PPAs in North America, setting 2023 on track to beat the 22.5 GW signed in 2022.
There is a tidal wave of demand for clean energy on the horizon, not only from corporations, but also from utilities and retail electricity providers. The market share of electric vehicles continues to grow both for personal use and in fleet adoption, artificial intelligence is putting new demand on data centers, and green hydrogen producers will require carbon-free electricity at all hours. It will be increasingly difficult to find clean energy projects that have obtained interconnection approval. Corporations need to act now to secure PPAs that will help them reach their emissions reduction targets, before competition becomes even more fierce.” Gia Clark, senior director of strategic accounts, LevelTen Energy.
Clark said that while it is encouraging to see a calming in PPA prices, it is unlikely that price trends will fall significantly. Instead, Clark expects incremental levelizing with occasional declines.
Prices across regions remained flat, except for ERCOT, which raised 14% due to regulatory uncertainty.
“Regulatory threats during Texas’ 88th legislative session created an environment of profound uncertainty for developers, pushing up prices. While the worst proposals failed, this session made clear that the opponents to renewable energy have a strong influence in Texas,” said Clark.
LevelTen reports PPA pricing based on the P25 metric, which represents the 25th percentile of prices. All pricing data reported are based on developer contract offers, not transacted PPA prices.
“This quarter’s price stabilization after years of increasing prices make now a good time to procure,” said Clark. “It’s still a competitive environment, so buyers are most likely to succeed if they move quickly. LevelTen is committed to developing innovative ways for more clean energy deals to get done faster.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/18/fracking-enables-record-power-and-flow-rates-for-geothermal-pilot-project/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NEVADA",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 18, 2023",Fracking enables record power and flow rates for geothermal pilot project,"Fervo Energy successfully completed a well test at its full-scale commercial pilot, the results of which, the company says, confirms the commercial viability of Fervo’s drilling technology.
The pilot project, Project Red, took place in northern Nevada over a period of 30 days. The test achieved a flowrate of 63 liters per second at high temperature that enables 3.5 MW of electric production, setting new records for both flow and power output from an enhanced geothermal system, said Fervo.
Fervo drills its geothermal wells using fracking technology employed by the oil and gas industry. The company reports that it is the first to successfully drill a horizontal well pair for commercial geothermal production, achieving lateral lengths of 3,250 feet, reaching a temperature of 191 C, and proving controlled flow through rigorous tracer testing.
“By applying drilling technology from the oil and gas industry, we have proven that we can produce 24/7 carbon-free energy resources in new geographies across the world,” said Tim Latimer, CEO and co-founder of Fervo Energy.
Fervo said the pilot was completed without creating any seismic activity, having implemented an induced seismicity mitigation protocol following best practices established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The company said its next horizontal well pair is expected to achieve more than double the power output of the pilot design.
In 2021, Google partnered with Fervo because, according to Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, they saw significant potential for Fervo’s geothermal technology to unlock a critical source of 24/7 carbon-free energy at scale. Google said it intends to power its cloud region datacenter in Las Vegas with the geothermal resource.
“Achieving our goal of operating on 24/7 carbon-free energy will require new sources of firm, clean power to complement variable renewables like wind and solar,” said Terrell.
Fervo’s results from Project Red support the findings of the DOE Enhanced Geothermal Earthshot and show that geothermal energy could supply over 20% of energy needs in the U.S. and complement wind and solar to reach a fully decarbonized grid.
The DOE’s Enhanced Geothermal Shot aims to dramatically reduce the cost of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) by 90%, to $45 per megawatt hour by 2035. DOE estimates that investments in EGS can unlock affordable clean energy for over 65 million American homes and exponentially increase opportunities for geothermal heating and cooling solutions nationwide.
“Power systems modeling confirms that geothermal can be a critical player in a fully decarbonized grid,” said Jesse Jenkins, assistant professor and leader of the Zero-carbon Energy Systems Research and Optimization (ZERO) lab at Princeton University. “Fervo’s successful commercial pilot takes next-generation geothermal technology from the realm of models into the real world and starts us on a path to unlock geothermal’s full potential.”
Fervo recently broke ground on its first greenfield development in southwest Utah, adjacent to the DOE’s Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE). Revenue and learnings from Fervo’s Utah project will go toward the development of other projects in new geographies.
In conjunction with the announcement, Fervo is hosting research and industry partners for the inaugural Fervo Energy Technology Day on July 19 in Houston to present findings from the project and explain their implications for accelerating the deployment of next-generation geothermal power.

The projects are expected to add enough capacity to power the equivalent of 70,000 homes in the state.
Dominion is procuring more renewable energy resources as it moves towards its goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The utility serves over 2.8 million customers in Virginia.
“We’re invigorated by our ability to help Dominion move forward with a slate of projects in its home state of Virginia that reduces its carbon footprint and helps get the industry closer to achieving net zero,” said Mark Noyes, chief executive officer of RWE Clean Energy, a subsidiary of RWE AG.
The portfolio is comprised of projects in development, construction, or commercial operations in Virginia:
In addition to the utility-scale projects, RWE Clean Energy signed an additional eight distributed energy resource power purchase agreements with Dominion, combining for 24 MW of capacity. 
RWE Clean Energy operates a renewable energy installed capacity of 8 GW, making it among the largest in the nation. The company’s significant presence in renewables is due in part to its acquisition of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses in March 2023. The transaction was valued at $6.8 billion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/18/patent-violation-by-standardization-judge-tosses-tigo-lawsuit/,"BUSINESS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 18, 2023",Patent violation by standardization? Judge tosses Tigo lawsuit,"On June 28, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California delivered a mixed ruling: “DENIED in part and GRANTED in part,” on the infringement claims that Tigo Energy lodged against the SunSpec Alliance.
Tigo Energy had accused the SunSpec Alliance of infringing on its patent rights by creating an industry standard for a “rapid shutdown system” for solar panels. However, the court ruled that Tigo’s three patent infringement claims were not applicable to the SunSpec Alliance or its very broad membership as a result of third parties using the standards. The rationale was that SunSpec does not manufacture the products under contention, which include inverters, optimizers and rapid shutdown devices.
However, the ruling narrowly defined two limitations. First, it is applicable exclusively to SunSpec, excluding any manufacturers of products certified by the SunSpec Alliance; this implies that such manufacturers could be found in violation if they utilize these patents. Second, SunSpec Laboratories, which produces and tests potential SunSpec-certified rapid shutdown hardware, could potentially face liability if it were proven that they had manufactured units infringing on the patent.
In a previous filing concerning 11 patents, nine were ruled in favor of Tigo, while two were in SunSpec’s favor. Included in the nine was U.S. Patent No 8,933,321, which Tigo alleged was being violated in this lawsuit.
The order outlined Tigo’s three arguments:
The court disagreed with SunSpec’s argument that it did not engage in activities that encourage infringement when it came to SunSpec’s laboratory partners. The motion points out that the plaintiff has alleged that SunSpec instructed the laboratories to perform tests using the patented technology, which can be seen as an affirmative act to induce infringement. The fact that the laboratories pay a fee to SunSpec was a key element in the argument.
In its concluding statements of the ruling, the court stated:
Tigo’s infringement claim may proceed under each of the theories of liability identified above: literal infringement, infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, and induced infringement. But those theories are only adequately pleaded as it relates to the theory that SunSpec-affiliated laboratories’ use or make the claimed systems. To the extent that the claim relies on other alleged acts by SunSpec members, customers or solar panel installers, they have not been sufficiently alleged.
The SunSpec Alliance certified product page is a “who’s who” of hundreds of hardware products that are certified under the standard from some of the industry’s largest companies.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/18/the-benefits-and-challenges-in-expanding-local-clean-energy/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 18, 2023",The benefits and challenges in expanding local clean energy,"In a recent report by the Institute for Local Self Reliance (ILSR), local clean energy is defined by resident involvement in every aspect of energy, from decision making through benefitting from cost savings and use of clean energy.
The report, Advantage local: Why local energy ownership matters, offers examples of local clean energy that include rooftop solar systems that are owned or leased by the homeowner as well as community solar.
Data from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that host-owned systems made up about 65% of residential capacity installed through 2020, and that number has grown rapidly since then. Community solar made up less than 1% of installed projects at that time, but this sector is growing rapidly as well, especially as states increasingly pass supportive policies.
Some of these advantages of local clean energy include cost savings, job creation, local wealth creation, community decision making, energy justice, and support for renewables, along with promoting social change.
One of the most direct benefits of owning one’s own solar installation, the report says, is the energy savings, estimated to be an extra $12,000 compared to third-party ownership. But residents can save even more by being a part owner and subscriber to a community solar installation, with lifetime savings estimated at an extra $14,000, compared to third-party ownership.
Job creation is another strong benefit to the local community. Solar installations offer direct positions in construction and maintenance of the project as well as direct and indirect roles in development, supplies and retail, legal services, accounting, and financing, the report states.
As an example, the report points to the analysis of community wind projects in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Texas conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in 2009, which found that local ownership was associated with greater local employment impact (including direct, indirect, and induced jobs) than absentee ownership.
The NREL study concluded that the studied locally owned wind farms created 1.1 to 1.3 times more jobs per megawatt than hypothetical absentee-owned wind farms during the projects’ construction phases and 1.1 to 2.8 times more jobs per megawatt during the operations phases. The study concluded that greater local clean energy ownership boosts the local economy and that “policies that promote local ownership could increase community economic impacts, such as local employment”.
The community decision making involved in local clean energy projects is another key benefit. According to the ILSR report, local clean energy enables a myriad of community members to take part in decision making. Community residents understand local needs, and can take into consideration local siting, meeting diverse needs (such as low income), and solving unique local problems. An added benefit is that local ownership can help promote supportive policies and thwart public backlash that has sidelined clean energy projects in some areas.
Community solar has benefits for residents across all incomes, and therefore serves as a form of energy justice—bringing clean energy to all. The shared ownership model of community solar means that households are protected against financial risk and they can “go solar” with no upfront costs, as opposed to putting solar on one’s own roof. An example of sharing community solar with all can be seen in Duluth Minnesota’s Lincoln Park neighborhood’s recent installation of a 37 kW solar garden that serves its low-income residents.
While the ILSR report expounds upon the many advantages of local clean energy, report authors call on policymakers to move for more change. “There are a number of key policies that legislators and regulators, especially at the state level, must adopt to make many locally owned clean energy projects feasible in the first place.”
One example of enabling legislation is virtual net metering, which the report authors consider an essential piece of policy support that brings clean energy benefits to all residents. The report also calls for federal, state, and local governments to pass legislation in the form of improved tax incentives, direct grants, accessible financing, and reformed securities regulations. While it points to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act as making important progress, the authors see a need for expanded grant options that would replace or supplement clean energy tax credits, and they call on state and local governments to create grant programs as well.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/18/high-voltage-mini-solar-panel-converts-laser-light-into-electricity/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 18, 2023",High-voltage mini solar panel converts laser light into electricity,"From pv magazine global
A group of scientists led by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has designed a monocrystalline mini solar panel that can convert laser light into electricity.
“This technology is inexpensive as it is silicon-based and uses the same processes used for terrestrial cells such as TOPCon devices relying on silicon oxide passivating contacts,” the research’s lead author, Paul Stradins, told pv magazine. “The module is composed of poly-Si/SiO2 passivated contact minicells. These minicells offer remarkably low contact resistance, suitable for high suns operation.”
In the paper “High-voltage monocrystalline Si photovoltaic minimodules based on poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts for high-power laser power conversion,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the scientists explained that the panel may be used, for example, in applications such as wireless data transmission in special environments or energy transmission in medical implants, among others.
The multijunction mini panel is designed with silicon oxide (poly-Si/SiOx) passivated contacts using a very thin SiOx layer of approximately 1.5 nm. These passivated contacts are used to build minicells that reportedly offer remarkably low contact resistance, suitable for high suns operation. The minicells are put “on edge” and packed into the modules.
“These minicells can be composed into micromodules by simply mechanical stacking,” said Stradins. “We used 10 cells, but it can be any number. Thus, the voltages of these micromodules can be high, while currents are kept low.”
In the solar module, the direct contact of the metal from one cell to the next allows for electricity to flow freely between them, with the large area of contact limiting series resistance. Light penetrates vertically through the narrow edge of the device and current is collected laterally through the large-area p- and n-type passivating contacts.
According to the researchers, this architecture allows the cell current to be collected over the whole “side” area of a minicell, which is considerably larger than the light entry area. “These 10- or more minicell stacks can be assembled into any size larger power beaming conversion module,” Stradins further explained. “There is no size limitation, can be meters if necessary, with cooling, tabbing, and power electronics on the backside.”
The research group tested the module at an illumination of around 1000 nm and found its photoconversion efficiency exceeded 40% and the open-circuit voltage surpassed 7 V. The fill factor was around 78%. “Based on current device results, it is expected that power transfer of 25 W could be obtained for a 10 cm2 module with a 12 kW laser source at a distance of 1 km,” the academics said.
According to Stradins, the minicells are made without any expensive lithography. “We use mechanically aligned masks for all deposition steps, which are easily made using ns laser scriber,” he said. “The minicells also are produced by the same laser scriber process. They remain attached to the wafer and processed as a whole wafer, for all steps including final metallization. Only then they are detached and assembled into a micromodule. All this can be automated in a production line.”
