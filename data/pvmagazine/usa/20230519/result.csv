Beard, a former investment principal from Apollo Global Management, a global private equity firm.
“Since 2017, Suntuity’s mission has been to support the transition to a 100% clean and renewable energy future by simplifying residential solar power,” said Dan Javan, president and chief executive officer of Suntuity. “In taking this next step to become a publicly traded company, we intend to accelerate our growth, broaden our focus to include comprehensive home electrification solutions and services across the country, and establish ourselves as a significant industry participant in the renewable energy transformation.”
New Jersey-based Suntuity provides residential solar installation solutions in 25 U.S. states and has deployed 9,500 systems to date. Since 2017, the company has originated more than 200 MW of aggregate solar and storage systems, as well as third-party financing solutions.
Suntuity’s industry relationships with top-tier suppliers and financing partners have contributed to its 26.7% installation compounded annual growth rate for the past three years, as well as a $55 million backlog for more than 1,152 projects whose cycle time from deal acceptance to installation is 59 days.
The company has forecast growth of 79 MW of installations in 2022 increasing to 125 MW of 2023 solar installations across its 25-state market. Suntuity breaks down its top state markets primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, such as New Jersey (33%), Pennsylvania (22%), Connecticut (6%), Massachusetts (6%) and Maryland (6%).
Suntuity uses a mix of in-house and outsourced solutions and capabilities to deploy home solar, storage and EV charging solutions. Outside of its key states, Suntuity has an outsourced installation crew in additional states in Ohio, Illinois, Nevada, California and Texas, among other states capable of installing the company’s systems, with outsourced crew hubs in Utah, Texas, Florida, South Carolina and across the Northeast.
Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will be named Suntuity Inc. and its shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker, “STY.” The business combination has been approved by the boards of directors of both Suntuity and Beard, and is expected to close in Q4 2023, subject to regulatory and stockholder approval.
Citigroup and Roth Capital Partners served as underwriter and capital markets advisor on the SPAC transaction, while Loeb & Loeb LLP is Suntuity’s legal advisor. Vinson & Elkins advised Beard.
Suntuity’s senior management are expected to continue to serve in their existing roles following the SPAC transaction. Current Suntuity employees are expected to retain a 40% ownership of the company at closing, assuming no redemptions by the SPAC’s public shareholders.
“When searching for a potential partner in this transaction, we sought to identify a high-growth business in the renewable energy space with a clear path to scalability and a public-ready management team; we believe Suntuity satisfies each of these criteria and much more,” said Beard.
Beard formed his energy transition SPAC platform in March 2021 with $250 million of capital commitments. Other members of the SPAC team held prior roles across the energy market, including Riverstone, Intervale Capital, Athlon Energy and Caelus Energy, both of which are historic oil and gas producers.
Institutional shareholders in Beard include the Alberta Investment Management Corp. (2.8%), Cantor Fitzgerald (4.6%), Sculptor Capital (4.7%), Adage Capital Partners (5.4%) and Saba Capital (7.7%).

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/19/polar-racking-adds-two-u-s-solar-mount-manufacturing-facilities/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,RACKING,TRACKERS,CANADA,FLORIDA,MICHIGAN,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 19, 2023",Polar Racking adds two U.S. solar mount manufacturing facilities,"Ontario, Canada-based Polar Racking announced it will add two facilities to manufacture solar mounts in the United States. One factory will be located in Michigan, the other in Florida.
A spokesperson for the company told pv magazine USA that it is building up to over 1 GW of tracker and fixed-tilt capacity by mid 2024, with the ability to scale up from there. The company said each site will add 10 jobs, with job opportunity growth as demand increases.
The Michigan facility is currently operational, and the Florida plant is expected to reach commercial production by the end of summer 2023, said the spokesperson.
“Our new U.S. facilities mitigate shipping lead time risks for our customers and gives us additional control over the entire supply chain,” said Pals Saddyappan, director of supply chain and global manufacturing, Polar Racking.
The company currently has a pipeline of 3.4 GW of solar mounting and racking across North America and the Carribean.
Made-in-USA solar components, including racking, trackers, and mounts, are in-demand across the nation, as the Inflation Reduction Act includes a 10% tax credit adder for renewable energy projects that include a certain threshold of domestic content. The Treasury Department recently released guidance on the content requirements, which contain complexities and are actively being evaluated by the industry. The subject of domestic content requirements was a hot topic at the RE+ Southeast renewable energy conference in Atlanta, Georgia.
“The expansion of Polar Racking’s manufacturing operations is in response to our customers’ needs to meet the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) domestic content requirements,” said Vishal Lala, managing director of Polar Racking. “Polar Racking supports the government’s initiative to re-shore the PV supply chain to create local jobs and bolster the local economy.”
Tracker for all terrains
This March, Polar Racking was tapped by OYA Renewables to supply its solar mounts for community solar projects in New York, the nation’s largest community solar market. Polar will supply its terrain-following Axsus series single-axis tracker for the construction of the Camillus Site 1 (6.61 MW), Camillus Site 2 (6.64 MW) and Vernon Site 1 (5.93 MW) community solar projects.
The company’s Axsus Sol-X tracker was developed in collaboration with leading automotive manufacturers to meet the challenge of installing solar on uneven terrain. As of April, Polar Racking has installed 200 MW of the product, with up to 400 MW expected to enter construction in 2023.
By applying automotive manufacturing best practices for a modular, on-site factory process, Polar Racking has increased assembly efficiencies, said Lala.
The Sol-X tracker features independent tables that can hold 6 to 24 modules per table for a total of up to 180 modules per row that are all controlled by a single motor. The table purlin design and flexible drive shaft allow it to follow the undulations of the terrain. Additionally, the Sol-X is can connect directly to various types of foundations, such as ground screws, helical piles, driven piles, and concrete ballasts for landfills. Its purlin table design also allows for greater pile and assembly tolerances that the company says allows for a much simpler and quicker installation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/19/texas-utility-solar-developer-emerges-after-30-million-investment/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TEXAS",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 19, 2023",Texas utility solar developer emerges after $30 million investment,"Gone are the days of the Texas oil boom of the early decades of the 1900’s, and taking its place is the Texas utility-scale solar boom of the early 2000’s. “There will be sun” in the Lone Star State, which is set to take over California as the largest solar market in the United States. 
The newest entrant to the Texas solar boom is Accelergen Energy, a company launched in 2020 that emerged from stealth mode this week following a $30 million investment from Leyline Renewable Capital, a renewable energy investor.  
Accelergen said it will focus on greenfield utility-scale development, targeting a multi-gigawatt pipeline of solar and energy storage projects. The company will engage in a mix of solar-only, solar-plus-storage, and standalone storage projects. 
Thomas Houle, previously managing director of Green Investment Group and founder of Freemantle Energy, and Josh Skogen, twelve-year veteran of utility solar developer sPower, formed the company. The two said Accelergen will leverage in-house grid and commercial analytics in pursuit of strategic advantage in the competitive field.
“We look forward to working with Tom, Josh and their team,” said Todd Kice, managing director of originations, Leyline Renewable Capital. “They’re a top-notch team uniquely equipped with the experience to develop enterprise scale projects in the commercial solar market.”
The company is set to join a steadily growing market. The Energy Information Administration (EIA), often conservative in its projections for renewables, said that 2023 will mark the largest utility-scale solar and storage year yet for the U.S. The EIA projects 29 GW of solar and 9.4 GW of storage to be added this year.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) forecasts that Texas alone will add over 34 GW of solar capacity over the next five years, and most of this will be at the utility-scale. This doubles the cumulative 17 GW installed through the end of 2022. The Advanced Power Alliance projects that in 2024, renewable generation in Texas will deliver $6 billion in net system operating cost savings.
Regulatory hurdle ahead?
While the largely “free market” conditions in Texas combined with its high energy use and strong solar irradiance makes it an attractive market, recent proposed legislation may soon make the market less free. The Texas Senate voted 21-9 in favor of SB 624, a bill that would place significant permit restrictions on solar and wind energy projects in the state.
The legislation singles out solar and wind facilities, requiring them to obtain a permit from the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of Texas, while leaving out fossil fuels from the requirement. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has long shown an affinity for fossil fuels, has appointed all the PUC members, who now would act as gatekeepers for any renewable energy project.
“This new legislation will undeniably hinder continued transformation of the Texas grid and threaten investment, growth, workforce advancement, and energy cost reduction within the state,” said Mike Wietecki, senior vice president of strategy and regulatory affairs, Powin, a utility-scale battery energy storage systems provider.
Apex Clean Energy recently announced the development of the 195 MW Angelo solar-plus-storage (100 MW | 200 MWh) project in Texas, using Powin’s Centipede modular battery product.
“Because of the rapid transition, and the potential for unintended consequences, there may be an opportunity to evaluate progress thus far to ensure the continued deployment of clean energy happens in an efficient manner. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be the goal of this legislation. Rather it seems intent on putting up illogical roadblocks that will cost Texans real dollars by increasing energy costs, all while reducing the status of Texas as a leader in the sector,” said Wietecki.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/19/navigating-complex-energy-markets-for-vpp-participants/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 19, 2023",Navigating complex energy markets for VPP participants,"Virtual power plants are networks of distributed energy resources (DER) such as rooftop solar, smart thermostats, water heaters, electric vehicles, and batteries. The VPP network is actively controlled by utilities and energy service providers to benefit consumers, the power system and the environment.
According to Jigar Shah, director of the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, VPPs “increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives. By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.”
A recent Brattle report, Real Reliability: The Value of Virtual Power, modeled the value and performance of a VPP network versus conventional resource adequacy options. The consulting group compares the net cost of providing 400 MW of resource adequacy from three resource types: a natural gas peaker, a grid-interconnected battery system, and a VPP composed of residential demand flexibility technologies. They found that the net cost to the utility of providing resource adequacy from a VPP is roughly 40% to 60% of the cost of the alternative options; 60 GW of VPP deployment could meet future U.S resource adequacy needs at $15 to $35 billion less than the cost of the alternative options over the ensuing decade. An added benefit is that 60 GW of VPP systems could provide over $20 billion in additional societal benefits, such as those related to emissions and resilience, over ten years.
The VPP market spells opportunity for businesses that manufacture and manage energy assets to create new revenue streams. One of those providers is Leap, or Leapfrog Power, Inc., a software platform that connects DERs to energy markets. Increasingly, companies like Leap are connecting VPPs to electricity markets, which is beneficial to the electric customer because the software provider can respond to pricing signals reflecting real-time energy needs, as opposed to relying on a directive from the utility.
Leap offers a single interface that can connect thousands of DER products to power markets and utilities. The software is a solution for DER technology and service providers, enabling them to earn revenue through the wholesale market and other programs from utilities, municipalities and community choice aggregators.
VPPs are designed to make their aggregated energy available at times of high demand, such as on hot California days when air conditioners are running full tilt. In the age of fossil fuels, peaker plants sit idle waiting to be called into duty on demand. A 2020 report, “Dirty Energy, Big Money” found that New York City’s peaker plants cost residents more than $4.5 billion over the last decade, despite only being active four to 30 days a year. VPPs act as a “virtual peaker plant,” thus eliminating carbon spewing into the atmosphere and capturing value from the many DERs already being deployed on the grid for other purposes.
Leap aggregates the grid interactive devices enrolled on its software platform into a VPP, then sells its energy to utilities and into wholesale energy markets, sharing the revenue earned with its technology partners. In times when emergency energy is needed, such as what happened in September 2022 when California experienced an extreme heat wave, Leap reports that it was able to dispatch energy from thousands of residential and commercial sites on demand.
The opportunity extends beyond grid emergencies. Many customers and device types, such as energy storage, have the ability to participate and dispatch on a regular basis without sacrificing their originally intended value. Leap enables these devices to compete in the energy markets each day, just like traditional thermal generation but without the carbon footprint.
GridPoint is a specialist in building energy management and optimization technology that decarbonizes commercial buildings. Its platform connects the built environment and DERs with energy grids. With its platform deployed in 17,000+ commercial buildings across multiple industries, including myriad retail brands, it turned to Leap to maximize the value of the grid-interactive technologies in the buildings. GridPoint allows Leap to navigate the complexities of the regulatory and operational requirements in energy markets so GridPoint can more easily expand its grid services offerings where it has customers.
Another company that benefits from Leap’s API is Nuvve Holding, a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) specialist, which manages power among electric school bus batteries and the grid. It partnered with Leap on a unique demand response (DR) project with resources inside a microgrid at the University of California, San Diego. Leap collaborated with the California Public Utilities Commission, utility San Diego Gas & Electric, and the university to overcome baselining challenges and metering obstacles to successfully activate the site in the market.
In April, Leap announced that it joined the Virtual Power Plant Partnership (VP3), founded by Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) to help advance VPP solutions to help decarbonize the electricity sector. Through this collaboration, Leap will work closely with energy technology companies, including current technology partners Google Nest and Sunrun, to accelerate the growth of the VPP industry.
VPPs also offer an opportunity for DER companies who partner with a company like Leap to sell more of their products and services. Since the revenue generated typically passes to the DER provider, rather than directly to the customer, companies can use the new revenue from VPPs to provide a more attractive offer to their customer. End customers still receive the value, but often in the form of reduced upfront costs for new hardware or lower ongoing services or subscription costs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/19/maxeon-raises-199-4-million-in-equity-for-ibc-module-manufacturing-expansion/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,PRODUCTS,MEXICO,PHILIPPINES,SINGAPORE",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 19, 2023",Maxeon raises $199.4 million in equity for IBC module manufacturing expansion,"Maxeon Solar Technologies, a manufacturer of Maxeon and SunPower brand solar modules, priced a public offering of shares to raise $157.4 million in equity proceeds for which the company said it would use for Maxeon 7 module production and general corporate purposes.
Maxeon is selling 7.48 million common shares of stock, including 1.87 million shares of historic investor TotalEnergies, at a price of $28 per share. At closing, the company anticipates receiving over $157 million in gross proceeds. The offering was upsized by 10% from an initial announcement that Maxeon made of selling 6.8 common shares, according to a company statement. The add-on public offering is expected to close today, May 19.
BofA Securities and Morgan Stanley served as joint book-running managers for Maxeon’s offering. Raymond James and Roth Capital Partners were co-managers for the offering.
In an additional private placement transaction, TCL Zhonghuan Renewable Energy, a current 23.7% shareholder in Maxeon, will acquire 1.5 million shares in Maxeon stock for about $42 million.
TCL Zhonghuan is a Chinese semiconductor manufacturer primarily engaged in the solar market. In July 2020, Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor was acquired by TCL after the consumer electronics manufacturer won an auction to buy shares of its parent, state-owned Zhonghuan Electronic Information Group.
Maxeon is using the equity raise to fund the 500 MW capacity expansion of its cell manufacturing capacity for Maxeon 7 interdigitated back contact (IBC) panels, which is expected to increase its  manufacturing capacity of the next-generation panels by about 50%, the company said.  Maxeon 7 IBC panels are expected to be the world’s most efficient solar panels at approximately 24% module efficiency.
The IBC manufacturing expansion would utilize a previously closed Philippines warehouse with module assembly to occur at other existing Maxeon facilities. The Philippines facility will be designated as a “Fab5” facility and located near Maxeon’s existing Fab4 site, which currently hosts the Maxeon 7 pilot line.
Maxeon said Fab5 site production will ramp up in the second half of 2024. The company said new volume produced at Fab5 will be sold to the distributed generation (DG) markets, including expanding supply volume into a new U.S. residential channel market. Additional new Fab5 expansion capacity will allow more shipments to its European market and rebalance the mix of Maxeon and Performance line sales.
Total capital expenditures (capex) for Maxeon’s IBC expansion are $200 million, of which about $50 million is for site preparation and long-lead time items included in prior 2023 guidance. Including the $157.4 million and $42 million of add-on and private placement proceeds, the company’s 2023 capex budget remains at $150 million to $170 million, of which $100 million relates to the Fab5 ramp up.
Domestic content guidance
In SEC filings, Maxeon said the company’s management was reviewing the May 12 guidance from the Internal Revenue Service related to U.S. domestic content bonus incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.
For taxpayers using the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (ITC), eligibility for the domestic content bonus would increase the credit by 10%, which in most cases is from 30% to 40% of the cost of a qualifying solar property. By power output, using the production tax credit (PTC) would increase by 10% as well as a result of domestic content eligibility.
Maxeon said, “IRS guidance is supportive of our announced plans to deploy a multi-GW cell and module factory in the U.S. to manufacture solar products for both the DG and utility-scale power plant markets. We are currently evaluating this guidance, which provides guidelines for how the solar products we will produce help our customers qualify for the domestic content bonus in the ITC and PTC and prescribes requirements for certain record-keeping and certification.”
Maxeon was spun off from SunPower in August of 2020, when both became separate entities. TotalEnergies owns a minority interest in Maxeon.
The company’s Performance line of solar modules leverage Maxeon’s shingled cell technology, originally developed by SunPower. The technology is protected by 83 granted patents. The 425 W modules use bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large-format eight-inch G12 wafers, and have an efficiency of 20.6%, according to Maxeon.
Maxeon is based in Singapore but lists shares on the NASDAQ Capital Markets exchange, where it currently trades at $28.66 per share today with a $1.3 billion market capitalization. The company has 5,344 employees worldwide, of which based primarily in Mexico (39%), Malaysia (33%) and the Philippines (20%), according to its annual financial statement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/19/no-loan-no-lease-going-solar-via-home-equity-agreement/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 19, 2023","No loan, no lease: Going solar via home equity agreement","California-based evNation announced it has partnered with QuantmRE to provide a debt-free financing option for homeowners looking to install solar or electric vehicle charging stations.
The two partnered to offer home equity agreements for rooftop solar and EV charging. While loans, leases, second mortgages, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) often have credit score requirements and require the customer to take on debt, the home equity agreement does not.
Under the agreement, the homeowner is provided with a lump sum in exchange for a share of the future value of the property. These funds can then be used to install rooftop solar arrays and home electric vehicle charging stations.
The product opens the door for customers who may not qualify for traditional loans or leases and are suited for homeowners who have accrued equity in their home and do not have cash on hand. Typically this type of financing has a 10 year term, though terms can be as long as 30 years.
“QuantmRE’s Home Equity Agreements are a much-needed alternative financing option than can be an ideal solution for many of our customers,” said Neil Okun, co-founder, evNation. “We look forward to joining forces on a shared vision to bring evNation’s range of EV charging and solar installations to a wider range of homeowners without the cost and burden of them having to take out another loan, and with all the cost-savings that QuantmRE’s debt-free financing solution brings.”
Often in a home equity agreement, at the conclusion of the agreement term, the homeowner pays back the equity advance the company paid, as well as a percentage of any appreciation in property value.
“This can amount to a significant payment — in some cases, more than double or even triple the amount of the original loan,” said NerdWallet.
However, the financing option offers a way to cut down on monthly costs without paying cash up front.
“For borrowers who have a lot of debt or limited cash reserves that couldn’t cover a consistent loan payment, this can be a way to access their wealth immediately without having to pay it back for several years,” said NerdWallet.
If the home’s value does not go up or if it goes down, the company will take an adjusted share of the sale price, which can be less than what was received upfront. However, the homeowner will also be working with a smaller reserve from the home sale to pay the company back.
evNation offers its customers traditional financing methods for solar and EV charging, as well, and installs for both residential and commercial accounts. The company also forms partnerships with automotive dealers, training employees in offering EV charging solutions and providing concierge services to EV purchasers.

An increasing number of jurisdictions and installers actively participated in the program, submitting permits. 
Over the course of the year, 206 installers submitted 11,092 residential solar permits, which included 708 solar-plus-storage permits. These submissions represented 46% of all solar permit submissions at the local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ).

The pilot program, initially featuring 16 AHJs, expanded to include 31 by the end of 2022, as an additional 15 AHJs integrated the software.
SolarAPP+ expedites the approval process by providing immediate feedback on permit applications and granting instant approval when no issues are detected. This accelerated procedure allows for same-day permit issuance compared to the average week-long wait in participating AJHs. As a result, residential solar power projects pass local inspections up to thirteen days earlier than traditional projects.
The study, based on a statistically limited dataset, revealed a 17% inspection failure rate for SolarAPP+ projects, compared to a 24% failure rate for non-SolarAPP+ projects. This indicates a 29% higher inspection pass rate for projects employing SolarAPP+.

However, it’s worth noting that 11% of inspection failures in SolarAPP+ projects were due to the absence of the SolarAPP+ installation process list at the inspection site. NREL sees this as a simple issue to resolve as installers become more familiar with the SolarAPP+ process.
NREL humorously suggested that the lower inspection failure rate could be attributed to the specific installers who choose to use SolarAPP+, given the small sample size. Whether SolarAPP+ reduces inspection failures remains an open question.
Previous studies show that each local AHJ saved between 5,800 to 13,900 hours through the use of SolarAPP+, equivalent to the work of three to seven full-time staff members. These significant time savings have led to a decrease in solar permit fees, ranging from $6 to $250.

Over time, consumers have also noticed that lithium-ion batteries have historically underperformed or shown to be less effective operating in freezing environments at or below zero degrees.
Current lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte. As particles and ions transfer within the liquid and as the liquid begins to freeze at sub-zero temperatures, an EV battery’s charging ability can be severely limited in cold temperatures. Various consumer studies by Kelly Blue Book and Consumer Reports found that EV driving range can be reduced by up to 25% in sub-freezing temperature conditions driving at normal highway speed.
According to a study by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne and Lawrence Berkeley National laboratories, researchers have developed a fluorine-containing electrolyte that performs well for EVs driving in sub-zero temperatures.
In conventional lithium-ion batteries, the electrolyte is a mixture of a salt (lithium hexafluorophosphate) and carbonate solvent such as ethylene carbonate. These solvents dissolve the salt to form a liquid. When freezing, the battery solvents’ cluster loses the ability to transport ions out of the cathode and pass through the electrolyte onto the anode.
Creating an antifreeze component to EV batteries, the DOE/LBNL research team investigated several fluorine-containing solvents. The team found a composition that had the lowest energy barrier for releasing lithium ions from the salt clusters at sub-zero temperature.
The team’s fluorinated electrolyte retained stable energy storage capacity for 400 charge-discharge cycles at negative 4 degrees F. Even at sub-zero temperature, the capacity was equivalent to that of a cell with a conventional carbonate-based electrolyte at room temperature, the research team found.
“Our team not only found an antifreeze electrolyte whose charging performance does not decline at minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, but we also discovered, at the atomic level, what makes it so effective,” said Zhengcheng “John” Zhang, a senior chemist and group leader in Argonne’s Chemical Sciences and Engineering division.
This low-temperature electrolyte shows promise of working for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as in energy storage for electric grids and consumer electronics like computers and phones.
“Our research thus demonstrated how to tailor the atomic structure of electrolyte solvents to design new electrolytes for sub-zero temperatures,” said John Zhang, Argonne group leader and senior chemist of energy storage.
The antifreeze electrolyte has a bonus property. It is safer than carbonate-based electrolytes in current use, since the antifreeze battery technology will not catch fire.
Zhang said the DOE/LBNL research group is seeking to patent the antifreeze electrolyte technology now and secure an industrial partner to adapt it with one of their designs for lithium-ion battery production.
The study was initially published in Advanced Energy Materials. Additional authors include Argonne’s Dong-Joo Yoo, Qian Liu and Minkyu Kim. LBNL contributors include Orion Cohen and Kristin Persson.
The research study was funded by the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technologies Office.

PJM’s process will not meet the potential for renewable energy growth “fueled” by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) through 2028, the report says, as shown in the dotted line near the top of the bar chart. The report used a projection from the Princeton ZERO Lab that PJM will see an additional 1 GW of renewable energy projects enter the queue annually.

NRDC’s report considered a portion of the 13-state region served by PJM, consisting of 8 states plus the District of Columbia that have both a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) and much or all of their load served by PJM. The analysis used data on annual aggregate RPS demand from Bloomberg NEF.
For the portion of PJM evaluated, NRDC projected that 15 GW of new utility-scale solar will enter commercial operation by 2028, and used a value from IHS Markit that 6 GW of new small-scale solar will be added by 2028.
“States throughout PJM set ambitious RPS goals to cut emissions, lower costs, and boost reliability, but years of delays at PJM threaten to derail these plans,” said the report’s lead author Dana Ammann, an NRDC policy analyst.
“Our analysis represents the best-case scenario,” the report notes, pointing to three factors. The report highlights a “likely onslaught” of interconnection requests that PJM will face in 2026 when it begins to process interconnection requests submitted since October 2021; the potential for “RPS expansion and policy updates” across the states; and the investment uncertainty and “skyrocketing costs” faced by solar and wind developers, which could lead to projects being delayed or not completed, or being unable to take advantage of IRA incentives.
Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate with NRDC’s Sustainable FERC Project, said in an emailed statement, “We’re happy to see that PJM has started work to streamline transferring interconnections from retiring fossil fuel plants to new clean energy. PJM also needs to identify near-term transmission upgrades that will enable states’ clean energy goals, and work with states to find ways to get those projects funded and built.”
“Looking to the late 2020s and 2030s,” Rutigliano added, “PJM’s transmission planning needs fundamental reform. PJM currently plans for a future that looks much like the past, a recipe for failure as we move through the energy transition. PJM must update its planning to be based on realistic scenarios for the future energy mix and explicitly support state policies.”
All 13 states in the PJM region called for the grid operator to make faster progress on interconnection, in comments submitted last year by the Organization of PJM States, Inc. to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
“The challenges faced by grid operators were not entirely unanticipated,” the NRDC report states. Quoting a 2008 white paper from the ISO/RTO Council, the report says the paper “recognized the impending challenges of an ‘overwhelming increase in new generation interconnection requests’ from public policies encouraging new renewable resources.”
NRDC’s report, titled “Waiting Game: How the Interconnection Queue Threatens Renewable Development in PJM,” includes state-level analyses for the 8 states plus the District of Columbia that were evaluated.
