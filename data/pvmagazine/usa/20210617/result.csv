The expected growth is spurred in part by the lockdown and social distancing measures imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has created challenges in sending technicians into the field. What’s more, human inspections are more costly in terms of travel and can result in errors. It is not uncommon for human-captured imagery to be unclear, causing delays and difficulties in further diagnosis and damages analysis.
The report acknowledged that many solar and wind farms already are equipped with various IoT sensors that measure vibration, weather, and other operational factors. However, operators often prefer to have remote visual inspections.
In light of that, robots, drones, and other imaging technologies are taking over and offering augmented/virtual reality and machine learning. These devices use object-tracking and self-navigation tools that enable them to conduct inspections without the need for human intervention.

A range both hardware and software is being deployed in this latest generation of solar and wind inspections. Here is how the report said they are currently being used: 
The report recommended that market players develop digital platforms that combine software and hardware applications to utilize field operations and inspection data for a comprehensive inspection. R&D partnerships can be made to accelerate product development and improve competitive advantage.
Frost & Sullivan also said it is advantageous to use mobility solutions that can be deployed anywhere, anytime, to save travel costs and improve operational performance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/17/to-address-transmission-issues-ferc-and-naruc-agree-to-tackle-barriers-through-a-new-task-force/,"POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 17, 2021","To address transmission issues, FERC and NARUC agree to tackle barriers through a new task force","The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved creating a joint task force with the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) to address issues related to electric transmission.
The Joint Federal State Task Force on Electric Transmission will consider a range of topics, including how states can voluntarily coordinate in order to identify, plan, and develop regional transmission projects.

The Task Force will be made up of FERC Commissioners as well as representatives from 10 state commissions.
“It is increasingly clear that interstate transmission will play a critical role in the transition to the clean energy future,” said FERC Chair Richard Glick in a tweet announcing the task force.
The FERC also issued a policy statement to clarify that states and transmission providers may enter into voluntary agreements to plan and pay for transmission facilities.
FERC said that voluntary agreements could provide states with a way to prioritize, plan, and pay for transmission facilities that are not being developed under the regional transmission planning processes required by FERC order No. 1000. The policy statement is intended to address concerns that the Federal Power Act (FPA) and FERC policies interfere with the creation of these voluntary agreements.
Topics that the Joint Task Force may consider include the following:
In a statement, Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) said, “Ten years after being finalized, not one interregional transmission line has been built using the process established under Order 1000.” He said that with more interregional transmission, centers of high renewable resources can be connected with centers of high electric demand, “enhancing grid reliability and dramatically reducing carbon emissions.”
The Solar Energy Industries Association’s vice president of state and regulatory affairs, Sean Gallagher, said, “The reality is that we are going to need to add hundreds of gigawatts of solar and energy storage capacity to reach President Biden’s 100% clean electricity goal.” Gallagher said the FERC/NARUC partnership “promises to help overcome the regional planning challenges associated with building the transmission capacity we need to meet our goals.”

One program, in Massachusetts, will extend financial and technical help to community development agencies that need help navigating the often-daunting development process. A second program, in New York, leverages the cost savings generated by rooftop solar to provide free Wi-Fi to residents in two dozen buildings.
The Massachusetts Solar Technical Assistance Retrofits (STAR) program announced $10 million in funds for up to 3 MW in solar projects on affordable housing units. Financial and technical help will be given to community development agencies looking to cut costs through the savings of rooftop solar.
STAR saids those in low-income areas are disproportionately affected by climate change, and that the often-tight budgets of these residences has led to a lag in solar adoption. The program is intended to support more equitable access to clean energy for community members who may not have the capital to invest in solar on their own.
Researching the complex financial and technical aspects of solar projects for numerous multi-unit buildings can be a heavy lift for an already stretched housing agency staff. The program seeks to address this issue by acting as a guiding force through the decision-making process.
In the initial stage, the campaign collected over $40,000 in donations, which were distributed as grants to 15 participating organizations. This allowed the staff to devote time to gather data for feasibility studies, including collecting utility bills, roof ages, and square footages.
Design plans and eventual installation will be performed by Resonant Energy, a group that focuses on deploying solar in underserved communities.
Most participants are expected to opt for a power purchase agreement which includes no upfront cost. The $10 million in financing will be used to pay for solar system construction, and the investors will own the completed installations. They will then sell the generated power to the housing agencies at a discounted rate.
STAR projects $250,000 in total annual savings across the portfolio of projects.
In most applications, the solar projects will serve common areas such as hallways, elevators, an laundry rooms. The expected energy cost savings will generally be used to reinvest in upgrading the community windows and other amenities, said STAR.
Some projects will be structured to allow residents to take a more direct share in the benefits. Credits created by excess generation for common spaces would be passed on in the form of utility bill savings for those living in the building, says Resonant.
STAR said the next step for these agencies is to update older buildings and replace oil and gas burning heating systems with energy efficient electrical systems, as well as making other building efficiency upgrades such as insulation and LED lighting.
Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is a New York City neighborhood that struggles to have a steady source of internet access, as almost 40% of its households do not have Wi-Fi. The pandemic has necessitated the use of internet as schooling and work go online, and while students were loaned laptops for distance learning, connectivity has been a big issue across New York.
The Workforce Housing Group, an affordable housing development organization, has come up with a creative solution to the problem: free Wi-Fi for its residents.
The Wi-Fi is being funded with a NY Green Bank loan to the Workforce Housing Group to cover the cost of 18 independent solar arrays, providing power to 24 buildings. The loan was structured so that payments directly match the projected utility bill payments to ConEdison.
The expected excess savings generated by the cheaper solar power and related incentives will then work towards paying for the Morgan Stanley-backed loan for the buildout of new high-speed internet infrastructure.
The project is engineered, designed, and installed by New York-based Premier Solar.
Workforce Housing Group founding member John Crotty said the first panels will be installed in late July, with the project expected to reach completion before the end of the year.
NY Green Bank, a division of New York State Energy Research & Development has a $1.2 billion portfolio of financing projects in solar, wind, biofuel, energy efficiency, agriculture, fuel cells, and more.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/17/roll-out-solar-arrays-installed-in-successful-nasa-spacewalk/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 17, 2021",Roll-out solar arrays installed in NASA spacewalk,"Astronauts Shane Kimbrough of NASA and Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency (ESA) have completed their spacewalk upgrade of the international space station, installing the new iROSA roll-out solar arrays.   
It cost about $100 million to install the six Redwire-produced arrays. The new arrays are expected to add more than 120kW in capacity, which will increase the station’s power generation by 20-30%.
The previous arrays had been designed for a 15-year service life, but had been continually operating since December 2000. Although they were functioning well, the older arrays were showing signs of degradation, as expected.  
The duration of the spacewalk was scheduled to last six and a half hours, and ended up totaling seven hours fifteen minutes, with the astronauts utilizing their battery powered suits to traverse the exterior of the station. Kimbrough experienced some errors with his suit’s status display, including a reading of a spike in the pressure reading. After resetting his suit, the data stabilized, but the delay will cause the two astronauts to return for another spacewalk to complete the deployment.
Before the new array can begin supplying power, the spacewalkers will need to install electrical cables and drive the final two bolts, thus allowing the panels to unfurl into the deployed position. This will take place on June 20th, and can be viewed live on NASA’s website. 
This is the third spacewalk Kimbrough and Pesquet have conducted in tandem, following two 2017 expeditions in which the astronauts replaced the orbiting laboratory’s nickel-hydrogen batteries with new lithium-ion batteries. 
This report was changed on 6/18, adding details about the technical errors in one astronaut’s spacesuit, and removing the word “successful” from the headline.

Canada’s clean energy sector currently employs around 430,500 people. Over the same time period, Canada’s fossil fuel sector is forecast to experience a 9% drop in employment. In raw numbers, the 208,700 new clean energy jobs that are expected to be added by 2030 exceed the 125,800 likely to be lost in fossil fuels.
“Oil and gas may have dominated Canada’s energy past, but it’s Canada’s clean energy sector that will define its new reality,” said Merran Smith, the group’s executive director in introducing the report.
Alberta is forecast to see 71,700 jobs in its clean energy sector by 2030, a 164% increase over 2020 and the greatest increase of any Canadian province. The province is home to Canada’s largest oil and natural gas production fields. Saskatchewan also is forecast to see its clean energy jobs double.
The report said that by 2030, clean energy will make up 29% of Canada’s total energy GDP, up from 22% in 2020. The fastest-growing clean energy industry is expected to be electric vehicle technology, with jobs forecast to grow to 184,000 in 2030. Another industry expected to grow is hydrogen consumption technology, with jobs expected to grow 27% per year between 2025 and 2030, employing 21,900 workers by 2030.
A new group has been formed to focus on advancing what it says is “much needed” changes to the federal tax code to advance clean energy opportunities. The Partnership for Clean Energy Investment includes Advanced Energy Economy, Ameresco, Apex Clean Energy, Brookfield Renewable Partners, Intersect Power, Third Way, and CleanCapital.
The group said that the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) are primary tools to help incentivize development and financing. Both rely on tax equity markets that exist due to what it said is a “fundamental misalignment” between the PTC and ITC and their real-world application. It said many developers find themselves with little or no initial tax liability, since projects will not generate taxable profits until after development is complete. That makes it difficult to access available clean energy policy incentives.
Tax equity financing has emerged in which clean energy developers trade future tax credits for building solar and wind to banks in exchange for upfront investment. The banks then use the tax credits to reduce their own tax liability from their regular financial activities. Banks charge what the group said is “a significant premium” for this service and many developers are unable to participate.
The partnership said it will advocate for 100% direct pay for clean energy tax credits and push for legislation and action aimed at fixing clean energy finance shortcomings.
Florida Power & Light toppled a 495-foot stack at its last coal-fired power plant, marking the start of demolition work on the Indiantown Cogeneration plant in Marin County northwest of Orlando. Once the land is cleared, the utility will begin development a solar energy, using portions of the plant’s existing infrastructure.
In addition, Gulf Power, a part of FPL that serves customers in Northwest Florida, ceased coal-fired power generation at its Plant Crist in Escambia County near Pensacola earlier this year. The plant was modified to run on natural gas.
Control system provider Dragos Inc. and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation‘s (NERC) Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) announced a joint initiative to strengthen cybersecurity in the North American electricity industry.
The initiative enables E-ISAC analysts to gain greater visibility into industrial control system cyber threats through Dragos’s Neighborhood Keeper technology. E-ISAC analysts will have the ability to view aggregate information about threat analytics and Indicators of Compromise (IOC) as they are detected, and then share insights and trends with E-ISAC members.
Neighborhood Keeper was developed with the support of an award from the U.S. Department of Energy, and is a opt-in, anonymized information-sharing network available to Dragos customers.
The Western Energy Imbalance Market, operated by the California Independent System Operator, has expanded its footprint to Montana with the addition of NorthWestern Energy. Eight utilities have joined the market this year, and it now includes portions of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and Montana. By 2023, an expected 22 participants will represent more than 83% of the load in the Western Interconnection.
The Western Energy Imbalance Market was formed in 2014 and is intended to find and deliver the lowest-cost energy to utilities, while enhancing reliability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The most recent quarterly results show the market has achieved $1.28 billion in cumulative gross benefits for its participants.
NorthWestern Energy provides electricity and natural gas to more than 743,000 customers in Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska.

Construction is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Through a competitive bid process led by the New York Power Authority (NYPA), Sol Systems was selected to install and operate the solar array at no expense to the Monroe County Water Agency in return for all energy credits generated at a fixed price per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.
The array is expected to generate 8 million kWh of electricity per year, which will be delivered to the local utility and credited to the water agency on its energy bills. The system is expected to offset more than 15% of the annual energy required by the water agency for pumping and treatment.
The project will use ground-mounted bifacial solar modules. NYPA is serving as project advisor, and helped with preliminary site assessment, competitive bidding, and project execution oversight. Capital Dynamics will own the project with Sol Systems managing the asset throughout the agreement.
