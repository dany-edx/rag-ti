Advocacy group shows how,"The Beyond Earth Institute, a nonprofit that offers policy recommendations for interplanetary human expansion, offered the U.S. National Space Council a strategy for space solar power development. The group said the strategy would provide power for both terrestrial commercial applications and lunar operations.
The institute said deployment of government and commercial space solar power and wireless power transmission is vital to combatting climate change, developing scalable baseload energy sources, and enhancing U.S. leadership in space.
In Beyond Earth’s vision, space solar power systems would include photovoltaics and concentrators, along with wireless power transmission systems, including microwave and laser power transmission. The microwaves or lasers would beam energy from the satellite to a receiver called a rectenna, which could then dispatch power terrestrially or on the moon.
The structures would feature large in-space low-mass systems that are assembled and deployable. The systems would be supported by maintenance robotics and solar-powered propulsion systems.
Beyond Earth said it sees a path for this technology to be operational by the late 2020s, achieving nearly continuous dispatchable power at scales of gigawatts and greater. They said that with public-private collaboration, the terrestrial power supply could be inexpensive and commercially viable. The recommendation offered no cost estimates.
In its strategy, two pilot programs were recommended. One would place a facility on Earth, which could be scaled to gigawatt range, and a 1 MW facility on the permanently shadowed region of the moon. Terrestrial power supply units would operate in low-Earth orbit, and interplanetary transmission would occur high-Earth orbits.
The institute said issues associated with spectrum allocation and management of the wireless power transmission would be resolved by the Federal Communications Commission and through the International Telecommunications Union. 
The letter provided a roadmap to achieving this vision.  First, by the mid 2020s, identification and resolution of key technical challenges would be made. A requirements assessment, technology assessment, and development stage would be conducted in collaboration of the Energy Department, NASA, the Department of Defense, and private actors.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Air Force awarded the University of Toledo $12.5 million to develop photovoltaic energy sheets that would harvest solar energy in space to transmit power wirelessly to Earth-based receivers or to satellites.
Researchers will develop flexible solar cell sheets, each roughly the size of a piece of paper, that can be assembled into larger structures.
One space-based solar array could include tens of millions of sheets and be as large as a square mile. An array that size could generate about 800 MW, the researchers said.
In its policy recommendation, Beyond Earth said that by the mid- to late-2020s, spectrum management and other regulatory issues would be resolved. A demonstration of at least 1 kW of power dispatch to Earth would be completed by 2026.
By 2028, Beyond Earth recommends a lunar demonstration of delivery of no less than 100 kW, and construction of a 100 MW terrestrial power system, scalable to 1 GW or above. They said the systems should be in operation for a minimum of five years, and all elements in orbit would eventually be brought back to Earth to be decommissioned.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/06/hyundai-and-ul-ally-to-give-ev-batteries-a-second-life/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,NORTH AMERICA,SOUTH KOREA,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 6, 2021",Hyundai and UL ally to give EV batteries a second life,"Global safety science leader UL and Hyundai Motor Co. signed a memorandum of understanding to help further the safe deployment and use of second-life battery energy storage systems (SLBESS). 
The two said they will collaborate on SLBESS initiatives, including safety testing and assessment, a North America product demonstration project, and evaluation process development. They said they intend to use their worldwide presence to further SLBESS market adoption.
Second-life batteries often consist of electric vehicle batteries that no longer meet the requirements of automotive applications, but are still worthwhile additions as grid-connected energy storage devices.
As the EV market grows, attention is focusing on battery reuse. In 2018, UL participated in developing UL 1974, the Standard for Evaluation for Repurposing Batteries, a bi-national standard of the United States and Canada. In 2019, 4R Energy Corp., a joint venture of Nissan Motors and Sumitomo Corp., became the first organization certified to that standard.
Improvements in lithium extraction, battery efficiency upgrades, lithium battery recycling, and battery reuse all present market opportunities as the world shifts the way it uses energy.
The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow from $40.5 billion in 2020 to $91.9 billion by 2026, as demand for electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and electronics continues to ramp up.
Lithium battery growth is a part of national plans to evolve and decarbonize the energy and transportation sectors, as evidenced by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) making $200 million in funding available to support the full value chain of batteries, from raw materials to end-user products such as EVs and battery storage systems.
DOE and the Biden administration have identified the need to establish a secure end-to-end battery materials and technology supply chain that supports economic competitiveness, job creation, and national security.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/06/got-windows-then-photovoltachromics-may-be-for-you/,"RESEARCH,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 6, 2021",Got windows? Then photovoltachromics may be for you,"From pv magazine Global
Photovoltachromic devices (PVCDs) are capable of enabling adjustable transparency glazing and, at the same time, generate electricity by means of the PV effect. This technology has been so far applied to the design of self-powered smart windows for buildings and vehicles at research level and, however, it is still at a very early stage of development. The ability to modulate indoor light and heat transmission, while generating energy from PVs, is enticing for further BIPV developments.
Researchers in China have now taken a further step by developing a solar window based on a photovoltachromic device that combines a full-transparent perovskite photovoltaic device and electrochromic components based on ion-gel in a vertical tandem architecture without any intermediated electrode.
“This full-transparent monolithic smart window possesses not only full advantages of self-power, on-demand control and self-adaptive based on solar-irradiances, but also good features including excellent visible transparency and color neutrality, high adjustable range on transmittance and temperature, as well as repeatable serviceability,” the scientists stated.
The Chinese group used visibly transparent perovskite and flexible electrochromic ion-gel to connect two terminals of PV element and two terminals of the electrochemical element in a four-terminal configuration. The perovskite layer was based on hybrid methylamine lead chloride (MAPbCl3) perovskite film prepared by a spin coating method.
The monolithic PVCD device was assembled via a full solution process in an architecture incorporating glass, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layer, the perovskite-based PV cell, the electrochromic gel, another FTO layer, and glass. This design, according to the researchers, offers the possibility of building large-area devices with a surface of approximately 36 cm2. The electrochromic gel has a thickness of around  90 μm and the PV component of around 800 nm. The PV module consists of a 300 nm electron transport layer (ETL), a 350 nm perovskite layer, and a 40 nm hole-transport layer (HTL). When the PVCD is hit by sunlight, the PV module provides voltage to charge the electrochromic module.
“By optimizing the halide-diffusion period for perovskite, we successfully achieved a self-adaptable adjustment on transmittances depending on varying solar irradiation intensities for this monolithic PVCD,” the study reads. The PVCD is claimed to achieve a high pristine transmittance up to 76% and to be self-adaptable to control indoor brightness and temperature automatically depending on different solar irradiances.
A full description of the device can be found in the paper Full-frame and high-contrast smart windows from halide-exchanged perovskites, which was recently published in Nature Communications. The research group includes scientists from China’s Nanjing Tech University and the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

Maine’s NEB program allows customers to benefit from clean energy savings by offsetting their electrical bills with either owned or shared energy projects, like community solar, which, in turn, spurs further development of these assets within the state.
The 35 MW included in this acquisition will come across five ground-mount projects, all set to be funded, owned, and operated by Standard Solar, with each project expected to commence construction within the next 12 months.
Once completed, the projects will provide a significant boost to Standard Solar’s generation portfolio, which currently sits around 200 MW.
Earlier this year, in February, Standard Solar acquired roughly 25 MW of community solar projects in Massachusetts and Minnesota. Those 25 MW will be coming across 17 projects, 16 of which are located in Minnesota, with the remaining project currently operating in Massachusetts.
In May, the company agreed to fund, own and operate a portfolio of  21 solar canopies across the Long Beach Unified School District in Southern California. Those projects, set to total 4 MW in capacity, were developed in partnership with EMCOR Services, while Mesa Energy Systems assisted in funding. The majority of the projects are already in operation, with all set to be live by October.
