The funding round was led by Standard Investments with participation by DNV Ventures and Sustainable Future Ventures. Existing investors including Union Square Ventures, Congruent Ventures and National Grid Partners also joined the round.
The company’s platform enables automated access to energy market participation for battery storage, electric vehicle charging, smart thermostats, energy management systems, and other distributed energy resources like rooftop solar. It helps distributed energy technology providers and operators to earn revenue in demand response and other grid services programs.
“The need for clean, flexible capacity to help balance the strained power grid has never been higher,” said Leap co-founder and chief executive officer Thomas Folker.
Folker said the funds will be used to add features to the platform, grow Leap’s network of technology partners and expand across geographies. Along with a network of over 70 technology partners, Leap has connected over 70,000 customer meters to virtual power plants (VPP) across the United States.
“Distributed energy resources are a growing priority for both consumers and utilities. With Leap’s unique ability to monetize all types of assets — from energy storage to electric vehicles to building management systems — it is a market maker in an increasingly crowded field,” said Standard Investments’ Logan Ashcraft, who was named to Leap’s board of directors.
A study by Boston-based consultancy Brattle Group estimates utilities could save $35 billion by 2033 by focusing on VPPs for supporting peak demand capacity. Brattle Group’s 400 MW resource adequacy study considered a utility with 1.7 million residential customers. The power company had 5.7 GW of gross peak demand and 3.6 GW of net peak demand from solar and wind resources. Its aim was to generate half its electricity from renewables by 2030. The study found VPP peaker usage would be 40% to 60% cheaper than alternatives, including gas peakers and grid-scale batteries 
Brattle Group estimated 60 GW of VPP deployment could meet U.S. resource adequacy needs through 2033 for $15 billion to $35 billion less than the cost of alternatives. That level of VPP deployment could also provide more than $20 billion worth of emissions and resilience benefits over the decade.
“VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large scale and utility grade alternative to new generation and system buildout, through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives,” said Jigar Shah, director of Loans Program Office, Department of Energy.

Designed for daily cycling in harsh environments, the battery has an expected lifetime of 20+ years with minimal fade, said Ambri. While the battery is in use in data centers, an announced test with Xcel Energy is the first reported installation by a utility.
Xcel Energy and Ambri plan a year-long test the 300 kWh system at Solar Technology Acceleration Center (SolarTAC) in Aurora, Colorado. SolarTAC is owned and managed by Grey Snow Management Solutions, a tribally owned economic development enterprise. The test center was established in 2009 by original founding member companies Xcel Energy, SunEdison and Abengoa Solar with the mission to test renewable energy technologies in a real-world, grid-connected environments.
Installation of the Xcel system is expected to begin in early 2024, with the system fully operational later in the year. The pilot will test various use cases, including solar and wind integration, capacity management, arbitrage, and ancillary services, among others. It will use the GridNXT Microgrid Platform at SolarTAC to integrate multiple generation sources, such as solar and wind, along with inverters, load banks, and 3-phase distribution connections and communications.
Xcel Energy became the first utility in the United States to set a long-term goal of providing its customers zero-carbon electricity. The utility aims to be net-zero across electricity, heating, and transportation by 2050.
“Xcel Energy is a forward-thinking and ambitious utility, and their enthusiasm for testing our system highlights the huge potential for Liquid Metal batteries,” said Adam Briggs, chief commercial officer at Ambri. “Xcel Energy clearly understands the significant value that can be achieved by integrating innovative storage technologies into their renewable portfolio.”
Xcel Energy plans to develop a follow-on memorandum of understanding (MOU) for larger-capacity long-duration energy storage projects to follow the upcoming 300kWh system at SolarTAC.
“Xcel Energy has always been at the forefront among utilities in the transition to carbon-free electricity,” said Justin Tomljanovic, vice president, corporate development at Xcel Energy. “This demonstration project with Ambri allows us to explore a technology that could help us continue to reliably supply the energy our customers depend on throughout the clean energy transition.”
Ambri’s batteries, manufactured in Milford, Mass., are comprised of a liquid calcium alloy anode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a cathode comprised of solid particles of antimony, enabling the use of low-cost materials and a low number of steps in the cell assembly process.
The company said that the active materials in its cells reversibly alloy and de-alloy while charging and discharging. The electrolyte thermodynamically stable with the electrodes, avoiding side reactions such as film-formation that can lead to performance degradation. The negative electrode is fully consumed when discharged, and reformed on every cycle, resulting in what the company said is a “highly repeatable process with no memory effect.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/19/autonomous-robots-for-solar-installation-gain-traction/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 19, 2023",Autonomous robots for solar installation gain traction,"As the United States pursues a wholesale shift from a fossil fuel-based energy system to one defined by renewables, it is an all-hands-on-deck scenario to stay on track to meet climate goals. Some of these hands may turn out to be robotic. 
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects a demand of 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the United States needs to be on pace with its decarbonization plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, said the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). 
With this challenge in mind, solar developers are increasingly exploring and implementing autonomous, robotic versions of solar installers, particularly at the utility-scale. Two companies making recent moves are Terabase Energy and Sarcos Robotics Corporation. 
Terabase secures funds
Terabase Energy, developer of the Terafab automated installation system, announced it secured $25 million in funding. The capital raise was led by Prelude Ventures, SJF Ventures, and EDP Ventures to support a commercial scale-up of its technology.
The company describes Terafab as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.

Terabase this year also opened a Woodland, California manufacturing facility; “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.
Terabase said its system will double labor productivity when compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas. Today’s launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase.
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in Q3 2023. The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly.
Blattner and Sarcos
Sarcos Technology and Robotics Company found a partner in Blattner Company to provide its automatic, robotic construction solutions to the renewable energy developer. The collaborative agreement focuses on the development and refinement of Sarcos’ autonomous mobile robotic system designed to optimize employee safety and enhance the efficiency of the installation of PV modules for utility-scale solar projects.
“We are extremely optimistic about the use of robots for solar construction to help address the workforce shortages, productivity, and safety challenges that are currently slowing down the progress of U.S. solar initiatives,” said Matt Hadsell, senior manager-innovation and development, Blattner.
Sarcos’ proof-of-concept robotic system consists of an autonomous working vehicle, featuring the company’s Guardian XM robotic arm and an autonomous delivery vehicle. The solution uses cameras to identify where the PV panels need to be installed. The robotic arm then autonomously lifts up the panel using a vacuum system and places it approximately where it needs to be clamped to the mounting structure.
“The arm then goes into a special mode where the person clamping the panel can easily move that panel however they need, in order to align it and attach it into the panels,” Sarcos explains in a video on its website.
The partnership will build upon the Sarcos Outdoor Autonomous Manipulation of Photovoltaic Panels (O-AMPP) project, which is funded through the support of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). The O-AMPP project started in 2021 and Sarcos expects to commercialize its solution by late 2024.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/19/solar-jobs-grow-3-5-in-2022-workforce-challenges-remain/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,CALIFORNIA,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 19, 2023","Solar jobs grow 3.5% in 2022, workforce challenges remain","According to the 13th annual National Solar Jobs Census released by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), full-time jobs in the U.S. solar energy and energy storage industries grew in 2022 and demand will only increase in the future.
The new report finds that the solar energy workforce grew by 3.5% in 2022, with a total of 263,883 solar workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, an increase of 8,846 jobs since 2021. Energy storage jobs grew 4.6% over 2021.
“The solar industry has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade, overcoming one challenge after the next to provide a quarter million jobs for Americans of all educational levels and backgrounds,” said Larry Sherwood, president and CEO at IREC. “With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we can look forward to transformational jobs growth in solar, batteries, and other clean energy industries in the years ahead.”
About two-thirds of the U.S. solar jobs are at installation and project development firms. The strongest growth sector was the residential market, which grew 11% or by about 9,500 jobs. The utility-scale market contracted by about 6,000 jobs in 2022, which was a challenging year due to the threat of solar tariffs and supply chain concerns.
About 33,400 jobs were in manufacturing associated with solar, and that sector is expected to grow as manufacturers of modules, cells and wafers open factories in the U.S. to take advantage of the production tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

California leads the way with a total of 2,404 solar jobs added in 2022, followed by New York (988 jobs), Texas (904 jobs), Florida (506 jobs) and Massachusetts (476 jobs). The top state for energy storage jobs was also California, with a total of 17,580. An interactive state map of jobs in solar and other clean energy industries is available here.
Diversity challenge
In October 2021, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) launched its Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice (DEIJ) Certification Program, which encourages broad participation across the clean energy industries and rewards companies working to create a more inclusive work environment, serve their communities, and attract, hire, promote, and retain diverse talent. SEIA reported good progress in the diversity program, with 45 companies enrolled in its first year.
The IREC report found that the number of women in solar has been on the rise for sometime, showing that women made up 27% of the workforce in 2017 and that has risen to 31% in 2022. The report noted that Black people made up 9% of the workforce, compared to 13% in the overall workforce. Veteran representation in solar is 8%, compared to just 5% in the overall workforce. And the solar workforce is relatively young, with only 13% over 55, compared to 24% nationwide.
Looking at demographics within the various sectors of the solar industry, women make up 30% of the installation and project development sector; however, women make up on 11% of the construction sector. the proportion is 11%. The solar manufacturing sector has about the same percentage of women employees as the overall U.S. manufacturing sector. Black workers make up 9% of the solar manufacturing sector compared to 11% of overall U.S. manufacturing.
“Solar energy projects provide opportunities for professionals with a diverse array of skills and create well-paying jobs in the communities where we build and operate,” said George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy. “What’s more, demand for solar has a ripple effect that creates jobs in other industries that provide critical equipment, fencing and even lunch for our workers, creating returns for local businesses that allow them to hire more workers.”
Finding workers
While providing good paying jobs and appealing to a diversity of workers are noble pursuits, the reality is that the tight labor market in the U.S. continues to create hiring challenges. The report notes that in 2022, 44% of solar industry employers said it was “very difficult” to find qualified applicants—the highest such percentage ever recorded in the Solar Jobs Census.
New workforce-related requirements were put into place by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that aims to address training, pay, diversity and job development in underserved areas.
To meet new apprenticeship requirements, taxpayers must ensure that, for construction that begins before January 1, 2023, at least 10% of labor is performed by qualified apprentices. This steps up to 12.5% for construction that begins after December 31, 2022, and before January 1, 2024. And then bumps up again to 15% for construction that begins after December 31, 2023. In response to the requirements, apprenticeship programs, especially at community colleges, are popping up across the country, rising up to meet the projected need for workers.
The IREC report found that most new hires in 2022 required some previous work experience. Less than half of all new hires required a bachelor’s degree, about a third required an associate’s degree, and almost none required a vocational or post-secondary certificate.
“In 2022, the U.S. solar industry remained resilient and kept more than 263,000 Americans on the payroll,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA. “More than half of all new solar jobs in 2022 did not require a bachelor’s degree, helping even more Americans launch their career in a forward-thinking and mission-driven industry. We’ve also made considerable progress welcoming more women and people of color to the solar industry, but we must continue to create inclusive and intentional workforce development strategies that can deliver our clean energy future.”
Future
Respondents to the Solar Jobs Census survey indicated that they expect a 9%  growth in employees, which would bring the total to 287,632 solar workers. Assuming that supply chain concerns are alleviated and installations ramp up as expected, 2023 could be a year of growth; however, IREC expects the real growth to come next  year and beyond.
IREC notes that the solar industry expects total U.S. installations will multiply fivefold in the next 10 years, from 141 GW in 2022 to over 700 GW in 2033. SEIA optimistically predicts the total number of solar jobs could more than double, reaching 538,000 by 2032.
