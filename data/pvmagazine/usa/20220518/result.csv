In traditional solar panels, covering just 1% of the panel can cause a 33% reduction in power output, and 10% shading can cut production altogether.
San Francisco-based Optivolt saw an opportunity here to deliver a product that can turn shaded areas into sites of plentiful photovoltaic production. The company said its proprietary shade-tolerance technology, Optivolt Pulse, delivers up to 25 times more power in the shade when compared to conventional solar panels.
Pulse is a low-cost shade tolerance system that lives in the junction box and is a drop-in replacement for bypass diodes, using the same panel connections.
When the panel is fully illuminated, the shade tolerance system does nothing, and draws no power. When the panel is shaded, the optimizer goes to work, virtually averaging the dimmed spot across the panel.
The Pulse shade tolerance system is managed by Optivolt Glide, an MPPT controller with 98% efficiency. Together, the two technologies join to form its Thin Mint panel series, devices which range from small 3 W panels for powering single electronic devices to robust 410 W solar modules.
The patent-pending device is currently competing in the Department of Energy’s American-Made Challenge for hardware.
Optivolt said its product represents the next generation of solar panels. It points to the history of solar optimization, saying that the 2000s were focused on reducing macro-scale balance of system losses in large solar facilities, and the 2010s saw the rise in maximum power point tracking (MPPT), with module-level optimization being built into panels to boost production. Now, Optivolt is introducing sub-module optimization, perhaps a new phase in the advancement of solar.
“If you assume the global solar install base was shaded an average of just 1% with a 5% standard deviation, 225 terawatt-hours of energy production was untapped in 2021 due to the limits of today’s solar technology.” said Rohit Kalyanpur, founder and chief executive of Optivolt. “This represents roughly $29B in electricity generation and 11.2 billion kg of carbon emission offsets that went uncaptured. That’s just a conservative estimate, the real figure could be much higher.”
The company said it sees immediate opportunity in distributed and off-grid applications like Internet of Things (IoT) devices, 5G infrastructure, military equipment, robotics, and electric vehicles.
Optivolt was launched in 2018, and recently the company announced its largest funding victory to date, raising $8.2 million in a seed round funding led by Atlas Innovate. Other participating investors included Social Impact Capital, Pure Ventures, City Light Capital, and Peter Relan, who was an initial investor in Discord. The new round brings Optivolt’s funding to $10.1 million.
“What excites us about the technology is that it not only produces dramatic improvement for existing solar applications, but it enables the use of solar in new markets that are in dire need of ‘must-work’ critical power, such as 5G infrastructure and industrial IoT,” said Alain Rothstein, partner at Atlas Innovate.
“Our power grid is becoming increasingly unstable due to the effects of climate change, and it’s predicted that we’ll run out of oil in 41 years at current consumption. Optivolt’s shade tolerant panels deliver reliable off-grid energy to keep machines & critical infrastructure powered even through the most adverse conditions,” said Daniel Kofman, co-founder and CTO of Optivolt.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/18/sandia-turns-to-solar-to-power-the-moon/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,SOFTWARE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 18, 2022",Sandia turns to solar to power the Moon,"Researchers with Sandia National Laboratories, known for their work in designing resilient microgrids for extreme and remote applications, have teamed up with partners at NASA and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez to design a microgrid that can power operations at NASA’s planned Artemis lunar base.
In truth, the team is actually developing two microgrids, one which will power the essential, life-supporting services and research facilities at the Artemis Base Camp, and another that will power mining and processing facilities, set to be located roughly five to 10 miles from the base camp. These mining and processing facilities, assuming all goes to plan, could produce rocket fuel, water, oxygen and other materials needed for extended exploration of the lunar surface while decreasing supply needs from Earth.
The two microgrids will be connected to provide resiliency in the event of any level of failure at either location. One of the core elements of the project will be designing an electrical system controller for the mining and processing center’s microgrid (NASA is in charge of the controller for the base camp), one that allows for maximum energy to be available during mining and research expeditions, but also reliable enough to keep operations at the base camp running safe and smooth, in case there are any issues with the camp’s own power supply.
“It’s a lot of those control questions, its resiliency, its supplying the load effectively,” explained Lee Raskin, an electrical engineer with Sandia. “In this case, it has been flipped a little. We’re not looking so much at how we dispatch the generation so much as we are how can we dispatch a load? How do we determine ‘Well, those loads are actually critical, which loads are less critical? Okay, that’s just an experiment, if they have to not do that experiment for a day, okay. Whereas this load, oh, that’s life support that absolutely positively has to stay.’ We’re figuring out how to control that. It’s analogous, where instead of saying, ‘Oh, hey, what did we do to the sources and the energy storage that were supplying all the load?’ It’s more like ‘What do we have to do on the load side, so that we’re not trying to ask for more than the source can generate?'”
At this point in project research and development (R&D), Raskin and his team are trying to develop control systems to communicate across the line that will ‘tie’ the two microgrids together in a way that will enable them to shift power from one to the other based on which loads are actually critical. Every single thing on the base or at the mining station will be tiered by how critical they are to survival and base operations, using criteria delivered by NASA, and the control system is being developed to ensure that the most critical loads stay on-line, even in the face of unexpected interruptions, like a small meteorite hitting a PV module.
Before any control system design can be done, however, the researchers need to have a clear understanding of how their hardware will operate in space and what differences in operation will arise for a solar system being installed. But how does a researcher on earth model for system performance in space?
“Here in our Albuquerque site, we have what is known as the Distributed Energy Technology Laboratory,” explained Rachid Darbali-Zamora, another electrical engineer with Sandia working on the project and a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez. “One of the platforms that we have is known as power hardware-in-the-loop. It enables us to connect a hardware physical device into a simulation environment through the use of power amplifiers and current transducers. The idea is that you have an actual physical power converter and a simulation of the lunar habitat, you can create an event in the simulation, and the power converter will respond to it. The response of the power converter is sent to the simulation, closing the  loop.”
Darbali-Zamora continued to explain that the system gives Sandia the ability to create an environmental simulation model that represents the lunar habitat and run different case scenarios to see how some of the hardware responds to it.
And while all of this testing and modeling is being done to determine hardware and control system efficacy in lunar applications, the Moon isn’t the only remote, isolated location with a need for a resilient microgrid power supply. Both Raskin and Darbali-Zamora anticipate that their R&D efforts will provide the basis for new control schemes or power architectures for terrestrial applications.
Bringing innovation home
“There’s a lot of things that we’re researching that have implications here on Earth; for remote communities that are affected by, let’s say a loss of a solar panels, but maybe instead of a meteorite, they’re damaged by a hurricane,” explained Darbali-Zamora.” Maybe this could have implications in Puerto Rico, or maybe for studying a system that is isolated, and it’s not connected to the bulk grid. Sure, it could be a lunar habitat, but it also could be a community in Alaska. When we look at critical loads, heating is important on the Moon. In Alaska, that’s also a critical load that we have to maintain.”
The Artemis lunar base microgrid project also marks the first time that Sandia National Labs, NASA, and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez have collaborated on a project, something the team, particularly Raskin and Darbali-Zamora, are excited about. Since the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which destroyed virtually all of the island’s transmission infrastructure, Puerto Rico has become a sort of proving ground for the development of resilient microgrids, as the island frequently falls in the path of powerful, destructive hurricanes.
A combination of microgrids and renewable energy was mandated in summer 2020 during the development of a utility integrated resource plan (IRP) for the island. The mandate came from the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, the island’s chief energy regulator. Puerto Rico’s utility, PREPA, had been developing its IRP since March 2018. The energy bureau ruled that microgrids must be a central part of grid planning.
While the Sandia team’s project sounds just like something out of an Asimov story, the breakthroughs that they discover may be just as  impactful for existing communities on Earth as they will be for future communities among the stars.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/18/legal-petition-calls-for-an-ftc-investigation-into-electric-utility-abuses/,"BUSINESS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 18, 2022",Legal petition calls for an FTC investigation into electric utility abuses,"More than 230 consumer, environmental and public interest groups urged the Federal Trade Commission today to investigate the electric utility industry for widespread abuses. These include bribery, fake dark-money campaigns and denying customers access to renewable energy.
A recent national survey found that nearly three-quarters of solar developers experience delays in interconnecting projects to the electric grid. An overwhelming majority (85%) respondents specifically named utility noncompliance with interconnection procedures as a problem. Project setbacks are well documented, and just over  three quarters of respondents reported unexpected delays and/or costs as a result of changes to state interconnection policies.
These delays can increase the cost of distributed solar projects and cause customers to back out of long-delayed projects. Minnesota regulators fined Xcel Energy $1 million for failing to keep pace with a backlog of projects. Two years later the backlog remains a barrier to solar growth. In another survey conducted by LevelTen, nearly 90% of renewable developers said that interconnection timelines and costs represented the biggest barrier to achieving 40% solar by 2035, a goal of the US Department of Energy.
In an editorial in pv magazine, Gwen Brown and Sky Stanfield of the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, stated that utilities need greater accountability because they have no incentive to create efficient interconnection processes on their own. “In many places, utilities continue to see DERs as either direct competition to utility-owned resources, or at best, are generally neutral on whether they thrive. Utilities have an absolute monopoly on grid access in their territories. As a result, the utilities hold all the cards in the interconnection process and there is no competitive pressure for utilities to improve the service they provide to interconnection customers.”
“Today abusive utility practices are leading to increased electricity rates, obstruction of clean energy competitors in the face of climate change, and utility interference in democratic processes,” the groups said in the petition to the FTC. “The urgency for a federal investigation of utility companies’ unfair competitive and anti-democratic practices at this time cannot be overstated.”
The Petition includes detailed examples of two classes of electric utility abuses:  unfair competitive actions that harm clean energy competitors, including consumers generating their own renewable electricity; and unfair and deceptive acts, including corrupt dealings and voting interference, that enrich utilities and ultimately drive up consumer electricity rates and decrease consumer choice. The petition details widespread abuses by monopoly electric utilities across the country. One example of such abuse is the Ohio utility FirstEnergy that paid $60 million in bribes to the Ohio House speaker’s political machine. In return the utility secured a $1 billion ratepayer-funded bailout for several of its unprofitable nuclear and coal plants. In another instance, Florida Power and Light spent millions of dollars on political consultants who engineered a scheme to siphon votes to third-party “ghost candidates” from candidates committed to holding utilities accountable, according to reporting by the Orlando Sentinel. That candidate won in all three races; one utility opponent lost by just 32 votes.
“Monopoly utilities are out of control,” said Anya Schoolman, executive director of Solar United Neighbors. “It’s time federal regulators step in and protect consumers.”
The petition states that the investigation requested would rely on the historical precedent set by a seven-year long FTC investigation in the 1920s when massive industry consolidation led to consumer abuse, corruption and an unrelenting campaign against public power competitors. That investigations’ findings laid the groundwork for the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which set limits on utility companies’ ability to merge and manipulate the market. Congress repealed the Act in 2005, worsening many of the problems the United States is seeing today.
“Utilities are gouging ratepayers and cutting off power while they line the pockets of politicians and rig the system to block planet-saving renewable energy,” said Jean Su, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s energy justice program. “Like it did a century ago, the FTC should use its authority to investigate the broken utility industry and stop this blatant self-dealing. The FTC needs to stand up for consumers and give renewable energy competition a fighting chance.”
Last week a fifth member of the Federal Trade Commission was confirmed, so the FTC is now at full strength. Advocates say the FTC should take action to stop the utility abuses and recommend legislation that will protect consumers.
“Employing its expansive investigative powers, the FTC can help build a comprehensive factual record for legislative and administrative reconstruction of the power sector to ensure public accountability and sustainability,” said Sandeep Vaheesan of the Open Market Institute. “The commission has a history of exposing the abuses, inefficiencies and unprecedented propaganda efforts of utility companies. As it did nearly a century ago, the FTC can lay the groundwork for utility reform and help rein in the power of these massive corporations.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/18/is-solar-worth-it/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 18, 2022",Is residential solar worth it?,"When shopping for a home solar system, sometimes the quoted price can leave you wondering why someone would move forward with something that seems so expensive. 
When compared with the status quo, electricity delivered from the utility, the price may not seem so high after all. First, pv magazine will examine the status quo, and how much you can expect to pay for power if you don’t get solar panels. Then, we will examine the average cost of solar arrays today and introduce incentives that boost home solar value.
The cost of doing nothing
Generally, early adopters have financially benefited from going solar by securing price certainty and stemming the impact of steadily increasing utility-bill costs.
End-use residential electric customers pay an average of $0.138/kWh in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In California, that rate is $0.256/kWh, it averages $0.246/kWh across New England, $0.126/kWh in the South Atlantic region, and $0.124/kWh in the Mountain West region.
EIA reports that the average home uses 893 kWh per month, so based on the average retail rate of $0.138/kWh, that’s an electric bill of about $123 monthly, or $229 monthly in California.
Over the last 20 years, EIA data show that retail electricity prices have increased 59% across the United States, or 2.95% each year. That means in 20 years, the average monthly bill across the US would increase to $213 a month, and in California monthly bills would be $398 on average.
This means based on historical rates, the average US homeowner can expect to pay $39,460 over the next 20 years on electricity bills. On average, Californians could pay $73,465 over 20 years.
Recent global events show just how unstable prices can be for commodities, and energy is no exception here. What will your utility bill cost in 20 years?
These estimated bills also assume that energy use in the home is constant over 20 years, but as the United States electrifies its homes, adds more devices, and adopts electric vehicles, it is fair to expect that many homeowners will use more electricity going forward.

Another factor that may exacerbate rate raising is the upgrade of the national transmission grid. The infrastructure that delivers power to our homes is aging and in need of critical upgrades, and it is estimated that a staggering $500 billion will be spent on transmission buildout by 2035. This half-trillion-dollar cost gets passed down to homeowners in the form of raised utility bill rates.
The benefit of backup power may increase as time goes on as well. Power outages are on the rise across the United States, and analysis of EIA data by the Associated Press shows that outages related to severe weather events have doubled in the last 20 years. Climate change-fueled storms are expected to continue to rise, so the role of battery backup in providing reliable energy may increase significantly.
The truth is, we don’t know how much power will cost in 20 years. Though it has increased 59% across the nation in the last 20 years, there is no way to be certain what it will cost going forward. That is where solar has a benefit over the status quo. By purchasing solar, you are securing price certainty going forward, making it easier to budget and plan for the future.
So how do these costs compare to going solar?
Cost of solar
As a general trend, prices for solar have fallen. In 2010, it cost about $40,000 to install a residential solar system, and since then, prices have fallen by as much as 70%, and about 37% in the last five years. However, prices have increased slightly in 2022 due to shipping costs, materials costs, and possible tariffs being placed on imported solar goods, and these pressures aren’t expected to be alleviated in the near-term.
When comparing quotes, the best metric for an apples-to-apples comparison is the cost per watt. Price benchmarking by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows the average cost per watt for the nation was $2.65/W DC in 2021, and the average system size was 7.15 kW. So, an average system would cost about $18,950. With 12.5 kWh of battery energy storage, the average cost was $4.26/W, representing an average price tag of $30,460 with batteries included.

The prices above do not include any incentives. Currently, the federal government applies a 26% investment tax credit to the system, bringing down system costs for those who qualify to $14,023 without batteries, and $22,540 with batteries. Compared to the potential $39,460 in utility bills, buying a solar system outright in cash appears to show a clear financial benefit.
Many homeowners will need financing to buy a solar system. Shorter terms can achieve rates as low as 2.99% or less, but financing for a 20-year solar loan typically lands between 5% to 8% or more. Based on 20-year, 7% annual percentage rate terms, a $14,000 system would total about $26,000 in loan payments over 20 years, and the system with batteries included would total about $42,000 in loan payments.
Often when you adopt solar, the utility will still charge you a grid access fee even if your system produces 100% of your needs. These vary from utility to utility but are often around $10 a month. Over 20 years, that equates to about $2,400 that you’ll still need to pay to the utility, plus any costs for energy you use beyond what your system provides.
Based on these average figures, a homeowner could expect to see as much as $12,000 in savings with a 20-year financed system. Homeowners in regions whose retail energy price exceeds the national average could see savings in multiples of that figure.
Image: SolarEdge
Though in this example batteries appear to be marginally more expensive than the status quo over a 20-year term, they improve the home by adding the crucial service of backup power, and increasingly are being approved to participate in grid services, potentially unlocking additional revenue streams for homeowners.
Another thing to note is most solar systems are warranted for 25 years rather than the 20 used in the status quo example. A panel can last a good 35 years, and though it will begin to produce less in old age, any power produced by a panel you own is money back in your pocket.
Incentives and home value
Many states have additional incentives to boost the value of solar, too. Checking the Database of State Incentives for Renewables (DSIRE) will show the incentives available in your state, and a solar representative should be able to walk you through these benefits when you receive a quote. State incentives change frequently and vary widely, and in some cases are quite rich, offering thousands of dollars in additional benefits.
Another factor to consider is home value. A study by Zillow found that solar arrays increase a home value by 4.1% on average. For a $375,000 home, that’s an increase of $15,375 in value. In most states home solar is exempt from property taxes, making it a great way to boost value without paying taxes for it.
Bottom line
We’ve shared a lot of data on national averages and the potential cost of power going forward, but is solar for you? In the past, early adopters have been rewarded for going solar, and celebrate when they see $0 electric bills paid to the utility company.
Each home is different, each utility is different, and each homeowner has different needs, so evaluating whether solar is right for your home will take a little time and analysis. Representatives from solar companies will walk you through this analysis, and it’s generally a good rule of thumb to get at least three quotes for comparison.
A great resource for starting your research is the Solar Calculator developed by informational site SolarReviews. The calculator offers a quote and savings estimate based on local rates and incentives available to your area. The website also features reviews of installers, equipment, and more.
Some people will save tens of thousands of dollars in the long run with solar, while others may witness more modest savings. Solar will also provide the home clean, local energy, making an impact both on mitigating climate change and in supporting local jobs.
One indisputable benefit of solar is that it will offer greater clarity into what your electricity bills will cost over the next couple of decades, rather than leaving you exposed to whatever rates the utility company decides to charge in the future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/18/an-american-at-intersolar-part-ii-solar-panels/,"BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,GERMANY",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 18, 2022","An American at Intersolar, Part II – Solar Panels","The first thing to notice about the Intersolar Europe 2022 show in Munich is that the solar panels are a big part of the show – literally and figuratively.
Solar panels completely fill the show’s first two halls – and spill over into a third. Some solar panels are big – nearly eight feet tall. The Canadian Solar module below, at 2,384 millimeters in height, is the standard size large module on the floor – that’s about 7’9” for those in the United States.

All of the major solar panel manufacturers had a similarly sized, highest wattage and usually highest efficiency module in this same form factor.
The manufacturers often showed off a broad array of module sizes. One group showed a lineup of six uniquely sized modules – everything from their smallest 12- and 24-volt off-grid panels, to residential units and commercial modules, and then two utility scale products.
Without a doubt, there is much less of a standard size to solar modules than there used to be.
The featured image in this article shows Meyer Burger’s new residential solar tiles being installed at their booth. As we can see in the image, these units are meant to be climbed on by the installation crew during the installation, as opposed to standard modules, which must be handled cautiously.

The 15.9% efficiency units snap into place, and were casually tossed from one installation team member to the other. The installation seems much more Lego-like than a typical solar installation. It was very exciting to watch, and there was a pretty good crowd surrounding the Meyer Burger booth all day.
Agrivoltaic-specific solar modules were on display as well.
These units were most often glass-glass bifacial panels with extra spacing between the solar cells to allow for specific amounts of light to pass through the modules and foster the plant life below.

The Agora M-50 260-watt module was designed to allow 40% of all light to pass between its 50 solar cells.
Agora was one of the only companies to share a solar module specifically designed for agrivoltaics, but many other solar panel and racking manufacturers referenced agrivoltaics in their imagery and marketing.
With a cornucopia of panels available, some of the countless, subtle innovations were sure to have been overlooked by the majority of buyers.

The solar panel above, by Dah Solar, adjusts the design of the aluminum frame around the solar panel. This brings the glass edge equal in height to the frame edge, limiting the pooling of water and therefore reducing mineral deposits in the corners of the module.
This was one of at least two micro-innovations that specifically focused on the corners of solar modules at the show.
There was also a nice presentation of panel flexibility by Suman Solar Panels.

The bending of this solar panel continued for three days straight. The representative said that the module has both solar cell and cell interconnection innovations that allow them to withstand persistent bending and twisting.
Walking among the attendees and listening intently whenever English was spoken, there was a lot of talk about expanding solar panel manufacturing in Europe, and about Meyer Burger being sold out. Conversations also focused on residential contractors, who have recently become so busy that they aren’t focused on sales right now, but are instead preoccupied with getting proposals out quickly, taking in orders, and managing the associated installation processes.
Multiple parties suggested that electricity pricing, along with the war in Ukraine, have been driving up solar demand across all of Europe. Germany’s solar market is particularly heated right now.
German demand for energy storage coupled with residential solar is so significant that one group, which has been installing ~700 projects a year, has considered offering only solar-plus-storage. However, one hitch in their plan is that the advanced inverters that manage batteries are challenging to procure due to global chip shortages.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/18/solar-and-affordable-housing-developments-what-you-need-to-know/,"COMMUNITY,CONSUMER PROTECTION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"MAY 18, 2022",Solar and affordable housing developments: What you need to know,"To date, 24 states have enacted net-zero carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) electricity production goals. Public policymakers look to carbon-neutral solar to help realize these goals, with full compliance expected between 2030 and 2050. To maintain and increase solar adoption nationwide, developers must consider how to best serve low-income communities in support of the net-zero agenda. These communities may lack the property assets and upfront resources required for self-owned residential solar and, therefore, present opportunities for solar growth as a largely untapped market.
Both housing developers and underserved communities alike can benefit greatly from increasing public funding opportunities for solar. As interest in projects that address environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of investment continues to grow, integrating renewable energy in affordable housing projects can provide significant sustainability benefits to developers, municipalities, and end users.
But what are the most important considerations for implementing solar as part of affordable housing development projects? Let’s take a look.
Solar systems, design & permitting
Ground mount, rooftop, or carport racking systems are among the options developers can consider for incorporating solar at affordable housing developments.
Ground mount systems require available physical space and special permit considerations, particularly when located on a “green field” or previously undisturbed site. In these instances, developers can alternatively use unutilized rooftop space on larger, multifamily buildings. HVAC equipment and piping pathways should be designed with room for solar in mind. Rooftop solar can reduce facility-cooling costs when combined with reflective roof coatings or bifacial modules to boost production.
For states with established community solar offtake policies, the case for offsite ground mount systems can be made. Selecting a brownfield site minimizes environmental impact concerns and presents opportunities for additional funding, such as with New York’s NYSERDA brownfield incentive, which can be further combined with the Inclusive Community Solar Adder.
Solar carports are another option, which can protect tenants from inclement weather while redirecting precipitation to improve ground conditions, nourish landscaping, minimize winter maintenance, and reduce urban heat islanding. These features can help make the case for green building fund eligibility, like the federal Enterprise Green Communities program, a compelling advantage in the face of high structural steel costs.
Additional design considerations include integrating complementary emerging technologies to highlight a facility’s holistic commitment to net-zero. The “all-electric” building approach can leverage technical improvements in electric heat pumps while preempting pending New York legislation to ban gas hook ups in new buildings, citing climate change concerns. It’s also a safer, lower-carbon operations strategy.
What’s more, some housing developers have begun adding electric vehicle (EV) charging stations to upcoming projects, increasing equitable access to renewable transportation modes. National Grid, an electric utility in New York, manages projects and community engagement for the EV Charging Station “Make Ready” program. This incentive is available for property owners and managers of multi-unit dwellings and can cover up to 100% of EV charger infrastructure costs, like distribution transformers, conduit, and conductors.
For residents without vehicles, proximity to clean transportation must also be taken into consideration. Many states are committing to the electrification of their public bus fleets while policymakers explore new transportation strategies for reducing GHG emissions and other localized pollution.
Public funding & incentives
A review of available funding programs and their eligibility requirements should occur in conjunction with early site selection planning to give developers the best chance at project realization. After all, financial feasibility is still the greatest driver of solar investment.
The complexity of connecting resources across multiple funding sources with unique administration requirements is a significant obstacle to market development. As such, many believe the key for market expansion is a greater collaboration between local, state, and federal incentive programs and more emphasis on non-economic solar benefits that are more difficult to quantify.
Greater technical assistance for funding applicants—particularly to publicize and connect ESG-focused resources—is needed. Unifying funding applications may also help developers reach investment decisions sooner, relieving pressure on clogged electrical interconnection queues.
Thankfully, we’re beginning to see a response to these needs. For example, New York-based Homes and Community Renewal and NYSERDA recently partnered to develop the Clean Energy Initiative, which offsets the costs of adding sustainable features to affordable housing projects, especially those already in existing state bond finance and federal low-income housing tax credit programs.
Community benefits
Low-income neighborhoods have historically been subject to unsightly and harmful infrastructure and manufacturing developments. As we transition away from fossil fuels, solar advocacy organizations like Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) work diligently to engage impacted neighbors when siting projects. SEIA also works to develop educational and workforce training opportunities alongside solar installations, reframing residents as active participants in the new energy economy.
Another important benefit of increasing renewable energy generation is the offset of negative health impacts from coal-fired power. The Multi-Pollutant Power Plant Strategy – introduced this year by the EPA – sets the stage for increasing recognition of the relationship between coal-fired power production and negative health outcomes. This consideration is expected to make siting new coal-fired power plants more difficult, thereby increasing the attractiveness of solar investment.
Utility bills are often an unpredictable portion of an affordable housing community’s operating budget. By stabilizing power pricing and simplifying the owner’s financial projections, solar delivers lower and more predictable energy pricing – especially on all-electric projects. This is an important benefit for price-sensitive tenants.
A final word
Solar deployment on affordable housing projects can be used to better distribute the benefits of renewable energy to all communities, especially historically underserved populations. When coupled with ambitious carbon reduction and renewable energy mandates, the case for solar on affordable housing is a powerful one.

Flexibility is at the heart of the latest battery storage innovations coming from South Korean battery company LG Energy Solution. As seen at the Smarter E event in Munich last week, LG Chem’s energy storage and battery division has gone one step further in modularizing its RESU Flex home battery system. It has also developed a new containerized, grid-scale energy storage solution that is delivered pre-assembled.
True to its name, the modular RESU Flex residential battery storage solution can be installed in various capacities, ranging from to 8.6 kWh to 17.2 kWh, with more than 30 different installation forms to maximize space efficiency. According to customer preferences, RESU Flex can be installed on any surface, indoor or outdoor, said the manufacturer.
Depending on the configuration, RESU Flex has a voltage range of 192 V to 531.2 V and can serve different energy usage patterns. The 8.6 kWh system, which features two battery modules and a battery protection unit, is primarily designed to support self-consumption, shaving peak hour loads and back-up critical loads in emergency. The three-battery module unit with 12.9 kWh capacity can cover energy-consuming devices, such as heat pumps and EVs, as well as provide back up to critical loads in emergency. The 17.2 kWh system is well-equipped for a wide range of applications from home to small C&I, as well as a whole home backup, depending on the functionality of the inverter.
The battery module measures 665.2 mm x 665.2 mm x 148.4 mmm and weighs in at 48.9 kg. All configurations come with a separate battery protection unit which weighs at 16.6 kg. The operating temperature range goes from -10 C to 50 C. The product also features an IP55 protection level.
In addition to single-phase inverters, RESU Flex is compatible with three-phase inverters made by Kostal, Fronius, SMA and GoodWe. As Jorg Jurgens, LGES director of energy storage systems EMEA, confirmed to pv magazine, RESU Flex is readily available for shipment. If ordered today, it would be delivered in just a couple of weeks, which is much faster than the time frames offered by most battery manufacturers. Current order waiting times are around five months in Germany, for example.
The new RESU Flex series will feature the NMC battery chemistry. The South Korean manufacturer has long been faithful to NMC, but it now plans to develop and release LFP-standard cells by October 2023 and LFP long cells by the fourth quarter of 2024. Jurgens told pv magazine that the transition will be a smooth one, as the LFP cells will be produced in the same format and sizes, so the systems will be able to use the same modules and racks as before.
The new battery cells will be made in Holland in the US state of Michigan, with double-digit gigawatt-scale production lines being added to the facility, Jurgens said. This aligns with an earlier announcement from LG Energy Solution that it is pouring in $1.7 billion to increase the production capacity for battery cells and packs at the Michigan plan, up fivefold from 5 GWh at present.
Residential recalls 
The switch to the safer nickel and cobalt-free battery chemistry follows LG Energy Solution’s forced recall of some of its battery energy storage systems in the United States and Australia due to potential fire-related risks. In March 2021, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a recall notice for batteries in LG Energy Solution’s lithium-ion RESU residential range, due to the potential risk of overheating and catching fire.
Only a couple of months later, LG Energy Solutions itself launched a free replacement program for certain models that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program, which was assessed to cost around $350 million, was announced after overheating incidents were reported.
Last August, LG Energy Solution Michigan launched a recall campaign for its RESU 10H batteries in the US market that affected about 10,000 storage systems. “The home batteries can overheat, poising a risk of fire and emission of harmful smoke,” the manufacturer said at the time. The recall was launched on the back of five reports of the lithium storage batteries smoking and catching on fire, resulting in property damage and one injury.
The first recall of its residential batteries in the United States took place only weeks after the manufacturer launched the new line of products in December 2020. It affected 1,815 RESU 10H units sold between January 2017 and March 2019. The reason behind the recall were reports of LG Chem RESU 10H fires resulting in minor property damage but no injuries.
Other innovations that LG Energy Solutions presented last week in Munich include the new container-based ESS solution is delivered fully assembled at the factory. It said this reduces the site installation time by 40% and cost by 30%. Compared to conventional 40-foot ISO systems, the modular and scalable containerized ESS solution reduces the installation area by 15%, saving costs incorporated with land. It is designed as more than a simple battery rack system, incorporating an active ventilation system, a fire suppression system and a HVAC system.
The company also showcased other high-performance, grid-based ESS products in its portfolio, including a high-voltage rack (1,400V) and the Transportable Rack 1300, a pre-engineered rack system optimized for indoor conditions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/05/18/new-belgium-brews-beer-with-the-help-of-the-sun/,"BUSINESS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SUSTAINABILITY,NORTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 18, 2022",New Belgium brews beer with the help of the sun,"New Belgium Brewing, headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado and famous for its Fat Tire beer and Voodoo Ranger IPA, has announced the completion of a solar installation at its Asheville brewery.
The 446 kW system, installed by Renu Energy Solutions, spans the facility’s 114,000 square foot roof, generating an estimated 620,000 kWh of electricity annually. The installation is comprised of 1,063 Q-Cells Q.Peak Duo L-G6.3 BFG 420W modules, three SolarEdge SE100KUS inverters and one SolarEdge SE66.6KUS inverter, and 527 SolarEdge P960 optimizers, all mounted on a QuickMount QRail Standard pitched racking system.
The new solar installation in Asheville more than doubles the solar power that New Belgium previously provided across both of its breweries, building on the company’s first rooftop solar initiative at its original Fort Collins, Colorado brewery back in 2010. Over 25 years, the renewable energy now being produced in Asheville will offset roughly 11,100 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to eliminating the greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 2,200 passenger cars annually, according to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies calculator.
“As we celebrate 10 years since announcing our move to Asheville with a brewery designed for rooftop solar, we’re thrilled to make good on our commitment to add more renewable energy to the grid,” said Jay Richardson, general manager of New Belgium Brewing Asheville
In August 2020, New Belgium announced that its Fat Tire Amber Ale became America’s first nationally distributed carbon-neutral beer, made possible via New Belgium’s ongoing renewable commitments, including powering its breweries with wind power and producing electricity with solar and biogas technology. The company’s first installation was a 200 kW rooftop system in Fort Collins, followed by a 96kW solar array, added in 2015. The Asheville installation was completed by Renu Energy Solutions, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and is Renu’s largest brewery install to date. Renu is also working on a solar installation at New Belgium’s east coast distribution center in Enka, NC. Once complete, the 503.2kW PV array will consist of 1,184 panels.
“We are honored to serve as New Belgium Brewing’s installation partner for their spectacular solar project in Asheville, NC,” said Jay Radcliffe, CEO of Renu Energy Solutions. “With our shared commitment to the Asheville community, our partnership with New Belgium showcases building renewable energy directly within a community, placing clean energy production closest to where energy is consumed.”
New Belgium also developed the first carbon footprint study for beer, and has donated significant money to climate and environmental causes.
A growing number of breweries across the country are looking to make solar a part of their Environmental, Social, and Governance portfolios.  At the end of April, Vermont’s Lawson’s Finest Liquids announced the completion of what it says is the largest solar canopy in the state. The canopy, built by SunCommon, features 495 REC 375W solar modules, which are arranged above 40 covered parking spaces. Customers with electric vehicles can top off the battery at the 10 level-two electric vehicle charging stations.  The Waitsfield Brewery and Taproom was generating about 10% of the electricity to run its operation, but with the addition of 215 kW from 495 solar modules, it expects that 60% of its electricity bill will be offset with net metering credits.
LG also released a case study last summer outlining  the company’s work with Lagunitas Brewery, showing the struggles overcome and the innovation needed to deliver a project that met the needs of such a unique customer. The $5 million-dollar, 2.1 MW solar project, inclusive of more than 6,000 LG solar panels, was able to offset about two thirds (60%) of the brewery’s energy use and budget during its first year of operation. Prior to the installation, the brewery spent about $1 million annually on electricity. For a different perspective, the solar panels generate enough power for more than 600 average-sized homes.
