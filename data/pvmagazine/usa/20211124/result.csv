https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/24/itc-says-that-section-201-tariffs-should-be-extended/,"BUSINESS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",ITC says that Section 201 tariffs should be extended,"The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) has determined that tariffs continue to be necessary for U.S. industry producing crystalline silicon PV cells.
All five commissioners determined that so-called Section 201 “safeguard” tariffs continue to be necessary to “prevent or remedy serious injury to the U.S. industry,” and that evidence exists that the domestic industry is “making a positive adjustment” to import competition.
The USITC will forward its report on its investigation and determination to President Joe Biden by December 8. The president will make the final decision on whether to extend the import relief.
Chair Jason E. Kearns, Vice Chair Randolph J. Stayin, and Commissioners David S. Johanson, Rhonda K. Schmidtlein, and Amy A. Karpel all voted in the affirmative.
Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement, “Four years of tariffs has proven to be an ineffective way to incentivize solar manufacturing and create American jobs.”
She said that a new round of Trump-era safeguard tariffs “will hamper U.S. solar development.”  SEIA has argued that under the Section 201 tariffs, the U.S. lost out on 62,000 solar jobs, including a net-loss of 6,000 solar manufacturing jobs.
In a guest column for pv magazine earlier in November, Brian Lynch, director of solar sales for LG Electronics USA wrote, that opposition to the tariffs in 2018 highlighted the possibility for project cancellations and lost jobs if the tariffs were to be imposed. He wrote that at a macro level, “the solar industry has exceeded every forecast during the period of the tariffs in every category— from megawatts deployed to jobs created.” Lynch offered formal testimony to the USITC at its November 3 hearing on the extension.
Lynch said that enough U.S. manufacturing capacity existed (or was in the pipeline) to support roughly one-third of installer demand, writing that “a lot of this capacity was brought online since the Section 201 tariffs went into effect and a lot more has been announced.”
George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy, a utility-scale solar installer, said the USITC’s decision “will come at the cost of American jobs and the President’s clean energy goals. Solar tariffs create more barriers to the deployment of renewables and lead to higher costs for consumers, stifling the transformation of our energy landscape.”
He called on Biden to end “all unnecessary tariffs” on the solar industry and work with Congress to support a long-term manufacturing policy for the solar supply chain.
At the beginning of August, two manufacturers, Suniva and Auxin Solar, filed a petition asking the USITC to investigate extending the Section 201 (s201) tariffs for another four years. Three days later a second petition was filed by Hanwha Q Cells, LG Electronics, and Mission Solar, which also included an ask that the Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) be increased to 5 GW (from the current 2.5 GW).
The s201 tariff is imposed on all solar modules imported into the U.S. that don’t meet exemption status as published in the Federal Register. The current s201 tariff is 18% and, if the tariff is not extended, would drop to 0% in February 2022.
Under trade law, if the USITC grants an extension of the s201 tariff it will last no longer than four years and cannot be extended again. The rate must also drop annually.
Expectations are that module prices likely will not go up as a result of the s201 tariffs being extended, as the tariff rates cannot increase from their current levels.
The Commission’s public report Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled into Other Products, (Inv. No. TA-201-075 (Extension), USITC Publication 5206, December 2021) will include the Commission’s findings and is expected to be available in late December.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/24/utilities-seek-ok-from-west-virginia-regulators-for-five-solar-projects/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WEST VIRGINIA",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",Utilities seek OK from West Virginia regulators for five solar projects,"Mon Power and Potomac Edison asked the Public Service Commission of West Virginia to approve five solar energy projects throughout the companies’ service territory in the state.
Together, the facilities would generate 50 MW of renewable energy.
The application supports a 2020 bill passed by the West Virginia legislature that authorizes electric utilities to own and operate up to 200 MW of renewable generation facilities to help meet the state’s electricity needs. A statement said the addition of new renewable generation may encourage economic development, as a “growing number of companies” require that a portion of the electricity they buy be generated by renewable sources.
If approved, Mon Power would build, own and operate the five solar facilities. The energy produced would be available for purchase by Mon Power and Potomac Edison customers in West Virginia. Customers who participate in the program would receive the equivalent of one solar renewable energy credit (SREC) for each megawatt hour of energy purchased.
The cost of the solar generation would be paid for by Mon Power and Potomac Edison customers in West Virginia through a solar surcharge until all the energy credits are purchased by program participants. The utilities are operating units of First Energy.
Once approved, procurement, groundbreaking, and permitting would begin on the first phase as soon as 2022, with all five expected to be completed before the end of 2025.
Four of the five proposed sites are on property owned by Mon Power or its affiliates, and the fifth location is still under review. The sites include a 26-acre reclaimed ash disposal site in Berkeley County, a 51-acre site adjacent to a Mon Power substation in Hancock County, a 95-acre site in Monongalia County, and a 44-acre reclaimed strip mine property in Tucker County.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/24/up-38-year-over-year-through-3q-solar-leads-u-s-capacity-additions/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",Solar capacity additions show a recovery from a subdued 2020,"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released data that show solar leading the way in capacity additions, with 8,410 MW added through the first three quarters of 2021.
That is an increase of 38% over the first three quarters of 2020, potentially indicating a bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic, and general growth of the industry. 
Solar PV represented 44% of all capacity additions; wind added the second-most with 43% of the share. Renewable energy now represents 25% of total U.S. available generating capacity. This is greater than coal (19%), which used to hold the greatest share of the generation mix. Five years ago, renewables were 18.45%, and a decade ago the sector represented 14% of total capacity.
Solar PV has had a 37-fold increase in capacity in 10 years, and that figure does not include distributed (i.e. rooftop) solar.
FERC reported a pipeline of 168,601 MW of new solar planned, with 51,758 MW classified as “high probability” projects, indicating a continued strong growth outlook. Around 92 MW of PV was expected to be retired, according to the data.
If FERC’s growth outlook holds true, by 2024 renewable energy should represent just over 30% of capacity, and solar would account for 8.88%.
“Whether one compares solar’s growth to that of last year or a decade ago or three years hence, the conclusion is the same — it has been, and continues to be, explosive … and wind has not been far behind,” said Ken Bossong, executive director of the SUN DAY Campaign, which analyzed the data. “And this growth can only accelerate if recent COP26 commitments are kept and the proposed federal Build Back Better legislation is enacted into law.”

(CATL) to cooperate in the areas of battery storage systems, supply of lithium-ion battery modules, operation and maintenance services of battery storage projects, and innovative renewable energy technology.
Canadian Solar said it has a global battery storage pipeline of 21 GWh, including 2.9 GWh under construction. Through the first three quarters of 2021, the company said it delivered around 550 MWh of battery storage shipments.
In its third quarter earnings statement, the company said that energy storage market growth is being driven by technology improvements, falling battery storage costs, rising penetration of renewable energy, and accelerating retirements of fossil fuel capacity.
CSI Solar said its approach is to pair battery energy storage systems with long-term service agreements, including future battery capacity upgrades.
In a statement announcing the framework agreement, Tan Libin, CATL’s vice president, said that his company’s competitive advantage rests on delivering batteries across various applications, while Canadian Solar is “one of the key players” in the global battery energy storage business. “Our partnership with Canadian Solar is a perfect match and allows us to build on both our strengths,” the statement said.
