This change, combined with rising interest rates, has posed some new challenges for rooftop solar installers, and new solutions are arising to ensure customers get a solid return on investment.
Enphase, the nation’s largest supplier of microinverters, announced it released updates to its product offerings that are designed to optimize return on investment under the NEM 3.0 environment. The release includes new configurations for the operation of its microinverters and batteries, as well as an NEM 3.0-focused feature in its Solargraf design and proposal software platform.
“Our financial analysis shows that with solar and batteries, homeowners can expect bill offsets between 70% and 90% and a payback period between 5 and 7 years for a cash system,” said Mehran Sedigh, vice president and general manager of the storage business unit at Enphase Energy. “These are compelling economics for homeowners, and we believe installers can thrive under NEM 3.0 with Enphase Energy Systems.”
Under NEM 3.0, the value of buying and selling electricity varies greatly by the time of day and month. The rules incentivize solar-plus-battery owners to avoid buying electricity during times of high utility demand, while compensating them for exporting during these peak demand hours. Enphase’s NEM 3.0-focused system enables homeowners to configure their systems to automatically self-consume and sell energy at optimal times, while retaining backup power reserves for times when the grid is down.
The company is also offering a grid-tied battery configuration that enables energy self-consumption and saving modes of operation without adding backup power for outages. This configuration minimizes system components used, focusing on reduced upfront costs and ease-of-installation.
Additionally, Enphase’s new power control system (PCS) software is designed to allow installers to build oversized solar and battery systems without triggering a main panel upgrade, potentially saving homeowners thousands of dollars and further improving the system payback time.
The update comes at a critical time when the California rooftop solar market is suffering as much as a 38% pullback in demand, according to Wood Mackenzie.
Enphase has an NEM 3.0 landing page for installers looking to improve their California rooftop solar sales pitch. A whitepaper goes into detail on how installers can maximize return on investment for their customers.
Enphase has shipped approximately 68 million microinverters, and more than 3.5 million Enphase-based systems have been deployed in over 145 countries.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/15/first-solar-reports-forced-labor-in-supply-chain/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,MALAYSIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 15, 2023",First Solar reports forced labor in supply chain,"First Solar, the leading U.S. solar manufacturer of cadmium telluride thin-film solar panels, revealed that a third-party audit confirmed that migrant workers employed as janitorial and security staff  at its operations in Malaysia were victims of forced labor. The audit found that four subcontractors charged workers recruitment fees and withheld pay and passports. 
The company said it is requiring the facilities to improve working conditions, outlining actions taken in its 2023 sustainability report. First Solar said it will perform periodic reviews to ensure the subcontractors are not using forced labor. It will also limit work weeks at the facility to 60 hours and require workers take at least one day off every week.
Our onsite service providers have since returned all passports and unlawful wage detentions to the workers and updated their policies to prevent future fees. In addition to organizing an Responsible Business Alliance briefing session for our onsite service providers, First Solar contracted a third-party to conduct an investigation and develop a reimbursement plan. We are working with our onsite service providers to ensure the recruitment fees are paid back to both current and recent workers in accordance with RBA guidelines and best practices.
First Solar reported the activity “to raise awareness of modern slavery risks that hide in plain sight and to illustrate the value of an independent third-party social audit conducted in a credible, comprehensive manner,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. 
The report highlights the increased focus on transparency in supply chains in the United States as it moves to divorce itself from unethical labor practices in the solar manufacturing sector. Enforcement of laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and antidumping / countervailing duty (AD/CVD) are placing increased responsibility on suppliers to show their goods are untainted by unethical practices if they want their goods to reach U.S. markets. 
“What First Solar has done is the critical due diligence that all companies need to do around the world to ensure they are identifying and remediating forced labor in their supply chains,” said Laura Murphy, human rights and contemporary slavery professor, Sheffield Hallam University. “It does happen, and companies have to be on the lookout for it.” 
While First Solar is not exposed to the forced labor risks in the Xinjiang region under scrutiny through the UFLPA, the findings of unethical practices in the Malaysian facility underscore the need for a thorough understanding of the origin of goods from raw material to finished component.
“The solar industry will anchor the global transition to a sustainable energy future, and we believe that it must do so responsibly,” said Widmar “Quite simply, our industry’s work to power the energy transition and enable the fight against climate change does not serve as credits to offset its social and human rights obligations.”
Despite U.S. announcing record levels of solar manufacturing capacity coming online, with over 155 GW of production capacity along the solar panel supply chain announced over the past year alone, demand is still outpacing domestic supply. The domestic content requirements to qualify for a 10% tax credit adder within the Inflation Reduction Act are further pushing demand for U.S.-made panels, and First Solar is currently booking sales as late as 2030 for its domestic products. These forces will likely require U.S. developers to continue to source non-U.S. panels for years to come, suggesting that supply chain transparency and traceability will continue to be an important focus for suppliers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/15/research-shows-bats-stay-away-from-ground-mounted-solar-plants/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Research shows bats stay away from ground mounted solar plants,"From pv magazine global
An international group of scientists led by the University of Bristol has assessed the impact of ground mounted solar power plants on bat activity and has found that bats tend to avoid locations where these facilities are located.
Their work, exposed in the study “Renewable energies and biodiversity: Impact of ground-mounted solar photovoltaic sites on bat activity,” published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, consisted of analyzing species-specific bat activity and bat species richness at 19 ground-mounted solar PV developments in southwest England.
The researchers stressed that bats usually avoid anthropogenic alterations and that the research was launched with the idea that solar plants would inevitably reduce activity and species richness. “We also predicted that bat species would be mainly affected at their foraging/commuting habitats, that is open space foragers will show reduced activity in fields containing solar PV panels, whereas species that utilize edge and cluttered habitats would be more affected along boundary habitats,” they specified.
The average size of the grassland surfaces of the 19 solar farms is 59.6 hectares, and the grassland is grazed, mowed, or providing cut arable crops. Bat activity was monitored via bat detectors for 7 consecutive nights at each site. This resulted in 51,464 call sequences, comprising 10 species or species groups.
The researchers compared bat activity registered at the solar plants with that of reference sites with no photovoltaic installations. “We found statistical evidence that the activity of six of eight species/species groups were negatively affected by solar PV panels,” they said. “The panels may be causing some bats to alter their flight paths, potentially resulting in further fragmentation of the ecological landscape.”
The research team, which also includes academics from the ELTE Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences, believes that solar PV sites may reduce bat activity over broad geographical scales. “We conclude that assessing, mitigating and monitoring bat activity needs to be factored into solar PV development planning and operation,” they stressed.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/15/nautilus-acquires-23-mw-of-community-solar-assets-in-maryland/,"ACQUISITIONS,BUSINESS,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MARYLAND",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Nautilus acquires 23 MW of community solar assets in Maryland,"Nautilus Solar Energy, LLC acquired two community solar portfolios in Maryland totaling 23 MW, comprised of six projects spread across the state. Expected to be operational by 2024, the projects will serve over 5,000 Maryland subscribers residing in the Pepco and BG&E utility territories.
Currently about 75% of Maryland households lack the ability to deploy rooftop solar systems based on inadequate roofing or shade conditions, as well as rentals or condominiums prohibiting access to solar systems, according to the Sierra Club. Community solar projects can offer a solution to that suitability problem. These small to mid-scale solar facilities typically sited on private land, commercial rooftops, landfills, industrial sites and other preferred areas in proximity to the utility customers they’re intended to serve.
Maryland was an early adopter of community solar, with a community solar pilot program launched in 2018. Maryland recently became the 23rd state with a permanent community solar program that became law when HB 908 was voted on in May of this year. HB 908 requires at least 40% of solar capacity dedicated to benefit low-to-moderate income (LMI) customers, intended to ensure that historically disadvantaged Marylanders have equitable access to electric bill savings at a time when inflated energy prices are driving up household energy costs.
The new community solar bill replaces the pilot program and eliminates the pilot’s cap of 580 MW of community solar. The new program incentivizes the development of projects on a greater variety of sites, including commercial and industrial rooftops, brownfield sites, as well as on farmland.
Nautilus is no stranger to community solar in Maryland, having been an early participant in the community solar pilot program. The company owns and manages nearly 90 MW of operational and late-stage development projects in the state, which provides clean renewable power to tens of thousands of Marylanders.
“Our focus is not just on producing clean energy but ensuring that the benefits, particularly the cost savings, reach every Marylander, especially those from low-to-moderate income backgrounds and historically disadvantaged communities,” said Eric Paul, vice president of partner development at Nautilus.
Nautilus Solar Energy specializes in community solar, managing solar farms in 10 states. In January Nautilus reached an agreement to acquire a nine-project portfolio with 54 MW of community solar assets from Seaboard Solar, a Connecticut-based utility solar developer. In 2022 Nautilus acquired two community solar portfolios in Maine with five projects under development totaling 26.2 MW in total capacity. In June the company completed a 2.8 MW community solar project in Upstate New York, the first of three in the service area of Orange and Rockland and expects to bring the next two projects online in Q3.
Founded in 2006, Nautilus was acquired in 2019 by Power Corporation of Canada.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/08/15/nikola-announces-recall-of-battery-electric-vehicles-pauses-sales-after-fire-investigation/,"BUSINESS,CONSUMER PROTECTION,EV,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"AUGUST 15, 2023","Nikola announces recall of battery electric vehicles, pauses sales after fire investigation","Nikola Corporation announced a voluntary recall of approximately 209 of its Class 8 Tre battery-electric vehicles, following the preliminary findings of an investigation conducted by Exponent into its battery packs.
The company said Aug. 11 that it was in the process of filing the recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and will be holding off on selling new battery-electric vehicles for the time being. Nikola manufactures heavy-duty commercial battery-electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles, and is headquartered in Arizona. 
On June 23, Nikola reported in a tweet that a fire had affected multiple battery electric trucks at its Phoenix headquarters, and that the company suspected foul play as a vehicle was seen in the area just before the incident. However, the company now says that internal and third-party evaluations, as well as hours of video footage review, indicate that it’s unlikely the fire was caused by foul play or other external factors. 
Instead, the company reported that following an Aug. 10 presentation from third-party investigator Exponent, it found that a coolant leak in one lithium-ion battery pack likely caused the fire. It said this conclusion was corroborated by a “minor thermal incident” that impacted one battery pack on a truck at its Coolidge, Arizona plant.
“Internal investigations from Nikola’s safety and engineering teams indicate a single supplier component within the battery pack as the likely source of the coolant leak and efforts are underway to provide a field remedy in the coming weeks,” Nikola said.
The company said that so far, only two battery packs out of the more than 3,100 packs on trucks produced until now have experienced an issue. 
Nikola said that while its battery-electric trucks can stay in operation, it is encouraging its customers and dealers to take certain actions to ensure their safety. These include ensuring that the “main battery disconnect” switch is always on, to enable real-time vehicle monitoring, and trying to park trucks outside so that they are better connected to Nikola’s monitoring system.  
“We stated from the beginning that as soon as our investigations were concluded we would provide an update, and we will continue our transparency as we learn more,” said Steve Girsky, CEO of Nikola.
Girsky replaced Nikola’s previous President and CEO Michael Lohscheller, whom the company announced was stepping down from his position on Aug. 4. The company reported that Lohscheller opted to step down because of a family health matter and will continue in an advisory capacity with Nikola until the end of September. 
Separately, Nikola began producing its hydrogen fuel cell electric truck on July 31, and had already received orders for over 200 trucks that it intends to start delivering in September. On the hydrogen front, the company was recently granted $58.2 million in different grants from regulators to build out a network of hydrogen refueling stations for heavy-duty trucks. 
The company said that the voluntary recall will not affect its hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, which have a different design.

“If successful, this application in solar modules could be a perfect example of the broad applicability of our core technology,” said Hunter McDaniel, UbiQD CEO. “With emerging applications in food and energy, these novel nanomaterials are proving to be a key tool in humanity’s urgent response to climate change and further sustainable economic development.”
Quantum dots (QD) are photoluminescent particles so small that it would take 100,000 of them to span one fingernail, said UbiQD. The company said it has applications in localized DC microgrids, smart building solutions, including integration with sensors for climate and ambient controls. UbiQD also has a UbiGro brand used in greenhouse and agrivoltaic installations.
“As we work towards developing the next generation of photovoltaics, we are exploring a range of enhancements that could allow us to convert more sunlight into energy,” said Markus Gloeckler, chief technology officer, First Solar. “We are interested in the potential use of quantum dots in optimizing the absorption of light and look forward to continuing our work with UbiQD on exploring this possibility.”
While UbiQD (short for Ubiquitous Quantum Dots) is a startup, it has much history in high-level applications. In 2021 UbiQD installed its energy-producing windows at three commercial sites. In 2022, the company’s quantum dot solar technology was used in a Small Business Innovation Research project with the United States Air Force. The Air force contract provided funding for two installations of over 20 windows and additional scale-up and development funds for the product. Also in 2022, UbiQD announced that it was developing a solution for controlled-environment agriculture in partnership with Heliene, a U.S.-based solar module manufacturer.
UbiQD also took part as a Growth Stage company earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 2023 NREL Industry Growth Forum. The forum included 40 companies that represent a range of clean and sustainable technology startups from around the world, and UbiQD was recognized as the Best Overall Venture.
