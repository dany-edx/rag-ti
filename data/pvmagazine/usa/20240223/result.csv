Eland 2 is a 374 MW solar, 150 MW / 600 MWh storage project. The project is slated to come online in Q1 2025.
Wells Fargo provided $431 million in tax equity commitment. Arevon also obtained $654 million of debt financing, including a construction-to-term loan, tax equity bridge loan, and letter of credit facilities.
Eland 2 will provide 200 MW of electricity under a power purchase agreement with Southern California Public Power Authority. The project will dispatch electricity from Tesla Megapack 2 XL batteries, for up to four hour durations during peak grid demand.
Combined with the project’s first phase Eland 1, the projects will total for 751 MWdc of solar and 300 MW / 1,200 MWh of energy storage. 
“Solar-plus-storage projects – like our flagship Eland 1 and 2 facilities – play an important role in Arevon’s strategy. Hybrid power plants deliver a more reliable, predictable energy yield during peak electricity demand periods, which in turn enables consistent returns across our diverse, multi-gigawatt portfolio,” said Kevin Smith, Chief Executive Officer at Arevon.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) served as the administrative agent, coordinating lead arranger, green loan coordinator, and bookrunner. Other coordinating lead arrangers included BNP Paribas, CoBank, Commerzbank AG, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and National Bank of Canada. J.P. Morgan served as joint lead arranger, collateral and depositary agent. Amis, Patel & Brewer, LLP represented Arevon as sponsor counsel; Milbank LLP served as lender counsel; and Sheppard Mullin served as tax equity counsel.
Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Arevon owns and operates more than 3.5 GW of solar and storage assets across the country. The company has a project pipeline of more than 6 GW in development.
Arevon also recently announced a successful close of $350 million from Blackstone Credit and Insurance. The funds will support a 200 MW / 800 MWh battery project in Grand Terrace, California that is slated to reach commercial operations in Q2 2024. The project made use of the Inflation Reduction Act’s new tax credit transferability rule.

Now Nova Scotia is partnering with the federal government to bring the program to its residents.
Under the program, low-to-median-income households in Nova Scotia that heat their home with oil can apply to receive up to $30,000 in funding to cover the full cost of switching to a cold climate heat pump; $15,000 of which comes from the Government of Canada’s OHPA program and up to $15,000 from the Province of Nova Scotia. Only cold climate heat pumps on this list are eligible. In addition to the funding going toward installation, it can cover the following:
“Making the switch to more energy-efficient heating systems does not just save energy and reduce families’ carbon footprint — it also helps Canadians save on their utility bills,” said the Honorable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources. “That is why we are strengthening the Oil to Heat Pump Affordability program and ensuring that families are supported in making the switch from expensive heating oil to an efficient heat pump.”
In addition to these increased grants, OHPA applicants will also soon be receiving an upfront, one-time payment of $250 from the federal government. This applies to all eligible applicants who heat their homes with oil and sign up for a heat pump through OHPA. This will include those who have signed up since April 1, 2023.
Natural Resources Canada (NRC) estimates that heating the average Canadian home with oil is the most expensive option, costing $2,000 to $5,500 per year, depending on the province or territory. Homeowners who switch from an oil furnace to a cold-climate heat pump could save approximately $1,500 to $4,500 per year on their home energy bills, NRC said.
Heat pumps offer a few major advantages over oil including energy efficiency are health considerations. NRC reports that heat pumps are two to three times more efficient than oil furnaces. Additionally, oil furnaces and boilers generate around three million tons of CO2 every year in Canada, according to the NRC, the equivalent of pollution from approximately 920,000 cars. Healthwise, oil combustion in heating systems also generates nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and fine particles that can be harmful to humans and the environment.
Nova Scotia residents interested in the program may apply here.

2,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/23/field-service-bridging-the-gap-in-solar-adoption/,"EMPLOYMENT,GUEST POST,O&M,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES",,2024-02-23,Field service bridging the gap in solar adoption,"The adoption of solar energy in the United States is increasing, and with it, the opportunity for notable market expansion for the companies and field services teams that site, install and service these projects.
Spurred by growing business and consumer demand for clean electricity, technology advances, and favorable federal and state policies, 63 GW of new utility-scale solar power generation is expected this year, adding significantly more than the 40 GW added in 2023. However, solar energy accounts for just 3.4% of all U.S. electricity generation, meaning there is room for significant expansion.
Customers now have multiple options to choose from when deciding how they deploy and use solar power. Large businesses can integrate solar power with battery energy storage systems, capturing, storing, and flexibly deploying this green power source as needed. Advances such as transparent solar panels and thin-film technology also promise to make solar energy more suitable for various business and consumer applications.
Despite these promising trends, challenges stand in the way of boosting solar adoption. High costs, unskilled or inaccessible labor, and negative public sentiment could prevent solar from growing at the rates predicted.
The good news is that there are strategies to address these issues to grow solar energy adoption and accelerate the country’s transition to green energy.
Strategy 1: Deploying technological solutions to manage solar energy cost challenges
The average cost to deploy solar panels residentially has been estimated at around $25k, but final costs vary depending on panel type and model; auxiliary equipment costs; and federal or state incentives. In addition, homeowners need to budget for ongoing system maintenance, cleaning, and repair.
Technology can improve solar power efficiency and performance. Internet-enabled sensors on solar panels and components provide a continuous stream of data on the system’s energy production levels, temperature and efficiency. Then, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms analyze sensor data, detecting anomalies that could indicate a need for proactive or predictive maintenance.
With intelligent monitoring capabilities, operators can detect problems in real-time, decreasing system risks and operating and maintenance costs.
Strategy 2: Addressing labor challenges in solar energy through technology
A recent survey found that nine in 10 U.S. companies are struggling to find the skilled labor forces they need, and job growth continues to outpace the existing talent base.
Solar development companies can use technology to help bridge this gap in several ways. These firms can use tools, such as generative AI copilots, knowledge bases, and web and mobile field services apps to train workers on the latest technologies, methodologies and practices. Workers leverage intuitive interfaces and natural-language queries to learn about new processes, such as implementing new technology or using intelligent monitoring systems.
In addition, workers can use data analytics and AI-powered systems to plan projects, optimize task performance and chart progress. Field service software streamlines projects, from managing work orders; to scheduling, dispatching, and monitoring their workforces; to estimating and invoicing. This integrated functionality helps companies optimize task assignments based on skills and location and ensure that projects are completed promptly and efficiently.
Solar development companies can also use these tools to tap gig workers for assignments, gaining access to an on-demand talent pool and filling skills gaps as needed.
Strategy 3: Shaping public opinion on solar energy through tech-enabled transparency and engagement
Utility-scale solar and wind projects are facing increased headwinds. In Michigan, community members have blocked more than two dozen large-scale projects, while across the U.S., 35 states have implemented 228 restrictions to do likewise.
Solar development companies can leverage field service software to help foster positive public sentiment about solar energy by increasing transparency about planned projects. They can provide real-time data and operational insights about planned projects, building community trust that they will proceed as promised. With this strategy, they can help educate the public about how solar energy works and the benefits it will provide to their communities.
Field service technology 
With the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, solar credits for qualifying projects have soared to 30%, providing a compelling reason for businesses and consumers to adopt this technology.
Solar development companies can cash in on this boom by using field service technology to manage and reduce project costs, access new talent pools and upskill workers, and positively influence public opinion about the worth of these projects. Companies that adopt all three strategies and use field service technology can win new projects, manage them to successful completion, and scale their businesses.

Solar cell FOB China prices have stayed unchanged, with not much real trading taking place as price negotiations for orders delivered in March are still ongoing. Mono PERC M10 and G12 cell prices trended flat at $0.0482 per W and $0.0473/W, respectively, while TOPCon M10 cell prices remained constant at $0.0584/W week to week.
According to a market participant, neither the supply nor the demand for cells has changed significantly as of right now. What will be clearer by month-end is the change in operating rates set by cell and module producers, the source added.
 

A manufacturer that had already sold Mono PERC M10 cells for the high price of CNY0.4 ($0.056)/W prior to the Lunar New Year said that, although they intend to raise prices even more, their ability to do so will depend on how order talks play out over the next two weeks.
Another source from the cell segment is skeptical about whether cell prices will continue to rise, saying that increases are restrained by the present price and potential future price of modules.
The fact that an increase in end-user demand in 2024 cannot be substantial will weigh on cell prices, according to an upstream insider. “The most bullish forecast I’ve heard so far is that end-user demand would rise by roughly 20% in 2024” compared to 2023, the source added.
Even if prices rise in response to increased demand, only integrated businesses are able to ensure sales volume and profitability, a market observer stated, who went on to say that stand-alone cell producers can only strive for profits by lowering the purchase prices of wafers.

The group’s goal is to deliver technologies that will electrify regional flights traveling as far as 1,000 miles with up to 100 people, all North American railroads, and all vessels operating exclusively in U.S. territorial waters. Two of Arpa-e’s goals are batteries exceeding 1000 watt-hours per kilogram and 1000 watt-hours per liter, compared to the generally available 285 Wh/kg and 650 Wh/L products.
The twelve announced projects were awarded up to $1.5 million each, with the smallest award being just under $700,000. The program expects certain results to be available within 18 months.
The twelve projects include:
At least five of the projects use hydrogen-powered fuel cells as a primary source of power generation..
The seven factors driving Arpa-e’s decision making process include:

Arpa-e sees the energy potential in these metals due to their high energy densities. Its logic is that anodes in batteries “may be considered as fuels in that upon releasing energy, they are oxidized and donate electrons.” The value in red underneath the images notes how much material is left over after the materials are oxidized. The jet fuel value does not include the CO2 and other emissions released into the atmosphere.
For electric aviation, the target cost of electricity is 0.30/kWh. For trains and ships, which require less power, the target cost is lower at $0.20/kWh.

5,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/02/23/weavegrid-toyota-join-forces-to-optimize-ev-grid-charging-in-utility-territories/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,2024-02-23,"WeaveGrid, Toyota join forces to optimize EV grid charging in utility territories","Software company WeaveGrid has begun working with Toyota Motor North America to better integrate Toyota and Lexus battery electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles into the grid in certain utility service territories in the U.S.
Under the partnership, certain models of Toyota and Lexus electric vehicles will be combined with WeaveGrid’s intelligent software platform, which the company says will allow vehicle owners to save money and offer utilities EV load management capabilities. 
“The result is a system that enables drivers to opt into charging optimization, personalized driver insights, and home charging cost savings,” according to WeaveGrid. 
The partnership currently exists in WeaveGrid’s utility programs in Michigan, Maryland, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Minnesota, Kendall Cody, senior manager, marketing and communications at WeaveGrid, told pv magazine USA.
“As WeaveGrid launches more managed charging programs with our utility clients, Toyota vehicles will be eligible for those programs as well. We cannot say more about which markets at this time as those programs have not yet launched,” Cody added. 
Vehicle owners who participate in the program can earn direct incentives and other benefits from their utility. For example, in Xcel Energy’s footprint in Colorado, Minnesota, and New Mexico, enrolled customers can receive both a $50 bill credit annually, as well as savings from off-peak rates. Meanwhile, in Maryland, Baltimore Gas & Electric enrolled customers could save some $150 annually. The program enables participating customers to save money by helping them to charge during off-peak hours, according to Cody. 
WeaveGrid has worked on similar projects before. Last July, for example, it announced a platform to support Detroit-based utility DTE Energy’s Smart Charge program, which helps EV drivers manage their charging in a way to reduce stress on the grid. Under that program, EV drivers can receive $50 in initial incentives and another $50 in end-of-program incentives from the company. In November 2022, WeaveGrid announced it had raised $35 million in a Series B funding round led by Salesforce Ventures, following its $15 million Series A a year and a half previously. 
The EV market has seen huge growth in recent years, and sales have more than quadrupled during the Biden-Harris Administration. Private companies, meanwhile, have announced more than $155 billion in the EV and battery supply chain. Last month, the administration announced grants worth $623 million to build an EV charging network across major U.S. travel corridors, aiming to install at least 500,000 publicly available chargers by 2030. 
More broadly, the influx of EVs on the road will increase overall electricity demand, Cody said. EV adoption is often clustered, meaning multiple EVs plugging in on a single residential street or neighborhood can create challenges for the local electricity distribution system. And adding a Level 2 charger at home can add two to three homes worth of demand to the grid and accelerate wear and tear on assets like transformers that already have backlogged supply chains, she added. 
On the other hand, utilities can take advantage of these EVs to manage load in their service territories, through managed charging solutions, which can optimize charging so as to reduce strain on the distribution system and turn EVs into grid assets to help balance electricity demand. 
The biggest challenge will be with the distribution system and ensuring the grid stays resilient amidst the challenges and opportunities presented by electrification and decarbonization.
“Funding mechanisms like [Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships] and other grants are really good initiatives. Policymakers should also be encouraging good grid planning and forecasting and utility managed charging programs,” Cody said.
