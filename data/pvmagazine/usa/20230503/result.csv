https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/03/sunpower-secures-550-million-loan-purchase-commitment/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 3, 2023",SunPower secures $550 million loan purchase commitment,"SunPower, a residential solar and energy services provider, announced it has secured a $550 million loan purchase commitment from private equity firm KKR & Co. Credit funds and accounts managed by KKR will purchase solar loans made to SunPower customers.
“Residential solar is a key area of focus for our Asset-Based Finance business,” said Avi Korn, managing director of KKR’s credit group.
SunPower’s loan programs offer residential customers 25-year terms to secure a more predictable cost for electricity when compared with volatile utility rates. The company launched SunPower Financial in 2021, and its loan business grew 99% year-over-year in 2022. With a SunPower project, installation, design, sales, financing and warranty are all provided by one entity.
“With the closing of this transaction, we have raised sufficient capital year-to-date to fund a total of $1 billion of incremental solar loans for SunPower’s customers.  As demand continues to rise, we expect this additional capital will power our loan bookings volume into 2024 and enable SunPower to increase access to the benefits of solar for more homeowners,” said Guthrie Dundas, interim chief financial officer, SunPower.
The $550 million commitment follows a $450 million commitment from April 12 provided by HASI and Crédit Agricole CIB, two leading climate and sustainability investors.  Both credit agreements are non-recourse financings. 
Business activities
In late April 2023, SunPower announced it partnered with OhmConnect to offer its customers the opportunity to participate in virtual power plant (VPP) programs.
Homeowners in select California markets that have the mySunPower app can earn rewards for managing electricity use, particularly during times of peak electricity demand on the grid, when utility bill rates are the highest. The service helps balance the electricity grid while offering solar and energy storage customers an opportunity to derive value from their system.
SunPower has continued to evolve its customer offerings over the last year. In September 2022, the company introduced two new batteries for residential energy storage applications. The two devices, called SV-BASE13-C and SV-BASE19.5-C, respectively are part of the company’s Sunvault energy storage series. The battery comes in five configurations: 13 kWh, 19.5 kWh, 26 kWh, 39 kWh and 52 kWh.
Also in September 2022, SunPower announced it partnered with retailer giant IKEA to offer its solutions in select California IKEA stores.  Members of the IKEA Family customer loyalty program will have in-store access to four custom designed SunPower solar packages, which all include a SunPower Equinox solar system, a 25-year warranty for power, product and labor, and a 10-year monitoring warranty. IKEA U.S. customers will work directly with SunPower to access its energy solutions, which contain all the products, services, and warranties that customers will need.
Last May, the company released SunPower One, a holistic energy management system designed to interface with home solar arrays, battery energy storage systems, as well as the full set of energy loads in the home, including heating and cooling, appliances, lighting, and more.
The platform takes a step beyond monitoring the system, proactively advising homeowners on ways to optimize their energy usage. It is capable of recognizing patterns of electricity consumption and suggests further actions for energy bill savings.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/03/50-states-of-solar-incentives-utah/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTAH",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 3, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Utah,"The state of Utah enjoys an unusual combination of land types, from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Basin to the Colorado plateau. It’s known for the Great Salt Lake, the dramatic scenery in Arches and Canyonlands National Parks and outstanding year ‘round recreation throughout the state. While it is not known as a state with strong support for solar and other renewable energy, its wide open spaces are amenable to utility-scale solar and it ranks 12th in the country for solar installed, which is up from 22nd place in early 2022, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Electricity in Utah is relatively inexpensive, at 8.34 cents per kWh, according to the Energy Information Administration. The 2.7 GW of solar installed is enough to power 504,102 homes, according to SEIA, and it provides just over 11.5% of the state’s electricity.

Rocky Mountain Power is the state’s largest utility. It is owned by PacifiCorp, which announced its 2023 integrated resource plan that sets all of its utilities on a path to net zero. It calls for a nearly four-fold increase in the utility’s current wind and solar resources, to a total of 20 GW by 2032, in addition to 7 GW of energy storage deployments by 2029. The utility is the offtaker for the Escalante solar project (see below), currently the largest project in the Beehive State.
Solar incentives
In 2020, Utah announced an incentive of $1,600 for residential customers to go solar, but that rate drops by $400 per year, beginning in 2021, according to DSIRE.
Despite Rocky Mountain Power aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2032, it is not overly generous in net metering rates for energy exported to the grid. From June through September 2023, it pays 5.636 cents per kWh for all exported kWh; and from October through May 2024 it drops to 4.745 cents per kWh for all exported kWh.
Net metering is offered by other Utah utilities, such as Murray City Power, which started a pilot program for renewable installation of up to 10 kW. The way Murray’s net metering framework works is that the electric customer receives credit on their next bill for all electric energy that they’ve fed into the grid in excess of what the city supplied during that billing period. Then in April, if the customer has a credit, it’s applied toward any electricity used in subsequent months. No cash is offered for excess generation.
Solar rights
Under the state’s solar rights law, which was enacted in 2017, homeowner associations cannot prohibit or restrict owners of detached dwellings from installing solar. It does not apply, however, in dwellings where the ownership has an interest in the rooftop. An association may have a declaration that prohibits solar or limits size, location and placement on owners with detached dwellings. Association rules may also require solar energy systems to meet health, safety and building performance standards, and they may limit roof overlap, color or texture, and may exclude visible piping or wiring. For ground-mounted systems, associations may require that systems not be visible from the street.
The state law also states that local zoning boards may adopt regulations that mandate solar access and grants the zoning body the right to refuse a plan if deed restrictions, covenants or other agreements running with the land prohibit “reasonably sited and designed solar collectors or other renewable resource devices”. The state includes clotheslines in the definition of renewable resource devices.
Landmark installations
The 240 MW Escalante Solar Project is three separate solar installations, located in the town of Milford in Beaver County. Developed by SunEdison and built by Mortenson Construction, the projects came online in 2016, and the power is sold under three power purchase agreements to Rocky Mountain Power. Taken together, it is the largest solar plant in the state.
The 180 MW Cove Mountain solar projects in Iron Beryl, Utah, are the next largest. Completed in 2021 by D.E. Shaw Renewables, Meta (formerly Facebook) is the offtaker of electricity from both Cove Mountain (58 MW) and Cove Mountain II (122 MW). The two projects were part of a flurry of PPAs that Facebook signed last fall to run data centers on clean, renewable energy.
More large-scale solar is likely on the way for Utah, as the Federal Energy Act of 2020 aims to deploy 25 GW of solar, wind, and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025. One of the first land areas that was vetted for this development is in Utah, where the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) offered 4,836 acres in Beaver County, Utah, to be bid on by solar developers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/03/solar-assets-are-underperforming-expectations-by-8-what-is-the-root-cause/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,QUALITY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 3, 2023","Solar assets are underperforming expectations by 8%, what is the root cause?","Research from climate insurance and renewable energy risk management firm kWh Analytics shows that solar assets are broadly underperforming by an average of 8%.
On average, projects constructed after 2015 have generated 7 to 13% less electricity than P50 production estimates. P50 means there is a 50% chance in any given year that production will be at least a given amount. If an array has a P50 production level of 500 kWh, it means that on any given year there is a 50% chance that production will be at least 500 kWh. Projects built since 2015 are on average performing worse than those constructed in the early 2010s relative to their P50 estimates.
Drone inspection and imaging provider Raptor Maps estimates annual losses of $82 million for the 24.5 GW of assets it inspected in 2022, at an average of an $3,350 annual loss per megawatt.
“Extrapolating across total global PV capacity (as of the end of 2021, excluding residential) translates to a $ 2.5 billion annual revenue loss for the industry,” the company said.
(Read: “Raptor Maps points to growing problem of PV system underperformance“)
“Underperformance affects investors and lenders critical to the success and growth of solar projects,” said Jason Kaminksy, chief executive officer of kWh Analytics. “As an industry, we must collaborate to find ways to course-correct in order to ensure the industry’s long-term financial health.”
Kaminsky suggests that sponsors and lenders should consider accurately priced risk-transfer products, be wary of aggressive production forecasts, and be collaborative with stakeholders to encourage data sharing.
Forensic analysis
The Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) recommends conducting a thorough forensic analysis on solar assets to determine the root cause of performance issues. RETC notes that in many cases, inverter failure or inaccurate production estimates are the cause of underperformance. 
However, sometimes PV module health issues can be the reason for falling short of estimates. As an expert source for solar module evaluation, RETC conducts forensic analyses to determine if module performance is the issue. 
The process begins with a baseline assessment. By capturing measurements prior to commercial operations, a baseline forensic assessment provides both short- and long-term benefits over the operating life of a PV power system. For the short term, evaluating panel health can help reduce loan default risk. For the long term, it can help with warranty claims. RETC said processing a warranty or insurance claim without baseline measurements taken at the beginning of the project lifecycle can be challenging. 
Electroluminescence (EL) testing is another forensic analysis technique to ensure module performance. Using a specialized camera system, inspectors can view light emissions that occur when an electrical current moves through solar cells. The test allows technicians to identify installation damages, or damages resulting from severe weather events such as hail, wind or snow. 
While EL testing has been used for a long time by manufacturers in indoor, pre-project settings, RETC takes a different approach by testing the asset while operational in the field. It also has specialized EL technology that allows for daytime testing, advancing from past methods that required nighttime imaging. 
RETC conducts daytime EL testing in the field, which comes with a few benefits. First, this method of EL testing allows technicians to test modules installed on-site, expediting the testing process and preventing cell damage from module removal and handling. Second, RETC’s daytime EL testing eliminates the need to test modules in the dark of night, improving safety and throughput. 
System monitoring and predictive maintenance methods are also recommended for ensuring healthy PV performance. This is especially true for identifying problems as PV systems age. For instance, cell microcracking often does not impact module performance when modules are new, but that is not necessarily the case as systems age. After 5 or 10 years in the field, some modules continue to perform as expected, whereas others suffer from accelerated degradation, said RETC. 
“Thermal mismatch resulting from cracked cells or other causes needs to be closely monitored as it can lead to substantial PV system underperformance,” said Dr. Ralph Romero, managing director, digital infrastructure advisory services, Black & Veatch. 
Large projects that appear to have a single module supplier may integrate modules manufactured using cells sourced from a dozen different vendors, said RETC. Given that each bill of materials is unique, each has a different risk profile. 
Romero said that his company is aware of digital monitoring platforms that can provide powerful, granular insights into system underperformance causes, but in some cases, further analysis is needed. 
“If we suspect that PV modules are underperforming and the root causes are not identifiable through performance monitoring, we can ask the forensic analysis team to identify the root causes of underperformance,” he said. “With this information in hand, we can develop an action plan based on a cost-benefit analysis of potential remediation measures. In the process of engineering a cost-effective solution that immediately improves system performance, we can also take steps to prevent the recurrence of underperformance moving forward.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/03/commercial-solar-guy-sells-101-mw-new-york-portfolio-seeks-additional-60-acres/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 3, 2023","Commercial Solar Guy sells 101 MW New York portfolio, seeks additional 60 acres","Commercial Solar Guy, a New England-based solar power construction, consulting, and development company, signed a deal to deliver a portfolio of 101 MW of community solar projects in upstate New York.
To complete the 101 MW solar portfolio, Commercial Solar Guy is seeking 16 MWdc more of capacity across about three projects, or about another 50 to 75 acres of land. The company has already leased or purchased 85 MW worth of land, or about 360 acres.
Four of the projects, totaling 30 MW, will be constructed on former brownfields. While the company is not specifically seeking more brownfield land, New York offers incentives for brownfield solar projects. Depending on the necessary mitigation, the company reports that it may be able to offer a higher dollar amount for brownfield land.
In a Cornell University report titled “Are big and small solar separate things?: The importance of scale in public support for solar energy development in upstate New York”, researchers demonstrated that support for solar generally decreases when system size and site location are considered, unless the project is situated on landfills.

John Fitzgerald Weaver, owner of Commercial Solar Guy, says that this research has directly influenced the company’s site selection strategy.
The community solar projects are part of New York state’s NY-Sun program, a  solar incentive program launched in 2011 to support the development of distributed generation assets. The state has already deployed more than one hundred thousand small solar power projects, totaling over 3 GW. Commercial Solar Guy’s projects are included in the pipeline of another 3+ GW of projects currently in progress.
New York aims to achieve 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030, which includes 1.6 GW of new solar capacity to benefit disadvantaged communities. The state’s community solar program, regarded as one of the strongest in the country, allows households and businesses access to the environmental and economic benefits of solar electricity generation without needing to install panels on their properties. 

Commercial Solar Guy’s community solar projects will serve the New York State Gas & Electric region, with the electricity being sold to individuals and businesses within the region.
These projects are expected to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in lease payments to the landowners, amounting to nearly $15 million over the next 25 five years. The projects are also anticipated to generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for local towns throughout their 25- to 35-year lifetimes.
During the construction phase, the company expects to pay over $40 million to local electricians, machine operators, excavators, concrete teams, fence installers and specialist installers. An estimated $20 million will be allocated for upgrading the local power grid, improving its capacity to handle complex weather conditions and deliver resilient, distributed solar electricity generation to the local population. The company will also source a significant portion of materials locally, including fencing, wire, tools, engineering services, vehicles, steel, electronics, and more.
Landowners interested in leasing land for a solar farm may contact Commercial Solar Guy.

The add-on funding brings the  company’s cumulative Series E round to $250 million, and represents a significant step towards expanding Redaptive’s offerings and procuring new customers, the company said.
Redaptive installs energy efficiency systems that include smart meters, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) upgrades, and LED lighting systems at no cost to its customers. The company’s business model involves a monthly “energy-as-a-service” contract, which with no upfront cost to the customer provides more commercial clients to sign up for energy efficiency and sustainability solutions.
The company itemizes efficiency solutions, solar and energy storage at a portfolio of customer building sites into one contract. As the installer, the company is paid over time from energy savings from the customer account. The solar and storage assets take a power purchase agreement (PPA) structure with no upfront cost required from the customer, the company said.
“As one of the original investors in Redaptive, I have seen firsthand the company mature into one of the best players in the energy efficiency and sustainability space that provides a truly differentiated and strong value proposition to its customers,” said Michael Linse, founder and managing director, Linse Capital. “With such a large addressable market in the U.S. and globally, we are doubling down on our investment and look forward to helping Redaptive continue to scale its leading EaaS and Data Solutions platform.”
The Series E add-on investment follows the March 2023 initial Series E funding round when the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board joined Honeywell, CBRE, and other prior investors. Formed in 2013, Redaptive has raised over $360 million in growth capital to date from VC and strategic investors that include Engie New Ventures, CarVal and GXP Investments, the VC arm of Midwestern utility Great Plains Energy.
Solar expansion
Across the U.S., over 450,000 warehouses and distribution centers have 16.4 billion square feet of roof space, providing fertile ground for new commercial and industrial solar installations.  California alone is home to over 66,000 warehouses and distribution centers with 1.5 billion square feet of roof surface area, according to a recent report by Environment California and the Frontier Group.
With the average cost of commercial building electricity rising by 10% since 2021, customers of Redaptive begin by installing smart lighting, meters, sensors and other efficiency solutions, which initially provide 15% or more in annual energy savings. The company expects to achieve additional monthly energy savings for its customers with on-site solar generation.
The company said over 70% of its commercial clients’ building portfolios are suitable for solar projects.
Case study
With a net zero goal to offset its energy consumption with clean energy by 2050, commercial uniform, apparel and cleaning company Cintas signed up with Redaptive in March of 2023 to upgrade lighting fixtures across more than 100 of its 450 U.S. facilities, representing 6 million square feet of commercial space.
Lighting efficiency upgrades replacing 42,000 incandescent light bulbs with efficient lighting have driven 18.7 million kWh or $2.2 million of annual energy savings for Cintas, according to the customer.
Working with both Redaptive and the state of New Jersey, in April Cintas began installation of its first solar-powered system at a rental location in Piscataway, N.J. The project is expected to be installed and operational in the late spring of 2023. Once online and connected to the grid, the first solar panel system installation will allow Cintas to evaluate its year-round performance and compare the costs with traditional utility-based energy sources.
“The expansion of our program with Cintas to include solar installations alongside LED retrofit projects is a big step forward on Cintas’ path to a sustainable energy future,” said Arvin Vohra, chief executive officer of Redaptive.

Swedish furniture provider Ikea announced it will rely on Meyer Burger‘s heterojunction solar modules for its own panel offer in the future.
The group’s investment arm, Ingka Investments, concluded a four-year supply agreement with the Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer for solar modules manufactured at Meyer Burger’s U.S. plant in Goodyear, Arizona, to be shipped between 2025 and 2029.
The agreement is one of two contracts that prompted Meyer Burger to increase annual production capacity at the U.S. plant from 1.6 GW to 2 GW. Ingka Investments will ensure a substantial annual advance payment to enable Meyer Burger to procure and finance machinery as well as raw materials for solar module production.
The two companies did not disclose the financial and quantitative terms of the deal. “We are very pleased to be working with Ingka Investments, who will support us with the rapid ramp-up of our production in the USA through this off-take agreement,” said Daniel Menzel, COO of Meyer Burger.
Ikea parent company Ingka Holding unveiled in March a plan to invest €340 million ($375.1 million) to acquire seven solar parks under development by Enerparc in Germany and Spain. At the time, the furniture giant also said it wanted to refresh the Solstrale offer for residential PV applications, which was launched in 2019.
Ikea is currently active in the PV sector in Sweden, France, Australia, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Poland and the United Kingdom.
Ikea is also trying to cover its own electricity needs with renewable energy. Its goal is to become climate-neutral throughout the world by 2030.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/05/03/virtual-power-plants-could-save-utilities-up-to-35-billion-by-2033/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 3, 2023",Virtual power plants could save utilities up to $35 billion by 2033,"Over the last decade the U.S. has spent over $120 billion on 100 GW of new generation capacity with the primary purpose of providing resource adequacy.
A new study by consulting firm The Brattle Group explores the cost and critical resource adequacy needs from virtual power plants (VPPs) as it relates to net savings on the U.S. utility grid.
VPPs are networks of distributed energy resource (DER) portfolios, which can include rooftop solar, smart thermostats, smart water heaters, electric vehicles, and distributed batteries. The VPP network is actively controlled by utilities and energy service providers to benefit consumers, the power system, and the environment.
The Brattle report, titled Real Reliability: The Value of Virtual Power, models the value and performance of a VPP network versus conventional resource adequacy options. The consulting group compares the net cost of providing 400 MW of resource adequacy from three resource types: a natural gas peaker, a grid-interconnected battery system, and a VPP composed of residential demand flexibility technologies.
The 400 MW resource adequacy study involved a utility with 1.7 million residential customers. That utility had 5.7 GW of gross peak demand, 3.6 GW of net peak demand of wind and solar resources, while its generation forecast was to generate 50% renewable energy by 2030, representing a growing trend toward decarbonized power supply. The sample utility is conservatively selected to represent challenging performance requirements for a VPP, such as a need for resource adequacy performance during many hours in both summer and winter.

The chart above shows the annual cost savings between the sample VPP network and systems comprised of just gas-powered and battery systems.
The study also identifies key near-term activities for enabling the deployment of VPPs, which currently are adopted well below their market potential.
“With the massive growth in consumer adoption of clean, flexible energy technologies that is expected over the coming decade, virtual power plants are no longer a virtual reality,” noted Ryan Hledik, a Brattle principal and co-author of the study. “There is real potential to leverage these technologies to improve reliability, enable decarbonization, and reduce costs to consumers. But barriers still need to be overcome.”
Key findings from the Brattle study include:
“Google already enables one of the largest VPPs in the U.S. by helping our thermostat users avoid carbon and earn rewards through the Rush Hour Rewards (RHR) program and our recently launched Nest Renew service,” said Parag Chokshi, director of product strategy and operations, Google Nest. “We believe the continued growth and support of VPPs in the residential sector is crucial to continue building towards a decarbonized, reliable grid of the future.”
According to the study, nine states are currently running VPP systems for resource adequacy testing, as well as Puerto Rico. Utilities that are integrating solar with energy storage in VPP networks include Pacific Gas & Electric (30 MW solar-plus-storage), Portland General Electric (4 MW behind-the-meter battery VPP), Green Mountain Power (4,000 batteries with 55 MW capacity) and Hawaiian Electric (80 MW solar-plus-storage system).
