In the past decade, the program has largely been dormant, but program director Jigar Shah is calling attention to it as a useful catalyst.
Over $44 billion in funding is available for the advancement of energy infrastructure, with a little more than 10% of that total dedicated to all renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The remainder is earmarked to vehicle advancement ($17.7b), nuclear ($8.5b), Tribal Energy Loan Guarantees ($2b), and fossil fuels($8.5b). 
That dynamic is set to shift however.
The fiscal year 2022 budget request from the Department of Energy begins the process of ensuring that federal funding no longer directly subsidizes fossil fuels. That shift is required in Section 209 of Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.
The LPO will ensure that its Title 17 program only encourages projects that help achieve a carbon-emission-free electric sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy wide by 2050. The program will avoid directly subsidizing fossil fuels by excluding traditional fossil projects from consideration for a loan guarantee.
The LPO was established as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. It provides access to debt capital for large-scale infrastructure projects in the United States.
Qualifying projects must “avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; employ new or significantly improved technologies compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued; and offer a reasonable prospect of repayment of the principal and interest on the guaranteed obligation.”
A decade ago, the LPO was a powerful tool that helped launch solar and electric vehicles companies into bankable investments. Commercial debt markets typically are not enthusiastic about putting new technology on their books, so the LPO does it first, said Shah.  
Shah pointed to the LPO’s early investment in Tesla as a major driver of the company’s success.
He said that today, without the help of the LPO, renewable energy projects are entering Wall Street at a rapid rate. While he previously had voiced concerns about the LPO as an effective near-term catalyst for decarbonization, Shah has recently changed his mind.
He said support and leadership from Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has reinvigorated interest in the program. Shah said he expects an average of $7 billion a month in applications to flow in. The ramp-up in interest has led to over 400 calls a week being fielded by a newly expanded LPO outreach team, he said.
This new wave of interest presents the LPO with an opportunity to fund the most impactful decarbonization projects on a large scale. One feature the LPO is prioritizing is integrating smart technologies, so that distributed resources are better able to respond to grid supply and demand, and provide reliability services.
LPO isn’t the only federal support available for solar. In fiscal year 2020, DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy dedicated $280 million of its $2.8 billion budget to run its Solar Energy Technologies Office. This office focuses more on the research and development side than commercialization, and tackles issues like advanced solar systems integration technologies, concentrated solar power (CSP) research, PV research and development, and solar workforce initiatives.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/14/air-products-plans-4-5b-investment-in-blue-hydrogen-facility/,"HYDROGEN,LOUISIANA",DAVID WAGMAN,"OCTOBER 14, 2021",Air Products plans $4.5b investment in blue hydrogen facility,"Air Products said it plans to build a $4.5 billion blue hydrogen at a complex in Louisiana.
The company will build, own, and operate the project, which is planned to produce over 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, south of Baton Rouge.
Blue hydrogen is produced using hydrocarbons as a feedstock, with the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the production process captured for permanent sequestration. The project is expected to create 170 permanent jobs and represents Air Products’ largest-ever investment in the U.S. The project is expected to be operational in 2026.
Part of the blue hydrogen will be compressed and supplied to customers by Air Products’ U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline network. The pipeline stretches more than 700 miles from Galveston Bay in Texas to New Orleans. Today, this pipeline network can supply customers with more than 1.6 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day from approximately 25 production facilities, including blue hydrogen from Air Products’ Port Arthur, Texas facility. The Port Arthur facility has captured approximately one million tons of CO2 annually since 2013, with the CO2 transported via pipeline and used for enhanced oil recovery operations.
The balance of the blue hydrogen from the new Ascension Parish facility will be used to make blue ammonia for export and converted back to blue hydrogen for transportation and other markets.
Around 95% of the CO2 generated at the facility will be captured, compressed, and transported by pipeline to multiple inland sequestration sites located along a pipeline corridor extending up to 35 miles to the east of the new production facility. Over five million metric tons per year (MTPY) of CO2 will be sequestered in geologic pore space secured from the State of Louisiana approximately one mile beneath the surface. Air Products said it has already received approval from the State Mineral and Energy Board, which is part of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, for the permanent sequestration of the CO2.
The news follows Air Products’ announcement in June of a multi-billion-dollar net-zero hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
In April, Koch Engineered Solutions said that two of its companies, Optimized Process Designs and Koch Project Solutions, would partner with Fidelis Infrastructure to develop the Grön Fuels renewable energy complex in Louisiana.
The $9.2 billion multi-year program would produce green hydrogen, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuels, and bio-plastic feedstocks. The project also would include biogenic carbon capture and sequestration.
The Koch-backed project is expected to produce the equivalent of 1,000 MW of green hydrogen produced by electrolysis, with a pathway to net negative CO2 carbon footprint through the use of biogenic carbon capture and sequestration.
An investment decision is expected to be made later in 2021.

The projects were developed by Portland’s Sulus Solar and total 38 MW in capacity. SolRiver Capital said it is investing over $52 million to complete the projects. Construction on the first projects is planned for spring 2022.
The portfolio includes utility-scale facilities and community solar projects. The community solar projects will sell their energy to customers in both Portland General Electric and Pacific Power utility territories. Oregon has had community solar as an option since  2016.
The community solar projects follow the Oregon Public Utilities Commission’s recent approval of the inclusion of additional residential and low-income customer in the program.
 The projects would represent a 3% increase to the total installed solar capacity in the state, per the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Currently, SEIA reports the state as having a five-year project pipeline of 1,668 MW of solar.

Once completed, the combined facilities are expected to generate 60 million kWh of electricity annually, said SolRiver.
Earlier this year, the state enacted a bill that requires its two major utilities to submit plans for carbon reduction.  The bill set targets of 80% reductions from a baseline amount in 2030, and 100% by 2040.

The company said the facility aims to meet North American market demands. Production will come online in October and the first batch of solar modules are anticipated to arrive in the U.S. by the end of the year.
SEG said it expects to ship more than 2 GW of products annually by the end of 2023.
The company said it recognizes the importance of on-time deliveries and “believes larger in-house manufacturing capacity with production diversification will help minimize any delays.”
Jim Wood, CEO,  said the company expects that production in Cambodia will result in reduced balance of system, tax, and shipping costs, saving “1 to 2 cents per watt cost at the system level.”
SEG half-cell module integrates 182mm large silicon wafers with technologies such as passivated emitter rear cell (PERC), multi-busbar (MBB), half-cut cell, and high-density packaging. The company said its bifacial series is designed to generate 10-30% more electricity under different ground conditions. Since its release in late 2020, over 1 GW of 182mm large cell modules have been installed world-wide, the company said.

The 50:50 joint venture with FREYR could result in factories with an initial production capacity of 50 GWh per year by 2030. The facilities would make batteries for the electric vehicle (EV) industry and utility-scale storage.
Koch and FREYR aim to finalize the decision to build the manufacturing facility by 2022.
In late September, lithium-ion battery recycler Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. said that Koch Strategic Platforms would make a $100 million investment. Proceeds will support the company’s growth in North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to the new capital, Li-Cycle and several Koch Industries business units said they were exploring ways to speed up Li-Cycle’s global growth efforts.
As part of the newly announced joint venture deal, Koch and FREYR have invested $70 million in convertible promissory notes, under which KSP and FREYR will initially invest $50 million and $20 million, respectively. Upon closing of the convertible note financing, the JV entered into a new licensing agreement with 24M that will enable the JV to deploy 24M’s SemiSolid platform technology with conditional limited exclusivity in the U.S. The partners said they also have secured a conditionally exclusive license to deploy 24M’s SemiSolid technology in the U.S. for EV and energy storage systems applications.
24M’s technology reduces the number of steps required to manufacture battery cells while still using conventional lithium-ion raw materials. The production platform is intended to enable capital and operating cost savings as well as expanded opportunities to recycle materials. Using the 24M technology platform, the partners will expect to be able to provide batteries of various sizes and chemistries at commercial scale.
The joint venture partners said they are considering siting the hub close to raw-material supply sources, processing facilities, and water treatment plants.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/14/solar-group-tells-feds-it-wont-name-its-members/,"LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"OCTOBER 14, 2021","Solar group names its members to Commerce, asks for public confidentiality","A U.S. solar group seeking import tariffs on panels made by Chinese companies in Southeast Asia confidentially identified to federal trade officials its members’ identities. It continued, however, to request public confidentiality, citing fears of retaliation by Beijing.
The filing was made by the group American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC). The group in August asked Commerce to investigate whether imports from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam were unfair, arguing that Chinese companies had shifted production to those nations in recent years to avoid existing U.S. duties on solar cells and panels made in China.
In late September, the Commerce Department deferred a decision on the request and asked the group to identify its members.
In its response to the department’s request, the group revealed its members to Commerce officials, said Timothy Brightbill, attorney for the group with the law firm Wiley Rein. In a publicly available version of the response, which has been reviewed by pv magazine, the members’ names have been removed. A-SMACC argued again that identifying its members could expose them to retribution from the Chinese industry, and could cut off supplies of module components like polysilicon.
In a copy of the 28-page filing obtained by pv magazine, the group said the case “implicates China’s strategic economic interests and is likely to generate a response that targets A-SMACC’s members if their identities are made public.” The filing said that overseas investments that are the subject of the tariff request are “the outcome of industrial and strategic economic priorities at the highest levels of the Chinese government.”
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has argued that the petitions should be dismissed on their merits. More broadly, the industry trade group said that the tariffs would cripple the U.S. solar industry.
In a statement to pv magazine, SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said, “From what we can tell of the heavily redacted document, the petitioners have failed to provide answers that show how Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia might be engaged in circumvention.”  She said that SEIA plans to file a formal response in the coming days, “but Commerce shouldn’t wait, it should dismiss this case now.”
The A-SMACC filing charged that SEIA “is effectively functioning as a Washington, DC-based enforcer for Chinese solar interests, making it unnecessary for Chinese entities to directly determine the identities of the members of A-SMACC.”
In a September 27 news conference, SEIA said that that almost 80% of all solar modules are imported from the countries, which include Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
George Hershman, president and general manager of Swinerton Renewable Energy told reporters that 90-95% of the modules that his company plans to import could be impacted. And he said that “100%” of the 7.5 GW of projects his company has in the pipeline for this year and next would be at risk.
“This is absolutely the biggest risk and issue for our company and the industry,” Hershman said during the SEIA-hosted press conference.
Updated October 14 to include a statement from Abigail Ross Hopper and to clarify that A-SMACC said it identified its member companies to Commerce Department officials.

The projects will operate under Maine’s NEB program, which allows customers to benefit from clean energy savings by offsetting their electrical bills with either owned or shared energy projects, like community solar, which, in turn, spurs further development of these assets within the state.
All of the projects developed under the portfolio are expected to reach commercial operation between 2022 and 2023. SRE will finance the projects via its dedicated funding platform with Osaka Gas US while Revision handles development, subscription, and construction of the portfolio.
In July, Summit Ridge entered into a joint venture with Osaka Gas USA Corporation to construct, own and operate over 120 MW of community solar projects throughout the state of Maine, with these projects representing the first leg of that commitment.
As for the electricity generated by the projects, Revision has subscribed a multitude of school districts, municipalities, hospitals, and local businesses.
