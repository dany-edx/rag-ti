The company said its new strategy is two-fold: boost renewable energy job growth in the state, and give Entergy customers price stability against volatile natural gas prices.
This level of capacity additions would increase the company’s total power generation portfolio from less than 1% to 17% in three years, and nearly 33% by 2027.
Entergy said it will begin issuing requests for proposals (RFP) for multiple projects starting in 2022. It will then face approval from the Mississippi Public Service Commission for review and potential approval later in the year.

“We look forward to working with the Mississippi Public Service Commission and Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to implement this plan, and with the Governor and the Mississippi Development Authority to spread the word to business leaders around the globe that this renewable power will soon be available in Mississippi,” said Haley Fisackerly, Entergy Mississippi president and CEO.
Entergy, in work with its partner Recurrent Energy, broke ground in August on a 100 MW solar facility in the state, enough to power 16,000 homes.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/11/solar-covered-parking-lots-could-offer-multiple-benefits/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,CONNECTICUT",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",Solar-covered parking lots could offer multiple benefits,"Analysis from Yale University has found that more than one-third of the state’s electricity could come from solar-covered parking lots.
Adding this potential to Google Project Sunroof rooftop’s solar data increased the availability of solar siting to roughly 85.5% of the state’s electricity provided solely from solar carports and rooftops.
The authors examined only parking lots with at least 100 standard-sized parking spaces, and covering a minimum area of 29,400 square feet. Those criteria cut the number of potential sites to 16,900; later filtering lowered the total still more to 8,416. The authors then spot-checked 100  sites, and designed solar power plants for them. They speculated that, on average, 35% of the chosen sites were good candidates for solar panels.
The authors found that the final 8,416 sites across the state could generate 9,042 GWh of electricity within their first year of operation. The total capacity of these sites was 7,021 MWdc of solar power.
Priced at $3.00 per Watt to install, the solar canopies would generate approximately $21 billion in construction activity.
The report was funded by social justice and clean energy group People’s Action for Clean Energy (PACE). In addition to the technical analysis, the report also found that a majority of the parking lots were located in areas that were either low income or non-white.
Building solar power in low-income areas offers multiple benefits beyond simply generating kilowatt hours. One benefit would be increasing job development in areas adjacent to people looking for local employment. A second might be that local generation of clean electricity could potentially allow for shutting down of gas power plants, which tend to be located in low-income and non-white communities.

Earlier analysis showed that solar power could power 100% of the energy and electricity in the United States using a relatively small amount of land. Additionally, research suggesting that getting to 80% of our electricity from wind+solar is relatively straightforward.
The knowledge that we can get 85% of all electricity from solar power on already developed rooftops and carports alone should be a huge positive for the environmental aspects of solar power.
And, just maybe, optimistic solar salespeople should reach out to the Yale authors to ask about their list of 8,416 sites, which are waiting for a cold call and a proposal.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/11/nrel-to-evaluate-ai-energy-management-system-for-solar-microgrid/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",NREL to evaluate AI energy management system for solar microgrid,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will now test the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in home energy management systems. The Basalt Vista community in mountainous Colorado will play host to the “foresee” AI system, which will control the internet-of-things (IoT) connected devices, which include rooftop solar, heating, electric vehicle charging stations, air conditioning, and more.
Photovoltaic generation, battery storage, and grid operations will be controlled by the Amazon Web Services-backed software, and residents will be able to set preferences related to energy savings, comfort, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction. A cloud-based aggregator will also coordinate among multiple units to manage resources across the community.
Energy storage and management aggregation has been studied to have numerous cost-saving effects. A trial run by the University of Otago, New Zealand, and local installer Aurora Energy found that aggregation of smart storage led to two significant improvements. It found a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing, and by 90%  for peak shaving operations.
(Read: “Energy storage aggregation unlocks benefits for homeowners, grid operators, and installers“)
While AI has been used in energy management models for many years, it is a first to have it operable in multiple linked homes, said NREL. Lead researcher Xin Jin said, “Although we’ve tried to create models that are as close as possible to these homes, there are some elements, such as human behavior and occupancy, that are challenging to model. We’re excited to see how these uncertainties affect actual performance.”
Numerous partnerships made this field test possible, including co-funding from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies and Building Technologies offices, plus local partnerships with electric cooperative Holy Cross Energy and Habitat for Humanity.
Copper and Conservation Labs provided advanced sensor technologies that enable some of the key functionalities of the AI energy management system. The wireless energy monitors provide high-resolution energy consumption data, plus voltage measurements from each home and service transformer in real time.
The system was under development for years in NREL’s lab a few hours down the road in Golden, Colorado. Research engineer Bethany Sparn said, “The first year of the project was used to develop control algorithms based on simulated buildings. In the second year, we took those models into the lab with real equipment to identify integration challenges or hardware compatibility issues—and we worked out those kinks in the lab rather than in peoples’ homes.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/11/a-deep-dive-into-lazards-lcoe-report/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",A deep dive into Lazard’s LCOE report,"Lazard released its annual set of levelized cost reports on electricity generation, energy storage, and hydrogen. In this year’s Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis – Version 7.0, the group analyzed 12 energy storage projects, three of which were U.S.-based battery storage facilities coupled with solar power.
The first case study was a direct-to-grid wholesale project, the second was integrated into a commercial-industrial (C&I) site, and the third was located in someone’s home. For the wholesale and commercial analysis, two lithium ion and two flow battery solutions were considered; the residential site considered only lithium ion models.
The case studies, however, focused on a single battery chemistry. Based on the pricing, it appears that lithium technologies were chosen for the wholesale and commercial projects.

Despite being somewhat less energy dense, lithium ion phosphate chemistry batteries are fast becoming the preferred stationary battery technology due to their thermal simplicity, low price, and high availability. In the flow battery space, this author would like to nudge the Lazard folks to consider adding an iron-oxide flow product from the likes of ESS or Form Energy on the wholesale and commercial side, and the Redflow and Zinc8 for residential consideration.
The report raised concerns over future pricing stability and product availability as demand for battery products increases. Lazard cited the automotive industry’s squeeze on lithium ion products, a trend with no end in sight. The report stated that cars today account for 75% of lithium ion cells, although that number is expected to reach 90% by 2030. And, while stationary storage will grow from its current market share of 5%, it will likely fall short of a 10% market share through 2030.
This suggests that even though stationary energy storage will benefit from the technological innovations funded primarily by transportation, it will likely be constrained by the whims of the auto market.
Clearly, parallels may be drawn between the energy storage industry, the computer chip industry, and the solar cell industry.

The three solar plus storage projects — wholesale, C&I, residential — had solar volumes of 50 MW, 50 kW and 6 kW. The four hour batteries were rated at 100 MW, 1 MW and 10 kW. Their respective lifetime unsubsidized levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) had ranges of 8.5-15.8¢/kWh, 23.5-33.5¢/kWh, and 41.6-62.1¢/kWh, respectively.
The wholesale battery is located in the Texas ERCOT region, the C&I unit is in California’s CAISO, and the residential unit is located in the Hawaiian power grid.
 The Corpus Christi, Texas wholesale facility was projected to have an internal rate of return of 29.1%. None of its cited revenues came from selling solar directly to the market.
Wholesale PV+Storage, ERCOT (Corpus Christi, Texas)

The 50 MW/200 MWh battery must charge exclusively from an AC-coupled 50 MW solar power plant for the first five years to qualify for the full Investment Tax Credit benefit. The analysis forecast an average annual revenue of $4,693/kW for the three types of services the battery provides. Each of these services run only part of the time, although they may run concurrently some of that time.
The largest of the costs to be covered by selling the system’s stored energy is hardware, with $62 of the $85 in revenue going to finance the price of the equipment. Around 11% of the costs go toward buying electricity from the solar power plant.
Lazard suggested that after incentives run out, the California C&I energy storage market will face some challenging financial arguments. With the current incentives, however, the IRR of this office space solar-plus-storage is a respectable 23.4%.
C&I PV+Storage, PG&E (San Francisco, California)

The project is DC-coupled to a solar power plant. The battery is used to load shape the electricity demand of a large San Francisco office space. Most of the project’s revenue comes from bill management of a time-of-use electricity tariff. The California market has cheap daytime electricity due to heavy solar, and expensive early evening electricity. The battery time shifts the solar power to be used in the evening period.
Without this shift, the economics of standalone solar have been getting progressively more challenging. Lazard suggested that without the local incentive payment, battery economics would be challenging as well.
The study did not assign any technical value to the resiliency provided by the batteries in either the commercial or residential settings.
The residential solar+storage project located in Hawaii currently gets all of its revenue from bill management; that is, capturing  its energy from excess solar power, and selling it back to the grid when the sun is down.
Residential PV+Storage, HECO (Honolulu, Hawaii)

This model works primarily because Hawaiians produce so much solar electricity that they’re no longer allowed to export electricity to the grid. The state recently started to pay solar owners to add energy storage in an attempt to give the power grid access to distributed storage during periods of peak demand.
Because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, the financial model works out for batteries. In most states, however, home energy arbitrage does not produce sufficient revenue to pay off a battery. Future models from Lazard may include capacity payments from utilities, like those in Hawaii or like those recently announced in Utah.
And finally, in what may hopefully appear in future case studies, here is a list of “recent project activity” which was researched while Lazard was developing their analysis:

The projects are the Athens Ridge solar project, a 3.8 MW array set to be constructed in Athens, Maine, north of Augusta, and the Mars Hill solar project, a 2.8 MW array slated for Mars Hill, on the state’s border with Canada.
The Athens Ridge and Mars Hill projects were sold at the notice-to-proceed stage. Greenbacker will complete construction and retain long-term ownership. Construction is expected to start in the first quarter of 2022, with both assets slated to reach commercial operation in the third quarter.
The projects mark the fifth and sixth installations acquired by Greenbacker from ReneSola this year. In the first quarter, Greenbacker bought a pair of the developer’s Utah solar assets, totaling 9.8 MW. The following quarter, it acquired two more pre-operational solar projects in Maine, Richmond Hill, a 2.5 MW installation, and Lebanon Road, a 2.8 MW array.
All four projects will be considered legacy additions to the state’s net energy billing program, which was capped in the second quarter of 2021. The program allows customers to realize savings by offsetting their electric bills either with owned or shared energy projects, like community solar. Those investments, in turn, spur further development.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/11/import-restrictions-that-jolted-the-solar-industry-may-be-easing/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",Import restrictions that jolted the solar industry may be easing,"Solar module importers may have caught a break from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which offered revised guidance on how it will enforce the Withhold Release Order (WRO) issued on June 24.
The revision appears to be subtle, but may be significant.
In its FAQ document, CBP outlines what it will consider to be “reasonable care” with respect to imports that may contain components subject to the WRO.
The FAQ previously required importers to establish the source of metallurgical grade polysilicon or wafers, a level of certainty that has been widely viewed as nearly impossible to achieve.
In a November 10 revision, however, CBP now says that it will consider whether the importer is “able to establish the source of the component materials” in an imported solar module product. It dropped the specific reference to the source of metallurgical grade polysilicon.
In a note to its clients on the development, Roth Capital Partners said the subtly revised FAQ “suggests that the door is open” for more lenient enforcement. The firm said that it believed that additional traceability programs “are currently capable of showing non-Xinjiang polysilicon.”
The revised FAQs came on the same day that the U.S. Department of Commerce tossed out petitions from a group known as American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC), which sought anti-dumping and anti-circumvention (AD-CVD) tariffs to be levied on a handful of companies that import solar modules from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The WRO applies to silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. and its subsidiaries, as well as to materials and final goods derived from or produced using those silica-based products. CBP determined that forced labor is used by Hoshine in its production process.
The border enforcement agency said the scope of its WRO is not geographic, but entity-specific. “This means that not all goods containing silica-based products from China will be targeted for detention,” it said.
Earlier in November, LONGi Green Energy filed a report with the Shanghai Stock Exchange that said CBP had detained under the WRO a total of 40.31 MW of modules it exported to the U.S. between October 28 and November 3. LONGi said it established a tracing protocol last year and would be able to prove that the detained modules used silicon that meets U.S. requirements. It also said that module shipment to the U.S. were proceeding normally.
In August, reports first emerged that CBP was detaining solar modules that they suspected contained material subject to the WRO. Reports said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. Canadian Solar also was said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar was reported as having had six testing samples detained in July.
Beijing has long denied that any forced labor exists in China. It also has passed legislation that penalizes companies for cooperating with U.S. and other governments’ efforts to ban imports of goods produced with forced labor. In the U.S., laws that are intended to combat forced labor date back to the 1930s.
Even importers with robust traceability protocols have found it nearly impossible to trace component sources as far upstream as the mine-mouth for metals, which is what the WRO targets.
On June 24, the Biden administration ordered a ban on U.S. imports from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. over forced labor allegations. The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies, and what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang region of China.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/11/commerce-department-throws-out-anti-dumping-petitions/,"LEGAL,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",Commerce Department throws out anti-dumping petitions,"The U.S. Department of Commerce tossed out a request by an anonymous group of solar companies that sought what could have been crippling tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The dismissal is a win for the Solar Energy Industries Association, which vigorously opposed the request by American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention (A-SMACC) for anti-dumping and anti-circumvention (AD-CVD) tariffs. In a statement, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper called the decision to reject the petitions a “major victory for America’s 231,000 solar workers.”
She said the Commerce Department’s decision “provides a rush of certainty for companies to keep their investments moving, hire more workers and deploy more clean energy. This is a critical time for climate progress, and we cannot afford to go backwards at a time when we need to be deploying more clean energy than ever.”
A-SMACC filed a series of petitions in mid August seeking a Commerce Department investigation into its allegations that module imports from the three countries represented an attempt by the companies to skirt existing U.S. rules against dumping.
In an email to pv magazine, Timothy Brightbill, attorney for A-SMACC, said the group was reviewing the Commerce Department decision and offered no further comment.
In a November 10 decision, Abdelali Elouaradia, director of the Commerce Department’s AD-CVD office, said that A-SMACC’s insistence to keep the names of its member companies from the public would “prevent Commerce from obtaining and considering” information related to an inquiry.
Elouaradia wrote that “not disclosing A-SMACC members’ names publicly hampers interested parties from fully commenting on the requests for circumvention inquiries and may hamper them from commenting on certain issues that could arise if Commerce were to initiate circumvention inquiries.”
The letter gave A-SMACC until November 12 to publicly identify its members. Failing that, one or more of the member companies could file a separate petition, thus identifying themselves.
The Energy Information Administration’s 2020 Annual Solar Photovoltaic Module Shipments Report, released on July 30, said that solar PV imports to the U.S. totaled just under 19.3 million peak kilowatts, and exports totaled 376,483 peak kilowatts.

The EIA report listed Vietnam as the top source of PV imports to the U.S. at 8.1 million peak kilowatts. South Korea and Thailand combined were second at 4.4 million peak kilowatts, and Malaysia was third at 3.2 million peak kilowatts. The report lumped together imports from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, which totaled less than 950,000 peak kilowatts.
U.S. solar panel imports fell 27% during the third quarter, the largest single-quarter drop since 2018, according to research firm Panjiva, with analysis provided by by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
In addition to being down compared to the second quarter, total module shipments were also down 11%, compared to the same period in 2020, according to S&P. Trade tensions between Washington, D.C. and Beijing contributed to the double-digit declines.
The original AD and CVD investigations on imports of crystalline silicon PV cells were launched in November 2011. The U.S. International Trade Commission separately determined that U.S. producers were being materially hurt by the imports, and the Commerce Department in December 2012 imposed import tariffs. In 2019, the Department extended both import tariff orders.
The current antidumping China-wide rate is 238.95%. Certain Canadian Solar companies and certain JinkoSolar companies received 95.50% AD rates in the last completed review. Certain Trina Solar companies received a 92.52% AD rate, also in the last completed review. The countervailing duty “all others” rate is 15.24%, although certain Canadian Solar, Trina Solar, and Jinko Solar companies received a 11.97% CVD rate in the last completed review.
In their petition, the U.S. companies complain that after AD/CVD duties were imposed on Chinese-origin solar cells, Chinese integrated producers started building cell and module assembly plants across Southeast Asia, while continuing “to rely heavily” on Chinese labor, raw materials, and inputs.
