Look to consumer action first, study says","A study by the Brattle Group and Oracle determined that consumer action could cut emissions twice as much as utility actions alone.
The aggregate action of consumers engaging in activities like adopting solar, driving electric vehicles, and cutting energy use could amount to 534 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions avoided by 2040. The study said that would be equivalent to retiring more than half of the remaining coal-fired power plants in the U.S., or around 135 plants.
The report projected that by 2030, near-term emission reductions will be driven by consumer gas and electric energy efficiency and the installation of rooftop solar.
By 2040, electric vehicle adoption and the move to more efficient electric heating will begin playing a larger role. In EVs, carbon reduction will largely occur as a result of the expected four-fold increase in the total number of electric vehicles on the road from 2030 to 2040.
“One of the most critical weapons in the fight against climate change is eliminating carbon before it’s ever released into the environment,” said Matt O’Keefe, group vice president, Oracle Utilities Opower. He said that some of the biggest, untapped opportunities for utilities to decarbonize lie on the demand side, including energy efficiency, electrification, and demand flexibility.
He said all of those “rely on influencing customer action on a huge scale.”

Grid decarbonization should not be overlooked, however. Since 2005, U.S. energy-related emissions have declined by 13%, according to the report. About 85% of the reductions were from reduced power sector generation emissions, like retiring coal plants. However, 40% of emissions in 2021 were estimated to come from the residential, and light-duty vehicle space, over which consumer decision-making has influence.
The report estimated that through 2040, around 158 million metric tons (MMT) of emissions could be avoided by improving residential gas and energy efficiency. EV adoption may reduce emissions by as much as 256 MT over the same time period. Behind-the-meter solar projects could reduce 67 MMT of emissions, based on a projection of 135 GW of distributed residential solar deployed through 2040.
Under existing policies, the report predicted that “greening the grid”–utility-side decarbonization efforts–would reduce 284 MMT of carbon dioxide emissions through 2040.
In addition to consumer choices and utility-side decarbonization, the report called for increased load flexibility. Flexible loads, enabled by energy storage and smart inverter-based technologies reduce curtailment, enhance the value of energy, and provide real-time grid balancing services.

The local power companies included Athens Utilities Board, Gibson Electric Membership Corp., Joe Wheeler Electric Membership Corp., and Volunteer Energy Cooperative, and all wanted to break their supply deals with TVA. They cited what they said was TVA’s slow adoption of renewable energy resources and its unwillingness to provide them transmission service if they did not source all of their power from TVA.

The companies alleged that the federal entity violated Section 211 A(b) of the Federal Power Act.
Section 211 allows any electric utility, federal power marketing agency, or any other person generating electric energy for sale for resale to apply to FERC for an order requiring a utility to provide transmission services. The section also allows FERC to redress discriminatory practices being made by transmitting utilities.
The companies alleged that their supply deal with TVA is discriminatory so long as TVA has a generation portfolio skewed toward fossil fuels and relatively lacking in renewables. They asked to be freed from their supply deals so they could pursue electricity agreements from renewable resources, while retaining their ability to use TVA’s transmission infrastructure.
Since the initial complaint was filed, Joe Wheeler Electric Membership Corp. has since withdrawn.
According to FERC Chairman Richard Glick, the denial was not due to disagreement with the petitioners, but rather that the power to approve the petition is not held by FERC. Glick cited TVA’s “fence” provision.

The TVA Act provides that, subject to certain minor exceptions, neither TVA nor its distributor customers may be a source of power supply outside of TVA’s defined service area. This provision is often called the “fence” since it limits TVA’s sales activities to a specified service area. Additionally, the Federal Power Act prevents FERC from ordering TVA to provide access to its transmission lines for the purpose of delivering power to customers within TVA’s defined service area. This provision is often called the “anti-cherrypicking provision” since it prevents competitors from “cherrypicking” TVA’s customers.
Glick did, however, express some disapproval towards the fence provision. He referred to it as an “anachronism” which prohibited a competitive market. He also outlined the limits of FERC’s power, saying it would take an act of Congress to amend the TVA Act, adding that the time had come for such an act.
The petition’s denial by FERC was criticized by renewable energy advocates. Gaby Sarri-Tobar, a campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, called it “a deeply disappointing decision and a slap in the face” to TVA customers.
“FERC just blew an opportunity to set an important precedent and give TVA power companies options for cheaper, renewable power and lower rates for customers, and begin breaking our fossil-fuel addiction,” continued Sarri-Tobar.
The Center for Biological Diversity previously filed a brief on the preceding.

An official with TVA told pv magazine that the entity believes that FERC’s action is consistent with the company’s view that the public power model created by Congress best serves the public interest.
“The public power model works,” the statement said. “We look forward to continuing to work with all of the local power companies to advance our unique, shared mission of service.”
This sentiment was echoed by Tennessee Valley Public Power Association (TVPPA), which represents the power distributors of the Tennessee Valley.
In a statement, TVPPA President and CEO, Doug Peters, described the relationship between TVA and its distributor customers as “unlike any other in the nation,” adding that TVPPA believes in the TVA public power model and it supports maintaining it.
“We support our members’ local decisions, as each is governed by leaders from the communities in which they serve. We encourage TVA and the petitioners to begin anew in their effort to reach a point of consensus that would enable those local leaders to commit to a long-term contract with TVA,” the statement reads.
While the petition itself was denied, FERC Chair Richard Glick said that he has asked the commission’s enforcement staff to look into allegations that TVA is retaliating against the complainants, as first reported by lawyer Jeff Denis.
On October 15, the complainants in the case filed four affidavits that indicate retaliatory actions from TVA against an LPC in the case, based on statements TVA’s CEO Jeffrey Lyash made at a late summer TVA meeting. While the recounts of Lyash’s statements were redacted from public view, one of the affidavits has section that starts , “Mr. Lyash has made similar statements elsewhere,” which the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) used as a basis for their summary of events.
As Maggie Shober, director of utility reform with SACE outlined, Athens Utilities Board, which serves Athens, Tennessee, a city of about 14,000 between Knoxville and Chattanooga, was the subject of some of the comments.
The unredacted portion of an affidavit from the Athens utility’s General Manager, Eric Newberry Jr., alleged that Lyash and TVA Board Chair, Bill Kilbride, both met with Athens local officials.
Newberry went on to say that in that same conversation, Lyash noted TVA’s system is unreliable in the area of Volunteer Electric Cooperative (VEC), but that Lyash was reluctant to fix the situation because VEC brought the Petition to FERC and might leave TVA after the five year termination period in its contract.
SACE then said that Newberry stated in his affidavit that he was “taken aback by this statement” from Lyash, and that both Athens Utilities Board and VEC pay “millions of dollars each month in wholesale power charges to TVA” in exchange for a reliable supply of power.
According to Shober, Newberry suspects Lyash’s statements were an attempt to influence the Athens mayor to pressure the utilities board to withdraw from the FERC petition.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/21/how-varied-energy-storage-can-enable-a-low-cost-renewable-energy-future/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",How varied energy storage can enable a low-cost renewable energy future,"As the power grid progresses toward being sourced with 100% renewable energy, storage becomes critical to operating reliably and cost-effectively. Research at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) suggests that there is no single “silver bullet” storage technology, but instead, a mix of technologies that could offer the most optimal future. 
In a study published in Energy & Environmental Science, researchers from NREL used a custom high-resolution model to compare energy storage possibilities across the United States. The group found geographic variation, among other factors, can determine the optimal energy storage portfolio. 
For example, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) grid has high solar penetration, and would benefit from discharging seasonal storage for around 50 days to cover winter months in the model. Compare this to the wind-driven Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which could deploy shorter-duration seasonal storage, with a capacity of 5-14 days. The researchers said these durations are currently much longer than currently deployed storage technologies. 
Storage faces trade-offs in efficiency and capital costs for both the power and energy components, which is why the researchers say multiple technologies are useful. Short-duration technologies like Li-ion batteries have high efficiencies but also high energy-related costs, while long-duration storage like compressed air or pumped thermal have lower energy-related costs but suffer from lower efficiencies. 
The study found that as a system approaches 100% renewable operations, a growing share of its storage portfolio would benefit from multiple-day to even seasonal capacity. This is due to an increasing seasonal mismatch of the remaining load and supply of renewable energy.
NREL also said a strategy of storage-to-storage charging may arise, to drop the rate of renewable energy curtailments and store more power where it’s needed.
The researchers said their models are important for renewable developers and stakeholders who are planning 10 to 20 years ahead. They said that because storage technologies are flexible they can be used for a variety of grid services. A next research step will be to understand the full range of energy storage benefits to inform optimal storage portfolios.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/21/policy-will-determine-if-bidens-community-solar-push-succeeds/,"COMMUNITY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Policy will determine if Biden’s community solar push succeeds,"The Biden administration and its Department of Energy (DOE) has set a target to power 5 million homes by 2025 with community solar, with goals explicitly targeting moderate to low income households and those who don’t own homes.
In making its announcement, the DOE said there is currently enough community solar installed in the U.S. today to power 600,000 households. It also provides a great community solar reference in the Solar Futures Study and the Sharing the Sun Report studies, both referenced in the press briefing.

However, to go from powering 600,000 homes to 5 million means we must grow community solar by 700%. That is roughly equivalent to deploying 27.1 GWac / 34 GW of solar power.
To meet this goal, the administration is funding the National Community Solar Partnership. This tool aims to support various community solar stakeholders, from solar developers, to software coders, to public-policy crafters. Essentially, the partnership is intended to train and develop industry professionals in order to ramp up community solar deployment.
Growing an industry by 700% or more clearly is going to take a lot of work.
Community solar capacity has more than doubled every year since 2010, with over 1.1 GW coming online in 2020. And 21 states and Washington, D.C. have passed legislation to enable community solar either through state-required programs or through pilot projects.
That means that if we’re going to deploy 700% more community solar in the next five years, we’ll need to bring online greater than five times what was deployed in 2020, every year, for the next five years. That is not going to just happen; we’re going to have to work very hard on policy.
First, the projects must make financial sense. Second, they must have a legislative path to market for their electricity. Third, and ultimately, they must be able to connect to the power grid in a timely and cost-effective manner.
 
New York and Pennsylvania are two states of consequence for community solar right now, but for very different reasons.
 
New York has successfully deployed or developed 6 GW of distributed solar power — ranging in size from 5 MWac on down –meeting state goals several years early. Now, the state aims to increase that figure with an additional 4 GW capacity.
New York also is in the early stages of its energy storage deployment program, and is beginning to build transmission power lines to bring electricity from rural lands in the north to load centers around New York City.
However, New York’s community solar program isn’t selling anything new right now. Instead, it is building projects already signed within the last couple of years. As the community aolar program has already met its goals, funding — to the tune of about 2 cents per kilowatt hour — is no longer available. Portfolios of new projects are sitting in the hands of finance institutions, unable to close, as the financial side of projects no longer meets investors’ requirements.
Another reason that projects are unable to meet investor requirements is interconnection costs. These range from $500,000 to several million dollars to connect anywhere from 2 MWac through 5 MWac to the grids. Solar developers have already scoured the publicly available data in the hosting capacity maps to find the low-hanging fruit. And they’ve also shouldered the costs of grid upgrades for many years.
Image: Community Energy
The local utilities, hoping to hold onto power and profits, have floated a proposal that is being opposed by the solar industry. The State of New York has also increased the social cost of carbon; this help to bridge the gap (but by only a penny so far) which is not enough to get most financiers moving forward given our current inflationary climate.
All this means that New York has a legislative pathway to the market, and an open interconnection process, but the financials don’t add up because interconnection costs have increased and the unrealized costs of fossils still allow for cheap electricity.
New York’s southern neighbor offers a very different solar market. The power grid in Pennsylvania is wide open, with less than 1% of electricity coming from solar power. But there still isn’t a path for community solar electricity to get to market. As a result,  there’s no financial certainty for most small-scale utility projects.
In fact, Pennsylvania doesn’t even have a community solar program. Multiple pieces of legislation have been introduced, but none has made it to the desk of a signature-ready-and-willing governor.
Even with the lower cost of installation in the state, greater solar insolation values, and more expensive wholesale electricity when compared with cheap upstate New York hydroelectric power, these benefits are irrelevant without a community solar program.
Even so, we can even see hints of an unsubsidized solar market developing. But right now, that market is only for large projects whose costs can scale and compete in the 3-4¢/kWh wholesale market game.
And for an extreme example, take Minnesota, whose community solar program has been called the most successful nationwide. But it now has led to some customers being told they’ll need to wait 15 years to interconnect their solar power.
If the Biden administration is to deploy huge amounts of community over the next several years, it must aggressively push policy makers to adequately prepare markets. That means electricity markets need a pathway for the electricity to be sold. And policies must consider and solve financial constraints. Doing all of this will enable renewable assets to connect to the power grid on time, and in a financially viable manner.

To mitigate the challenge of too much cheap, clean, solar power, developers have coupled energy storage with about a third of all solar power projects in the nation’s construction queues.
However, we’re still very early in the energy storage phase of market development. With that in mind, the Electricity Markets & Policy (EMP) group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published a document, Influence of Business Models on PV-Battery Dispatch Decisions and Market Value. It analyzes the business cases of 11 utility scale facilities with solar+storage, and provides a list of all projects greater than 1 MW of size.

The main takeaway is that “the empirical increase in market value of a PV-battery hybrid relative to a standalone PV plant varies by project and ranges from 0.1¢/kWh to 4.8¢/kWh.”
Within the solar+storage industry, it’s well known that most solar+storage power plants do not simply charge with solar in the daytime and sell electricity into the merchant wholesale market at night. Local policy — sometimes at the state level, such as in Massachusetts — or at the regional transmission level — as in Texas or the ISO New England region — are the biggest variables right now driving differences in revenue models.
The 11 case studies were from the California, Texas, and New England power grid regions.

The three projects in the Texas ERCOT region, unsurprisingly, ran as pure merchant facilities. Those facilities buy electricity to charge batteries when the price is low, without discriminating between generation sources or benefiting from the solar investment tax credit. They then sell into the grid when the price is high. In Texas, this peak period often occurs midday as air conditioners turn on.
Projects in the New England region, however, pushed electricity into the evening peak demand period because daytime temperatures are cooler.  The New England region has a duck curve – much like California’s – which is largely a result of behind-the-meter solar power in Massachusetts. The duck curve’s effect on market pricing is to drive daytime power down.
In a few years, as the 100 GW of solar power in Texas comes online, that market may shift toward a New England or California-style evening peak price model.

One of the New England solar+storage facilities earns revenue from the still-evolving Massachusetts Clean Peak program. This program requires energy storage to charge with clean electricity – in this case solar power – and dispatch it during the dirtiest, most expensive 10% of demand periods as predetermined by the state over the course of the year.
Many of these projects also make money in the ancillary services market. But because the revenue in such markets is limited, the expected volume of energy storage will soon dwarf the revenue available from ancillary services.

The image at left, taken from this document from the EMP lab, shows that roughly 7.8 GW of capacity is needed for spinning reserve services across the nation, versus the more than 100 GW of energy storage already in the queues.
As new energy storage technologies deploy with lower per kilowatt-hour pricing, the transition from evening peak period demand to general merchant electricity will accelerate.
In 2019, we got a chance to see publicly what a large solar+storage plant might charge for its electricity when Los Angeles signed on for the Eland Solar Power Project sold by 8Minute Solar Energy.
The default solar power project, a pair of 200 MWac power plants, was offered with a power purchase agreement of 1.997¢/kWh. Then, two energy storage adders were offered. The first added a 100 MW/400 MWh battery to each facility for an additional 1.3¢/kWh. The second increased the battery sizing to 150 MW/600 MWh for an additional 0.665¢/kWh.
In total, Los Angeles signed on for 400 MWac/~700 MWdc of solar power plus 300 MW/1.2 GWh of energy storage for just under 4¢/kWh, with batteries making up around half of that revenue.
However, again, this project isn’t selling electricity into the wholesale market. Its excess daytime solar will sell at the time of generation, and its energy storage solar power will sell into the evening peaking periods.

Module manufacturer Trina Solar said the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) is set to announce a set of standard dimensions for large format modules relying on the 210mm wafer launched by Zhonghuan Semiconductor in 2019.
The standard, according to Trina, will be set for different cell layouts as in the table below. Having a standard set of dimensions should make thing simpler, and therefore cheaper, for project developers and component suppliers. All of them have to deal with uncertainty over module sizes and electrical characteristics since the switch to larger wafer formats began to play out.
The process began in May, when the CPIA brought together industry experts and representatives from across the supply chain to agree on a set of standards for products incorporating the 210mm wafer. Cell and module manufacturers including Trina Solar, Risen Energy, Canadian Solar, and Tongwei – all of which have opted to work with the 210mm wafer rather than the smaller 182mm product being promoted by Longi and others – took part in the CPIA event. They agreed to standardize various technical details of the modules including module dimensions, size and positioning of mounting system attachment holes, and cell spacing, among other details.
Modules will also be designed to meet the latest international standards including IEC 61730, published by the Switzerland-based International Electrotechnical Commission.
“This means 210mm module manufacturers, end users and system solution providers have achieved uniformity in technical issues,” said Trina Solar in a statement.
Trina said it expects the move for standardization to directly result in cost reductions for balance of systems components, and a more efficient supply chain. It said it also expects the manufacturing industry to be able to innovate and bring new processes to scale more quickly, and to bring down manufacturing costs.

The company said it is seeking a variety of sources including new renewable dispatchable generation projects (with or without energy storage systems), extensions of existing resources, standalone energy storage projects, and aggregated customer-sited distributed energy resources projects.
Projects will need to be at least 2.5 MW in size, the threshold for a waiver from competitive bidding rules.

Under the agreement, the two will work to help the utility reach an 80% carbon-free resource mix by 2035 and develop a roadmap to achieve a 100% carbon-free energy mix by 2045.
A focus will be to develop a strategy for the utility to use hydrogen to generate energy across its power generation fleet. Part of the plan includes converting El Paso Electric’s Newman Power Station’s newest unit from all natural gas generation to a blend of up to 30% hydrogen, and eventually to all hydrogen.
The two also will work to evaluate regional transportation, commercial, and other industrial sectors to promote future decarbonization and economic growth.
In August, El Paso Electric and community and environmental groups reached an agreement on construction of the gas-fired 228 MW, $168 million Newman Unit 6. The groups agreed to withdraw their opposition to the plant. In exchange, the utility agreed to a four-year moratorium — excluding Newman 6 — on building any new natural gas units. The agreement also stated the site will not be used for future fossil fuel construction after Newman 6 is built.
The project faced delays after the Sierra Club and others challenged Texas’ pending approval of El Paso Electric’s air quality permit, citing health and environmental concerns.
In September, fossil fuel company Chevron tentatively agreed to acquire an interest in ACES Delta, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development that owns the hydrogen-based Advanced Clean Energy Storage project. The Utah project would produce, store, and transport green hydrogen in salt dome caverns at utility scale for power generation, transportation, and industrial applications in the western United States.

Under the plan, the 840 MW Intermountain Power Plant would be converted from coal to natural gas and then to green hydrogen to produce electricity. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is leading the power plant conversion.
