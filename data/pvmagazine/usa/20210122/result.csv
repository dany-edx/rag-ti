To stay up to date on what’s new, check out this latest product roundup:
New York City-based utility Con Edison is offering, free of charge, a device that can save upwards of $1,000 for a residential customer installing a new solar array. The Smart ConnectDER, built by project partner ConnectDER, allows the customer to avoid the cost of upgrading the circuit breaker panel. It also eliminates the need for excessive electrical boxes on the side of the home.
The Smart ConnectDER is an adapter that uses the electric meter socket as a point of interconnection for solar power. It fits on most electric meters and works for solar arrays up to 15 kW. Con Edison provided 300 Smart ConnectDERs to customers during a 2019 pilot program and has received state funding to provide an additional 2,400 units. The utility said it plans to continue the program even after reaching that target. More info available here.

Separately, Virginia-based ConnectDER announced it received a U.S. patent for “innovations” to its products. More info available here.
e-Zinc, a Toronto-based startup, raised C$2.3 million ($1.8 million) in a closed round led by BDC Capital’s Cleantech Practice to help accelerate commercialization of the tech company’s long-duration energy storage solution.
According to e-Zinc, it developed a grid-scale solution that stores energy in physically free zinc metal, scales energy capacity at a fraction of the cost of lithium-ion batteries, and enables economical energy delivery over a period of multiple days. This latest financing adds to other equity rounds and government grants. The company plans to launch a pilot project in Ontario in May and has set its sights on entering the U.S. market. More info available here.
Panasonic Corp. of North America recently promoted 13 installers across the U.S. to the Elite and Premium tiers of its Residential Solar Installer Program. Installers and homeowners will not only gain access to the Panasonic Solar Modules portfolio, but also receive access to the new high-efficiency Panasonic Solar EverVolt Modules, available beginning in February.
Homeowners in Arizona, Texas, Florida, Iowa, and Indiana will be able to access Panasonic’s solar products from seven Elite Level installers, who will be the first in Panasonic’s network to gain access to new products and rebates. Six additional installers in Florida, Texas, and New Mexico will also offer homeowners Panasonic’s benefits as new Premium Level installers. More info available here.
California-based Enphase Energy said that its Enphase Storage systems are now compatible with Enphase M215 and M250 microinverter-based solar systems. According to the company, the expanded compatibility provides approximately 300,000 additional Enphase system owners with the possibility of achieving grid-agnostic energy resilience through the Enphase Upgrade Program.

Similarly, this new combo of solar and storage products, as well as previous compatibility with IQ 6 and IQ 7 microinverter-based systems, now allows U.S. installers to approach and offer storage upgrades to nearly the vast majority of Enphase homeowners nationwide. More info available here.
NeoVolta, a San Diego-based manufacturer of residential energy storage systems, has expanded its distribution network into Utah, adding to California, Nevada, and Arizona. Under a three-year agreement, PMP Energy is able to secure specific geographic exclusivities for distribution, in exchange for making minimum purchases of up to $15 million.
According to NeoVolta, its NV14 product features a storage capacity of 14.4 kWh and 7.7 kW of continuous power discharge. That capacity can be scaled up to 24 kWh with the optional NV24 add-on battery, without the expense of an additional inverter. NeoVolta systems are engineered with lithium iron phosphate chemistry. More info available here.
Rhombus Energy Solutions has landed certification by Underwriters Laboratory (UL) and the Consumer Electronics Testing and Certification Services Group (CSA) for its RES-D2-CS20 electric vehicle (EV) charging dispenser. The product is compatible with Rhombus’s UL-certified 60 kW and 125 kW power conditioning systems (PCS) for high-power EV charging of medium- and heavy-duty fleets.
Combined with the UL 1741-SA certification of Rhombus’ AC to DC PCS units, these certifications allow Rhombus solutions to be used in both unidirectional and bi-directional vehicle-to-grid applications, meaning fleet operators could use their EVs as a source of energy storage.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/22/virginia-aims-to-make-installing-energy-storage-easier/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,VIRGINIA",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Virginia aims to make installing energy storage easier,"Over the last two years, Virginia has made significant legislative strides in promoting the development of renewable resources, all in pursuit of achieving 100% clean energy by 2050, adding 16 GW of solar and onshore wind, building 3 GW of energy storage, and closing the state’s coal power plants by 2024.
In 2020, legislators changed state laws to allow solar and wind projects to be developed more smoothly and swiftly. Initially devised for smaller-scale wind projects and later extended to solar, Virginia’s permit by rule (PBR) program allows renewable generation projects under a certain threshold – 150 MW for now – to eschew the approval process overseen by the State Corporation Commission, which can be a lengthy affair.
This year, lawmakers are looking to do the same for energy storage.
Enter House Bill 2148, a measure introduced by State Delegate Rodney Willett, a Democrat from Henrico County. The bill looks to extend this same regulatory review avoidance to energy storage facilities and hybrid renewable + storage projects that meet similar parameters.
Willett has described the bill as the logical next step toward achieving the state’s clean economy goals and critical if Virginia hopes to get an unprecedented 3.1 GW of storage onto the grid by 2035.
And while projects still have a number of steps along development that can slow down or stall them, PBR has proven to be an effective policy for Virginia in recent history. More than 70 project developers filed notices of intent to apply for the program in 2020.
HB 2148 is not the only bill in the works in Virginia to make rolling out storage projects easier. One of the biggest headaches for developing solar in the state has been getting permits for projects (just ask the Spotsylvania developers).
This has been so historically difficult because, prior to 2020, renewable generation projects had certain state tax exemptions. Because of this, rural residents and legislators felt that they were being taken advantage of, as these projects would take up large swaths of land, provide little local revenue, and have the generation used outside of the local community.
This issue was partially remedied in 2020, when laws were passed that caused the tax exemptions to decrease over time, or local governments could instead opt for a revenue-sharing system where a $1,400/MW fee could be imposed on the project.
State Delegate Stephen Heretick, a Democrat from Portsmouth County, has introduced House Bill 2006, which would extend these same measures to energy storage projects.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/22/entergy-arkansas-solar-program-slated-to-save-60m-for-local-schools-other-customers/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARKANSAS,UNITED STATES",JOE BEBON,"JANUARY 22, 2021","Entergy Arkansas solar program slated to save $60m for local schools, other customers","Entergy Arkansas customers who joined the utility’s Solar Energy Purchase Option B program in fall 2020 have already begun to reap savings from the clean power generated at the 81 MW Stuttgart Solar Energy Center.
According to Entergy Arkansas, participating agencies are projected to save about $60 million over the lifetime of the solar facility.
Of the 61 subscribed customers, 26 are schools, which will save an estimated $39 million over the next 18 years. The remaining subscribed entities – including cities and counties, water treatment plants, churches, and nonprofits – will save nearly $21 million.
“From October to November, our energy bill went down by $2,700,” said Robby Lowe, superintendent of the Junction City School District.
The Jessieville School District is expected to save over $50,000 annually. Superintendent Melissa Speers said that extra money can now go toward more efforts to support students, including anything “from better science labs to more field trips.”
Owned and operated by NextEra, Stuttgart Solar came online in 2018 and is contracted exclusively to Entergy Arkansas. It was the first of three approved Entergy Arkansas solar facilities.
Half of the 81 MW project’s power is dedicated to tax-exempt subscribers under the Solar Energy Purchase Option program. The solar tariff was approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission (PSC) in mid-September 2020, and customers were enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis.
Entergy Arkansas noted that all available energy is currently under contract, with more than 60 entities enrolled and at least that many on the waiting list for any future Solar Energy Purchase Options the PSC might authorize.
By participating in this program, customers are expected to save between 18% and 28% on their electricity costs, while still helping to support grid maintenance and lowering the cost shift incurred by all other customers without solar systems.
Michael Considine, Entergy Arkansas’ vice president of customer service, said this program is “especially helpful to tax-exempt customers who already have tight budgets.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/22/tampa-electric-doubles-its-solar-powered-homes-goal/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,FLORIDA",TIM SYLVIA,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Tampa Electric doubles its solar-powered homes goal,"Tampa Electric achieved commercial operation on its tenth utility-scale  solar project, the 60 MW Durrance Solar project, located in Polk County, Florida.
By bringing that project live earlier this month, Tampa Electric now has enough solar capacity to power 100,000 homes, a benchmark that the utility had previously set as a procurement goal. Now, the utility has set its sights on its next goal: having enough solar capacity on-line by 2023 to power 200,000 homes.
Alongside doubling its solar reach in just two years, the utility is also looking to retire a coal unit, Big Bend Unit 3, in 2023, nearly two decades before the unit’s scheduled retirement. The move is seen as a money saving one as well as an environmentally-conscious decision, as continuing the unit’s operation past 2023 would require significant capital investments for improvements, a financial burden the utility has deemed unfair to ratepayers.
Big Bend 3 also marks the second Big Bend unit that is retiring. In November, Unit 2 will retire as part of the $850 million Big Bend Modernization project, an undertaking that will renovate the remaining Big Bend units to include combined-cycle natural gas units, capable of producing 1,090 MW of electricity.
Back on the solar side of things, the work to get to 200,000 is under way. Tampa Electric has begun construction on the next wave of 600 MW of solar, all of which will reach commercial operation by the end of 2023. Four projects with a combined capacity of 225 MW are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2021. When the entire 600 MW tranche is complete, Tampa Electric will have enough solar energy to reach its 200,000-homes goal.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/22/why-module-cleaning-makes-all-the-difference/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Why module cleaning makes all the difference,"For many years, it was believed that solar panels didn’t need cleaning. The inclination of installed modules and rain were thought to result in automatic cleaning. This theory was supported by solar panel manufacturers and installers throughout the boom of the solar industry in the early 2000s.
After the market slowdown of 2014-2017, and the increased deployment of solar panels on farm roofs, industrial and commercial sites, as well as the construction of solar parks in arid zones, it became quite clear that in environments with heavy soiling, the yield of solar panels can drop drastically.
Today, the cleaning of solar panels is widely accepted as a necessity rather than a luxury. Most new solar projects already include some sort of cleaning process in their maintenance plans. In fact, in order to reduce the cost of maintenance and a thorough management to minimize production losses is necessary. Solar panel cleaning systems can provide such maintenance assistance.
In order to understand the importance of the solar panel cleaning segment, it is essential to understand why dirty panels are an issue and how soiling can damage solar panels in the long term. Studies carried out in the United States, the Middle East and elsewhere have demonstrated the extent to which solar modules’ energy output falls when they are left uncleaned.

Shade on panels temporarily diminishes their production. However, dirt on the panels keeps the production permanently reduced, until the module is cleaned. The decline in power output is particularly noticeable in dusty, arid, and windy areas as the wind blows sand onto the panels.
However, even in milder climactic conditions with more rainy weather, it is noticeable that dirt remains on the panels. This is true even when modules are installed at a steep incline, which helps to flush off water and dirt. Moreover, dust tends to accumulate over time, and will become engrained, severely impacting output.
Power losses are not the only problem caused by soiling. Ongoing soiling can result in hot spots forming over time. Sand can be blown off unevenly by the wind and may scratch the module surface. Irregular soiling is a more common — and the most problematic — type of soiling.
Beyond dust, bird droppings can accumulate on modules, particularly in urban areas. These droppings, apart from their acidity, also lead to hotspots forming on the module: the heat concentrates in one point, causing damage to the cell. The damaged cell will impact the yield of all the neighboring cells. Whatever the soiling type, regular cleaning is a must in order to keep all elements of the solar installation in optimal operating condition.
Several techniques and methods have been developed over the years to efficiently clean solar panels.
The first method, still one of the most widespread today, is washing panels using handheld brushes. This technique is advantageous for smaller installations and for rooftops with higher inclinations Panels on steeply sloped rooftops can be difficult to reach and can only be cleaned cost-efficiently when cleaned manually by hand.
However, with the growth of large-scale commercial installations, the manual cleaning business model is being challenged. Lack of efficiency, rising labor costs, and labor-related safety issues play a big role, and in a worst-case scenario can result in a “Sisyphus-like-task,” with cleaned panels becoming dirty again before the entire cleaning job is completed.
Although manual cleaning is a reliable and rapidly deployable solution, it is no longer sufficiently efficient in light of the large numbers of large-scale solar power plants that are popping up everywhere in the world.

For ground-mounted PV installations, a bulky but efficient solution was developed by mounting long brushes onto vehicles, mostly slow-moving tractors. These brushes allow the cleaning of panels rows, as long as there’s enough space between the rows to let the vehicle pass. Depending on the configuration of the installation, it can be a very efficient solution for cleaning solar panels.
However, the use of tractors is heavily dependent on the availability of fuel, the terrain itself, and the condition of the ground – which can be heavy mud. Also, it is only possible to clean panels up to a certain height. These restrictions aside, it is one of the quickest ways to clean large-scale installations.
Other solutions available for large-scale, ground-mounted installations are semi-automated long brushes of varying lengths that are fixed to the frame of the installation and move vertically along the array. These machines can be automatized to run at specific times of the day or night. However, they cover only one single row of the array, and require large investments plus extra manpower to move the machines from one line to the next.
The newest, and most versatile solution for the cleaning of solar panels is the use of solar panel cleaning robots. Several types of robots exist on the market, from small to big, from lightweight to heavy. Besides manual brushes, robots are the only solution that are capable of cleaning any type of commercial installation, including solar panels mounted on on roof-tops, car ports, ground mount systems as well as floating solar plants.
Robotic solutions are semi-automatic and are controlled by a single user. They allow a faster cleaning with less physical strain. Also, it is the most versatile solution, being fast and easy to transport from site to site, and very easily deployed and lifted onto roof tops without the necessity of cherry pickers or lifts. Semi-automatic robots are the most versatile solution, adaptable to any type commercial solar installation.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/22/seia-expands-its-executive-team-as-advocacy-work-accelerates/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 22, 2021",SEIA expands its executive team as advocacy work accelerates,"The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has expanded its executive team as the organization prepares for what it said will be a strong advocacy push in 2021.

Evelyn Butler will serve as vice president of technical services, leading SEIA’s work on a range of issues that facilitate continued solar growth and mitigate business risks for solar companies. Her portfolio will include work on solar codes and standards, workforce development, corporate social responsibility, and the circular economy including PV recycling, among other issues.
In her five years with SEIA, Butler has worked across the organization on issues related to best practices and codes and standards proposals. Through her work, she established SEIA’s PV Recycling Network, helped to create requirements for solar on new homes in California, and improved solar permitting through SolarAPP+.
Roderick Lewis is SEIA’s new vice president of member services, responsible for developing and driving all phases of the organization’s membership growth strategy, including recruitment, retention. and membership upgrades.

Lewis has led SEIA’s membership team since mid-2019 and has worked in association sales for more than 20 years. SEIA has set a goal for solar to reach 20% of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030, and Lewis is being tasked with ensuring that SEIA’s membership mirrors the industry’s growth and that the organization has the resources it needs to effectively advocate for a maturing industry.
In addition to his role as SEIA’s vice president of state affairs, Sean Gallagher will also direct SEIA’s federal regulatory affairs efforts. Gallagher previously represented the California Public Utilities Commission at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and has supported utility-scale solar project development on public and tribal lands. He has also worked on matters related to the Section 1603 Treasury Grant Program and the U.S. Department of Energy’s loan guarantee program.
SEIA said it will be filling additional positions under Gallagher to lead the industry’s advocacy on issues such as increasing renewable energy deployment on public lands, the implementation of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, fair treatment of distributed energy resources, fair electricity market rules and greater collaboration with Regional Transmission Organizations, and compliance with the Paris Climate Accord.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/22/sunrise-brief-xcel-fined-1m-over-solar-interconnection-complaints/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 22, 2021",Sunrise brief: Xcel fined $1M over solar interconnection complaints,"Minnesota utility regulators fined Xcel Energy $1 million for complaints related to delays in connecting solar projects to the electricity grid.
Almost all of the roughly 120 complaints were filed by St. Paul-based All Energy Solar in 2019.
Published reports said that Minneapolis-based Xcel acknowledged shortcomings, but argued the complaints should have been rolled into one. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) disagreed with that assertion, but split on whether to immediately hit Xcel with the $1 million fine.
The complaints stem from a 2019 standard that Xcel, the solar industry and clean-energy groups hoped would improve the state’s interconnection process. The interconnection problems have been with community solar gardens — which number over 300 — and other smaller projects.
In December 2019, All Energy Solar filed 128 complaints against Xcel, accusing the utility of “systemic failure.”
At least one other developer filed a complaint, and the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association reportedly has said in regulatory filings that other developers have had similar problems.
There has been “industry­wide exasperation” with Xcel on connecting to the grid, David Shaffer, the trade group’s executive director, was quoted as saying to regulators.
The avalanche of complaints hurt Xcel’s 2019 “quality of service plan,” an annual regulatory report. They put Xcel over its allowed threshold of 363 complaints for 2019, triggering the $1 million fine.
Xcel reportedly said it has resolved the 2019 All Energy Solar complaints, which the company contends should not count toward its service-quality plan. The plan was never intended to include interconnection issues, which have their own review process, Xcel said.
Sungrow said it will supply an energy storage system to the 100 MW Chisholm Grid project in Fort Worth, Texas. Chisholm Grid has been under construction since August of 2020 and will be one of the largest battery energy storage facilities in Texas when work onsite is completed this June. The facility will use lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNiMnCoO2) battery technology. It will provide energy and grid stabilization services to the ERCOT wholesale electricity market.
The Chisholm Grid Battery Energy Storage Project is owned by Astral Electricity, a privately-held energy storage power producer, and was developed by Able Grid Infrastructure Holdings, a joint venture between Able Grid and MAP RE/ES.
Researchers at MIT say that installing charging stations on residential streets, rather than just in central locations such as shopping malls, could have an outsized benefit in increasing the number of electric vehicles on roads.
They also found that adding high-speed charging stations along highways and making supplementary vehicles more easily available to people who need to travel beyond the single-charge range of their electric vehicles could greatly increase the vehicle electrification potential.
The findings are reported in the journal Nature Energy.
The researchers developed a methodology to identify charging solutions that would conveniently fit into people’s daily activities. They used data collected from GPS tracking devices in cars, as well as survey results about people’s daily driving habits and needs, including detailed data from the Seattle area and more general data from the U.S. as a whole.

The approach emphasized building a better understanding of people’s detailed energy consuming behavior, throughout the day and year.
While the vast majority of people’s daily driving needs can be met by the range provided by existing electric cars, people sometimes need to drive much farther. Or, they may need to make more short trips than usual in a day, with little time to stop and recharge. These so-called “high-energy days” can be the deciding factor in people’s decision making about whether to go electric.
Being strategic in placing infrastructure where it can be most convenient and effective — and making drivers aware of it so they can easily envision where and when they will charge — could make a huge difference, the researchers said.
In looking at driving habits in Seattle, the team found that the impact of either adding highway fast-charging stations or increasing availability of supplementary long-range vehicles for up to four days a year meant that the number of homes that could meet their driving needs with a lower-cost electric vehicle rose from 10% to 40%. The number topped 90% when fast-charging stations, workplace charging, overnight public charging, and up to 10 days of access to supplementary vehicles were all available. The researchers said that charging options at residential locations (on or off-street) proved to be key across all scenarios.
The study’s findings also highlight the importance of making overnight charging capabilities available to more people. While those who have their own garages or off-street parking can often already easily charge their cars at home, many people do not have that option and use public parking. That includes locations such as hotels as well as residential neighborhoods.
