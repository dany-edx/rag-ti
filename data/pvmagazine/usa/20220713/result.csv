Four years later, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched solar panels into space.
Today, solar panels power the James Webb Space Telescope, which offered the world the most detailed look into the most remote reaches of the universe to date.
NASA launched the Webb Space Telescope on Christmas Day 2021. The telescope uses less power than one might think. In fact, only one kilowatt, equivalent to the power used in microwaving your lunch, is needed to power the device. NASA said Webb will stay energy efficient more than 1 million miles from Earth, reliably powered by photovoltaics.
A 20-foot fold-out solar array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the ‘powerhouse’ for the telescope, supplying energy to all its scientific instruments, communications, and propulsion systems. The system is sized at 2 kW to account for the degradation that will occur over time due to the harsh conditions of space.
The array consists of five panels that are connected by hinges for folding into the launch vehicle, the Ariane 5 rocket. The telescope’s onboard battery was designed to only last a few hours, so the unfolding and activation of the array was considered one of the most critical early steps of the telescope’s voyage. A video of the deployment of the fold-out array can be viewed below.
 
Solar in space
The James Webb telescope is not the only NASA project that relies on photovoltaics to power its systems. Last June, Astronauts Shane Kimbrough of NASA and Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency (ESA) completed their spacewalk upgrade of the international space station, installing the iROSA roll-out solar arrays.
It cost about $100 million to install the six arrays. The arrays are expected to add more than 120kW in capacity, which will increase the station’s power generation by 20% to 30%. The solar panels that were replaced were designed for a 15-year service life, but had been continually operating since December 2000. Although they were functioning well, the older arrays were showing signs of degradation, as expected. 
Last December, NASA announced it is testing solar-powered electric propulsion systems for asteroid defense. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission will employ roll-out solar arrays and a 6.9 kW gridded ion electric propulsion system to redirect Earthbound asteroids by smashing the small craft into the asteroid.
The craft is designed to propel itself at about 250 miles per hour, guided by an onboard camera and autonomous navigation software, directly into the path of the asteroid. The DART test will make contact with the Didymos system’s moonlet that is headed into orbit in September 2022.
NASA is also using two large cross-shaped PV arrays to power its Psyche mission, which will bring a craft 1.5 billion miles away from Earth to the asteroid Psyche. The mission is to explore a large, metal-rich asteroid with the remote-operated craft.
The Psyche solar array s 37.1 feet long and 24 feet wide on each side when fully deployed. The two cross-shaped arrays fold out from the craft, and represent the largest solar array deployed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said NASA. So large, in fact, that the entire craft could not be unfolded during the test at Arizona State University’s lab in Tempe. ASU has partnered with NASA on this mission, which will observe the suspected unusually high amount of metals in the thickest band of the asteroid.
On Earth, the solar array can generate about 21 kW of electricity, but far away from the sun alongside Psyche, they will only produce 2 kW, about the same energy demand as a hair dryer. Despite this low amount of energy, it will be sufficient to power the planned three-and-a-half-year journey to the asteroid, and the two years of orbiting and observation of the body.
“Even in the beginning, when we were first designing the mission in 2012, we were talking about solar electric propulsion as part of the plan. Without it, we wouldn’t have the Psyche mission,” said Arizona State University’s Lindy Elkins-Tanton, who, as principal investigator, leads the mission. “And it’s become part of the character of the mission. It takes a specialized team to calculate trajectories and orbits using solar electric propulsion.”
The launch is planned for this August, and the Psyche spacecraft may make first contact with the Psyche asteroid in 2026.

Enel Green Power is a developer, owner and operator of renewable energy plants with a presence in 14 US states and one Canadian province. Its current portfolio includes 64 plants totaling over 8 GW of installed capacity powered by renewable wind, geothermal and solar energy. It also includes 12 utility-scale battery energy storage systems totaling 1,290 MWh of capacity under construction or in operation. Moving forward, the company has a target of 6.5 GW of new renewable capacity through 2024, according to Conor Branch, head of business development at Enel.
“Precise and accurate resource assessment has been foundational to Enel Green Power’s solar siting as we have developed and installed several gigawatts of new capacity over the last several years,” said Branch.
The company plans to use the SRA systems to help design efficient projects by identifying prime sites in a variety of geographies across North America.
The turnkey systems capture meteorological data, including soiling and albedo measurements, to estimate annual energy production. The systems integrate with NRG Cloud, a web interface that facilitates remote management of data, troubleshooting, and data logger configuration.
NRG Systems announced that it will work with Harness Energy to install, maintain, and decommission the SRA systems, while ArcVera Renewables will provide data monitoring.
“There are a lot of unknowns in project development, especially given today’s supply chain challenges. By providing the hardware, software, and supporting services needed to carry out a resource assessment campaign as a holistic package, we can help ensure as much project stability for our customers as possible,” said Thomas Lattanzio, NRG’s sales manager, North America.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/13/rfp-alert-tennessee-valley-authority-seeks-5-gw-of-carbon-free-energy/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,TENNESSEE",ANNE FISCHER,"JULY 13, 2022",RFP alert: Tennessee Valley Authority seeks 5 GW of carbon-free energy,"In what the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) says is one of the largest clean energy procurement efforts in the nation, the utility has issued a request for proposals (RFP) for up to 5 GW of carbon-free energy.
“We are taking this bold, decisive action because TVA is uniquely positioned to lead in reducing carbon emissions for the region and the nation,” said Jeff Lyash, TVA president and chief executive officer. “This announcement is a clear signal to our industry, our partners, and our nation that we need to move further and faster, together, to make a cleaner future a reality.”
The RFP is seeking to procure up to 5 GW of carbon-free energy resources with commercial operation dates from 2023 through 2029. Those resources can include solar, wind (offshore or land based), hydro, geothermal, biomass, nuclear, and green gas. The utility is also seeking proposals for battery energy storage systems (BESS) paired with clean energy resources, standalone BESS, and hybrid combinations. All projects will be contracted under a power purchase agreement, and all the applicable associated environmental attributes (renewable energy credits/certificates, etc.) will be transferred to TVA. Resources must be located in the TVA service territory or delivered to TVA’s interface with neighboring transmission systems.
TVA’s plan is to reduce carbon from 2005 levels by 70% by 2030, 80% by 2035, and to be net-zero by 2050. This recent request follows an RFP in 2020 that resulted in the addition of 964 MW of solar with 130 MW of battery storage. The utility plans to bring on an additional 10 GW of solar capacity by 2035.
While TVA has not been the most solar-friendly entity historically, it has found success with its Green Invest program, which is a platform for businesses that have set specific renewable generation and carbon reduction goals to be matched with local renewable energy projects. Through a lowest-cost competitive bidding program, TVA negotiates project terms on behalf of the customer. TVA reports that since 2018, the Green Invest program has generated over $3 billion in investment across its seven-state region.
Lyash said last year about 270 companies selected the Tennessee Valley to do business because of TVA’s low-cost, reliable and clean energy. In April, Envision AESC, an electric vehicle battery company, announced a 2,000 job, $2 billion investment to build a new battery factory in Bowling Green, KY, reportedly because of TVA’s renewable energy programs.
RFP proposals must be submitted by October 19, 2022. Review the RFP and submit bids at tva.com/Information/Doing-Business-with-TVA. Project selection will be announced in Spring 2023.

However, the results from a recent poll suggest that while they are not yet ready to pay to fix the root cause of climate change, Americans are willing to pay for some degree of mitigation.
The poll – by NPR / Robert Wood Johnson Foundation / Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health – suggests that, overall, 70% of the US public “sees climate change as a crisis or a major problem”. That percentage jumps up to 77% when polls focus on those who’ve been affected by extreme weather events in the past five years. Unfortunately, that number falls to 46% among those who stated that they have not been directly affected.
At the moment, getting the public to pay for measures to prevent climate change is a bit more complex. The multi-part question #26 from the poll:

When respondents were asked if they support a carbon tax, 52% of respondents suggested they likely would. However, that support drops to 39% if that tax substantially increases prices that they would have to pay.
The researchers note that many respondents communicated experiences of financial challenges related to current high energy pricing, and that presumably, these hardships affected their answers. In fact, pricing pressure is apparently so great that 62% of respondents support increased oil drilling to lower gasoline pricing, even if that were to interfere with climate goals.
Broader socioeconomic factors are also affecting those who are experiencing weather events, and more importantly, how these parties can financially respond to these events – and thus how willing they are to pay even more.
For instance, only 29% of households that experienced extreme events had 100% of their damages covered by insurance. Renters though had it worse – with those who have experienced extreme events being uninsured 70% of the time.

The report noted that 22% of homeowners who experienced extreme weather damage applied for federal and state aid, with about half of them receiving some form of support, leaving 88% with no government backup.
The authors suggest that regulations which seem “further from their wallets” of respondents had higher general support. For instance, 65% believe the government should do more to limit climate change via tools such as limiting power plant emissions (78% support) or increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards (67%).
When asked about fuel efficiency standards and grid resistance, we again see a split between those who have dealt with extreme weather events and those who haven’t. For instance, those who have experienced severe weather events support federal fuel efficiency standards by 18% greater than those who haven’t, 17% more want regulations to push grid resilience, and 24% more support state spending to prepare for future weather disasters.

An important nuance is that the poll self-reported those who have ‘experienced’ or ‘not experienced’ an extreme weather event. It is clearly possible that the pre-existing political and climate related views of these peoples bled into their perceptions of whether they had experienced an extreme weather event at all. Those who are more sensitive to climate change might believe that more things are extreme, whereas those who push back against the science, might deem extreme weather as simply ‘weather’.
As well, those who are in a more challenging socioeconomic position might define an event as extreme more so, since it had a greater effect on their existence, and their literal physical experience of the event might be more direct and life changing.

Australia has signed a series of new clean energy partnership agreements, including the ‘Net Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership’ with the US, the ‘Minerals Security Partnership’ which includes political allies from across the world, as well as an agreement between the chief science agencies of Australia and the US, the CSIRO and NREL respectively.
Speaking at the Sydney Energy Forum on Tuesday, US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm focused on the importance of secure supply chains to the clean energy transition, especially in light of the current global energy crisis spurred by Europe’s over-reliance on Russia and the invasion of Ukraine.
“We’ve seen what happens when we rely too much on one entity for our source of fuel, and we don’t want that to happen – so to diversify those energy sources and to link up with partners is part of our energy security,” Granholm said.
With few hard details in the agreements, it seems as though the moves at this stage are more of a formal recognition of a joint goal, especially in response to recent geopolitical events. The US and Australia did, however, point to of a number of technological focal points.
‘Greatest peace plan’
Granholm described the transition to renewables as “the greatest peace plan of all” since countries cannot be “held hostage” over access to the sun or wind. “They have not ever been weaponised, nor will they be,” she said.
Australia currently imports around 80% of its solar panels from China – which also controls the vast amount of materials processing for other renewable technologies. While this has led to incredible depressions in the price of these technologies globally, the International Energy Agency’s executive director Fatih Birol noted the country’s near monopoly was “something that we all need to think about.”
Net zero technology acceleration partnership
Signed by Granholm and Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, the Australia – United States Net-Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership seeks to accelerate the development and deployment of zero emissions technology, as well as growing cooperation between the two countries in terms of critical minerals supply chains.
“With today’s partnership, our two countries will work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials – providing an essential opportunity to export the innovations that will accelerate the global clean energy transition,” Granholm said.
Officials from the US and Australia agreed to meet within three months to make further progress relating to the agreement, presumably to set out more concrete goals. 
Minerals security partnership
This global partnership is specifically aimed at ensuring the security of critical minerals supply chains. Australia has now joined the partnership which includes the US, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the European Commission.
CSIRO & NREL
At the forum, Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific, Research, and Industry Organisation (CSIRO) and the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
“Under the agreement, CSIRO and NREL will initially focus on four areas of strategic importance to Australia: hydrogen, global power system transformation, plastics, and an accelerator/incubator program for small and medium sized enterprises that has the potential to transform our global energy future,” NREL’s Chief Research Officer, Dr Peter Green, said at the signing yesterday.
The agreement was also signed by CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Larry Marshall. “Importantly, through CSIRO’s shared national labs, it paves the way for new opportunities for Australian science institutions to partner with US national labs and industry to lead on cutting-edge research that will lower the cost of net zero energy technologies at a global scale,” Dr Marshall said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/07/13/role-of-uv-in-solar-cell-degradation/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 13, 2022",Role of UV in solar cell degradation,"From pv magazine global
Improvements to solar cell technology and manufacturing processes mean that modules can be sold today with performance guarantees for up to 30 years. They usually promise to retain 80% to 90% of their initial performance by the end of this period.
However, there are still mechanisms and interactions at work between tiny particles within a PV module. And understanding them will be key to developing cells that can generate more electricity for an even longer period. Scientists led by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) looked at the role of UV light in some of these mechanisms, and found that in many of the latest cell designs, UV could be to blame for significant performance losses.
“Historically, the harmful effects of UV radiation have largely been associated with the aging of module packaging materials and have led to encapsulant discoloration, delamination, and backsheet cracking,” the group said. “Solar cell performance is also adversely affected by UV radiation through the generation of surface defects.”
Within a silicon solar cell, the UV light can cause damage to the passivation layers, to the silicon beneath, and at the interface between the two. The researchers tested a range of silicon cell designs under long-term exposure to UV light, to better understand damage that they could suffer in the field.
“Understanding the damaging effects of UV radiation in emerging silicon solar cell technologies will enable the identification of the underlying mechanisms that may affect both the power output and durability of modules,” they said.
They described their findings in “UV-induced degradation of high-efficiency silicon PV modules with different cell architectures,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. Testing p-type PERC, n-type PERT, heterojunction and interdigitated back-contact cells, the group calculated average and maximum degradation rates of 0.12% per year and 0.73% per year, respectively, based on a module containing a UV-transmitting encapsulant. They also found that with bifacial cells, the rear side was more susceptible to UV induced damage.
The group noted several different mechanisms triggered by the UV that can cause damage to cells. The problem is largely related to the breakdown of hydrogen bonds that reduced the quality of the passivation layer.
They suggested a range of strategies to reduce such damage. Additives to the module encapsulant material could block UV wavelengths from reaching the cell, and low- cost materials are available to do this. However, the group warns that this could involve some discoloration of the encapsulant, resulting in initial performance losses.
Glass coatings are another way to block UV light from reaching the cell, but they require the design of a multifunctional coating material with anti-reflective and anti-soiling properties. Coatings on the front of the cell itself could also reduce UV damage.
With an average 11% power loss after 2,000 hours of UV exposure, heterojunction cells appeared to be the most vulnerable to UV damage. But the group said that more work would be needed to draw this conclusion.
“The most durable among high-efficiency cell technologies (HJ, IBC, PERC, or PERT) remains to be proven for a wide variety of makes and models of cells,” they said.
