https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/05/off-grid-solar-canopy-charges-electric-tractor-at-california-winery/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",Off-grid solar canopy charges electric tractor at California winery,"Paired Power, a provider of solar-powered EV charging products, and Monarch Tractor, a fully electric tractor manufacturer announced the two have partnered to deliver an emissions-free tractor solution for Kaerskov Vineyard in Santa Ynez Valley, California. 
Since July, the vineyard has been operating Monarch’s MK-V electric tractor, charged fully with Paired Power’s solar canopy and EV charger. The solar charging solution can be installed as a rooftop or raised as a canopy. 
The winery’s solar canopy is a 38.5 kW array comprised of 72 panels, 535 W each. The panels are made by JA Solar. 
The U.S.-made DC fast chargers charge directly from solar during daylight hours. The chargers can provide up to 100 A service. A full charge from 0% to 100% for the Monarch tractor typically takes five to six hours at 80 A. Paired Power said the racking and mounts for the canopy are U.S.-made, as well. 
The tractor was delivered with two swappable batteries. One can be used for operation while the other stores the solar generation from the day. 
Farmers may move increasingly toward electrification of vehicles as cost advantages shift from fossil fuels to the renewables sector. A Monarch tractor can also offset 54 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year when compared to a conventional tractor, the company reports. 
Monarch said the tractor comes with advanced collision prevention, human detection, and power take-off protection while reducing over 60% of the farm’s expense on tractor fueling and service. 
“Our mission at Monarch is to elevate overall operations, improve farmer profitability, and pave the way for sustainable farming,” said Praveen Penmetsa, co-founder and chief executive officer of Monarch Tractor. “Pairing the all-electric MK-V with renewable charging infrastructure like Paired Power’s solar solutions brings us closer to a farming future that is powered by clean energy solutions. We are pleased to partner with Paired Power and Carr Winery in taking this step toward more environmentally friendly farming practices.” 
Agriculture is responsible for about 20% of global emissions, according to McKinsey and Company. However, many farms are located in remote locations at the end of distribution lines, which can lead to an unstable power supply for charging electric machinery. As such, on-site and off-grid solutions like Paired Power’s may represent a pathway for farmers seeking to improve the emissions profile of their operations. 
“Our high-powered solar charger was designed with fleet applications in mind, as we know that providing a convenient means to charge electric tractors will be essential in the adoption of electrified farming. Our charging solutions are scalable to ensure that we can continue to provide easy renewable charging as electric fleets expand,” said Tom McCalmont, co-founder and chief executive officer of Paired Power.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/05/lg-energy-solution-to-sell-residential-energy-storage-with-inverter-in-u-s/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",LG Energy Solution to sell residential energy storage with inverter in U.S.,"LG Energy Solution (LGES), a manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries, announced the upcoming launch of Prime+ in the U.S. market.
Prime+ is an energy storage system (ESS) that integrates an inverter and a battery. It connects two 10H or 16H Prime battery modules in parallel to offer a capacity of 19.2 kWh or 32 kWh, with a maximum output of 9.6 kW from the inverter.
LGES reports that the system is compatible with existing PV systems, making it applicable to retrofit installations. Also, the inverter will also be compatible with the LG Energy Solution enblock S, a new product set for release later this year, according to LGES.
After pilot testing, LGES said the new system passed all necessary quality assessments. In testing, the company collaborated with multiple installers, who attested to speed and simplicity of installation and setup.
“The Prime+ AC-coupled inverter from LG Energy Solution was quick and easy to install, freeing our team to complete more work in less time,” said Jeff Dimond, COO of ES Solar, a customer of LG Energy Solution.
A recently launched Global ESS Customer Portal (GECP) app offers streamlined access for customers, which LGES reports can be used by installers to initiate and track after-sales service requests in real time. Should the system fail and need to be returned, the portal enables return merchandise authorization both online and offline. The ESS comes with a 10-year warranty that covers the batteries, the inverter and the auto-backup device. It is available in two configurations: a backup solution and the arbitrage (self-consumption) solution.
LGES was formed in 2020 after being spun off from LG Chem, and it debuted on the Korea Exchange (KRX) in January 2022. In 2017 LG Chem was the first international player to enter the U.S. residential battery market, and now, as LG Energy Systems, focuses the burgeoning U.S. battery market for electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
Prime+ will be available later in September through major distributors across the U.S. LGES will showcase Prime+ in booth 13086 at the RE+ exhibition, which runs Sept. 11 to 14 in Las Vegas.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/05/nextracker-unveils-three-next-gen-solar-racking-products/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TRACKERS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",Nextracker unveils three next-gen solar racking products,"Nextracker, a provider of tracking and mounting solutions for utility-scale solar projects, announced three next-generation editions of its products. These include a hail-ready stowing mechanism, a terrain-following tracker and a new irradiance tracking system.
“Our product development priorities are informed by listening to customers and innovating to create value for them,” said Nextracker founder and chief executive officer, Dan Shugar.
The company will exhibit the products in booth 2511 at RE+ Las Vegas, September 11-14, 2023.
“The suite of hardware and software technologies launched today benefits customers by accelerating construction, reducing risk in extreme hail, and generating more energy in rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. These technologies deliver improved solar project profitability, and expand the geographic areas where solar is cost effective, furthering our vision of a world powered by renewables.” 
According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Nextracker has been the solar tracker global market share leader for eight consecutive years. It has shipped more than 75 GW of trackers as of the end of 2022.
NX Horizon Hail Pro
The hail pro is built upon Nextracker’s NX Horizon, a tracking system with balanced design, integrated UPS, and independent row architecture. The company said its racks can stow panels up to four times faster than standard trackers, allowing them to rapidly respond to the threat of hail.
The Hail Pro components add automatic stowing using weather service data and hail readiness services. A Hail Pro-75 feature can be added for stowing at up to 75 degrees for regions with extreme hail risk. The solution was made in collaboration with customers, independent engineers, and experts from the insurance industry.
“Getting insurance in hail prone geographies like Texas is an increasingly challenging issue solar project developers and owners face today,” said Michael Alvarez, chief operating officer and co-founder of Longroad Energy. “Advanced technology, like Nextracker’s new Hail Pro suite is directionally where our industry needs to be going.”
Zonal Diffuse
Zonal Diffuse builds on the company’s TrueCapture yield optimization software. The tracking software rapidly responds to changes in irradiance. The software adds higher spatial resolution sensing and new control algorithms, responding to variations in cloud cover across the solar plant.
“Plants equipped with Zonal Diffuse can ‘chase clouds’ for additional gains, without compromising tracking performance during clear sky conditions,” said Nextracker.
Zonal Diffuse is compatible with Split Boost, a tracking optimization algorithm for half-cell modules. A third-party validation report can be found here.
NX Horizon XTR-1.5
The XTR series of trackers is designed for uneven terrain, used in utility-scale projects since 2019. The updated XTR-1.5 edition reduces or eliminates earthwork on extreme terrain sites, without adding joints or additional components.
Nextracker said the XTR can save many tons of steel with shorter piles and thousands of cubic yards of cut and fill. This will come with the benefit of shortened construction schedules, minimized environmental impact, and reduced project risk, said Nextracker.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/05/bringing-ercots-speedy-interconnection-process-to-the-rest-of-the-u-s/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TEXAS",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",Bringing ERCOT’s speedy interconnection process to the rest of the U.S.,"The Texas grid operator ERCOT interconnected 6 GW of renewables in 2021—about three times as much as the nation’s largest grid operator PJM—and outperformed PJM by a wider margin in 2022, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
ERCOT’s process “is so much faster than some of the other processes,” Brattle Group Principal Johannes Pfeifenberger has said, because ERCOT “pretty much” follows a process known as “connect and manage,” as opposed to the “invest and connect” approach followed by other U.S. grid operators.
Executives from Clearway Energy Group and Enel North America have called for combining the connect-and-manage approach with comprehensive regional transmission planning to efficiently interconnect large-scale renewables and storage.
Now Tyler Norris, a former Cypress Creek Renewables executive, has tackled the question of just how the connect-and-manage approach could be used in the rest of the U.S., in a paper published by the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University. Norris is a Ph.D. candidate at Duke researching electric power systems.
Connect and manage is well-suited for ERCOT, with its energy-only electricity market, Norris says, and can be adapted for use elsewhere in the U.S. where electricity markets have a capacity market alongside an energy market.
To describe connect and manage, Norris first compares it to the Network Resource Interconnection Service (NRIS) process that is typically used for interconnection requests for large-scale renewables projects outside of ERCOT.
NRIS requires a proposed generator to be able to deliver to load during severe grid conditions, such that it can be designated as a capacity resource and contribute to resource adequacy requirements, Norris says. NRIS studies often identify the need for significant grid upgrades to relieve grid constraints, so this approach has been termed “invest and connect.” The grid upgrades required “can often make generators financially unviable and delay interconnection by years,” Norris says.
Some project developers opt for an alternative interconnection service known as Energy Resource Interconnection Service (ERIS), which Norris says is less likely than NRIS to require grid upgrades. Generators with ERIS service, however, are more likely to be curtailed during emergency conditions, “which introduces greater uncertainty for project revenue forecasts.”
In ERCOT, which is currently an energy-only market without capacity compensation, essentially “all generators are treated like ERIS and there is no NRIS option,” Norris says. With fewer network upgrades to slow interconnection, generators can interconnect “much more quickly,” Norris says, “in exchange for bearing more curtailment risk and not receiving capacity compensation.”
Improving ERIS
Because ERIS is the connect-and-manage approach in a nutshell, Norris examines how ERIS service could be improved across the U.S.
He notes that Commissioner Allison Clements with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) encouraged further consideration of how to streamline ERIS, and said FERC could address this topic in a rulemaking, in her concurrence to FERC Order 2023.
Curtailment risk
Norris evaluates several possible approaches to reducing curtailment risk under ERIS, including flexible operation of solar plants and alternative compensation methods for power purchase agreements.
A hybrid approach
Storage is a capacity resource, yet would not be compensated for its substantial capacity value under ERIS. With increasing amounts of hybrid capacity (renewables-plus-storage) waiting in interconnection queues, Norris considers ways to enable project developers to make use of both ERIS and NRIS approaches. Potential solutions, he says, include preserving the option for ERIS interconnection customers to pursue NRIS; allowing a hybrid developer to submit a separate NRIS application limited to the nameplate rating of the storage; or developers pursuing standalone storage over paired storage.
Linkages
Noting that a FERC order is pending to improve regional transmission planning and cost allocation, Norris says that “proactive transmission planning is equally important as improved ERIS-based standards”–echoing the call from Clearway Energy Group and Enel North America executives. In areas without a regional grid operator, Norris also makes a case for “rationalizing the relationship” among interconnection, transmission planning, and competitive procurement.
Backstory
Norris said he came to the topic of connect and manage largely through his involvement in North Carolina’s 2022 Carbon Plan proceeding, in which he testified on behalf of the Clean Power Suppliers Association and “collaborated closely” with The Brattle Group to develop an alternative resource plan. During that work, he said, “it became increasingly apparent how the existing invest-and-connect approach is limiting interconnection rates.” He describes the disadvantages of invest and connect in his paper.
Norris’s paper is titled “Beyond FERC Order 2023: Considerations on Deep Interconnection Reform.”

The new portfolio includes sites in California, Utah, Arkansas, Texas, and South Carolina.
Ute Energy Exploration & Marketing was founded by the Ute Indian Tribe to protect the Tribe’s natural resources. The Utah-based developer selected Erthos for its upcoming 3 MW solar project, which will be located on the Tribe’s land in Utah.
“Electrical infrastructure is becoming more and more essential to the Ute Tribes development initiatives. Powering modern controls which monitor and measure emissions are essential to the Tribe,” says Devin Pehrson, CEO of Ute Energy Exploration & Marketing. “The Erthos installation methodology and development plan lead us to the lowest installed cost, which translates into the lowest power rates we could find.”
Erthos also announced contracts with Cedar Lake Power to deliver three new solar plants in South Carolina totaling 10 MW. “Erthos offered solutions to all three of our primary project challenges. They offered the highest energy density for our tightly configured sites, the highest wind rating, and the fastest installation method to address our aggressive schedules.” says a representative from Cedar Lake Power.
Two other undisclosed developers plan projects totaling 9 MW, bringing the newly announced portfolio to 34 MW. Erthos now has 17 solar plants under contract nationwide. 
Late last year Erthos announced the signing of an agreement with Industrial Sun LLC for a new utility-scale solar project of more than 100 MWdc in Texas.
In March 2022, the company announced the closing of a $17.5 million Series B funding round in March to scale up production. This follows a $7.4 million Series A in 2019, which launched the company and helped it finalize the earth-mount system architecture. It also funded the development of the autonomous cleaning robot, which drives over the surface of the panels to clean them, which is necessitated by having the solar modules so close to the ground.
“With each new project, Erthos proves its ability to offer a highly attractive alternative to the status quo,” says Jim Tyler, CEO of Erthos. “We’ve said from the start that we can deliver on the lowest cost of energy. Now, with two years of plant operating history, we can prove it with real-world performance data. The word is out, and you can expect many more project announcements soon,” says Tyler.
Erthos will be exhibiting in booth 28048 at RE+ solar trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, September 12th through 14th.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/05/bluetti-to-unveil-ep800-household-energy-storage-system-at-re-2023/,"SPONSORED POST,UNITED STATES",,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",BLUETTI to unveil EP800 household energy storage system at RE+ 2023,"BLUETTI, a pioneering provider of energy storage products, will debut its EP800 home energy storage system (ESS) at the upcoming RE+ 2023 (Solar Power International) event, ahead of the product’s official release date. From September 11-14, BLUETTI will showcase its innovative power solutions at Booth #20074, Hall G, at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center, in Las Vegas.
The new EP800 off-grid battery system, which will officially be released on September 15, provides 7,600 W of power for both 120 V and 240 V home appliances. Its modular design allows users to choose from two to four B500 battery packs for a flexible capacity ranging from 9,920 Wh to 19,840 Wh. Households could have customizable backup power and optimized energy consumption with its peak load-shifting function. Featuring a 9,000 W solar input, the EP800 helps to store solar energy for use at any time.
Unlike many other complex battery systems, the EP800 is easy to install and use. It can be up and running under a home’s roof or in the garage within a matter of hours. Its reliable LiFePO4 battery and NEMA4X rating allow it to withstand the tests of both time and weather. BLUETTI also gives it a worry-free 10-year warranty.
BLUETTI’s new arrival is a further demonstration of the company’s R&D capabilities. The EP800’s predecessor, the EP900, an on/off-grid 9,000W system, enjoys the same flexible capacity. What distinguishes the two is that the EP900 supports grid connection, with which users can sell excess solar power back to the grid for additional credits. The new EP800 is a purely off-grid system.
At BLUETTI’s RE+ booth, visitors will be able to check out the new energy storage system in person to learn more about it. In a related announcement, the company says that starting with the launch, 30 households with monthly bills over $100 will have the opportunity to join BLUETTI’s new Energy Freedom Program and try the EP800 system free for a month. After the trial, they can either return the product at no cost or keep it with discounts.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/09/05/iowa-judge-rules-solar-supports-townspeoples-health-and-safety/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,IOWA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",Iowa judge rules solar supports townspeople’s “health and safety”,"An Iowa judge has ruled that zoning adjustments favoring solar power align with the town’s stated objectives, specifically the “protection and enhancement of the health and safety of all Linn County residents through the use of renewable energy.” The case revolved around objections to the 1,934-acre Duane Arnold Solar Project, under development by NextEra Energy.
The plaintiffs appeared to use a “scattergun” approach in their legal challenge. Among the litany of complaints were zoning ordinance violations, illegal “spot zoning”, and allegations that the project contravened both Linn County’s comprehensive plan and state law by allowing the conversion of prime farmland. One particularly incoherent complaint sought a hazard assessment for the solar farm due to its proximity to a nuclear material storage facility.
The judge dismissed all eight of their complaints.

Source: Linn County
The Gazette’s Erin Jordan reported on the local resistance to the project. The case, Joseph Kerner et al. vs. Linn County, Iowa Board of Supervisors, was filed on October 21, 2022, and reached its conclusion on July 20, 2023. Project documents are available on the Town of Linn’s official website.
The variety and nature of the plaintiff’s grievances have raised questions about the sincerity of their legal stance, especially since their strategy echoes the “throw everything at the wall and see what sticks” technique employed by Citizens for Responsible Solar in opposing other solar initiatives nationwide.
The judge ordered the seven plaintiffs to cover court costs. 

Currently, the town has halted all new solar projects through a moratorium in effect until the end of 2023. Local authorities are in the process of refining solar zoning regulations and creating a Utility-Scale Solar ‘Scorecard’. The draft scorecard takes into account factors like native species, blooming seasons, agrivoltaic practices, and site grading among other considerations.
