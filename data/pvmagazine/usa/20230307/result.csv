The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a roadmap to achieve this goal, with a target of 50 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity by 2030.
The U.S. has been plagued by numerous pressures threatening the supply of solar modules imported from overseas. With decarbonization and climate goals under threat due to this shortage, the U.S. is now turning to boosting domestic manufacturing to power the energy transition.
The Department of Energy (DOE) said, “Greatly expanding U.S. PV manufacturing could mitigate global supply chain challenges and lead to tremendous benefits for the climate as well as for U.S. workers, employers and the economy.”
The DOE concluded in a study that U.S. production could reach 10 GW in two years, 15 GW in three years and 25 GW in five years on its path to 50 GW annual production.
SEIA said domestic manufacturers should focus on building downstream production first, backfilling components with imports while upstream domestic production is built out. While scaling domestic module capacity will take 2-3 years, it will be 3-5 years before there is significant domestic manufacturing capacity for ingots, wafers and cells.
The DOE tracks the capacity of domestic manufacturing nationwide. Where does the U.S. stack up in relation to its goals? The figures below represent active capacity, which is set to expand dramatically following numerous investment announcements following the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
The traditional solar module supply chain begins with silicon or polysilicon sourcing. DOE tracks eight polysilicon or silicon metal facilities active in the U.S. with a combined capacity of producing 244.4 kilotons of refined material each year. The largest silicon metal facility is a 73 kiloton fabrication in run by WVA Manufacturing in West Virginia. The largest active polysilicon site is the 32 kiloton-per-year Hemlock Semiconductor, operated by Siemens AG.
Next along the value chain comes refined polysilicon ingots. The DOE tracks no active polysilicon ingot manufacturing capacity in the U.S. thus far.
After ingots are formed, they are further refined into polysilicon wafers. DOE reports only one wafer facility inside the U.S., a 20 MW per year facility run by CubicPV in Massachusetts.
Wafers are then converted to cells. DOE does not report any cell manufacturing capacity in the U.S. This is set to change as Hanwha Qcells announced a $2.5 billion investment in a vertical module value chain. The company plans to manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and finished modules in Cartersville and Dalton, Georgia, creating 2,500 clean energy jobs.
(Read: “Next-generation factories promise a brighter future for solar manufacturing“)
Cells are then integrated as solar modules, often known by the public as solar panels. The two main types of solar modules manufactured in the U.S. are polysilicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe).
In total, DOE reports 16 polysilicon module manufacturers with a combined total of 5.6 GW of manufacturing capacity. The largest operational facility is the 1.7 GW Qcells module manufacturing site in Georgia.
Many manufacturers have announced investment into module manufacturing, including, but not limited to a $2.5 billion 3.3 GW vertical value chain committed by Qcells; a 3 GW facility by Enel North America and 3Sun USA; a 1 GW expansion by Mission Solar; and a 1.2 GW planned facility by Philadelphia Solar.
CdTe capacity combines across two manufacturers, First Solar and Toledo Solar, for a total of 2.9 GW per year. First Solar has announced plans to expand its manufacturing capacity to over 10 GW by 2025, investing $1.2 billion to achieve this growth.
Next time, pv magazine will track the manufacturing capacities of essential components like racking, trackers, inverters, and energy storage systems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/07/renewables-merger-and-acquisition-strategies-are-shifting/,"ACQUISITIONS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 7, 2023",Renewables merger and acquisition strategies are shifting,"CohnReznick Capital Markets shared that the 2023 U.S. renewable energy market is expected to be defined by the the juxtaposition of tremendous momentum from recent changes in U.S. policy and uncertainty stemming from upheavals in global markets.
As the International Energy Agency expects 2,400 GW of renewables to come online through 2027, the world will add as much renewable energy capacity in the next five years as it did over the last two decades. With this market evolution comes the opportunity for significant merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, and the profile of this activity is expected to shift.
Throughout 2020 and 2021, M&A activity for renewables surged as valuations for platforms, which included project portfolios and corporate development teams that manage them, reached all-time highs. Now with increasing capital deployment rates, there is a shift from majority platform M&A activity to transactions in which investors could take a minority stake.
“Investors are providing growth capital in the form of a minority stake, often receiving preferred equity in a company that has the potential to grow and expand in the post-IRA world, in which company value could increase substantially over the next few years,” said CohnReznick in a whitepaper.
There is a growing trend of international players acquiring experienced U.S. developers with strong project portfolios, and CohnReznick said it expects this trend to continue in 2023. International independent power producers and infrastructure funds see acquisition as an efficient tool to enter or expand their presence in the growing North American market. Corporate M&A activity that includes developer experience and a portfolio of projects offers scale and transaction efficiency that the acquisition of individual projects aren’t able to match.
Now that the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit have been extended for projects that begin construction before 2034, independent power producers and infrastructure funds are looking to access a much larger project pipeline through acquisition, according to CohnReznick.
As the ITC now includes energy storage, this category is expected to drive more M&A activity as well. Mercom Capital reported there were 23 energy storage M&A transactions through the first three quarters of 2022 compared to 15 in 2021, a trend that is expected to continue as the energy storage market matures.
FTI Consulting said in a whitepaper that notable 2022 M&A transactions included Brookfield Renewable’s pair of acquisitions of Scout Clean Energy ($1 billion) and Standard Solar ($540 million), Enbridge’s acquisition of Texas wind developer Tri Global Energy for $270 million, and German energy producer RWE AG’s acquisition of Con Edison’s Clean Energy Businesses for $6.8 billion.
FTI Consulting said renewable investors not only continued to move up the value chain in search of financial returns but also diversified into emerging subsectors, such as renewable natural gas (RNG), alternative fuels and standalone storage. Notably, RNG transaction volume more than doubled in 2022, spearheaded by transactions like BP acquiring Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion.
FTI Consulting said that 2023 deal flow is expected to remain strong, but creative solutions and investor flexibility will be needed as the market navigates persistent supply chain challenges, long interconnection queues, and high inflation rates, all of which will apply downward pressure on asset sales.
To meet these challenges, investors are expected to seek right-priced deals and move towards emerging technologies and subsectors to receive a digestible risk-adjusted rate of return. FTI Consulting said corporates may look towards divestiture of non-core assets as a means to free up cash flow for more strategic investments or other operational drivers.
The report said it may take four to six months for guidance to be issued on specific aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, and developers and asset owners will require time to assess the relative value of their investments and to implement financing plants to make the most of the IRA’s incentives.
“With patience, we anticipate strong M&A activity in traditional renewable assets, platforms and emerging technologies trending toward the second half of 2023 and into 2024 as greater clarity and increased value creation are established,” said the whitepaper.

The company is an international service provider in the field of supply chain management and e-commerce, and a a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann, a media, services and education company headquartered in Germany with operations in about 50 countries around the world
Bertelsmann aims to be carbon neutral by 2030, and to do so, it is working on powering all its locations with clean energy.
“It’s important to us that our success is measured not only by economic figures, but also by the measures we’ve implemented to build a more sustainable organization,” said Mitat Aydindag, president of Arvato North America.
With the company’s warehouses and distribution centers located in different locations across the U.S. including Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, Louisville, Kentucky, and Valencia, California, it has found that making the switch to clean energy is sometimes difficult, depending on the region. The solution was to apply different approaches for different regions.
In Louisville, Kentucky, Arvato is working with two local electric utilities, LG&E and East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC), which both offer a green power program that buys “green” energy to offset the electricity consumed on-site. LG&E has a goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and is planning to add nearly 1 GW of solar and 125 MW of battery storage. EKPC’s sustainability plan establishes targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions 35% by 2035, 70% by 2050 and to increase energy from renewable sources 15% by 2035.
“Because our distribution centers in Louisville are among the first in the U.S., we are especially proud that these sites are now purchasing green electricity to support the expansion of renewable energy in the region,” says Rachael Miller, site director for Arvato’s Louisville campus.
The Valencia, California site relies on the Clean Power Alliance. Founded in 2017, Clean Power Alliance is a not-for-profit community choice aggregator that is reportedly the fourth largest electricity provider in California including providing power for 30 cities across Los Angeles County and Ventura County, as well as the unincorporated areas of both counties. In the community choice aggregator model, a local utility provides transmission and distribution of the electricity, while a third party purchases the green power on behalf of its program participants. In 2020, Clean Power Alliance sourced 70% of its electricity from solar and the rest from wind power.
“It’s very encouraging when businesses make the leadership decision to select 100% renewable energy as their preferred power option,” said Matthew Langer, chief operating officer at Clean Power Alliance. “When companies like Arvato choose to use renewable energy in their operations, it can help spur demand for more renewables in the market and contribute to the renewable energy transition.”
Overall, switching its five locations to clean energy will reduce Arvato’s reported annual greenhouse gas emissions by an average of around 3,100 metric tons of CO2.

The Croton-Harmon Union Free School District, an elementary through high school system with 1,600 students in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., reports that it recovered $1.5 million over an 18-month term for an energy savings project that integrates a 350 kW rooftop solar array, LED lighting and temperature control upgrades, as well as HVAC system upgrades to improve the efficiency of its school buildings.
Deployed by energy efficiency company Energia in March 2021, the energy efficiency project provided $188,000 in guaranteed energy savings over its first year in service and eliminated 1,200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year going forward.
The Croton-Harmon district installed efficiency solutions that include LED lighting, a Direct Digital Control (DCC) thermostat system, building enveloping insulation, boiler burner control upgrades, and steam trap replacements.
Energia installed rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panels across three school buildings yielding over 350 kW of on-site power generation to reduce the district’s utility energy costs, generate revenue and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.
“The entire Croton-Harmon School District community will benefit from our modernized facilities and the enhanced learning environment we have created with guidance from the Energia team,” said Stephen Walker, superintendent of the school district. “Energia worked with us every step of the way, from initial project assessment through contractor selection to final walkthrough and evaluation of our facilities.”
Smithtown, N.Y.-based Energia, an energy-savings financial engineering firm with operations in 15 states, deployed the efficiency upgrade solutions with energy services partner Honeywell Building Solutions, a commercial division of consumer products and technology company Honeywell.
The engineer funded the construction of the project upgrades using an energy performance contract or EPC, which enables the school district to pay for the facility upgrades with energy savings produced over time, rather than a lump sum upfront.
According to its website, Energia is a Small Business Association and Women’s Business Enterprise-certified women-operated business. The company has provided engineering, measurement and verification, fuel cell microgrids, solar projects and street light solutions for educational facilities and municipalities around the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Arizona and Texas.
In 2019, Energia deployed a 2.36 MW landfill solar project for the City of Waterbury, Conn., as well as upgrades for the city’s Public Schools District, which involved $26 million of solar, backup power generation, LED lighting and HVAC system upgrades.  Energia holds a 20-year lease term for the landfill project, the Mark Lane Landfill, which provides $33,000 per year in lease revenue and generate 3.26 million kWh of energy per year for the city. BQ Energy LLC holds the lease to the Waterbury landfill property and is a developer of brownfield projects.

The EIA defines small-scale solar as projects smaller than 1 MW.
The 6.4 GW of installations nationwide exceeded installations of 5.4 GW in 2021 and 4.4 GW in 2020.
Maine added the most small-scale PV relative to its population, adding 132 watts of capacity per person. Next was California at 52 watts per person, followed by Nevada, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Florida, all adding at least 30 watts per person.
Southeast
Thirteen Southeastern states added just over 1 GW of small-scale solar last year, for a 57% gain over the previous year.
Florida led the way, with installations nearly doubling over those in 2021. As in past years, EIA was unable to obtain meaningful data for Alabama and Georgia.
 
Northeast
Nine Northeastern states added 1.3 GW of small-scale solar last year, for a 25% gain over the previous year.
Six Northeastern states reached an installed base of small-scale PV exceeding 200 watts per person, a milestone otherwise reached by only four states in the sunniest part of the country.

Midwest and Northern Tier
Thirteen states in this region added 675 MW of small-scale solar, representing a 6% decline from 2021.
Oregon led the way by adding 18 watts of small-scale PV per person, overtaking last year’s leaders, Illinois and Idaho.

Ten Sunniest States
The ten sunniest states added 3.3 GW of small-scale PV last year, representing a 14% gain over the previous year, and accounting for more than half of the additions nationwide.
Hawaii retains the lead in cumulative small-scale PV per person, at 541 watts per person, followed by California at 364 watts per person.

Raptor Maps has published its latest annual report on global PV system underperformance. The solar lifecycle management software specialist performed aerial inspections across 24.5 GW of large-scale solar systems.
The inspection statistics show that solar assets are becoming more anomalous each year. Underperformance due to anomalies nearly doubled from 1.61% in 2019 to 3.13% in 2022, said the company. Power losses have increased by 94% since 2019, it added, noting that anomaly-driven power losses could grow to almost 6% by 2025 at the current rate.

Raptor Maps estimates annual losses of $82 million for the 24.5 GW of assets it inspected in 2022, at an average of an $3,350 annual loss per megawatt.
“Extrapolating across total global PV capacity (as of the end of 2021, excluding residential) translates to a $ 2.5 billion annual revenue loss for the industry,” the company said.
The report includes data on underperformance by site size and module-level anomalies for the first time. The figures show that smaller sites had the highest average power losses as a percentage of their generation capacity. However, the largest sites exhibited higher average power losses. Sites between 100 MW and 200 MW in size had average power losses of 4.04% – 29% higher than the global average.
“Sites larger than 200 MW are losing, on average, around $4,320 per MW, with some sites losing up to $12,900 per MW,” claimed Raptor Maps.
The report shows that system-level anomalies are the largest drivers of power losses, with string, inverter, and combiner anomalies affecting the most power as a percentage of total power inspected, at 1.06%, 0.70%, and 0.67%, respectively. String anomalies were reportedly responsible for 34% of lost revenue, while inverter and combiner anomalies were respectively responsible for 22% and 21%.
At the module level, Jinko Solar, First Solar, Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, and Longi were the top five manufacturers of inspected assets. Cell and diode anomalies were the most common module-level and sub-module-level anomalies among these manufacturers, according to Raptor Maps. Combined, the two categories accounted for roughly 70% of observed defects. Physical damage accounted for 18% of defects.
Monocrystalline modules were found to be considerably less defective than polycrystalline and thin film technologies, by 65% and 41%, respectively. The inspected thin-film modules were purportedly more susceptive to physical damage such as cracking, delamination, and warping. They showed three times more physical damage than polycrystalline and 12 times more than monocrystalline. Hot spots were also found much more frequently in thin-film modules than in the other two technologies.
“The report underscores the need for asset owners and managers to monitor equipment performance over time, proactively identifying maintenance issues and warranty claim opportunities,” said Raptor Maps.

Meanwhile the Inflation Reduction Act and various other new clean energy funding platforms “has thrown jet fuel on the fire for the financing of renewable energy projects,” a project developer recently attending Intersolar North America 2023 in Long Beach, Calif., told pv magazine USA.
Banyan Infrastructure, a San Francisco, Calif.-based clean energy financing platform, is raising a $25 million Series B equity round from Energize Ventures, SE Ventures (Schneider Electric) and Elemental Excelerator, to digitize the manual process of procuring project finance between banks, investors and project developers.
With the new investment, Banyan plans to more than double its headcount and further expand its proprietary finance software. Founded in 2018, the company achieved 700% year over year growth over the last year, securing partnerships and customers including Standard Solar and SMBC. The company’s software enables billions of financial transactions to go on across seven countries and thousands of projects, according to the company’s website.
Using a unified risk and data management system, Banyan’s platform enables the rapid scale up of sustainable infrastructure portfolios and allows customers to achieve net-zero targets rather than get slogged in months of paperwork.
The Series B investors were joined by return investors VoLo Earth and Ulu Ventures, bringing the distributed generation finance platform’s total funding to date to just over $42 million.
“Because standardization is lacking for sustainable technology, risk averse investors are hesitant to move quickly in this relatively new industry,” said Will Greene, co-founder and chief executive officer, Banyan Infrastructure. “Our software focuses on reducing transaction costs and increasing transparency to create previously unseen speed and scale of project finance.”
Banyan’s technology replaces manual paperwork with digitized loans and workflows, as well as automated data ingestion, risk monitoring and contractual compliance for each loan, resulting in a faster financing and larger capital deployment rate.
The NY Green Bank, the $1 billion sustainable infrastructure fund of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), has used Banyan’s platform to support portfolio management activities.
“Software is key to making the very nuanced and complex project financing process quicker and more profitable, especially given the unique challenges around financing renewable energy projects,” said Amanda Li, co-founder and chief operations officer, Banyan Infrastructure. “These projects are far more smaller and more distributed, which can lead to the underwriting and risk management process being too complex, or too unprofitable with current timelines and overhead.”
Prior to forming Banyan, Amanda Li was an investment professional at Generate Capital, Obvious Ventures and consulted for McKinsey & Company, while Greene spent 13 years at Oracle, before senior technology roles at Twilio, Revel Systems and Treez.
In July 2022, Dalrada Financial affiliate Dalrada Energy Services partnered with Banyan to develop a cloud-based software-as-a-service for environmental social and governance (ESG) projects of Dalrada. The partnership enabled Dalrada’s commercial clients to have full transparency to meet their net zero goals and contractual obligations, while boosting loan transparency and expediting communications for origination, service and syndication of infrastructure loans.

With the electric vehicle market expected to drive demand for 200,000 tons of rare earth elements in North America through 2030, work is being put in by industry and policy makers to restore the region’s rare earth element supply chain.
Efforts are being made in Canada and the U.S. to shift dependency away from Chinese rare earth element reserves. There are many reasons why North America is looking to onshore its processes, one of the biggest being concern around potential supply chain choke points in the event China decides to cut off rare earth element supply due to geopolitical wrangles.
Demand for the material is expected to skyrocket, with an estimated 315,000 tons of rare earth elements needed by 2030, most of them for EVs.
What is being done by North American mines to ensure they can keep up with demand without needing to rely on Chinese rare earth element supply and Far Eastern separation facilities? What type of government policy needs to be implemented to help speed the onshoring process along?
Mountain Pass
Las Vegas-based MP Materials owns the only operating rare earth mine and processing facility in the U.S. The Mountain Pass Mine, in California, is an open pit site that supplied 15.8% of the world’s rare earth production in 2020. In late April, MP Materials began construction at its first rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturing facility with the intention of fully restoring the U.S.’ rare earth magnetics supply chain. The plans include establishing hydrometallurgy and separation facilities, along with the manufacturing fab, at a site expected to be completed in 2025. Becoming a closed-loop operation that can convert refined materials into metals and alloys would mean the company would no longer have to export its mineral concentrate material to China for processing, thereby onshoring the process and decoupling the current supply chain.
MP Materials’ substantial, $700 million investment is the first of its kind in the U.S. and would be able to produce approximately 1,000 tons per year of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, thereby supporting the production of approximately 500,000 EV motors, with room to scale. In addition to electric vehicles, NdFeB magnets are used in robots, drones, defense systems, wind turbines, and many other high-growth technologies.
Mine progress
Just before construction began at the mine, MP Materials was awarded $35 million by the U.S. government’s Department of Defense to refine and separate heavy rare earth elements to further support onshoring of both the mining and processing procedures. At around the same time, MP Materials and General Motors (GM) announced a definitive supply agreement for Mountain Pass to produce alloys and magnets for GM’s electric vehicle programs. Under the long-term contract, MP Materials will supply U.S.-sourced and manufactured rare earth materials, alloy, and finished magnets for the electric motors for more than a dozen GM models, with a gradual production ramp expected to begin late this year, starting with alloy supply.
This means that not only will Mountain Pass be expected to produce enough rare earth elements to fulfill the Pentagon’s Department of Defense requirements, it must also meet the alloy requirements needed to make electric motors for GM. How is this all possible without significant government support?
More help needed
Although tremendous efforts have been made to begin decoupling supply chains from China, to shift processing to onshore facilities, there is still a significant gap between domestic supply and demand. One solution to this which U.S. president Joe Biden and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau should consider is the creation of upstream investment incentives for suppliers of these critical minerals – particularly the metals needed for EV motors.
In late December, the Canadian government published a strategy to increase the responsibly-sourced supply of 31 critical minerals. It was backed by $3.8 billion in the 2022 budget, including $40 million to support northern regulatory processes and a 30% exploration tax credit for targeted minerals.
The issue is that these budget promises are currently no more than smoke and mirrors. Brandon Macdonald, CEO and director of Canadian miner Fireweed Metals, says he would like Ottawa to extend flow-through tax credits as there is capital scarcity during the lengthy permitting process for mining.
Flow-through shares
Flow-through shares are stock issued by mining companies at a higher price than common shares. The issuer agrees to forego, on flow-through shares, the tax deductible benefit due under Canadian law that is associated with mining exploration and development. Instead, investors buying flow-through shares can themselves claim those tax deductions, with such stock helping miners raise finance during capital-intensive exploration efforts.
Macdonald is also calling on the Canadian government to invest in infrastructure including roads, power grids, smelters, and refineries. Although Ottawa’s strategy is meant to accelerate strategic projects, build sustainable infrastructure, and make assessments more efficient, if the right companies – the ones uniquely positioned to begin fulfilling national demand within a couple of years – are not supported financially, the nation could be no closer to decoupling supply chains in 2025 than it is today.
Policy wishlist
Much work remains to be done to onshore North America’s rare earth element supply chain.
If the U.S. and Canadian governments explore different incentives for junior mining companies, the sector could see expedited infrastructure and supply chains decoupled from China becoming a reality much, much more quickly. The time to act is now, given rare earth element demand is expected to soar as North America looks to reduce its carbon footprint by rolling out EVs at mass scale.
Ultimately, the grip China has over North American supply is expected to loosen over time, particularly as new mines such as Mountain Pass come into full operation, but onshore rare earth processing could be further accelerated with the help of proper government funding and support from policy makers.
The world outside China needs more rare earth element mines and processing and separation facilities in order to reduce its dependence on the Far East for critical minerals.

Honda has unveiled a new stationary fuel cell power station at its corporate campus in Torrance, California. The demonstrator will provide backup power to the campus data center and will be powered by green hydrogen.
“The demonstration stationary fuel cell unit has a capacity of approximately 500 kW and reuses the fuel cell systems of previously leased Honda Clarity Fuel Cell vehicles, with a design that allows the output to increase every 250 kW packaged with four fuel cells,” Honda said in a statement. “It features the flexibility to change the layout of the fuel cell units to suit the installation environment and to accommodate cubic, L-shaped, Z-shaped, and other packaging configurations.”
The Japanese group said the Clarity Fuel Cell’s fuel cell stack is four times more impact-resistant than other fuel cells, as it supports the cells with a fastening bar. It is designed to prevent hydrogen leakage in collisions. The Clarity fuel cell features a fuel cell powertrain, a hydrogen/air supply system, an air compressor, a fuel cell voltage converter unit (FCVCU) and a drive motor.
“With the Clarity Fuel Cell, improved cell performance allows a 30% reduction of the number of cells, and improved cell structure allows a 20% size reduction of each cell,” said the company. “These improvements lead to a 33% smaller fuel cell stack.”
In early February, Honda revealed plans to launch an all-new fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) based on the CR-V 5-seater SUV next year. It said it will also sell its fuel cell systems on the open market to promote its hydrogen fuel cell systems, in cooperation with General Motors. This will allow it to reach economies of scale.
Honda said fuel cell stack costs should become comparable with diesel engines by 2030, at about one-third to half of current costs.
