This growth came on the back of a 46% year-over-year jump in systems solutions revenues, driven in part by strong demand for utility-scale solar.
Component revenues declined during the period, but systems solutions carry higher margins than components, the company reported.
“In our core U.S. solar business, we are seeing increasing levels of demand as the build out of new projects accelerates,” Jason Whittaker, Shoals Technologies Group’s CEO said. A combination of factors, including continued declines in the life cycle assessment of solar, the two-year investment tax credit extension. and the normalization of the permitting processes are driving this acceleration, he said.
Unlike many of its engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) customers, Shoals is not having a hard time staffing jobs. Whittaker said that this is because the company’s combined as-you-go system install is faster than conventional providers’ installs and because Shoals’ installation does not require skilled labor.
“We can be the difference between our customers being able to take on an incremental job versus letting it go to a competitor because they simply don’t have the crews available to do the work,” he said.
Shoals said it is also getting faster at winning new customers. The company recently converted a prospect to an order in less than 90 days.
According to Whittaker, Shoals has been relatively unaffected by the current tightness in the U.S. utility-scale solar market. Some shifting of projects has occurred, but based on where projects sit right now, these shifts are not meaningful enough to adjust the company’s outlook, he said.
So far, Shoals has also been largely unaffected by the current squeeze on shipping services.
“We are in a nice place and highly vertically integrated in our manufacturing, and because the product packs out so well, we can get it to where it needs to be quite readily,” Shoals Chairman Brad Forth said.
Shoals said that it has not had any difficulty procuring materials for product processes and that all of its major suppliers have continued to meet their delivery commitments this year.
For its electric vehicle solutions, Shoals is targeting EPCs that build charging stations and charge point operators. Targeting charge point operators makes sense because they are the ultimate beneficiaries of lower installation costs and because they typically specify which vendor’s equipment they will allow EPCs to use for their charging stations.
The company said it does not need to spend a lot of money to penetrate this market, which remains concentrated.  “You can get to roughly 80% of the addressable market through about a dozen companies,” said Jeff Toner, vice president of EV solutions.
EV charging deployments are growing rapidly and participants need to get more efficient to stay competitive, Toner said. To this end, Shoals is launching four product families that it believes will reduce the installed costs of charging deployments by 20-30%.
In Q4, Shoals is launching a plug-and-play power conversion and protection Skid Solutions product that it says will reduce field installation costs and site disruptions, and a Quad Charger Skid product line. According to Shoals, the latter product, which is suited to EV fleets, will minimize placement and cable costs because each skid will support four vehicles.
A second phase of Shoals’ EV charging product push is slated for Q1-2022, and will include Raceways and EV big lead assembly (BLA) products. Whereas the EV BLA product will take Shoals technology and apply it to EV charging to eliminate the need for multiple home rods from each dispenser to the distribution panel, the company’s Raceways are above-ground cables trays that it says will eliminate or minimize the need for trenching. The approach is intended will make installation faster and minimize disruption to the customer site, Toner said.
All of these new EV charging products will be able to be used individually or grouped together, he said.

GP Joule’s experience building projects in challenging climates with durable technology that provides a lower cost of energy were key drivers in the company being awarded the three PV projects. Each 35 MW installation must be built to sustain wind speeds at 140 kilometers per hour (87 mph).
All three projects are to be built within one hour of Lethbridge, Alberta, south of Calgary. And each will use GP Joule’s Phlegon fixed-tilt racking system.
Around 150 skilled and professional trade workers will be hired for construction, with about 60% likely from the fossil fuel industry. And some of the workforce will come from the the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Native American tribe.
Concord Pacific has a renewable energy portfolio that includes solar power plants operating in Ontario and more than 500 MW of renewable energy projects in the development pipeline.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/05/04/nrel-signs-agreement-with-ul-to-scale-up-solarapp-software/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 4, 2021",NREL signs agreement with UL to scale up SolarAPP+ software,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) today announced a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the global company UL to work toward further developing and commercializing the Solar Automated Permit Processing Plus (SolarAPP+) software. The software automates the permitting process for residential solar systems.
The use of SolarAPP+ so far has enabled local governments to cut down on the time required to grant a permit from a national average of five business days to zero.
SolarAPP+ is designed to make it easier for local governments to determine whether a proposed residential solar system is compliant with safety and code standards. If it is, SolarAPP+ will approve the design and issue a permit instantly. If not, SolarAPP+ will decline the application and indicate the issues for the contractor to resolve.
The collaboration with UL is a step in meeting NREL’s goal to deliver instant permitting nationwide, and have the software used to cover 90% of all residential solar and solar-plus-storage permits by 2030.
UL’s code-related experience in the solar market, including with installers, customers, and local governments, drove the partnership decision, NREL said.
Late last year, NREL released the pilot version of the free SolarAPP+ software to help reduce the time and cost of local government permitting and support faster deployment of residential solar.
DOE funded the development of SolarAPP+, and a coalition of stakeholders including the International Code Council, National Fire Protection Association, International Association of Electrical Inspectors, local governments, and the solar industry are helping to develop the software and engage local governments in its adoption.
NREL has committed to adding new features to SolarAPP+ until March 2023, when UL will take over management and deployment of the software with code organizations, the SolarAPP+ coalition, and related stakeholders. UL also plans to work to create new features that expand the scope to other clean energy technologies and installation scenarios in accordance with an NREL license agreement.

According to AES, the transaction will result in construction of around 500 MW of renewable energy and storage projects to ensure Google’s Virginia-based data centers will be 90% carbon-free when measured on an hourly basis.
AES put together the 500 MW portfolio from a combination of the company’s own renewable projects and those of third party developers, which were selected, sized and contracted to meet Google’s energy needs. The portfolio is expected to require $600 million in investment and generate 1,200 jobs, both permanent and construction, in the host communities.
The company said that these efforts will simplify Google’s energy procurement and management at a competitive price while decarbonizing Google’s load and the broader PJM grid. The agreement will start supply later in 2021 and is a step in meeting Google’s previously announced goal to run its business on 100% carbon-free energy on an hourly basis by 2030.
In 2019, AES and Google formed a strategic partnership to leverage Google Cloud technology to accelerate innovation in energy distribution and management and advance the adoption of clean energy.

The company also detailed its front-row seat during the debacle in March when the container ship Ever Given became lodged in the Suez Canal.
SolarEdge reported that its quarter-on-quarter revenues rose 13% to $405.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. Despite strong demand for its residential and commercial products, SolarEdge said it expects that a spike in ocean freight prices, which resulted from the effects of Covid-19 on trade and supply chains, to dampen its second quarter gross margins.
“Ocean freight prices have increased by more than 100% over the last month, and our pre-negotiated prices have gradually expired and exposed us to higher fright costs worldwide,” said Ronan Faier, SolarEdge’s chief financial officer. Higher costs for certain components and freight costs related to the expedited shipping of components will also factor into lower Q2 margins, he said.
Faier said SolarEdge is managing component shortages in a way that enables the company to meet its annual operating plan. At times, however, it has to pay more for a component or resort to air transport to ship components to its contract manufacturers’ facilities.
“Our logistics are always complex and global,” said Zvi Lando, CEO. He noted that the company manufactures at five sites globally.
In late March, SolarEdge had more than 100 containers of products delayed in the Suez Canal congestion, which resulted when a container ship became lodged in the canal. Lando said that some of its products were on the ship that blocked the canal and some were on ships on either side of the blockage. He said delivery dates remained intact despite the delay.
Faier said that the company has a “pretty clear visibility” for the ocean freight prices for the second quarter. The path for prices beyond Q2 is not yet clear, but the company expects a slight downward trend, he said.
SolarEdge’s U.S. revenues grew 23% in the first quarter, driven by sales of residential products. Commercial shipments also grew in the U.S. on quarter-on-quarter basis. Most of the company’s Q1 growth in commercial volumes originated in Europe.
SolarEdge said that it started to see meaningful signs of recovery in its commercial business across all regions during the first quarter. Megawatt shipments of commercial products grew 35% from Q4, Lando said.
Overall, however, the commercial sector has been slower to recover from the economic downturn triggered by the pandemic. SolarEdge now expects revenues from that segment to return to pre-pandemic levels in the second and third quarter, Lando said.
SolarEdge’s year-over-year total revenues fell 6% from $431.2 million in Q1 2020. Revenues related to the sale of solar products were down 8% from last year’s $407.6 million.
SolarEdge Technologies is a U.S.-domiciled, Israel-headquartered provider of power optimizer, solar inverter and monitoring systems for photovoltaic arrays. Its stock trades on NASDAQ.

The Kapolei Energy Storage project was selected a year ago by the utility as part of its transition away from coal-fired generation. In all, 15 renewable energy and battery storage projects located across three islands were selected. Plus Power’s Kapolei project was the largest battery storage project in the group.
The lithium-ion battery project will be located on eight acres in an industrial area, where it will interconnect with a Hawaiian Electric substation. The project will provide load shifting and fast-frequency response services to Hawaiian Electric, enhancing grid reliability and accelerating the integration of renewable energy. The project is planned to enter service in June 2022 in advance of the closing three months later of the island’s last coal-fired power plant.
State regulators opened a docket in March into Hawaiian Electric’s interconnection processes, which regulators said were causing “unnecessary delays and increasing project costs.” The docket called problems “pervasive” across community-based renewable energy as well as utility-scale projects.
At the time, the utility said that the Kapolei project’s timeline could slip to the end of 2022 without affecting reserve margins or grid reliability. However, it said a project delay past 2022 and up to mid-2023 “would prove more problematic.”
Ørsted has completed its Permian Energy Center project, a 460 MW hybrid solar and battery storage facility located in Andrews County, Texas. Permian Energy Center brings Ørsted’s onshore operating capacity to 2.1 GW. The project and its 420 MW of solar PV and 40 MW of battery storage are on a 3,600-acre site alongside existing oil and gas installations and will supply growing West Texas demand for electricity.

Ørsted said it is one of the first developers to own the full spectrum of new renewable energy technologies at utility scale in the U.S., onshore and offshore wind, solar PV, and storage.
Solar is on track to make up the largest share of new capacity additions in Texas between 2020 and 2022. Almost 50% of the additions during this time period will be solar, surpassing wind (35%) and natural gas (13%) additions, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration.
Factors driving solar investment in Texas include lower solar technology costs and plentiful sunlight, particularly in West Texas’s Permian Basin, where about 30% of the state’s planned solar capacity will be built.
Connecticut-based ReneSola signed a joint venture agreement with Eiffel Investment Group intended to speed the development and financing of ReneSola Power’s solar project pipeline across Europe.
The two created European Solar Energy Development JV with ReneSola Power having a 51% ownership stake and Eiffel a 49% stake. The initial portfolio will consist of 340 MW of advanced stage development projects located in Poland, Spain, and France, which both partners will support and develop to reach ready-to-build stage. The joint venture company intends to fund the development of up to 700 MW of solar projects in the next three years across Europe. Eiffel has been ReneSola’s financial partner for several years.
Solar and storage design-build firm CS Energy said it has closed its acquisition by affiliates of American Securities LLC, a U.S. private equity firm. American Securities acquired the equity interests from a fund managed by the Infrastructure and Power strategy of Ares Management Corporation and The Conti Group.
Energy Services of America said that its Nitro Construction Services unit completed the purchase of Revolt Energy, a solar installation company located in Nitro, West Virginia. Terms were not disclosed. Revolt Energy is completing a 487 kW solar array that will power Nitro’s office and fabrication shop.
