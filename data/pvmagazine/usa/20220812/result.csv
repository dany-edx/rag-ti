FlexGen, a US battery energy storage system integrator, has launched a new suite of products for distributed and behind-the-meter applications. The FlexPod battery energy storage system (BESS) products are fully containerized, modular, scalable and come in a range of sizes to fit every project.
All of FlexGen’s FlexPods include lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, power conversion electronics, thermal management, and fire suppression in a single container solution. Each FlexPod is enabled with the company’s proprietary energy management software, HybridOS, which is said to enable advanced functionality, simplicity in operation, and adaptability over time.
The FlexPod BESS comes in 920 kW, 1,200 kW, and 1,500 kW power configurations, with 920 kWh, 1.2 MWh or 1.5 MWh of battery capacity in 20-foot containers. The DC nameplate capacity is 920 kWh, 1200 kWh, or 1,500 kWh. There is also a 2-hour and 4-hour solution starting at 125kW.
The systems’ auxiliary consumption at 1C charge/discharge stands at 20 kW, 21 kW, and 22 kW. With UL9540 pending, FlexPods is said to safely operate in a wide temperature range from -30 C to 45 C, and in altitudes below 2,000 meters.
The company said the benefits of its FlexPods include advanced capabilities to manage power quality, “out- of-the-box” integration with solar, advanced microgrid functionality, black start function, and integration with EV charging infrastructure. Earlier this year, FlexGen launched an electric vehicle charging solution that combined its energy management system platform and battery energy storage.
“Commercial and Industrial businesses need scalable, flexible energy solutions now more than ever. This is a sector that is bearing the brunt of energy inflation and the high costs of fossil fuels right now,” said Kelcy Pegler, CEO of FlexGen. “We’re committed to delivering solutions that allow our customers to meet the full-range of operational and commercial demands today, while anticipating the needs of tomorrow.”
The North Carolina-based company recently raised $100 million in a Series C funding round led by Rotterdam-based energy trader Vitol. In December 2021, the company was contracted to provide software and integration services for a massive 2.1 GWh battery storage rollout by Ameresco across three sites in southern California.
Since its founding in 2009, FlexGen has installed more than 3 GWh of energy storage systems across the United States for utility, microgrid, and C&I customers.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/12/whats-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-for-the-solar-industry/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 12, 2022",What’s in the Inflation Reduction Act for the solar industry?,"This past Sunday, the United States Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act, and today the House of Representatives votes on the bill. It is now on its way to the President’s desk for a final signature as soon as next week.
The bill – known technically as H.R. 5376 – Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – is 730 pages of dense legalese. The document covers a wide variety of topics including healthcare, corporate taxes, staffing at the IRS, and – of course – energy related legislation.
With that, we at pv magazine USA will try our best to extract and point to the pieces of the legislation that will directly affect our industry.
Investment Tax Credit
The Investment Tax Credit has been increased from 26% to 30%. The residential tax credit is not transferable. The 30% applies to both business and residential projects, including projects installed in 2022, and will last until the end of 2032.
Everyone should learn how to utilize a transferable credit. While transferable credits are not as simple as cash from the government via Direct Pay, they are not nearly as complex as tax equity structures.
Energy storage projects were previously ineligible for tax credits unless they were connected directly to solar power projects. The Inflation Reduction Act removes these requirements, and allows energy storage projects to receive the same 30% tax credit, even if they are stand-alone facilities. Batteries connected to a solar power project will continue to qualify for the credit, even if they are no longer being charged by solar power.
Interconnection costs will also be included in the tax credit, for projects smaller than 5 MWac.
The business tax credit can be found starting on page 263, while the residential tax credit update can be found starting on page 351.
Starting in 2025, the Investment Tax Credit will be retired and turned into a much broader, technology agnostic credit, that applies not only to solar power, but to many emission reducing techniques. The same terms apply for solar, which also gets a 30% transferable tax credit that lasts until September 30, 2031. After 2032, the credit will begin to decrease. This technology agnostic tax credit can be found starting on page 464.
For larger projects, there are additional considerations:
Prevailing wage & apprenticeship
For projects of more than 1 MWac and above must pay attention to employment requirements. By default, the tax credit is 6%. To be eligible for the additional 24%, laborers and mechanics installing the solar power projects must be paid prevailing wages, and must be part of an electrical apprenticeship program. These tax credits will begin to apply to projects in 2023.
Additionally, there are requirements for the ratio of apprentices to journeyworkers, which are specified by the Department of Labor or the applicable State apprenticeship agency. Contractors or subcontractors who employ more than 4 individuals performing construction, alteration, or repair work must employ at least one qualified apprentice to perform such work.
Violations will result in fines to the Secretary of Labor of $5,000 for each laborer or mechanic who is underpaid. If the underpayment is found to be intentional, the fine doubles to $10,000 per laborer or mechanic. These details can be found starting on page 234.
Domestic content – 10% tax credit adder
Solar power projects eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10% – to 40% in total – by purchasing domestically produced hardware. Per the document, 100% of steel and iron must be US manufactured in the United States. For manufactured goods – like solar panels, inverters, and electrical gear – the goods must initially be 40% US manufactured, though this percentage will increase in the future.
Historically, for goods to be classified as Made in the USA, they must be composed of at least 55% domestic content. The bill lists some exceptions to these requirements. Items that are not of satisfactory quality, or are not produced in sufficient quantities, may be imported. Items that would increase the project cost by greater than 25% may be sourced outside the US as well. These requirements, and exceptions, will apply to all project sizes.
This report from the Congressional Research Service offers more refined answers.
Project siting – 10% tax credit adder
Projects that are located in former ‘energy communities’ can earn an additional 10% tax credit. Energy communities are first defined as brownfields, and secondly as locations associated with fossil fuels over the last generation.
If there have been significant extraction jobs associated with coal, oil, or natural gas after December 31,1999, then the census tract – and its connecting census tracts – are eligible. If a coal power plant or mine has closed in the same window, the area and its surrounding tracts are also eligible. Language describing energy communities can be found starting on page 250.
Clean electricity production credit
For a long time, the wind industry has been given a tax credit on a per kilowatt-hour basis. Prior to 2007, the solar industry was also eligible for this production credit. The Production Tax Credit is now fully applicable to the solar power industry. In this document, it is titled the ‘Clean Electricity Production Credit’.
If a solar power project meets the prevailing wage requirements, then it will receive a tax credit of 2.5 cents/kWh for the first ten years of a project’s life. If a project does not meet prevailing wage standards, it will earn only 0.3 cents/kWh before adjustment for inflation. Going forward, the production credit increases as it is adjusted for inflation. Language describing the production credit can be found starting on page 442.
Domestic solar hardware manufacturing
The Ossoff Manufacturing Credits made it into the bill – and then some. There are tax credits for manufacturing the various solar panel, inverter, and racking components, as well.
For solar modules the credits are expected to include:
For inverters the credit would be applied per watt of alternating current:
Torque tubes for racking will receive 87 cents per kilogram, while structural fasteners get $2.28 per kilogram. Language describing the production credit can be found starting on page 414.
60% tax credit opportunity?
There is also a 10% adder for solar power projects that sell their electricity via community solar projects to low-income individuals. If we add the 30% tax credit base, 10% for domestic content, 10% for being located in a former fossil fuel energy community, and 10% for selling the electricity via community solar to low income families – the tax credit could potentially reach 60%.
Additional items
There are additional tax credits for EVs, electrical panels, heat pumps, and many other items directly related to our industry that pv magazine USA will cover in the future.
Not all of the details of the legislation are fully developed, as there are rules that the IRS and Treasury Department will need to develop, publicize, and provide guidance on for more specific detailed tax related questions. This article is not intended to provide legal or financial advice, so please seek out professional opinions before developing any solar power or energy storage facilities.

President Biden has already publicly announced he will sign the bill the moment it reaches his desk.
Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is focused on supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience. The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on ultra-wealthy Americans and corporations.
The IRA mandates a reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. The bill is “long overdue and a necessary step to ensure the United States takes decisive action on the climate crisis that helps our economy and provides leadership for the world by example,” said former Vice President Al Gore.
Tax credits
One of the most significant provisions in the IRA was something the industry had been calling for all year: a long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit. The bill mandates a 10-year extension of the tax credit at 30% of the cost of the installed equipment, which will then step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. If the bill is passed, the 30% credit will be retroactively applied to anyone who installed their system since the beginning of 2022.
The 30% credit also applies to energy storage whether it is co-located or installed as standalone energy storage. This enables the retrofit of a battery to a solar array while taking advantage of the credit.
There are several “adders” for the tax credit depending on the type of organization, domestic product use, and project location. ROTH Capital Partners said that the investment tax credit could reach as high as 50% for some projects with the right adders applied.
The credit also includes the “direct pay” option, another provision the industry was calling for. This would allow a developer with little or no tax liability to treat the amount of credit as an overpayment of tax which would result a cash payment refund in the amount of such overpayment being made to the developer.
Made-in-USA
A recent Wood Mackenzie report estimated that with supportive policies, an additional 20 GW of US manufacturing could be added. The IRA includes over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes clean energy vehicles. Included in this is $30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. About $10 billion investment tax credit is included to build new clean technology manufacturing facilities. National laboratories are granted $2 billion for National Labs to accelerate breakthrough energy research as part of the IRA.
Numerous tax credits for each component are mandated, including:
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and cofounder of SEIA.
Impact
Under the IRA, Princeton University researchers said that solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The Act would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said Princeton.
Annual US energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% in 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and industry. This translates into hundreds of dollars in annual energy cost savings for US households. Tax credits, rebates, and federal investments in the Act would shift costs from energy bills to the progressive federal tax base.
The REPEAT report said the Inflation Reduction Act could cut annual emissions in 2030 by an additional 1 billion metric tons below current policy, including the impacts from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This would represent closing two-thirds of the remaining emissions gap between current policy and the nation’s 2030 target of lowering emissions 50% below 2005 levels.
“It really makes me incredibly optimistic,” said Princeton’s Jesse Jenkins. “It doesn’t get us all the way there on its own, but it keeps us in the climate fight.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/12/new-centralized-dcdc-converter-from-alencon/,"MARKETS & POLICY,OPTIMIZERS & INVERTERS,PRODUCTS,PENNSYLVANIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 12, 2022",New centralized DC:DC converter from Alencon,"Alencon Systems announced the launch of a new DC:DC converter, called CUBE, which is designed for high voltage applications, able to support both 1000 V and 1500 V. The converter is rated at upwards of 430 kW and can be configured for both solar and energy storage applications.
The CUBE – Combined Universal Buck/Boost Power Electronics – comes in a highly compact design, offering high levels of power density. Alencon said the power density of the CUBE is about five times greater than other non-isolated DC:DC converters in a similar power class. The power density is achieved via a silicon carbide-based power train, which is currently patent pending in the US.
Like all Alencon products, the CUBE is designed and manufactured in the company’s Philadelphia-area factory.
In large-scale solar facilities, the CUBE provides distributed energy harvesting to increase energy yield for projects using larger central inverters. The converter will step-up voltage to a central inverter, thereby allowing the inverter to operate at greater utilization. This enables large scale PV plants to be built with fewer power blocks, lowering costs. The CUBE also allows for less copper to be used in the balance of the system by operating at higher voltage and lower current.
The converter also allows PV facilities to be “storage ready” and can be useful in repowering older PV arrays. In energy storage applications, the CUBE can be used to step up voltage from lower voltage batteries to higher voltage power conversion systems. As a result of its high switching frequency, the CUBE provides minimal additional fault current contribution to a battery energy storage system.
“The introduction of the CUBE series of DC:DC converters allows Alencon to offer alternative energy project developers yet another unique tool in an increasingly DC coupled world,” said Hanan Fishman, president of Alencon Systems. “Alencon has leveraged its decade of expertise in building high power, high voltage DC:DC converters with next generation silicon carbide power electronics to deliver a product of unrivaled power density to the market. The addition of the CUBE to Alencon’s product line-up is consistent with our mission to become the premier supplier of high power, high voltage DC:DC optimizers to the alternative energy industry.”
The CUBE joins Alencon’s existing line-up of galvanically isolated, modular DC:DC optimizers, the SPOT and BOSS. The CUBE can be paired with the Alencon BOSS, to create cost effective, fixed voltage DC bus solar plus storage projects.
Alencon’s solutions for ALternative ENergy CONversion provide modularity and scalability for systems from several megawatts to several-hundred megawatts. Headquartered in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, the company has been building PV power conversion hardware since 2009, drawing on the combined decades of power electronics experience of its engineering team.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/12/sol-systems-develops-bifacial-single-axis-tracking-solar-project-with-pollinator-habitat/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RACKING,TRACKERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW YORK",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 12, 2022","Sol Systems develops bifacial, single-axis tracking solar project with pollinator habitat","The Monroe County Water Authority (MCWA) project spans 29 acres and is one of the first in New York State to use bifacial solar modules and single axis tracking. For added sustainability, the site was planted with a seed mixture of pollinator plants, which will create new habitats for local pollinators, boosting the surrounding ecosystem.
The array, part of the Water Authority’s long-term goal to reduce energy expenses, is expected to generate 8 GW hours of electricity per year, which represents more than 15% of MCWA’s energy needs for water pumping and treatment.
“Reliably providing quality, affordable water is our top priority. MCWA should realize substantial savings over the course of this 25-year contract, helping keep water rates affordable,” said Nick Noce, MCWA executive director. “Beyond the financial benefits of the solar array, utilizing sustainable, clean energy is a significant step forward in our commitment to environmental stewardship.”
Sol Systems was selected through a competitive bidding process led by NYPA to install and operate the solar array at no expense to the Water Authority. In return, the kilowatt hours of energy produced by the panels are delivered to Rochester Gas & Electric and a percentage is credited to MCWA on its energy bills. The project also qualified for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) solar energy incentive, which will pay nearly $1 million toward the project over the first two years of operation.
“The New York Power Authority is pleased to have played an energy advisor role for the Water Authority to help make this unique solar project happen in Monroe County,” said Justin E. Driscoll, NYPA’s interim president and CEO. “This prudent use of Water Authority land will make a new source of clean power available to the Water Authority. Monroe County residents and New Yorkers as a whole will benefit from further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which supports the state’s ambitious clean energy goals. We commend the Water Authority’s dedication to this clean energy project, even amidst the challenges that we faced together during the pandemic and over the last few years.”
The Water Authority’s new system will generate electricity to help support New York’s clean energy goals of achieving 70% renewables-sourced electricity by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity sector by 2040. The state intends to build at least 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030, enough to annually power nearly 700,000 homes.
“The economic and sustainable benefits of this project will be felt for years to come, and we are proud to have had such committed partners in MCWA and NYPA,” said Anna Toenjes, Sol Systems’ senior director. “In addition to providing clean energy and cost savings, the project’s pollinator habitat will provide decades of positive impact to the local ecosystem.”
