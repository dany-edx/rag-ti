The projects, while not all guaranteed to advance, represent a new level of developer interest in the state. Some of the proposed capacities would rival the largest projects being constructed in the country’s sunniest areas.
Among the six proposed projects include the 300 MW Birch Solar project proposed by Lightsource bp, and the 300 MW Yellow Wood Solar project, which would be developed by Invenergy.
The Birch Solar project would be constructed in Allen and Auglaize counties, southwest of Toledo. Lightsource bp said that it intends to use 590W monocrystalline modules from Trina Solar, Power Electronics’ PE 3350 inverters, and Array Technologies DuraTrack HZv3 trackers. The hardware specifics could change as the project advances.
The Yellow Wood Solar Project would be constructed by Invenergy in Clinton County, midway between Cincinnati and Columbus. For this project, the developer said it would use modules from Longi, inverters from TMEIC inverter, trackers from NEXTracker, Soltec, or Array Technologies. Specific models were not disclosed, and the application outlined potential module and inverter substitutions.
The remaining four projects are still of considerable size:
The 100 MW Marion County Solar Project, set to be developed by Savion Energy, would include a 20 MW energy storage system. The project, planned for Marion County, just north of Columbus, would use Tier-1 solar modules, with applicants identifying Risen, Jinko, Trina, Longi as possible providers. Inverter mounting system specifics were not disclosed.
The 120 MW Tymochtee Solar project would be developed by Apex Clean Energy in Wyandot County, also north of Columbus. Hardware details were not available, other than it will use bifacial solar modules mounted on single-axis trackers.
The 117 MW Dodson Creek Solar project would be developed by National Grid Renewables in Highland County, east of Cincinnati.  National Grid is considering Solar Ware, SMA, and SunGrow inverters; First Solar Series 6, Longi LR5, Vertex TSM-DEG 201C.20, Canadian Solar BiHiKu6 Mono, and JA Solar Deep Blue 3.0 modules, and Soltec, FTC Solar and NEXTracker trackers.
The 175 MW Kingswood Solar project would be developed by Vesper Energy in Xenia, Cedarville, and Miami townships, near Dayton. Hardware specifics have not been finalized, with the developer stating only that it would use Tier 1 solar modules. The inverter supplier and mounting system of choice have not yet been decided.

PacifiCorp service territory spans portions of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, California, Wyoming and Utah.
In an announcement made on August 27, the company stated that it would make no further investments in coal or natural gas in the future, and that it would be retiring 14 of its 22 active coal units by 2030. By 2040, that number is set to grow to 19, though it would retain two coal units at Wyoming’s Jim Bridger power plant, converting them to natural gas peaker plants in 2024.
The Jim Bridger conversion is still in-line with the company’s plan for no new gas investment, as those plans were known prior to Friday’s announcement.
In total, the company’s coal capacity is set to fall 4 GW by 2040, while its gas capacity will fall by 1.5 GW over the same time period. Replacing these assets, PacifiCorp intends to deploy more than 3.6 GW of new wind, more than 5.6 GW of new solar, and close to 6.7 GW of storage capacity, as well as significant investments in new transmission to support these resources.
The company also plans to bring on-line 2.7 GW of “advanced nuclear and non-emitting peaking resources” by 2040.
The new plan is slightly different than the one outlined in the company’s 2019 IRP, where the company planned to add just under 11 GW of wind and solar by 2038, complemented by 2.8 GW of battery storage. The new IRP includes slightly less solar and wind capacity, but more than doubles the amount of storage set to become active in the next two decades.
When the IRP gets submitted later this week, we’ll have a better idea of how much capacity of each resource is set to go on-line and when, as well as a breakdown of which states will be receiving capacity, and how much.

The utility warned that people in the hardest-hit areas “could experience power outages for weeks.” The utility also provided photos of some of the damage that crews encountered as repair work began.
The South Louisiana Electric Cooperative Association, which serves 17,000 customers, said the hurricane caused “catastrophic damage” to its system. It said that parts of its Houma, Louisiana, office roof blew off and the building was full of standing water.
As of daybreak on August 30, Entergy said it had 888,229 power outages in Louisiana. Power outages continued to increase as the storm moved through Mississippi. It counted around 45,000 outages in its Mississippi service territory.
Entergy said that it counted 216 substations and 207 transmission lines in addition to the 2,000 miles of transmission lines as being out of service. One transmission line that spans the Mississippi River was down. The destroyed tower withstood Hurricane Katrina when it struck the area in 2005.
Entergy said it had a workforce of 11,450 working to restore service. With additional requested resources, it expected to mobilize a storm team of at least 20,000.
Entergy said on Sunday night, as Hurricane Ida was near its peak, that it provided back-up generation to the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board. But the Board reported that it had lost “all Entergy power.” It said its crews were working “quickly and decisively” to make up for the loss with internal self-generated power sources, including what it identified as Turbines 4, 5, and 6, and EMD, as well as backup generators located at drainage pumping stations.
The water board said that the Entergy loss of power was a “significant” loss for its 60 hz pumps and the 25 hz pumps typically powered through frequency changers. The Board said it was using the self-generated sources of power to drain stormwater and pump drinking water into the city.
The power loss also impacted the city’s sewer pumping stations. The water board said that as of Monday morning, hours after the storm had passed, no backup power was available to operate any of the pumps that were impacted. Crews were assessing how many of the 84 stations were impacted and the board warned but the number “may be very significant.”
The water board said it was working to obtain backup power for some of those sewage pumping stations. In order to prevent sewage backups, the board said it asked residents to limit water usage at home, thus decreasing the amount of wastewater that must be pumped and treated.

Local utility Entergy said that the hurricane’s “catastrophic intensity” caused the damage, which resulted in what it said was a load imbalance that forced power plants to trip offline. It did not know when power might be restored.
The utility said that as of 8 a.m. CDT across its service area, 216 substations, 207 transmission lines, and more than 2,000 miles of transmission lines were out of service.
Local news reports quoted an official in Jefferson Parish who said that a transmission tower that provides power for New Orleans and the east bank of the parish collapsed into the Mississippi River near Bridge City. According to the parish’s Emergency Management Director, cables strung across the Mississippi River fell in the water. The parish is Louisiana’s most populous, with around 450,000 residents. Entergy said the transmission tower that was destroyed withstood Hurricane Katrina that struck the area in 2005.
In 2008, Hurricane Gustav knocked out 13 of the 14 transmission lines that at the time brought power to New Orleans. The failure led regulators to criticize Entergy for the condition of its grid.
The Entergy transmission system is comprised of roughly 16,100 circuit miles of transmission lines operated at 69 kV to 500 kV and around 1,300 substations.The transmission system spans portions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas, covering 114,000 square miles.
Entergy said on Sunday night as Hurricane Ida was near its peak that it provided back-up generation to the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board. But the Board reported that it had lost “all Entergy power.” It said its crews were working “quickly and decisively” to make up for the loss with internal self-generated power sources, including what it identified as Turbines 4, 5, and 6, and EMD, as well as backup generators located at drainage pumping stations.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/30/the-worlds-largest-solar-power-stations/,"GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"AUGUST 30, 2021",The world’s largest solar power stations,"From pv magazine Global
In 2019, the top five solar parks had a combined capacity of 6.6 GWAC. Fast forward to 2021, and today’s top five total over 12.5 GWAC.The intervening Covid-19 pandemic has clearly done little to slow the explosive global growth of utility-scale solar.
In three blogs in the coming weeks, the top solar power plants, solar parks, and solar clusters will be identified. First, however, here’s a reminder of where the records stood in 2019; and how solar parks, individual plants, and regional clusters are distinguished.
In most cases, solar power plants are designed and built singly, with the project developer choosing a site with a suitable connection to the electricity grid. Project size may be dictated by the site area available, connection capacity, or financial restrictions. Where those factors do not impose limits, developers aim for economies of scale often by maximizing plant size.
In 2008, the largest PV project – at about 50 MWAC – was near Olmedilla de Alarcón in Spain. By 2012, the Agua Caliente solar farm in Arizona had taken the record to over 250 MWAC. When the previous list of top plants was published two years ago, the Sweihan project was about to be commissioned in Abu Dhabi with a capacity of 938 MWAC (or 1,177 MWP).
Not all solar projects are developed individually, however. There can be benefits in grouping plants together to take advantage of prime locations and strong grid connections.
By the second decade of the millennium, several national and state-level energy agencies had realized that solar power could be produced even more economically if multiple projects were co-located in one area, where they could share grid connection and other site related costs.
Probably the most notable early example is the Charanka Solar Park in the Patan district of India. When this was first opened in 2012 by Gujarat’s then chief minister, Narendra Modi, it had a combined capacity of 224 MW from 19 individual solar power plants, of which the largest were 25 MW each. It has since been expanded to over 600 MW of overall capacity. Agencies of the state of Gujarat arranged the grid connection and leased land to the project developers.
A similar approach was adopted in China most notably in the Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces. This approach lends itself particularly to centralized economies where state agencies can arrange grid connections, land allocation, and other shared services. This model is also now being adopted in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, with a few instances in Europe and America.
The Golmud Solar Park in China’s Qinghai province was the largest at 1,800 MWAC, when the previous list was published. Many of these solar parks have been progressively expanded over the years, with several now achieving combined capacities running into the multi-gigawatt range.
The co-located solar park model has not been widely adopted in Europe and America where energy markets are more deregulated. However, less formal co-location of multiple projects can sometimes be found in areas where suitable land and grid connection capacity is plentiful and solar radiation is good.
The Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County hosted the largest cluster in 2019, with a total of about 3,000 MWAC.
Press reports of the largest solar power station may refer to any of the above mentioned arrangements and may therefore ‘compare apples with pears’. Subsequent blogs in this short series will identify the world’s largest solar power stations, distinguishing between individual plants and groups of multiple co-located projects.
For consistency, the terminology solar plant will be used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium, even if it is spread over several geographical plots or built in various phases. Where multiple plants are co-located in a discreet area under the coordination of an identified agency, this will be called a solar park. A cluster denotes several solar farms are co-located in an area without formal coordination.
Single plants are often colloquially known as solar farms. Readers should note that this terminology is not universally adopted, and that some developers and owners choose to call individual plants a ‘solar park’.
Also for consistency, all capacities are quoted in MWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically around 25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.
The next blog will identify the largest individual solar plants in the world, to be followed subsequently by solar parks and then clusters.
