Mike Thompson of Kansas (R) introduced new laws that would require solar and wind facilities to be built only on lands zoned for industrial use. About half the state’s 105 counties are rural and unzoned, so the bill could effectively freeze renewable energy growth in the state. Kansas already uses a fair amount of renewable energy when compared to other states, and the Energy Information Association reports renewables powered 44% of Kansas’ operation in 2020.
“It would be sending a message…that, well perhaps Oklahoma, or Missouri, or Nebraska, or Texas or Iowa would be a better and more stable state in which to invest dollars,” said Kimberly Svaty, public policy consultant for the Kansas Power Alliance, which represents the state’s clean energy industry.
The law did not find support from other legislators, so now Thompson is targeting county-level zoning laws to combat the development of clean energy. He has targeted Douglas and Johnson counties, looking to heavily restrict zones that are open to development.
Barbara Kerr, a founding member of an anti-solar group in the state that is attempting to block NextEra Energy’s utility-scale solar project in the two counties, said that her groups website has featured videos with misinformation about solar, and Senator Thompson has spread similar false messages.
“Just horrible,” Kerr says of the videos. “They are just counterfactual and not something we should have on the website.”
Anti-solar groups have made false claims, such as solar farms creating “heat islands” that are harmful to nearby livestock. They have made claims that solar is an attempt by China to weaken the United States, and that solar panels contaminate groundwater, despite the fact they are made of non-harmful materials like silicon, aluminum and steel. Solar developers must post funds up-front for the eventual decommissioning of the project, yet anti-solar groups falsely claim landowners and taxpayers will be stuck with paying for the process.
Despite Kerr’s expression of distaste in the manipulative information, she sided with the group’s decision to continue to show the videos. “It is important to not judge, and censor utility-scale solar content/opinions contributed by citizens. If we become judge and jury, we are headed down the wrong path,” the group said in an emailed statement.
Thompson has misinformed the public, too. He has made claims that wind farms have acute, adverse health effects on people that live near the turbines. He also invited witnesses to testify that solar developers will snatch up the family farm at will, though private energy developers do not hold the power of eminent domain.
In an opinion piece for the Kansas City Star, Steven Clark, a solar PV engineer with 42 years of experience, wrote, “Solar opponents believe intermittent renewables are ‘unreliable’ since they use variable wind and sunshine. However, renewables have been successfully integrated into the Southwest Power Pool, which serves Kansas and 16 other states, for 20 years. The pool’s highest renewable energy peak supplied 87.5% of the power utilized on May 8, 2021. Intermittent renewables haven’t caused blackouts.”
Clark went on to write that Sen. Thompson’s anti-renewable policies violate his own core political beliefs of limited government. Despite being a purported stalwart of free enterprise, Thompson is actively using government to block market participation.
Clark writes, “They want property tax exemptions revoked for renewable plants, but not for conventional power plants. They claim solar farms require large amounts of land, but ignore the extensive footprints of conventional power plants with their associated coal mines, gas wells, pipelines and railroads. They exaggerate the minor environmental impacts of renewable power, but ignore the very harmful impacts of fossil fuel power plants, including their climate-warming carbon emissions.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/01/greenbacker-annual-revenues-grow-39-to-107-million/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 1, 2022",Greenbacker annual revenues grow 39% to $107 million,"Greenbacker, a publicly reporting, non-traded investor and manager of sustainable infrastructure assets, announced its year-end 2021 financial results. Strong growth was posted, with Greenbacker’s revenue increasing 39% to $107 million. 
The company dramatically expanded the capacity of its holdings from 900MW to 2.6GW, a near tripling. This includes operational and pre-operational assets. The company added 149 new projects to its fleet in 2021, bringing the project count over 400, representing a 58% increase in number of assets.
Greenbacker deployed $1.8 billion in capital, marking annual growth of 182% in spending. The fair value of its assets increased 111% over the year, reaching $1.4 billion. Net assets nearly tripled for the company, with $928.3 million in new equity capital raised in 2021.
“Despite supply chain challenges in 2021, our capital deployment and fleet expansion reached new highs. I’m happy to report that this growth brings even greater economies of scale throughout our operations, creating additional value for our investors and allowing us to deliver cheaper renewable power across the country.” Charles Wheeler, CEO 
Greenbacker estimates its fleet abates 2.7 million metric tons of carbon, saves 2.5 billion gallons of water when compared with coal generation, and supports over 4,600 jobs.
The company invests in solar and wind projects in a variety of project sizes and sectors. Earlier this year, it invested in floating solar developer Noria Energy. It has investments in solar PV assets that power colleges, rooftop commercial solar portfolios, and utility-scale solar projects. 
By the end of 2021, Greenbacker was conducting business in 32 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC. 
When it was gounded was founded in 2014, it set a goal to raise equity capital of about $1.5 billion. Now that it has neared that goal, the company has made the decision to close to new equity capital opportunities.
“We believe GREC’s expansion will continue to illustrate the long-term earnings power of our strategy. And, as always, we’re excited to focus on new opportunities to drive the future of clean energy” said Wheeler.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/04/01/duke-seeks-to-procure-an-additional-600mw-of-solar-in-2022/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH CAROLINA,SOUTH CAROLINA",TIM SYLVIA,"APRIL 1, 2022",Duke seeks to procure an additional 700MW of solar in 2022,"Duke Energy Carolinas has filed a proposal with the North Carolina Utilities Commission under which the utility is seeking bids this year 700MW of solar projects, in addition to the roughly 600MW of solar the company is already seeking through previously-announced procurement.
Duke shares that it is undertaking this additional procurement due to North Carolina’s recently-passed House Bill 951 (HB 951), a measure which formally adopted Governor Roy Cooper’s goal of 70% carbon emission reduction by 2030 into state law. Also outlined in the bill is the requirement that 55% of new solar generation under Duke’s Carbon Plan is to be supplied from solar energy facilities that are company-built. The remaining 45% of the total MW of any solar energy facilities procured under the Carbon Plan are to be supplied through the execution of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with other companies.
Just like the company’s earlier procurement, the 700MW proposed could be constructed in either North or South Carolina, though the company will likely prioritize development in North Carolina, in order to meet the requirements of HB 951. Additionally, all construction in either state will be done in those states’ Duke Energy Carolinas service territories, but not their Duke Energy Progress service territories.
Under the earlier solicitation, Duke’s utilities and commercial renewables division, Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions, was allowed to win up to 30% of bids in that round, a figure that will hold if the new proposal is approved by regulators.
While Duke’s proposal is still subject to regulatory approval, a company spokesperson shared with pv magazine that a quick approval would mean that the company could create an open window for bids from May 31 through July 15. Winners could be announced later in early 2023, with projects possibly online in early 2026. This initial solar procurement will be the first of a series of annual solar procurements, with the capacity to be built under each subsequent procurement to be determined by the state regulators as part of approval of the Carbon Plan.
Even considering the vast capacity of solar that Duke has brought to the North Carolina grid, the two combined solicitations, assuming the proposal is approved, represent a roughly 30% increase in installed solar capacity.

And soon SunPower will offer choices in solar modules. SunPower CEO, chairman and director, Peter Faricy, announced its new partnership with First Solar, calling it “Tandem Technology” that will combine First Solar’s thin-film semiconductor design with crystalline silicon. The stacked tandem solar module could be available to customers as soon as 18 months.

The design differs from traditional silicon or thin film modules, using two different photovoltaic absorbers to harvest more energy. SunPower says that it will be the most sophisticated technology commercially available to residential customers and that it will significantly raise the bar for solar module efficiency and aesthetics.
Meanwhile, SunPower has ambitious plans for the residential market, having recently sold its Commercial & Industrial Solutions (CIS) to TotalEnergies, majority owner of SunPower. In November of last year SunPower hinted at its move away from commercial and more deeply into residential. In February of this year, the company signed the definitive agreement with TotalEnergies, and confirmed that SunPower was putting its eggs in the residential basket
“The sale enables SunPower to focus on creating a superior residential experience, increase our investment in product and digital innovation, and reach more homeowners,” said Peter Faricy, CEO of SunPower.
In the analyst briefing, Nate Coleman, chief products officer, said that having a diverse panel offering would help First Solar reach more residential customers. He stated that the company plans to make solar available to 100 million homes (or more), and that by introducing new products the company will maintain its #1 position. “We expect to  obtain the same market share in the mainstream market as we currently have I premium segment over an approximate 6 quarter ramp,” said Coleman.
Coleman also presented the new SunVault whole home backup solution. SunVault Storage, in the form of 26 kWh and 52 kWh configurations, allowing the system to provide customers with backup power for every device in their homes in the event of an outage.
SunPower CEO Peter Faricy kicked off the analyst day presentation saying that by 2026 100 million homeowners will save money with solar. He noted that the two factors working in favor of this growth are increasing utility rates and the positive outlook for clean energy policies. Because policy changes have yet to go into effect, Faricy said that SunPower wouldn’t see a “deal progression” until late in Q2 or early Q3 2022.
