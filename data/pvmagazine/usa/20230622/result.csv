Designs must meet or exceed code requirements, maintain structural integrity when facing extreme flood events and minimize both project capital costs and operating expenses. A well-balanced project design is one that maximizes use of the buildable space for a parcel of land while avoiding costly impacts from flood damage during the operational period. The latter can be achieved by constructing solar arrays outside of expected flood areas or incorporating a structural design with adequate freeboard and structural strength to survive extreme flood events.
The 100-year flood is the common benchmark, or design flood, that engineers consider when determining solar array layouts and structural member sizes. This extreme event is defined as a flood that has a 1 in 100 chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. There is both statistical and anecdotal evidence supporting the claim that today’s extreme flood events are more severe (i.e., greater depths, extents, and velocities) and more frequent than historical averages. This is illustrated statistically in the chart shown below. This figure shows an increasing percentage of land area across the contiguous United States where a greater than normal portion of total annual precipitation has come from extreme single-day events.
While extreme precipitation events appear to be occurring more frequently over time, the design requirements for flood protection have not become stricter to account for these changing conditions. If flood protection design requirements do not evolve in parallel to a changing climate, solar projects may see a higher rate of flood damage than expected during their 25-to-40-year lifespan.
Flooding impact on renewables
The impact flooding can have on solar projects is highlighted in the photo below. In addition to potentially negative impacts to structural and electrical components at solar projects, issues related to erosion control can occur. Accounting for flooding appropriately in the design of a solar projects is important to avoid increased downtime, increased equipment repair costs, and negative impacts to environmentally sensitive habitats.
Solar facilities typically contain dirt or gravel roads to access important locations such as module blocks, electrical enclosures, and meteorological stations. Even minor flooding can erode or block off access roads at a solar site, preventing operations personnel from working on equipment that needs attention which can result in increased downtime. Sites that are topographically complex or contain cohesive soils that drain poorly are at an elevated risk to access issues resulting from erosion or extended periods of standing water.
Floods have the potential to damage structural racking framing and modules, particularly in locations where high flow velocities are expected during a flood event. Debris can be carried by moving water and these objects can impact and cause structural failure of racking members and modules. Conventional racking framing includes driven steel piles. Flowing water at the pile to soil interface can cause scour of the soil at the base of racking piles, effectively reducing the pile’s embedment and load carrying capacity.
Environmentally sensitive habitats such as wetlands are often located nearby or within solar project boundaries. These environments can be degraded by sediment and contaminant transported from their watersheds during flood events. Solar projects are often obligated to comply with strict permitting requirements intended to prevent wetland and habitat impacts. Flooding at a project elevates the risk of unauthorized sediment or contaminant transport which could result in permit non-compliance issues.
Solar facilities contain a wide array of electrical equipment and conductors. Many of these components have ingress protection ratings but are typically not designed to be submersible. Prolonged exposure to water, especially in submersion, can result in damaged electrical equipment which needs replacing.
Appropriate attention to flood risk mitigation measures during the development and construction of a solar project can prevent negative impacts. Accurate estimation of flooding conditions plays a key role in equipment layout and design specification requirements to minimize repair costs and project downtime. Some of the main design considerations for addressing flood risk at a project are summarized below.
Civil consultants can perform site-specific flood studies, often referred to as hydrology studies, to determine anticipated flood extents, depths, and velocities associated with different scenarios. These studies are typically more accurate and include more information than the publicly available Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) commonly used as a basis of design for solar projects. A flood study is a key data source for informing civil, structural, and electrical design details.
Civil drawings are prepared for solar projects to specify drainage and erosion control design requirements. It is important that civil drawings include specifications on the use of established best management practices (BMPs), such as silt fences, runoff diversions, or stream buffers to prevent negative erosion impacts to the surrounding environment. In addition to erosion control requirements, civil design drawings also specify design details for stormwater control features at a site. This can include the location and size of low water crossings, culverts, stormwater basins, and channels. The civil drawings also show grading details across a project which impacts the flow of water at a site. Both erosion control and stormwater design details can be informed by hydrology study findings. An accurate estimation of flooding conditions can result in properly placed and sized civil design details and reduce the risk associated with flooding.
Structural drawings are prepared for solar projects to show tracker and racking design requirements. Structural design consideration for tracker stow, equipment freeboard, and pile scour protection are important to mitigate flood risk at solar projects. If flooding is expected within the solar array footprint at a project, trackers can be programmed or manually operated to rotate into a “flood stow” position. This is a position parallel, or close to parallel, with the ground which allows flowing water to avoid impacting modules and reduces the risk of module damage during a flood. Fixed tilt racking systems can be designed to provide a minimum “freeboard” or gap between the bottom edge of modules and estimated flood water surface elevation. Water contact with foundations during a flood event may be unavoidable, therefore piles can be armored with rip-rap to reduce the energy of flowing water and prevent washout of material around piles. Alternatively, scour depth can be estimated in a hydrology study and a specific depth of soil around piles can be neglected in the structural calculations to ensure piles have adequate structural capacity in the event of erosion. Improper protection and layout of solar project equipment can result in short circuits or damage requiring replacement.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/22/top-risks-for-solar-assets-financial-modeling/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 22, 2023",Top risks for solar assets: Financial modeling,"The solar industry is forecast to build as much capacity in the next five years as it has over the previous two decades. As the industry matures, risk assessments support the build out of bankable projects that perform at a high level. 
This is the motivation behind the annual kWh Analytics Solar Risk Assessment report, now in its fifth year. In the 2023 report, the firm highlights key risks in extreme weather, finance, and asset operations. 
(Read part one: Extreme weather) 
“Mitigation of these risks will be critical to our industry’s shared goal: investment of capital into solar to attain sustainable growth,” said Jason Kaminsky, chief executive officer, kWh Analytics. “Doing so will require industry leaders to continue working together as new environmental, technological, legislative, and economic challenges arise.” 
1) Production modeling improperly evaluates downtime events 
kWh Analytics found that equipment outages and downtime events are contributing significantly more downside risk than would be expected using normally distributed performance curves. Tail events called P99 scenarios are occurring much more frequently than modeled.
A P99 scenario refers to a statistical analysis used to assess the reliability or availability of a solar asset. The term represents the 99th percentile, as an indication that the analysis focuses on extreme conditions that are expected to occur only 1% of the time or less.
With solar assets, a P99 scenario typically involves evaluating performance under unusually high-demand conditions or challenging circumstances. This scenario helps identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the system. For example, in the case of a power plant, a P99 scenario might involve simulating the plant’s performance during a peak demand period, extreme weather events, or equipment failures.
“Optimistic uncertainty assumptions result in both an under-estimation of the severity of downside events as well as an overestimation of upside events,” said kWh Analytics. “Analyses of the actual P99s used in project financing have shown that the combination of optimistic P50’s and inadequate downside uncertainty results in P99 events occurring 17 times more frequently than expected.”
Significant recurring inverter failures, ground faults, and manufacturer defects are some specific events that are driving tail event “P99” outcomes, said kWh Analytics.
2) Median asset availability is 97.7%, fixed-tilt projects are less available 
Availability of a solar asset is the overall percentage of time it is operational. Based on an assessment of 130 projects from 5 MW to 500 MW operating from 2013 to 2022 across the U.S., strategic consultant firm ICF found that the median annual availability of PV projects is 97.7%.
ICF found lower availability in the first year of operation, but this varies significantly project-to-project. The firm said that there are several projects that have achieved 99% or greater availability, and it has identified differences in design and operations and maintenance practices that are common among the highest-availability projects. 
The firm also found that fixed tilt systems had lower availability than tracker systems, which ICF said is likely due to the fixed tilt systems generally representing smaller, unmanned facilities. 
“A few examples of specific O&M practices which we have seen improve project availability are shorter response times specified in the O&M contract, higher frequency or higher sampling of certain preventative maintenance activities, and higher availability guarantees utilizing metrics that capture DC-level performance,” said ICF. 
3) Capital costs for DG solar to decline, supply chain delays keep utility-scale costs high 
Forces of global inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and anti-dumping duties for module procurement have cause a high-cost environment for U.S. solar in 2022, said Sagar Chopra, research analyst for Wood Mackenzie. 
Chopra said the price of mono-grade polysilicon ballooned from $11 per kg in early 2021 to a peak of $44 per kg at the end of 2022. Prices have since declined as over 1 million metric tons of capacity is planned to come online by the end of 2023. 
System costs for distributed solar projects, both residential and commercial, are expected to decline 3% this year, aided by a decline in module costs and advancements in module technology. 
However, Chopra warns that utility-scale system costs will increase about 6% this year on average for projects averaging 100 MW. This is due to a one-year lag in procurement. Additionally, labor rates have risen anywhere from 4% to 10%, and prevailing wage requirements will increase this further, said Wood Mackenzie.
4) US module prices to plummet below $0.30 per watt as tariff dust settles
Once the Biden Administration moratorium on solar tariffs lift, solar cells from China will likely need to pay import taxes to enter the U.S. from June 2024 onward. Pol Lezcano, research analyst for BloombergNEF said large solar manufacturers are preparing for this risk by building over 35 GW of annual wafer manufacturing capacity in Southeast Asia to avoid new tariffs.
BloombergNEF said over 50 GW of tariff-immune annual cell production will be online in Southeast Asia by the end of 2024. This production would be enough to meet the firm’s projected U.S. demand of 42 GW to 52 GW between 2025 and 2030.
Lezcano noted that while capacity will be moved out of China to avoid tariffs, detainments of goods enforced under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act are being released. Customs Border Patrol reports about half the detained products have been released to date. The other half remain stuck in review, and less than 2% have been denied entry.
“By 2025, module prices for the US could fall well below $0.30 per watt, compared with a range of $0.38-0.44 per watt in 2023 and 2024,” said Lezcano. “However, many U.S. module assembly factories will struggle to be cost competitive with best-in-class plants in Southeast Asia, even after lucrative US subsidies.”
5) Uncertainty in degradation
The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC) are two core incentives that support the value of projects. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) warns that the different nature between these two incentives may shape decisions on technology choice.
“The ITC could make more sense for more expensive systems where it is desirable to reduce the payback time—perhaps due to technology and underperformance risk. The PTC, on the other hand, is based upon the power that is produced over multiple years of operation—so it could be more attractive for longer-term system owners in high solar resource areas,” said NREL.
NREL said bifacial technologies were calculated to have a 4.5% to 6.5% gain in annual specific energy yield, which the lab said translates to higher potential values for the technology.
“But the value varies between credits and depends significantly upon the assumed degradation rate. For both tax credits, even just 0.5—1.0% per year lower-than-expected degradation rate could negate any gains that might be expected from the higher initial energy yield technologies,” said Michael Woodhouse, energy technologies economics analyst, NREL.
Follow up for the third and final part of the risk series based on kWh Analytics reporting. Part three will focus on asset operation risks.

EPEAT is a globally recognized and independently validated environmental, social and governance (ESG) and low-carbon standard and eco-label for solar panels and inverters. Achieving the EPEAT for Solar designation demonstrates each company’s commitment to sustainable manufacturing as well as low-carbon supply chains and production technologies, according to the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance.
“Credible life cycle-based ecolabels like EPEAT make it easier for solar developers, investors, and end-users to identify environmentally leading products from socially responsible companies,” said Samantha Sloan, vice president of policy, sustainability and marketing at First Solar.
Project developers and corporate buyers are increasingly seeking more reliable supplies of solar panels made with a low-carbon manufacturing footprint, and free from connections to forced labor. Solar panels bearing the EPEAT label make it easier for customers to identify low-carbon solar products and partner with manufacturers committed to reducing their product’s climate footprint.
“EPEAT will show our customers that we take cutting climate pollution seriously when manufacturing our products,” said Kelly Weger, director of sustainability at Qcells. “This label will give them peace of mind knowing that when they partner with us, they’re supporting a more sustainable future.”
Other Ultra Low-Carbon Alliance members expected to begin the EPEAT registration process in 2024 include:
EPEAT-compliant PV panels are expected to be listed in the EPEAT for Solar registry in the second half of 2023, with additional panels being added over time. This registry will make it easy for buyers to find sustainably-manufactured, low-carbon products when planning projects and power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The rigorous standards of the EPEAT for solar lifecycle based criteria, combined with third-party verification requirements, assures buyers that they can demonstrate their commitment to sustainable supply chains and reduced scope 3 emissions.
Specifying solar panels bear the EPEAT label will send a strong signal to module producers, motivating them to produce sustainably-made, low-carbon products up and down the entire solar supply chain. As producing solar materials in a low-carbon grid is an important element of achieving EPEAT’s low carbon footprint requirements, this signal will also serve to expand PV manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and European markets.
The Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance consists of more than 14 companies across the solar PV production chain committed to the production and deployment of low-emissions PV modules, wafers and other components.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/22/rutgers-university-to-add-15-mw-of-solar-carports/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW JERSEY",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JUNE 22, 2023",Rutgers University to add 15 MW of solar carports,"Rutgers University, the largest public university system in New Jersey, has committed to greening its campuses with the addition of close to 15 MW of solar carport canopy arrays this year.
As part of its Climate Action Plan from 2021, in which the university has a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040, the 6,000-acre plus university system will add 16 solar carport installations by DSD Renewables at its four main campuses and off campus buildings as well.
The carports represent the first initiative of Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway since the 2021 Climate Action Plan was announced, with the solar installations to generate 18 GWh of clean power each year.  The car canopy systems are to be deployed at the following locations:
The carport solar projects are being financed through a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) at no upfront cost to the university. DSD will build, own and operate the solar canopies across campuses upon completion, and provide operations and maintenance services. The Rutgers Division of Institutional Planning and Operations (IP&O) will be the direct offtake counterparty for the clean power produced at a predetermined, discounted rate compared to the local utility.
“It’s an unconventional project in that we are not spending university funds, but accruing significant benefits,” said Frank Wong, assistant vice president, university planning and development at Rutgers IP&O. “The project will significantly reduce our energy costs over time and be a visible sign of our ongoing sustainability efforts.”

Construction is currently underway across several of the university’s parking lots, and the solar carports are expected to be complete by the end of the year. Once complete, the carports will create shaded parking lot coverage, reducing urban heat island effects of surface parking lots. The carports will also provide cover from snowfall and precipitation during winter months.
“Having the opportunity to work with such a well-known and highly regarded university, such as Rutgers, is an honor,” says Kevin Brooks, senior director, origination, DSD Renewables. “This is an exciting portfolio of projects that will provide Rutgers students across five campuses with access to renewable energy, and will ultimately bring the university closer to its sustainability goals while saving money on electricity.”
Climate Action Plan
With an enrollment of 67,620 students, Rutgers first installed solar canopies onto its 33-acre Livington, N.J. campus in 2013.  Currently its Livingston campus generates 1.4 MW of solar from 7,993 solar panels and 8 MW of solar canopies composed of about 33,000 solar panels.
A 2021 assessment of campus solar resources suggested that 26 MW of solar could be built on parking lots and 16 MW on building rooftops.
The university’s CAP report highlights $770 million worth of estimated capital cost investments into on-campus solar generation and off-campus power purchase agreements for solar or wind power, reducing carbon emissions by 116,000 tons and generating $40 million in annual energy savings from lowering its reliance on the local grid.
Rutgers’ clean energy savings includes an $80 per MWh state subsidy under the New Jersey Transition Renewable Energy Credit program, the Garden State’s renewable energy credit (REC) program.
Besides PPA agreements, Rutgers is also reviewing cooperative and community solar developments for procuring solar, in which the university could become a partial owner of the system alongside community members, it said in the report.
Other direct and grid emissions solutions the university is pursuing include:
Rutgers intends to be fully divested from fossil fuel energy resources by 2031, according to its CAP report.
In March 2020, Rutgers became the 22nd member institution of the University Climate Change Coalition (UC3), a coalition of more than two dozen U.S. private and public universities committed to reducing global emissions, including through clean energy and energy efficiency development. UC3 is monitored and administered by Second Nature, a nonprofit group that tracks climate action plans at higher education institutions.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/06/22/better-solar-projections-mean-better-models-and-higher-project-valuations/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MONITORING,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 22, 2023",Better solar projections mean better models and higher project valuations,"Denowatts’ “Digital Twin” software package, paired with its ‘Deno Simulator,’ has earned certification from the industry standard testing organization DNV, affirming that it does exactly what it says on the tin.
The Deno Simulator, a weather station and pyranometer, aims to first determine the maximum potential solar electricity a site can produce under optimal conditions. Then, going forward, it informs the asset owner what the asset’s generation should be at any given moment, based on the site’s current weather conditions and the original capacity testing of the installed project.

DNV released a ‘Capacity Testing & Benchmarking Technical Review’ confirming that the tool’s processes and hardware adhere to industry standards. DNV acknowledges that there are some differences between Denowatts’ tools and other weather station and pyranometer hardware. However, they highlighted that these differences could be addressed through minor adjustments to the settings and standardizing the data readout protocols among project analysts. This would ensure that the Denowatts unit aligns with the industry’s expectations.
Key standards analyzed by DNV include:
Dan Leary, chief executive officer and founder of Denowatts, has established other successful solar companies, including Nexamp and PanelClaw.
The primary unit, the Deno Simulator, is priced at $1,000. The comprehensive package, including gear and services, costs $3,000, and includes a complimentary capacity test report. The hardware package includes a gateway receiver and an antenna. The gateway receiver is located inside the communication hardware enclosure. An antenna connects directly to the remotely positioned Deno Simulator, providing a wireless connection to the gateway.

The package includes a $200 annual service for five years, providing local weather data benchmarking versus actual system output. Denowatts also offers contractor support for the initial installation of the unit and the power plant’s initial capacity testing.
The Deno Simulator is self-powered and measures irradiance and temperature, both key factors estimating the power output of a solar array based on a predefined energy model. This local data is used to create a ‘digital twin’ of the solar array, which is a digital simulation that mirrors the array’s performance based on the energy model. The goal is to achieve a performance index of 100%, indicating the array is performing as anticipated.
Capacity testing serves as a key commissioning tool, primarily used to assess the potential of a specific solar project after construction. Once a solar power plant is completed, the finely calibrated Deno Simulator is deployed nearby. The Denowatts software package then juxtaposes the data from the actual power plant and the Deno Simulator, taking into account collected weather information, such as sunlight and temperature.
Based on this comparison and ongoing data comparisons, the simulator can predict the solar power plant’s future output under varying weather conditions. This could prevent unnecessary site visits by O&M specialists due to transient weather conditions like passing clouds.

The Simulator can also be equipped with a reflected in plane of array sensor to measure albedo, which is useful if the site employs bifacial solar modules.
The unit holds potential for assessing a site’s possible electricity generation, acting as a supplement to the industry’s standard atmospheric data from NASA. According to Leary, one of the primary advantages of a site analysis and project capacity test is avoiding underestimation: “When the electricity generation of a system is under-projected, it can result in assets being underpriced and returns on investment going unrecognized.”
