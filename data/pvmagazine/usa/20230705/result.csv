However, a political rift is expanding.
The research discovered that the proportion of U.S. adults who identify as Democrats and favor the expansion of solar power has remained relatively steady since 2016, fluctuating between 92-94%. In contrast, Republican support has dwindled from 87% in 2016 to 70% in the past year – a considerable portion of this drop occurred after Joe Biden’s inauguration as president.
In 2016, the national support for expanding solar power stood at 89%. This figure rose to 92% in 2019, then decreased to 84% in 2021, before reaching 82% in this year’s Pew polling.

Support from Republicans, especially those with more conservative stances, is markedly lower and declining more rapidly, plunging from 80% in 2016 to a recent 63%.
During the same polling period, support for wind energy decreased from 83% to 75%, even as Democratic support was rising. On the other hand, nuclear energy witnessed an increase in approval from 43%, with support from Democrats surpassing 50% and national support reaching 57%. No fossil sources achieved a national support rate above 50%.
Pew’s survey also explored expectations for the potential impacts of an energy transition – a reduction in fossil fuels and an increase in renewable sources. Nearly 60% of the nation anticipates improved air and water quality, yet over 40% predict no effect, or even a potential decline.
When it comes to the cost of everyday goods, 44% of those polled predict an increase, while 38% expect the reliability of the power grid to worsen over time. The political divide in responses to this particular question was even more pronounced, with swings exceeding 100 points in some responses.
The complexity of public sentiment becomes clearer when considering sources beyond the Pew poll.

A recent analysis of opinions on solar energy in New York found near-universal support for rooftop solar. However, attitudes became more nuanced when considering larger ground mount solar installations. Urban residents typically view ground-mounted solar more favorably, while those in rural areas are somewhat less supportive.
Project size is also a significant factor in public opinion. Solar projects larger than 50 acres, often termed ‘industrial’ solar, face considerably more pushback than smaller projects. In contrast, ‘community solar’ projects – those that sell power locally – enjoy more widespread approval.
The location of solar installations also matters significantly. The New York poll showed strong support for siting solar installations on former landfills, industrial sites, and unproductive farmland, while placing them in forests, or on productive farmland, was met with notable disapproval.

Public sentiment takes a notable turn concerning dollar installations on productive farmland when the concept of agrivoltaics is introduced into the dialogue. A study conducted in Michigan discovered that, much like the Pew poll, the vast majority of individuals broadly endorse further solar development in their communities. The introduction of agrivoltaics into the discussion catalyzes a surge in solar approval, to greater than 80%. Resoundingly, nearly 90% of respondents link their increased support to potential growth in farmers’ income and local economic benefits, highlighting these as key reasons for their favorable stance.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/05/doe-advances-1-billion-of-7-billion-clean-hydrogen-strategy/,"BUSINESS,EMPLOYMENT,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"JULY 5, 2023",DOE advances $1 billion of $7 billion clean hydrogen strategy,"With Deloitte forecasting the global clean hydrogen development market to hit $642 billion by 2030 and ballooning to $1.4 trillion by 2050, growth in the industry will require significant amounts of private capital investment and government stimulus packages.
As part of President Joe Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today released a notice of intent (NOI), which includes a request for information (RFI) to invest up to $1 billion in a demand-side initiative to support Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs).
Later this year, the Biden-Harris Administration will announce the selection of six to 10 H2Hubs projects for a total funding of up to $7 billion in federal funding—one of the most historic clean energy investments in history and a cornerstone of President Biden’s vision to achieve carbon-free grid by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
With funding from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the H2Hubs program will help form the foundation of a U.S. clean hydrogen network vital to reducing emissions from some of the most energy-intensive sectors of our economy, including transportation, industrial and chemical processes.
The announcement will help ensure both producers and end users in clean hydrogen have the market certainty they need to unlock private investment and realize the full potential of clean hydrogen. Achieving commercial-scale clean hydrogen deployment is critical to creating new clean energy jobs and economic opportunities in communities across the U.S. while enabling long-term decarbonization objectives.
“Ensuring America is the global leader in the next generation of clean energy technologies requires all of us — government and industry — coming together to confront shared challenges, particularly lack of market certainty for clean hydrogen that too often delays progress,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “That’s why DOE is setting up a new initiative to help our private sector partners address bottlenecks and other project impediments — helping industry unlock the full potential of this incredibly versatile energy resource and supporting the long-term success of the H2hubs.”
According to DOE’s Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Clean Hydrogen report, the U.S. hydrogen economy has the potential to add 100,000 new direct and indirect jobs by 2030. Clean hydrogen will strengthen American energy independence and accelerate a manufacturing boom that has already created over 800,000 jobs since President Biden took office in 2021.
The H2Hubs initiative provides revenue certainty that hydrogen producers require to attract private sector investment. It will also help meet the needs of end users who often prefer the flexibility to purchase hydrogen on shorter-term contracts and require confidence in the long-term availability of clean hydrogen before making critical, long-term investments.
The NOI seeks public input on the potential benefits and risks, operating models, governance structures, and equipped implementing partners. The notice is informed by DOE’s dialogue with the energy industry, investment firms, nonprofit groups, non-governmental organizations, and public response from the demand-side request for information issued in spring 2022, and from the recent Pathways report.
Funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and managed by DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations with support from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, H2Hubs are a critical component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to invest in America’s workforce, jumpstart local economic growth, and create jobs while strengthening the role of the U.S. in the energy transition.
The proposed mechanism outlined in the NOI will help connect the H2Hubs to prospective purchasers — providing durable demand and sufficient customers for the Hubs while also supporting President Biden’s whole-of-government approach to building a strong clean hydrogen economy.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/07/05/californias-electricity-duck-curve-is-deepening/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 5, 2023",California’s electricity duck curve is deepening,"The phenomenon of the “duck curve” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation (mid-day to afternoon) and peak electricity demand (late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.
The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “duck curve” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to balance the grid.
The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.
Additionally, if more solar power is produced than can be used, operators may have to curtail, or deliberately shut off, solar assets to avoid over generation. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 1.5 million MWh of utility-scale solar in 2020, representing 5% of total production, according to EIA. Solar is by far the most dominant source of energy that undergoes curtailment in the state. EIA said 94% of power curtailments in 2020 involved solar energy.
Curtailments reach a peak in the spring months, where demand is relatively low and solar output is relatively high. For example, in the early afternoon hours of March 2021, an average of 15% of utility-scale solar was curtailed, CAISO data showed as reported by the Energy Department.
EIA also warned that the duck curve scenario also challenges traditional, dispatchable energy sources by making it uneconomical to operate them around the clock. This harm to a given facility’s revenue may lead to a retirement of the facility without a highly dispatchable replacement, the EIA said.
“Less dispatchable electricity makes it harder for grid managers to balance electricity supply and demand in a system with wide swings in net demand,” said EIA.
However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.
“The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets,” said EIA. “Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’s neck.”
Battery energy storage in California has quickly grown from 600 MWh in 2018 to nearly 15.5 GW today, said EIA. Operators plan another 14 GWh of storage capacity in the state by the end of the year according to EIA data, suggesting the solar-plus-battery boom has only just begun.
Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive. 
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.

SDCP, the second largest community choice aggregator in California, signed a PPA for the Arrowleaf Solar and Storage facility project being developed in Imperial County, California. The facility is sited adjacent to Ormat’s existing North Brawley geothermal facility, and is also located within the Imperial Irrigiation District’s service territory.
Under a 20-year PPA, Ormat will supply SDCP with clean power from the new solar-plus-storage facilities. Subsidiary Ormat Nevada operates the 30 MW collocated geothermal power station, which entered commercial operations in 2008.
“This agreement represents a great outcome for SDCP and Ormat and will bring significant value from a solar-plus-storage facility that will strategically utilize the existing interconnection infrastructure that was established for our nearby Brawley geothermal power plant,” said Doron Blachar, chief executive officer of Ormat Technologies.
The solar component of the project will contribute 42 MW of clean energy to the grid, enough to power 31,500 southern California homes. The project’s storage component will provide 35 MW/140 MWh of capacity, enough to provide four hours of electricity during daily peak consumption when solar is not operating.
The battery to be used for the storage facility has been procured from a global supplier at an attractive purchase price, the developer said. Operations are expected to begin in the first half of 2025.
“San Diego Community Power’s mission is to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers across the region,” said San Diego city councilmember Joe LaCava, chair of the CCA group. “The Arrowleaf Solar and Storage project will be a critical component to ensure that, not only are we meeting our ambitious renewable goals, but we are creating quality construction jobs that support the energy transition in our communities.”
San Diego Community Power serves customers in San Diego, Chula Vista, Encinitas, La Mesa and Imperial Beach, Calif., and began enrolling customers in National City, Calif., in April 2023. The program aims to provide local control and consumer choice regarding energy decisions on a large scale. It is one of 23 major community choice aggregators in California, and adds to roughly 10 million customers involved in community choice solar programs across the state.
Ormat is a public power producer based in Reno, Nevada, that constructs and operates geothermal, solar and storage facilities in the U.S., Guatemala and Kenya with 700 MW of total capacity.  The company’s stock traded up 2%, to $81.56 per share, following news of the SDCP power agreement signing.

An international research group has used quantitative models to analyze data about the flow of iron, copper, aluminum, and other precious metals from source to end-use destination in the renewable energy infrastructure value chain to reveal trends and potential risks.
The study found a growing inequality in metal footprints, which are defined in the paper as the total metal ores embodied in the renewable power value chains. The authors said this kind of uneven activity may “hinder the just net-zero transition and climate change mitigation actions” and that there is an urgency “to establish a metal-efficient and green supply chain for upstream suppliers [source countries of metals] as well as downstream renewable power installers for just transition in the power sector across the globe.”
Noting that the amount of metal used in renewable energy infrastructure has increased by 97% in the ten-year period from 2005 to 2015, the paper’s authors examined the flow of metals in seven value chains, including solar, solar thermal, ocean, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal.
They developed a multi-regional input-output model and a value chain decomposition model that are said to enable the analysis of the activity for worldwide regions and individual countries. They sourced data from Exiobase, a dataset used that estimates emissions and resource extractions by industry, developed by a consortium of research institutes in projects financed by the European research framework programs.
The scientists found imbalances within the global value chains studied and attributed them to the continuous outsourcing of metal demand for the renewable power sector to developing economies. “Developed economies occupy the high-end segments of the renewable power value chain, while allocating metal-intensive (but low value-added) production activities to developing economies,” they also stated, noting that some economies are contributing a considerable amount of metal from their reserves to fulfill foreign demand but have only minimal economic benefit.
The academics presented their findings in the paper “Tracing metal footprints via global renewable power value chains,” published in nature communications. The research group comprises scientists from China’s Shandong University, Fudan University, Guangxi University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as well as from the University of Maryland in the United States.
“Our results indicate that the trade structure can be modified to mitigate metal supply risk and consumption inequality along global renewable power value chains (RPVCs) among economies,” they concluded. “Import-dependent developed economies can adjust the distribution of traded goods towards metal-efficient sources.”

The modules are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2028, as demand for First Solar’s technology pushes its orders further into the future.
“Capital Power joins a growing group of project developers that partner with First Solar as a reliable module technology provider that can help de-risk their project pipelines by delivering long-term pricing and supply certainty,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer, First Solar. “We are pleased that Capital Power selected Responsible Solar technology to power its assets reliably, affordably and sustainably.”
Capital Power, committed to net zero emissions by 2045, operates 7.5 GW of capacity across 29 facilities in North America. The company has a mixed asset base of solar, wind, gas, energy storage, and waste heat facilities. It has a U.S. solar pipeline of about 2.4 GWdc.
During Q1 2023, First Solar executed 9.9 GW of contracts and recognized 1.9 GW of volume sold, resulting in a total backlog of 69.4 GW, with an aggregate value sold of $20.4 billion, which implies approximately $0.293 per watt, an increase of approximately half a penny per watt from Q4 2022. During the quarter, First Solar produced 2.36 GW of Series 6 panels, which had an average Watts per module of 467 W.
First Solar’s cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film modules have among the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV module today. The company’s CdTe technology certified a new record in Q1 2023 with a conversion efficiency of 22.3%.
The modules are included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) registry for sustainable electronics, signifying strong performance on metrics evaluating the management of substances in the product, manufacturing energy and water use, product packaging, end-of-life recycling and corporate responsibility.
“Credible life cycle-based ecolabels like EPEAT make it easier for solar developers, investors, and end-users to identify environmentally leading products from socially responsible companies,” said Samantha Sloan, vice president of policy, sustainability and marketing at First Solar.
The module provider is investing $1.3 billion in expanding its U.S. manufacturing footprint from over 6.5 GW of annual nameplate capacity today, to approximately 10.9 GW by 2026. About $1.1 billion was invested in the company’s new 3.5 GW facility in Alabama, and $185 million was directed to improve and expand its original facility in Ohio.
The company also announced an investment of up to $370 million in a research and development innovation center that is slated to begin operating in 2024.
First Solar also recently showcased fully functional, pre-commercial, bifacial thin-film PV modules at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany. First Solar’s research and development teams have reportedly developed a transparent back contact for the module. This innovative feature allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through the back of the module instead of being absorbed as heat. It also enables bifacial energy generation. The manufacturer said that this technology will reduce the operational temperature of the module and increase its specific energy yield.

California-based Complete Solaria, an integrated provider of solar installation solutions using its own 360 to 400 Watt solar modules, plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker “CSLR” by the end of July, subject to closing conditions in connection with the business combination.
Freedom Acquisition is a $250 million SPAC platform established in February 2021 by Tidjane Thiam, Adam Gishen and Abhishek Bhatia. Thiam and Gishen have financial services and investor relations experience from over two decades at Credit Suisse and Prudential. Bhatia previously served as group chief executive officer of insurance firm FWD Group.
Complete Solaria’s public offering via SPAC merger is expected to provide gross proceeds of $376 million, prior to any potential redemptions and payment of transaction expenses, which includes $346 million of cash held in Freedom’s trust account and promissory notes.
According to a June 30 investor relations presentation, Complete Solaria anticipates generating $200 million of revenue this year as a “one-stop shopping model” for residential solar solutions.  The Utah-based company reports a cluster of seven residential solar companies based in and around the Salt Lake City, Utah area, where Sunrun and Vivint Solar also operate.
Complete Solaria is led by Will Anderson, co-founder and chairman of Complete Solar, chief financial officer Brian Wuebbels, the former CFO of NIDEC, GCL Solar and SunEdison, and president Vikas Desai, who founded SunPower’s residential business.
Complete Solaria recently encountered a slow down at its Lehi, Utah semiconductor manufacturing facility, running at half speed of 286 day cycle time in 2022 versus 140 days in 2021. The company retained the services of T.J. Rodgers, former chief executive of Cypress Semiconductors who has also worked with Enphase Energy and SunPower, to serve as executive chairman to scale up Complete Solaria’s manufacturing operations.
In November 2022, Solaria announced plans to merge with installer Complete Solar and float the resulting Complete Solaria business as a vertically-integrated company similar to SunPower. The SPAC merger was announced in October 2022, pending closing conditions for the companies’ merger.
Marathon Capital is capital markets advisor and Cooley is legal advisor for Complete Solaria. Cohen & Company, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley were capital markets advisor and book-running managers for the SPAC, with Paul Hastings as its legal advisor.
