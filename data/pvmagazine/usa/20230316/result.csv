It requires less transmission buildout than traditional, centralized power generation, is more resilient in events that disrupt the grid, and saves land. 
Yet, in December 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decided to pass NEM 3.0, cutting payments for exported solar energy by about 75%, adopting a utility-developed avoided cost calculator to set rates. The decision was justified based on an analysis that suggested non-rooftop solar customers were subsidizing their neighbors that decided to invest in the clean energy transition. 
The provision was unpopular with solar homeowners and prospective rooftop solar shoppers, as it is expected to worsen the return on investment for rooftop solar. ROTH Capital Partners projected that demand for residential solar in California would fall by 30% following implementation of NEM 3.0. 
The decision came following passionate public testimony in opposition to the rulemaking change, and well over a year of protests and pleas to block or delay the change.  
While the CPUC has not addressed NEM 3.0 since the December vote, public advocates and California citizens are still actively opposing it. The latest phase of opposition is led by a coalition of more than 100 groups, which requested the CPUC delay NEM implementation in an appeal this January. The coalition included the Center for Biological Diversity, Protect Our Communities Foundation and the Environmental Working Group. 
California Public Utilities Code § 1708 deems “The commission may at any time . . . rescind, alter, or amend any order or decision made by it.” 
“There’s still time to fix this without going to court,” said Roger Lin, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Failing to consider rooftop solar’s benefits to environmental justice communities makes it harder for these families to afford it, and that’s illegal.” 
The coalition argued that the commission’s decision will harm the ability of environmental justice communities to benefit from solar energy, and requested the CPUC delay implementation until this concern was addressed.  
“Under this plan, the gap will widen between those who can afford solar and those who can’t,” said Lin. 
Read more about the benefits of rooftop solar, and why utilities may be motivated to quash it in a report from the Center for Biological Diversity. 
While some argue the rulemaking decision kneecaps the rooftop solar industry, others suggest that it is a necessary part of the evolution of the grid with distributed energy storage as a feature component.  
“A solar-plus-storage market is already a norm in places like San Diego, and developers should be ready for that trend to continue across the state,” said Pari Kasotia, senior director and head of policy at DSD Renewables. DSD Renewables develops community, commercial, and industrial distributed solar projects nationwide, including in California. 
Motivated by this opportunity to appeal, California citizens took to the phones for several hours on a March 16 call that did not have NEM on the agenda. The callers said that NEM 3.0 opposes state mandates to keep rooftop solar growing, underestimated the environmental benefits of rooftop solar, and keeps the technology out of reach for low-income customers. 
“NEM 3 condemns California to one step forward, two steps back future,” said one caller in the public comment hearing.

In collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the DOE evaluated an advanced planning model that identifies least-cost power-sector investment portfolios accounting for major provisions of both laws. Provisions evaluated include, among others, tax credits for new clean electricity generation, energy storage, and carbon capture and sequestration and a variety of non-tax IRA and Infrastructure Law provisions.
The analysis found that clean electricity as a percentage of total generation could increase to over 80% in 2030 under mid-case assumptions. The low-case and high-case projections place clean energy’s share of electricity generation between 71% to 90%. This is substantially greater than the 41% share emissions-free electricity achieved in 2022.
Under the model, Solar and wind scale rapidly, more than doubling historical maximum rates of annual deployment in many scenarios. DOE now expects 350 GW to 750 GW of new capacity from these two technologies by 2030 depending on future market conditions.
This renewables growth is projected to be supported by 40 GW to 100 GW of new energy storage and a 11% to 24% expansion of long-distance transmission by 2030.
Furthermore, the DOE said clean electricity growth will lower bulk power costs by $50 billion to $115 billion through 2030, saving ratepayers money on their bills. In 2030, the reduction equates to approximately $3 per MWh (5%) to $6 per MWh (13%).
Carbon emissions may decline between 72% to 91% less than 2005 levels by 2030, even with increased total electricity generation. NREL’s research found that IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s power sector provisions lead to the avoidance 600 million to 900 million metric tons of annual carbon emissions. And, power-sector air pollution reductions may help prevent up to 11,000-18,000 deaths through 2030.
From an jobs perspective, the two laws are expected to lead to more than 500,000 new jobs. The laws also target economic prosperity for disadvantaged communities. Among other provisions, the laws include $3 billion for Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and $4 billion under the Advanced Energy Project Credit directed to industrial or manufacturing facilities located in communities historically reliant on fossil fuels.
Fully realizing these benefits requires breaking down deployment barriers and continued technology advancement, said DOE.
“DOE and other federal agencies have been hard at work, implementing IRA and BIL, spurring continual technological advancement and addressing deployment barriers. State, local, and tribal governments, civil society and the private sector also have important roles to play, to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by IRA and BIL. An all-of government and all-of-society approach will help maximize the positive returns from these historic new laws,” said the report.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/16/lightstar-partners-with-farming-conservation-group-to-unlock-agrivoltaics/,"BUSINESS,MARKETS & POLICY,COLORADO,ILLINOIS,MARYLAND,NEW YORK",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 16, 2023",Lightstar partners with farming conservation group to unlock agrivoltaics,"Rural farmland in the U.S. is under attack from climate change and a suburbanizing landscape. Between 2001 and 2016, residential and commercial development consumed 11 million acres of farmland. Another 18 million acres could succumb to new developments by 2040. According to the American Farmland Trust, climate change and extreme weather events make farming and ranching more challenging, with AFT’s research showing a significant swath of rainfed agricultural land will be less likely to support current growing systems by 2040.
And if that was not enough, the U.S. is currently in the midst of an intergenerational transfer as millions of acres of farmland change hands as baby boomer farmers retire, making farmland vulnerable to development as not many children of farmers seek to take the reins on the family farmstead, said Ethan Winter, National Smart Solar Director of AFT at the first Solar Farm Summit, a U.S. agrivoltaics conference held on March 14 in Rosemont, Illinois.
Lightstar Renewables, a Boston-based community solar developer, is partnering with AFT in order to preserve rural farmland for agriculture and community solar development co-located on farmland, also known as Agrivoltaics.
Under the partnership, AFT will use its Smart Solar principles to guide Lightstar on policy, research, and farmer engagement initiatives “to accelerate agriculturally-compatible solar energy development” and promote sustainable farming and ranching practices.
Speaking with pv magazine USA at the Solar Farm Summit, Lucy Bullock-Sieger, vice president of strategy for Lightstar, said the four-year old company has developed 31 agrivoltaic projects out of a 208 MW active development portfolio consisting of community and agrivoltaic projects, while the Magnetar Financial-backed company has a multi-year portfolio of committed projects with 600 MW of total power capacity.

Under the AFT partnership, Lightstar aims to empower farmers with regenerative agricultural practices that includes co-located agrivoltaic solar projects on farmland in New York, Maryland and Illinois. Bullock-Sieger said the northeast-focused developer is talking to scores of rural farmers about the solar opportunity to bolster their cash business and supplement crop yields at a higher growth rate in the coming decades.
The agrivoltaics market is establishing a “compliance mechanism between us and farmers,” Bullock-Sieger said. “We’re not going to put a hunk of steel in the ground and run,” Bullock-Sieger joked about a prior misperception rural farmers had about solar development.
“Five years from now, we don’t want farmers asking, ‘what do we do now that a turnkey project is in the ground?’” said Bullock-Sieger. Lightstar forges a relationship with host farmers by promoting and implementing new seed varieties for crop produce, and offering other vegetation management solutions that could improve the property’s resistance to erosion or climate change factors.   
Building trust with multi-generational family farm owners is based on tax compliance regulations, Bullock-Sieger said, while farmers typically iron out a long-term plan to continue to cultivate from the land for decades to come. Farmers keen on agrivoltaics are often either near retirement age or whose children see the revenue potential from dual-use agrivoltaic applications, she said.  
Like community and utility solar projects, agrivoltaic projects assembled by Lightstar and other developers will typically take a 20-year contractual lifespan in which the developer will continue to actively maintain the facility and farmland property with the owner-operator, Bullock-Sieger said.
In upstate New York, Bullock-Sieger says Lightstar will be developing a 3.6 MW (DC) solar array by early 2024 on a 16-acre plot for DiMartino Farms, a 125-acre family-operated hay and small vegetable farm in Montgomery, N.Y., in the western Hudson Valley region. She said the Hudson Valley development involved children of the farm’s owners stepping forward to preserve the farm’s crop yield. The rural farm also stands to generate new income sources from Lightstar-grown vegetable crops, pumpkins to be seeded, as well as on-site solar arrays to lower the farm’s energy bill.
Dual-use agrivoltaic projects also provide tax revenue at the local municipality level, increase energy independence and grid security.
The AFT is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization formed in 1980 by farmers, ranchers and conservationists Peggy Rockefeller, Patrick Noonan and William K. Reilly, to provide agricultural landowners with environmentally-sound resources, promote land conservation and utilize local solar power resources.
In August 2020, the AFT launched the “Farming Is Our Future” campaign with a goal to double the amount of permanently protected farmland and reduce current loss by 75%. At the same time the nonprofit adopted regenerative practices including Agrivoltaics at scale so that farmers capture more carbon than they emit.  Meanwhile, the AFT set out to bring 600,000 new farmers and ranchers into the market by 2040 based on the intergenerational shift away from farming culture in recent decades.
The AFT recently published a solar leasing guidebook for agricultural landowners for the Pacific Northwest market.
Brian Ross of the Great Plains Institute said the U.S. currently has 5 million acres of rural farmland whose land use is governed at the county level for solar development, presenting a large opportunity for the co-location of agrivoltaic projects over existing farm operations.
On a county wide basis, only 4% of Illinois land is currently utilized for solar development, Ross added.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/16/solving-the-battery-supply-chains-structural-deficit/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"MARCH 16, 2023",Solving the battery supply chain’s structural deficit,"Although demand trajectories vary, experts agree that the global energy transition will be hindered by a structural shortage of critical minerals – particularly lithium, graphite, nickel, copper and cobalt – as early as 2025. This forecast shortage is because many forms of renewable energy generators, transmitters and consumers including electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels require significantly more mineral inputs than their fossil fuel counterparts.
In the U.S., interest and investment in electric vehicles has surged over the last several months in response to President Joe Biden’s “aggressive action to advance our (sic) EV future” with nearly $50 billion investment committed since Biden took office. Indeed, the U.S. has a bold goal for 50% of all vehicle sales to be electric by 2030 – which would be an incredible increase on the 6% of 2022 (according to Motor Intelligence). With a typical electric car requiring six times the mineral inputs of a conventional car, this represents a staggering increase in the quantity of minerals that will need to be mined, processed, and manufactured into batteries.
Although theoretically there are sufficient mineral quantities in the ground, and the U.S. has the political backing to go the distance, a structural deficit exists along the entire battery supply chain that first needs to be solved. From mining and extraction from brines, through materials processing to cathode and anode manufacture, the U.S.’s limited domestic industry simply does not have the time nor human resources to ramp up supply to meet demand following the traditional path. While researchers are rapidly innovating new technologies that reduce our dependence on certain minerals, it will be several years before these innovations filter through to product lines.
To keep the energy transition on track, we must seek to address the battery supply chain’s structural deficit by expanding U.S. production in new and creative ways. This will be especially important given the recent changes to the U.S.’s EV tax credit regime which now requires at least 40% of the value of critical minerals for batteries to be sourced inside the U.S. or from a free-trade partner, meaning fewer imported minerals and parts can be used in designs.
No time for bespoke design
There are several challenges to increasing mineral supply, but the most pressing is how to condense typical project timelines to bring new mining, processing and manufacturing capacity online more quickly.
Historically, we’ve been hooked on bespoke infrastructure design which can take a decade or more to deliver. For context, according to the IEA, between 2010 and 2019 it took an average of 16.5 years to take a mining project from discovery through to first production, with construction taking up to five years! Similar constraints are evident at all stages in the battery supply chain with each production or processing facility requiring complex engineering, investment in the region of half a billion to a billion dollars, and several years to build.
Given the industry has less than seven years to increase supply chain throughput to a point where it can deliver Biden’s ambition for all-electric vehicle sales, we need to rethink the traditional bespoke approach to infrastructure delivery.
Design one, build many
Worley’s response to this is to innovate modular designs from which we can build many plants. Much like the trusty Lego block, while each modular block will be different, they will all share common interconnection points. This has the combined benefit of being quicker to construct but flexible enough so that new technologies and upgrades can be readily assimilated into the plant as they become available in the future. This will also reduce the barriers for the industry when adopting new technologies to help address future market changes such as the declining quality of ore, increases in the use of recycled materials and heightened sustainability standards.
Ultimately, with far fewer bespoke requirements, modular designs are much easier to scale, replicate and disseminate around the world, ultimately fast tracking the industry’s response for more battery supply chain throughout.
This is not entirely new territory as it takes inspiration from the manufacturing mindset embodied by the likes of the automotive, telecommunications and aviation industries as well as our own. Boeing’s move towards standardization within its design and production, for example, illustrate what is possible even in the face of complex engineering. While each aircraft can be customized and modified by the end customer to suit certain requirements, much of the core engineering remains the same – the frame, the windows, the wiring looms, etc. This has allowed Boeing to make production more predictable, repeatable and cost efficient while still being able to manufacture an aircraft from start to finish in nine days. To make a similar approach feasible for the battery supply chain we need to reimagine the design approach to focus on utility, adaptability of standard designs and speed of delivery.
Partnerships and collaborations
A large part of the success of this new design philosophy relies on collaboration from the battery supply chain who will ultimately deliver it; dozens of critical vendors for 4,000+ pieces of equipment. With the right information supported by a collaborative environment, vendors can support this vision of modularity and standardization in their own products. By leveraging vendor’s expertise, we can streamline equipment supply by adapting designs to accommodate largely “off the shelf” equipment which eliminate the time spent designing and manufacturing custom pieces. To bring it all together there is then the need for an experienced “system integrator” – an organization that takes accountability for the overall operating performance and process design, and crafts the participation by various vendors and other parties to align and maximize the contribution by each within their specific areas of expertise.
A simple example of this are the materials handling facilities needed at the receiving and dispatch ends of many such facilities. There are particular requirements for battery materials processing relating to containment of toxic substances and protection from moisture ingress that, with close collaboration from typical vendors of this equipment, can be readily adapted and standardized for this industry – ultimately reducing the need for bespoke design efforts and shortening delivery lead times. More complex examples exist deeper into the plant process – along the same lines and with the same outcomes.
The final piece in this reimagination is to build long-term partnerships with battery material miners, processors and manufacturers who are establishing new facilities in the US to successfully bring this novel concept to market. This is something that must happen quickly if the industry is to stand a chance of meeting Biden’s 2030 deadline. While we are in the midst of the 6th industrial revolution, it is clear that traditional methods of construction for chemical and mineral processing will not get us there in time. The battery industry must blaze its own trail if the US is to contribute at the scale needed to meet the world’s net zero ambitions and lessen the impact of climate change, at pace.
Driving innovation and leading the charge comes with risk, but with the right blend of creativity and expertise, there is always a way to solve even the most complex engineering problems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/16/solar-grazing-methods-a-centerpiece-of-inaugural-agrivoltaics-conference/,"COMMUNITY,MARKETS,O&M,UTILITY SCALE PV,ILLINOIS,NEW YORK,PENNSYLVANIA,TEXAS",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 16, 2023",Solar grazing methods a centerpiece of inaugural agrivoltaics conference ,"Sheep grazers, bee pollinators, solar tracking hardware vendors and small to utility-scale project developers were among a diverse set of groups represented at the inaugural U.S. agrivoltaics conference this week that was located next to a gateway for U.S. travel, Chicago O’Hare International Airport. The Solar Farm Summit 2023’s choice of location, the American heartland, was a focal point of the confluence of attendees and recent policy initiatives promoting the use of projects of 10 MW or less with active agriculture processes. Some of these include sheep and cow grazing, vegetable and fruit production, and various other organic crop produce. 
The first Solar Farm Summit, which took place March 14 to 15, drew an over-capacity filled Hilton hotel, as sheep grazers sat amongst seed vendors and community solar project developers alike. On the first day of the conference, the Summit recorded 460 attendees with printed badges, while speaking with pv magazine USA, executive producer Dan French said the number was likely above 500 strong.  
Most attendees expressed a mixed zeal to disbelief that the emerging solar plus farming niche was really taking off, in the form of a conference and small trade show that is, while many attendees hailed from Corn Belt to Mid-Atlantic region universities sought to learn about the various facets of solutions from energy to seed harvesting. 
Large-scale developer Silicon Ranch, based in Nashville, showed its first mover advantage in using methods of agrivoltaic solutions over the last few years on southeast to midwestern projects which range from 50 MW to 150 MW and above. The conference appeared to draw new entrants to agrivoltaics, such as EDF Renewables and Savion, which have hired agriculture professionals over recent years to branch into the nascent agrivoltaics market.  
Utility-scale sheep 
The utility solar market’s presence at the conference showed the initiative and willingness to promote sustainable farming methods and use agrivoltaics technologies like sheep grazing in large solar development. However, a caveat emerged of the dual-use nature of agrivoltaics, which combines on-site solar arrays and producing crops or livestock underneath panel arrays. As a method of creating farm and energy production from a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) perspective, agrivoltaics is best utilized from smaller distributed generation projects like community solar projects that range from about 2 MW to 10 MW on average. 
Independent power producers and project developers on projects from 100 MW to 200 MW in power capacity will spend $750,000 to $950,000 on average per year to mow grassy fields and hilly terrain where rows of solar panels can stretch as far as the eye can see, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.   
Using solar grazing with the deployment of up to 100 sheep on a solar project site, the use of agrivoltaic solutions would reduce the utility-scale developer’s mowing needs to two mowings per years, and reduce the cost of traditional mowing services to about $200,000 from the use of ewes alone, said Loran Shallenberger, director of regenerative energy operations at Silicon Ranch. 
Shallenberger told pv magazine USA that scheduled traditional mowing is still required for utility solar projects, especially as the size of such projects continues to grow above 200 MW per project. But capital costs that can range up to $1 million on average mowing costs for a large project can be reduced by 20% or about $200,000 from the use of sheep herds or other grazing livestock, he said. 
Solar grazing in its southeast region typically involves two ewes per acre, so a sample 100 MW solar project that sits on approximately 1,000 acres would require about 2,000 ewes to provide year-round grazing services, Shallenberger said.  Silicon Ranch uses ewes on just shy of half of its U.S. solar portfolio, he added.  
Various grazers and sheep herding organizations spoke throughout the two-day conference’s sessions, with various farmers showing capacity of up to a few thousand sheep available for dispatch on a variety of regional 10 MW sized projects in the Midwest, Virginia and Pennsylvania.  
Image: Texas Solar Ranch
J.R. Howard, owner of sheep and livestock rancher Texas Solar Sheep and donning an over-sized bucket hat, conveyed the age-old adage of “everything is bigger in Texas,” remains true even for the nascent agrivoltaics market. A previous West Texas oilfield energy foreman, Howard now says his ranching company manages a sheep count of up to 10,000 ewes, able to be deployed across a variety of solar sites across Texas. 
In partnership with lightsource BP, Howard’s business grazes up to 2,000 ewes at a 260 MW(DC) utility solar project in Lamar County, Texas. Sheep are grazed in groups of 50 on average, while in rare cases 250 to 500 head may be deployed at one time, Howard said during a Solar Rancher’s Forum panel discussion on March 15. 
At the lightsource BP project, the sheep fleet grazes on 18 pastures across the 260 MW project year-round, with the solar panels providing shade and relief for the sheep grazing crew. The global renewable energy business partly owned by BP reduces its service costs and lowers carbon emissions from solar grazing.  
Under grazing agreements, service providers deploying sheep herds on solar sites must adhere to a 24-inch maximum vegetation height on land that is groomed by dozens of ewes, said Silicon Ranch’s Shallenberger. 
While Shallenberger and Howard agreed the use of sheep as an agrivoltaic tool for servicing large project down to rural community projects could cause a shortage of sheep over the next year, they pointed to the resilient nature of the sheep’s ecosystem, and require minimal supervision and fencing systems while grazing quadrants of large projects.  
Canines such as Border Collies are the go-to pick for solar grazing field shepherds, said Howard and Marcus Gray of Gray’s LambScaping, a regional sheep herder in Virginia. With minimal supervision required, Border Collies are typically able to direct sheep back to a paddock or central location, though occasionally Gray will attach a GPS tracking device to his dogs’ collar, if one of his shepherds is guiding a ewe in a far corner of a thousand-acre solar field and can’t be heard.  
Solar grazers said that from community projects located at Susquehanna University to utility-scale solar projects in Texas, annual insurance premiums to cover sheep herds ranges from $4,000 to $10,000 on average, said Caroline Owens from Owens Farms, a Pennsylvania herder managing a 40-head ewe count, and Lexie Hain, director of agrivoltaics and land management for Lightsource bp, a former farmer from Ithaca, N.Y. Byron Komenick, owner of the first U.S. agrivoltaic project, Jack’s Solar Garden, in Longmount, Colo., said in Boulder County his firm pays upwards of $25,000 per year to insure his grazing operation.  
The burgeoning community solar market in New York state could command an increase in sheep husbrandy and livestock promotion as a solar operations and maintenance solution, as the Empire State currently has about 80,000 sheep, Hain said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/16/considerations-for-a-successful-financial-analysis-solar-module-purchase/,"FINANCE,GUEST POST,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 16, 2023",Considerations for a successful financial analysis and solar module purchase,"Consider the two module options below and how you would go about making a selection for a 49 MW DC solar project.
While making a decision strictly based on the dollars-per-watt ($/W) of a PV module may be a general rule for many project developers and independent power producers (IPPs), this approach fails to consider both the effect that module selection can have on balance of system (BOS) costs, as well the long-term impacts of module selection on project revenue.
Maximizing the value of a PV project is a balancing act. Estimated financial returns can change as modules are analyzed based on their prices, energy yield and degradation rates along with BOS costs. Any of these can tip the scale from a low-cost, lower-wattage module to a more expensive, larger-format module — and vice versa.
The secret to understanding how module costs affect project value lies in the formulas used in your financial analysis and your specific installation details. While experienced module buyers are familiar with the steps and considerations to take, even the most seasoned players can benefit from some guiding strategies to navigate the ever-changing procurement process.
Understanding net present value
You can use product data to compare the value of different modules to optimize overall project value. Determining each module’s net present value (NPV) is best. NPV calculates an asset’s costs and projected income and assigns a present-day value, accounting for the fact that money has greater value now than it will in the future, a concept known as the time value of money. NPV is calculated by summing up annual cash flows and discounting them back to today’s dollars. Employing NPV is more valuable than selecting modules based on the lowest cost, or even lowest all-in $/W cost, because it accounts for the total costs and revenue over the asset’s life.
Consider these two optimization levers in your financial analysis:
Real-world proof
While choosing the lowest-cost option or a large format module may seem more attractive, real-world projects prove this is only sometimes true.  In reality, you could be leaving money on the table, as outlined in the examples below.
Case Study #1
System size: 49 MW DC
Racking type: Single-axis tracker
Location: Peoria, Ill.
Table 1 – module options summary

Delta ($)
Even though there was a $2.1M (0.043 $/W) module cost advantage for the 540W module, there was only a $293,000 (0.006 $/W) difference between the two modules in the all-in CapEx costs to build the project. This was due to a $1.8M (0.037 $/W) pickup in BOS cost for the 650W module over the 540W module. The 650W module was also projected to produce revenue that was $1.4 million higher than the 540W module on an NPV basis. When module costs, BOS costs and revenue were combined, the analysis showed a project built with the 650W module would have a higher NPV. In this example, selecting the lower-cost 540W module would have reduced project NPV by $1.1 million.
Table 2 – module, row, foundation & string quantity comparison 
A project built with the 650W module requires installing far fewer modules, tracker rows and foundations. This is largely due to the form factor of the 650W module, but the Voc of the module also plays a role. The 650W module has a Voc of 45.0 vs. a Voc of 49.8 for the 540W module. This allows a maximum string length of 30 for the 650 and a maximum string length of only 27 for the 540s. When considering the physical length limitations of the tracker and the best practice of installing a whole number of strings per tracker row, it’s possible to maximize the number of modules per row by using three strings of 30 for the 650W, but it’s necessary to drop to four strings of 25 for the 540W. As a result, using the 650W results in more watts per row (4.5kW) and requires almost 1,100 fewer strings and over 300,000 less feet of source circuit wiring.
Running performance models for these two modules shows that the 650W module has a yield advantage of 2% over the 540W module. This yield advantage is a result of lower IAM, low light and temperature losses. Based on the energy rate for this project, the project term and the assumed discount rate, the revenue produced by this 2 percent increase in production has a net present value of $1.2M.
The 650W module also has a warrantied annual degradation rate of 0.45 percent, compared to the higher 0.5 percent annual degradation rate of the 540W module. In this case, the additional lifetime energy production that results from the lower degradation rate increases the NPV of the revenue by an additional $200,000. With both factors combined, the 650W module is projected to increase revenue by $1.4M based on NPV when compared to the 540W module.
Case Study #2
System size: 5 MW DC
Racking type: Fixed tilt
Location: Central Massachusetts
Table 3 – module options summary

Delta ($)
Based on the first case study, it’s easy to assume that the best option would be the large-format 650W module. However, this project uses different modules than the first example, so the NPV of the 540W module was higher by $147,000.
Table 4 – module, row, foundation & string quantity comparison
In the first case study, the 650W module had an advantage in effectively using the tracker rows and foundations. Looking at Table 4, the 650W module requires slightly more tables and foundations for this fixed tilt project. This is based on the physical limitations of the racking product and the number of modules that can be installed per table. There is also a difference between the two options in the “modules per string” metric, which is not as large. The result is that the BOS savings for the 650W module are only 0.011 $/W, compared to the 0.037 $/W savings in the first project. Performance models for this project show an energy delta of 0.12 percent, in favor of the 650W module. This, combined with the fact that both modules have warrantied annual degradation rates of 0.5%, results in only a $7,822 (0.002 $/W) revenue delta between the two modules on an NPV basis.
In this case, the BOS improvements and revenue advantage of the 650W module are not enough to offset the low cost of the 540W module.
Don’t leave money on the table
During module selection, it can seem easy to narrow your focus to a simple comparison of the $/W cost of the modules. However, if your view is limited to module costs, you will be unable to account for changes to total project cost and revenue that a more comprehensive analysis would be able to demonstrate.
Gathering data and performing financial analysis can be time-consuming and laborious. It may require hiring additional procurement or engineering staff, contending with limited access to supplier data that quickly grows out of date and vetting the results. The good news is that new technology solutions have come to market to compare available inventory from top-tier suppliers. Such technology that can help perform module technical analysis enables users to make informed decisions in a timely fashion and secure contracts quickly based on pre-negotiated supply agreements.
However you choose to proceed, a proper analysis that goes beyond module cost is critical to making informed decisions to optimize revenue and realize better project returns.

In the white paper, American Solar and Storage Manufacturing Renaissance: Managing the Transition Away from China, SEIA points out that the move away from over-reliance on imports for solar energy is beginning. And while we will not completely abandon global markets and supply chains, the momentum will build to the point where we can reduce our reliance on China for solar and energy storage equipment and raw materials.
SEIA reports that the U.S. has capacity to produce many of the elements that are key to the solar industry: metallurgical grade silicon, polysilicon, steel, aluminum, resins, racking and mountings and other key materials. There is already a modest capacity to produce modules, inverters and trackers, and a limited source of domestic specialty glass. However, other elements have been missing almost entirely from the U.S. supply chain, such as solar ingots, wafers and cells.
The Inflation Reduction Act provides myriad incentives for the build out of U.S. manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities.
Source: SEIA
The buildout takes time, however, and for the next few years we will remain dependent on imports to fuel the rapid deployment of solar energy systems needed for the energy transition.
The largest source of solar cells and modules is currently Southeast Asia, which has manufacturing facilities run by Tier 1 manufacturers that have demonstrated the quality, financial stability, and compliance necessary to underwrite warrantees for their products demanded by U.S. consumers.
While sourcing product from Southeast Asia is preferable to China, it means that the U.S. is still beholden to other countries to help fuel our energy transition. This presents risks, as witnessed by the supply chain challenges faced by Southeast Asia manufacturers over the past few years. According to SEIA, the best way to limit risks and build more resilient supply chains is to significantly expand domestic manufacturing.

Reshoring manufacturing
The manufacturing announcements stimulated by the IRA will amount to what SEIA estimates at 47 GW of new modules, over 16 GW of cells, more than 16 GW of ingots and wafers, nearly 9 GWac of inverters and well over 100 GWh of battery manufacturing (which serves the solar as well as the electric vehicle industry). SEIA also estimates that we can anticipate more than 20,000 tons of annual domestic polysilicon capacity coming back online and a multitude of new investments in tracker and racking capacity. And this is just the start—SEIA forecasts that we will see exponential growth in all of these sectors.
Timelines

As the chart above shows, it will take some time before domestic manufacturing fills in the gaps across the entire domestic supply chain. Polysilicon production, for example, will take until the fall of 2025 before U.S. production will be sold to domestic ingot/wafer manufacturers. And it will be after that that we begin to see any capacity in domestically produced ingots, wafers and cells. In the meantime, U.S. module makers will have to rely on imported ingots, wafers and cells. Similarly, inverter manufacturers will have to import chips, capacitors and transformers before factories supported by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 are commissioned. SEIA notes that it’s essential to allow necessary and ethical imports to continue during this transition period.

As we shore up the domestic supply chain, SEIA cautions that manufacturers will need reliable access to components, materials, and consumables, which will require having multiple sources and suppliers. In the short to mid-term, we will remain dependent on imports, yet bringing more robust solar manufacturing to the United States will avoid some of the risks the industry has faced in the past three years by heavy dependence on imports.
