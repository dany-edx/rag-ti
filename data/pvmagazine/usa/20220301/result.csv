https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/01/gridpoint-closes-75-million-in-funding/,"BUSINESS,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MARCH 1, 2022",Gridpoint closes $75 million in funding,"Intelligent energy network provider, GridPoint, announced it has closed a $75 million strategic capital raise led by the Sustainable Investing Group within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, with additional participation by Shell Ventures.
According to the company, the investment will be used to continue developing its technology platform that makes buildings smarter and more sustainable through data analytics, intelligent automation and machine learning.
The platform in question is a smart building solution, intended to help businesses and the grid exist symbiotically by leveraging data and analytics to identify opportunities for energy savings. It analyzes a business’s energy consumption and feeds back insights into how energy is being used, with an eye for operational inefficiencies.
“We’re a hardware enabled software as a service solution,” said Gridpoint’s chief marketing officer, Melissa Blanken, in a recent appearance on the SunCast podcast. “A piece of hardware goes into a commercial building on site at each site, and that helps manage or orchestrate your building operations around all, your HVAC, as well as your additional grid interactive resources that you might have there on site... So it’s a very low barrier to entry to not only meet energy efficiency goals, but also sustainability goals.”
The full interview with Blanken and Chairman & Founder of GridPoint, Peter Corsell, is available below, and offers a deeper look into the company’s foundation, technology, and vision for its role in the ongoing energy transition. It has historically been GridPoint’s strategy to keep a low media profile, so the interview offers insights not available elsewhere.

Using the platform, businesses can automate and control assets such as lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, and can integrate their sites with the grid. During times of surplus energy, participating businesses with renewable energy systems can supply energy to utilities, generating additional revenue and easing energy supply and demand challenges.
“Our mission is about accelerating the world’s transition to a sustainable energy future,” Blanken explained. “Big, lofty goal, but well worth the time and effort. And how do we do that? We’re out there transforming commercial buildings into a network of sustainable grid resources. So that doesn’t mean just energy efficiency in your HVAC, in your heating and cooling, but integrating in all of the other things associated with a building and taking a whole building approach. So EV chargers, batteries, battery storage, generators, you’re taking into account all of that when you’re thinking about commercial buildings and how you get to that sustainable energy future.”
Gridpoint shares that the funds will also accelerate the deployment of GridPoint’s innovative solutions in more buildings, accelerating the impact of its technology on utilities and energy grids, and a portion of the investment will be set aside to invest in GridPoint’s technology, sales, marketing, delivery, and customer success teams.
Other GridPoint investors include I Squared Capital, Fortress Investment Group, QVT Financial, TOMS Capital, Twenty First Century Utilities, and Kensington Capital Partners.

The funds add on to the $25 million Series A round in October 2021 that was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures.
The company has signed contracts with four automakers, with a pipeline of 25GWh of energy storage over five years. This equates to 300,000 electric vehicles, said ONE.
ONE said the latest round of funding will help it begin the site selection process for its first US-based battery factory. The company said it will also accelerate its research and development in Michigan and San Francisco.
This January, ONE demonstrated the strength of its batteries, creating a proof-of-concept device with 732 miles of range. In another pilot, the company outfitted a Tesla Model S with an experimental battery with 203.7kWh and an energy density of 416Wh/L. The battery was able to power the Model S at 55mph for 882 miles on a single charge, as validated by third party testing.
“ONE’s core principles of doubling the range, decreasing the cost of the batteries and creating a local supply chain, resonated strongly with us at BMW i Ventures,” said Baris Guzel, partner at BMW i Ventures. “Today’s announcement of ONE’s battery factory in the US is an important step for the larger electric vehicle value chain, and ONE has the potential to truly transform the ecosystem.”
The company builds lithium-ferro-phosphate batteries, which forego the need for earth-rare cobalt, said ONE. It currently has two proof-of-concept battery models; the Aries, and the larger Gemini, which was used in the Tesla demonstration.
ONE said it will begin Aries production in late 2022, and will demonstrate a production-level prototype of Gemini in 2023.

In announcing the partnership, the two cite data that an estimated 50 thousand functioning solar panels flow to landfill sites every day, while one billion people worldwide still lack access to electricity. Because of this drastic inequity, Good Sun works to divert solar panels away from landfills and into historically underserved communities.
For its end of the agreement, EnergyBin is leveraging its exclusive member network to pull together solar equipment, monetary donations, and other resources. EnergyBin members and individual solar owners donate cash and solar equipment to Good Sun in exchange for a tax write-off, or offer equipment for sale at deep discounts.
“We understand that non-profits don’t typically have vast resources to allocate toward marketing initiatives to promote their cause,” said Director of Sales & Marketing at EnergyBin, Renee Kuehl. “By leveraging EnergyBin’s resources in support of Good Sun, we can play an integral part to increase awareness of Good Sun’s work among EnergyBin members and the solar industry at large as well as encourage others to get involved in this cause.”
Modules acceptable for donation must demonstrate at least 50% of their rated power, and EnergyBin advises that equipment donors should be prepared to show evidence that second-hand modules have been tested and are in good working order.
To date, Good Sun has served over 2,000 low-middle income families, diverted over 150,000 pounds of solar panels away from landfills, and provided over $300,000 in materials and monetary donations to other non-profits and disaster relief efforts.
Good Sun has also partnered with Habitat for Humanity in 2022, with the goal of installing rooftop solar PV systems on 40 homes for families in need. In addition, the organization plans to donate a 30kW solar system to a northern California watershed protection organization, through a business model of non-profits helping non-profits.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/01/over-90-corporations-and-organizations-commit-to-reducing-carbon-emissions-through-doe-program/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 1, 2022",Over 90 corporations and organizations commit to reducing carbon emissions through DOE program,"The US Department of Energy (DOE) today announced a commitment from over 90 companies and organizations to reduce their carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 through DOE’s Better Climate Challenge.
The Better Climate Challenge builds on over a decade of experience working with partners to set portfolio wide goals and to address barriers to greater energy efficiency though the Better Buildings Initiative. In that initiative, more than 950 organizations work with DOE, and have shared more than 3000 innovative approaches and strategies for accelerating the adoption of energy efficient technologies and practices.
Both the Building Better Initiative and Better Climate Challenge start with the urgency of the climate crisis. “This moment demands action,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. This challenge is aiming to unleash collective solutions from inaugural partners in the including IKEA, Hilton, Harley-Davidson, the Cleveland Clinic, the State of Maryland, among others.
Over the last decade the DOE has depended on public-private partnerships as part of the Better Buildings Initiative. What they are partnering with the DOE on in the Better Climate Challenge is to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to share the details and data to show how they did it. This includes heating and ventilation, cooling, lighting for buildings, cars and trucks in fleets, the electricity, and more.
DOE brings technical and marketing expertise and will  convene peer-to-peer exchanges to facilitate solution sharing across their facilities and fleets. By understanding what works and what doesn’t will help illuminate pathways for emissions reduction that other organizations can follow. If all organizations in the commercial, public, and industrial sectors reduced their US greenhouse gas emissions by 50%, it would save nearly 1.5 billion metric tons of CO2e annually, more than the emissions from every home in the country.
“Companies across America are joining arms to lead the zero-carbon transition through smart, strategic climate solutions that slash building and factory emissions and significantly cut costs,” said Granholm.
In addition to cutting carbon, the Challenge is about supporting communities that are greatly affected by climate change while often not reaping the benefits of clean energy.
“We have a tremendous opportunity to deliver climate justice to disadvantaged communities, lower energy expenses in affordable housing, and accelerate mitigation efforts to protect at-risk communities from natural disasters and the impacts of climate change,” said US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia L. Fudge. Of the organizations stepping up to this challenge, seven are public housing and multifamily partners, representing what Secretary Fudge called “a bright future for more than 40,000 families”.
These partnerships are key to reaching President Biden’s goal of a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 through an equitable clean energy transition.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/03/01/rackless-earth-mounted-solar-provider-earns-funding/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ARIZONA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 1, 2022","Rackless, earth-mounted solar provider earns funding","Erthos is a company built on the concept of “solar simplified, from the ground up.” Its “earth-mount” solar arrays sit flat on the dirt, with no mounts or trackers below. It recently announced the closing of a $17.5 million Series B funding round to scale-up.
The company has an active project pipeline of over 2.5GW.
Prevailing utility-scale solar standards are to use single-axis trackers to increase production throughout the day. Erthos’ model disrupts this standard, instead opting to cut material and maintenance costs, and cut land costs by increasing panel density.
While this model may have been more challenging in the past, solar module prices have come down dramatically over the years. Erthos said at current prices, it is more cost-effective to buy additional solar modules to make up for the loss of efficiency from foregoing trackers.
Capricorn Investment Group, which is known for participation in the Tesla and SpaceX launch, led the Series B.
“We see in Erthos a unique opportunity where simplicity and speed to market is coupled with an enormous ability to effect change,” says Ion Yadigaroglu, partner at Capricorn. “Additionally, declining module prices, increasing steel prices, and rampant supply chain problems are creating enormous tailwinds for Erthos.”
The investment follows on a $7.4 million Series A in 2019, which launched the company and helped it finalize the earth-mount system architecture. It also funded the development of the autonomous cleaning robot, which drives over the surface of the panels to clean them. The company has a 20-year operations, maintenance, and cleaning contract that warrants for less than 1% soiling through the term.

The company said it can install projects in half the time of utility-scale plants, at nearly half the cost, running under $.50/W. Earth-mount solar requires 70% less cable, 70% less underground trenching, and very little water consumption, said Erthos.
The design eliminates the use of gaps between rows and the array is installed as a large, unified sheet, and Erthos said this allows their project to use one third the land area of a conventional utility scale solar design. Since the panels lay completely flat on the ground, Erthos says their projects are resistant to category-four hurricanes.

Solaria introduced the PowerXT panel to the market in 2016, and reports that the high-density module (HDM) produces up to 20% more power than a conventional solar panel. It is constructed using “shingled” solar panels, a technology in which solar cells are cut, overlapped (shingled), and more densely packed into the panel, which Solaria reports provides maximum energy output and optimized shading performance that work especially well on space-constrained roofs.
The 30-year warranty covers parts, power and labor. The PowerXT solar panels are available through solar and electrical distributors in North America.

The extension of the Solaria warranty follows the launch of a 40-year warranty by Maxeon Solar Technologies on its SunPower Maxeon Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) product line. The Maxeon IBC warranty applies to products in many countries throughout the world, but not in the US at this time.

More than half the added capacity came in the “ten sunniest states” in the Southwest and West.
The US Energy Information Administration reported the data, and counts a PV installation smaller than 1MW as small-scale.
Colorado added the most small-scale PV last year relative to its population, adding 45 watts of capacity per capita. Close runners-up were Arizona, California, Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont and Nevada, all adding about 40 watts per capita.
Twelve states added less than one-fifth of that amount of small-scale PV per capita in 2021, and ten more states added less than one-tenth of that amount. That’s despite having good solar potential, as nearly every state has at least 70% of the solar irradiance found in the desert Southwest.
Hawaii maintained its commanding lead in the installed base of small-scale PV per capita, reaching 521 watts per capita. California, Massachusetts and Arizona reached more than half of that amount per capita, while Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey and Nevada all had more than 200 watts of small-scale PV per capita.
State data and regional totals are provided below for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest & Northern Tier, and the “ten sunniest states” in the Southwest and West.
Southeast
The District of Columbia and Florida had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 666MW of small-scale PV overall.

Northeast
Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 1.07GW of small-scale PV overall.

Midwest & Northern Tier
Illinois and Idaho had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 720MW of small-scale PV overall.

Ten Sunniest States
Colorado, Arizona, California and Nevada had the greatest small-scale PV additions per capita. The region added 2.9GW of small-scale PV overall.
