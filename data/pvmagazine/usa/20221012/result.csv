Westinghouse Electric, the company that Nikola Tesla went to work for in 1888, now focuses on providing nuclear and other clean power technologies to utilities around the globe. Cameco, headquartered in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is one of the largest global providers of uranium fuel and reports that it has a controlling ownership of the world’s largest high-grade reserves and low-cost operations..
Brookfield Renewable operates one of the world’s largest publicly traded renewable power platforms. Its portfolio consists of hydroelectric, wind, solar and storage facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, and totals approximately 240 GW of installed capacity and an approximately 100 GW development pipeline. The company recently announced that it was acquiring Standard Solar for $540 million with the potential to invest an additional $160 million to support the business’ growth initiatives. The company has also agreed to acquire Scout Clean Energy for $1 billion with the potential to invest an additional $350 million to support the business’ development activities.
This recent transaction brings Westinghouse’s clean power technologies under Brookfield Renewable’s hydroelectric, wind, solar, energy storage and distributed generation portfolio, and alongside Cameco’s expertise in front-end uranium fuel capabilities. This will further strengthen Westinghouse’s presence in nuclear technology globally and provide a long-term path for the company’s strategic growth to the benefit of customers.
The acquisition of Westinghouse Electric, expected to close in the second half of 2023, adds more clean power technologies to Brookfield Renewable’s portfolio. With Cameco’s expertise in front-end uranium fuel capabilities, this combined acquisition is intended to strengthen Westinghouse’s presence in nuclear technology.
“This is the start of an exciting new chapter for the Westinghouse team and for nuclear power,” says Patrick Fragman, president and chief executive officer of Westinghouse. “We are grateful to BBU for its stewardship and investments that have strengthened Westinghouse’s position in the nuclear power industry, and more broadly in the clean power world, for the long-term. Now we are proud to join Brookfield Renewable and Cameco, reaffirming the important role played by Westinghouse and nuclear power in enabling the world’s clean energy transition and energy security goals.”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/12/watch-omco-solar-talks-growth-inflation-reduction-act-and-made-in-usa/,"INTERVIEW,ARIZONA,FLORIDA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 12, 2022","Watch: OMCO Solar talks growth, Inflation Reduction Act, and made-in-USA","OMCO Solar is a factory-direct manufacturer of solar trackers and fixed-tilt mounts for the community and utility-scale markets. Its experience is built on decades of steel manufacturing, founded as OMCO Holdings in 1955. To date, the solar business has delivered over 9.5 GW of mounting structures worldwide.
OMCO’s manufacturing footprint spans coast-to-coast, delivering American-made solar structures built from 100% US steel to developers nationwide. Considering the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content requirements for projects to take in the full value of solar Investment Tax Credits, OMCO may be well positioned to grow rapidly.
The company recently announced it completed a 650 MW utility-scale portfolio in Florida with engineering, procurement, and construction firm Moss. OMCO also recently invested $5 million in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, bringing total investment in equipment and tooling to $75 million.
Ryan Kennedy, editor, pv magazine USA was joined by Eric Goodwin, director of business development at OMCO Solar at RE+ Anaheim for an interview. Watch below:

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/12/estimate-your-home-solar-potential-with-the-solar-calculator/,"MARKETS & POLICY,SOFTWARE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 12, 2022",Estimate your home solar potential with the Solar Calculator,"More and more homeowners are turning to rooftop solar as energy bills and power outages are on the rise. Whether your goals are cost savings, more independence from the centralized energy grid, carbon emissions mitigation, or all of the above, it is a good idea to have an estimate of what your home’s solar project would look like before you begin gathering quotes.
This is where the website SolarReviews can help, providing both customer testimonials on installers, and a handy Solar Calculator to estimate system size, production, cost, and savings. Based on a few parameters like your zip code, average monthly bill, electric utility company, roof direction and pitch, and desired percent of energy covered by solar, the calculator will generate a suggested system size and project savings over the life of the system.
“It’s a truly open calculator,” Andy Sendy, SolarReviews CEO told pv magazine. “We educate consumers so they can’t get ripped off.” Sendy said there is no reason interested homeowners shouldn’t have full access to the mathematics of solar.
The Solar Calculator is regularly updated with new assumptions based on the ever-shifting electric rates and available incentives and programs in your utility’s territory.
SolarReviews partners with Genability, which actively feeds the latest utility rate and net metering structures into the calculator for up-to-date accuracy. It also integrates energy usage profile data from the Energy Information Administration to estimate building energy use based on different climactic zones across the nation.
“This is the greatest effort that any website has gone through to provide a fully accurate estimating tool which isn’t behind any paywall or registration wall,” said Sendy.
Once you’ve entered the basic information in the calculator, a wealth of information is provided. It will suggest the number of panels and system capacity needed, the expected payback period, 25-year net savings, and list all the federal, state and local incentives you can take advantage of. It will also provide advanced metrics like net present value and the internal rate of return.
After calculation, there are sliders available to tweak the figures for accuracy. You can play with the shading, the inflation of utility electricity electric prices over time, the discount rate, loan financing rates, and choose between median pricing or a customized quote price.
For those interested in battery energy storage, you can select a quote sized to your specifications. The calculator allows users to select a no-battery option, an option that sizes the battery to store surplus energy stored during the day, one that sizes the batteries to cover overnight electricity usage over a typical day, or the largest option, which allows for running key appliances for a given amount of time during a grid failure.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/12/solar-racking-updates-from-the-floor-of-re/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,RACKING,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 12, 2022",Solar racking updates from the floor of RE+,"ChikoUSA put together a striking 90s style DJ booth (see header image). Even their team members were dressed in the appropriate Adidas tracksuits to match the retro excitement. The company advertised their low priced racking equipment. Pricing for ChikoUSA’s systems has dropped well below 10¢/Wdc.
Mechatron Solar was also on display – their gear was a remarkable sight. The M18KD is a gearless Dual-Axis Tracker. Mechatron suggests that the unit produces up to 40% more generation from always facing the sun. The unit has 1,800 square feet of surface area to place modules and the manufacturers suggest that up to 40 kW can be deployed per unit.

This author asked questions about the O&M requirements, the longevity of the units in the field, and the long-term viability of the company. Mechatron suggested that there is no need for O&M, due to the purely hydraulic system that moves the tracker on its two axes. They backed up these claims with data that showed off their trackers’ uptime – over 99%.
Mechatron directed us to their website, where a document from Black & Veatch specifically examined the viability of the company, and its 200 MW/year (~5,000 units/year) manufacturing facility in California.
It’s genuinely cool that here in the 21st century, with our 2 nanometer computer chips, vertically landing rockets, and budding quantum computers, that our favorite, advanced form of electricity generation is being guided by a bag of air. This brilliant design came from a NASA roboticist at Sunfolding.

Due to the air-based distributed actuation, rows can be any length, even as short as two posts. This small size per batch means that they can be installed on uneven terrain, on grades as high as 15-20%, significantly lowering the costs of civil work.
As in previous years, APA Solar had their giant ground screws on display. The group also brought their A Frame unit. We talked about projects in the northeast USA, and about their ground screws, which are regularly used in locations where pile driving is unable to achieve sufficient foundational grip.

APA Solar’s Melanie Garza also mentioned that the A Frame is currently evolving, as the company gets more experienced in hardware deployment. The market should expect an announcement about their platform soon.
Speaking of putting steel in the ground, Gayk’s HRE 4000-W pile driving system was on display. Salesmen at the booth suggested that this unit, along with its smaller and larger siblings (the 3000 and the 5000), and their predecessors, have the highest deployment of all pile drivers used in the solar industry, globally.

Next we transitioned from the largest items on the floor to the smallest of racking components – the Vespr Solar module attachment clip (see Justin Souza’s business card below). The manufacturer suggests that these clips will lower the cost of a solar power project’s labor requirements by 0.5¢/Wdc. This is an enormous savings, considering the diminutive size of the clip!

Another major benefit of the clip is that it is self correcting. If the solar modules vibrate in a wind event, the clip simply moves with the modules – always repositioning itself into a holding position. This is in contrast to nuts and bolts, which must be repeatedly spot checked and torqued – not only during construction, but also many times over the course of the project’s life (and especially after strong wind events).
Vespr has validated the clips’ static and dynamic mechanical performance, and demonstrated their effectiveness via sites they deployed in upstate New York.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/10/12/sunrun-completes-successful-residential-virtual-power-plant-in-new-england/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 12, 2022",Sunrun completes successful residential virtual power plant in New England,"Sunrun recently completed its first successful season running a residential Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in a wholesale capacity market, what it says is a first-of-its-kind in the country.
In 2019, Sunrun won a bid into the Independent System Operator – New England (ISO-NE), the region’s grid operator and one of the largest wholesale electricity markets in the United State, to participate in a VPP with its home solar and battery storage systems connected to the grid. Sunrun won against centralized fossil-fuel power plants, which signified a shift to local, clean energy.
In a recent article, Achieving a zero-carbon grid: Opportunities in virtual power plants, Jigar Shah explained that A VPP is really an aggregation of distributed energy resource (DER) technologies. Not only can solar homes with batteries be connected to the grid, but also electric vehicle charging, grid-interactive appliances, and more. What ISO-NE and other grid operators do in a VPP is to automatically adjust the DERs that are aggregated, so they provide clean energy, reliability, and grid services. “VPPs not only open the grid to a whole new utility-scale, behind-the-meter supply, but also coordinate disparate DERs into holistic, demand-flexible resources,” Shah wrote. The benefit to the operator is the ability to use that aggregated energy, meaning that they don’t have to invest in additional capacity and infrastructure to serve a peak load. And that peak load is going to increase as we move to all-electric. The benefit to the solar homeowner is that they can receive compensation for their service.
Sunrun reports that during the summer months of June through August, its New England VPP sent more than 1.8 GWh of energy back to the grid. Thousands of Sunrun home solar systems across New England exported excess clean solar energy during the peak demand window of 1p.m. to 5 p.m., effectively reducing overall energy demand and relieving stress on the region’s energy grid, while reducing reliance on fossil fuel plants. Additional benefits are a reduction in energy costs across the region, along with resilience at a time when some grid operators have to issue energy conservation warnings.
“It is tremendous that we are able to work with ISO-NE to integrate local home solar and battery systems into the wholesale markets, and we thank them for their leadership,” said Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun. “This is a wonderful example of radical collaboration and demonstrates the importance of every market operator leveraging local clean energy resources to solve capacity constraints and grid reliability. As more severe and frequent heat waves, arctic freezes and other climatic events continue to stress our nation’s grid, we strongly encourage grid operators, utilities and policy makers alike to leverage these amazing solar energy resources.”
In an August report, ISO-NE detailed how home solar helped keep wholesale system demand below the average forecast throughout the July heat wave, despite the region’s heat index hitting 100 degrees or more. Now ISO-NE’s customers head into the winter months and heating season—a time when VPPs can demonstrate that local solar and batteries can deliver value to wholesale markets across the country and reduce grid costs for all.
