According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), West Virginia was the second-largest coal producer in the nation in 2020 and accounted for 13% of U.S. total coal production, and coal accounted for 88% of the state’s electricity net generation. West Virginia also produces a lot of natural gas. In 2020 it was ranked fifth in the nation for natural gas production, with 95% of it coming from shale wells. And while some parts of the country are weaning themselves off of fossil fuels, natural gas production in West Virginia has increased tenfold in ten years, amounting to nearly 2.6 trillion cubic feet in 2020. With a zest for fossil fuels, the state’s total crude oil production reached an all-time high of 20 million barrels in 2020, also more than 10 times greater than a decade earlier.
As far as clean energy use goes, hydroelectric and wind provided about 6% of West Virginia’s energy needs in 2020, according to EIA, while solar provided only .04%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
 

With only 20 MW of solar installed, West Virginia is currently ranked 48th in the nation for solar energy installations. But it doesn’t have to be this way. The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, sees West Virginia as a prime location for future solar development. “As the world transitions to a low-carbon future, solar energy is an important opportunity for West Virginia to continue serving as a domestic energy powerhouse,” Eriks Brolis, the director of TNC in West Virginia’s Nature and Economy Programs, told pv magazine.
The Environmental Protection Agency has long recommended that Superfund sites, such as abandoned mines, are appropriate for renewable-energy projects. Investing in renewable energy can lead to strengthening and diversifying West Virginia’s economy, according to the report West Virginia’s Energy Future, issued by the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at the West Virginia University College of Law. The report concludes that continued dependence on coal has many downsides economically, environmentally, and from a health standpoint, while a move to renewables has many benefits, just a few of which include job creation, a diversified economy, and health.
Solar policy
In 2020 the West Virginia legislature passed SB583 for the further development of renewable energy resources. The Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE), maintained by the NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University, also lists the 2012 legislation (HB 2740) that restricts homeowners associations from prohibiting solar energy systems on homes, although it leaves the door open for associations to vote to prohibit or restrict solar use.
Joe Manchin, Senator from West Virginia, thwarted efforts to pass the initial Build Back Better climate plan, but he was instrumental in the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Despite the fact that the ACT contains $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures, the Act provides further investments in fossil fuels—a fact that Manchin touts on his website:
… The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 invests in the technologies needed for all fuel types – from hydrogen, nuclear, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage – to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible. It is truly all of the above, which means this bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels. It invests heavily in technologies to help us reduce our domestic methane and carbon emissions and also helps decarbonize around the world as we displace dirtier products.
The tide may be turning
But there is hope, and the tide may be turning. While West Virginia is not home to any currently operating utility-scale solar installations, when EDF Renewables’ 92.5MW Wild Hill Solar project is complete, it is expected to be the largest in the state. It will then be eclipsed by a 250 MW project by SEVA WV, to be built on the site of a former coal mine. Total project cost is estimated at around $320 million, which is considerably more than the $54 million in total solar investment in the state previously, according to the SEIA. FirstEnergy Corp., a utility serving West Virginia, recently announced that it will permanently retire a coal ash facility will build a 6 MW site as part of a larger 50 MW solar portfolio.
Last time, the pv magazine tour of the 50 states of solar took us to Maryland, and next we will continue to travel through south Atlantic, stopping off in Virginia.

The program pays significantly higher rates for electricity than the program in which Ohm’s customers are enrolled. Ohm communicated this after Tesla’s Virtual power Plant got big headlines for participating in the August 17th California Flex Alert.
In a Twitter thread and in a blog post, OhmConnect points out that the company had over 200 MW of available capacity, capable of delivering over 1 GWh of demand response during the 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. PST. However, the state requested only 27 MWh of this available power – for which it paid 21.9¢/kWh.

Ohm notes that under ELRP, ‘millions’ of energy users – like the Tesla VPP participants – were paid $2/kWh during the five hour event. That’s more than nine times what Ohm’s customers were paid.
OhmConnect has more than 219,000 customers. Since July 1, those customers have delivered 450 MWh of demand response across 20 events. The company says they’ve met more than 99% of over requests from CAISO utilities during that period.
Tesla Powerwall owner and VPP participant @mr_calico posted this image to Twitter during the flex event:

This image comes from the user’s Tesla mobile app. The screenshot shows that this unit is part of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company VPP, and that 2,342 homes are participating, providing just over 16.6 MWac of capacity.Various other images found online show that the total capacity and number of participants vary during the Flex event.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/24/toyota-and-nrel-partner-to-develop-mw-scale-fuel-cell-systems/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,COLORADO,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 24, 2022",Toyota and NREL partner to develop MW-scale fuel cell systems,"Toyota Motor North America announced it is partnering with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to construct, install, and test a 1 MW proton exchange membrane fuel cell power generation system at the NREL Flatirons campus in Arvada, Colorado.
The program is a 3-year, $6.5 million project funded by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, part of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
The 1 MW system integrates multiple Toyota fuel cell modules to create a dispatchable stationary power system. In a previous partnership between the two, NREL demonstrated the use of an automotive fuel cell system to provide carbon-free power for a data center. This new test system is about 15 times the size of the previous test and is capable of both direct current and alternating current power output.
Toyota has been developing fuel cell technologies for over 25 years, largely in the light duty electric vehicle space. Toyota will provide the fuel cell modules and is partnering with systems integrator Telios for the design, balance-of-plant, and build of the system for delivery to NREL. Toyota developed a control system to manage operation of the modules and maximize efficiency and system life. Toyota said the system’s simplified design makes it a suitable candidate to be a drop-in replacement for conventional generators.
“Achieving carbon neutrality requires all of us to explore new applications of zero-emission technology, including how that technology will integrate with other systems, which the project with NREL will identify,” said Christopher Yang, group vice president, business development, fuel cell solutions, Toyota. “The application of our modules in deployments of this magnitude shows the scalability of Toyota’s fuel cell technology, whether it is a single fuel cell module for one passenger vehicle or multiple systems combined to power heavy-duty equipment.”
NREL will stress-test and push the operational boundaries of the system to identify performance limitations and degradation. The research project will also include an assessment of system performance when integrated with energy storage and renewable energy generation systems like solar and wind.
“We will study the scaling of PEM fuel cell systems for stationary power generation to understand what the performance, durability and system integration challenges are,” said Daniel Leighton, an NREL research engineer and principal investigator on the project. “This fuel cell generator system also creates a new megawatt-scale fuel cell research capability at NREL.”
The fuel cell generator is part of NREL’s Advanced Research on Integrated Energy Systems (ARIES) at the Flatirons Campus. The system includes a 1.25 MW PEM electrolyzer, 600-kg hydrogen storage system and 1 MW fuel cell generator. The fuel cell generator system will be installed this summer, and the full system will be commissioned later in 2022, said Toyota.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/24/solar-and-home-battery-program-will-aggregate-35-mwh-this-year/,"BUSINESS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,IDAHO,UNITED STATES,UTAH",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 24, 2022",Solar and home battery program will aggregate 35 MWh this year,"Over 2,000 customers are enrolled in utility Rocky Mountain Power’s Wattsmart Battery Program, a model for selling grid-interactive solar and utility controlled residential batteries. The program is an alternative to solar “grid defection” or going off-grid and eliminates reliance on net metering.
ES Solar, a solar installer, and sonnen, a residential battery provider, have led efforts to dispatch the utility’s program, which spans Utah and has recently entered Idaho. The program is expected to bring up to 35 MWh of grid-interactive battery capacity online this year.
Rocky Mountain Power gradually phased out its solar net metering subsidy to instead replace standalone solar with solar plus energy storage. The Wattsmart program is described as a pro-community and pro-grid model for delivering reliable renewable energy.
ES Solar currently has a 98% battery attachment rate on new solar sales as part of the Wattsmart Program. The company said it is on track for continued sales growth with goals to install an estimated 1,500 additional customers by the end of 2022 and more than 5,000 in 2023. It is also engaging with existing solar customers to retrofit batteries and add them to the aggregation program.
The utility Rocky Mountain Power has direct control over the battery fleet and can dispatch it on-demand to meet grid conditions with daily, dynamic solar time shifting and directed load curtailment, plus frequency response and directed solar grid injection when the grid needs power, as opposed to when it is sunny.
“As Rocky Mountain Power’s battery program grows, ES Solar is succeeding in overcoming the complex concepts and challenges associated with effectively integrating residential solar + storage into the broader energy system,” said Blake Richetta, CEO at sonnen. “As this radical model expands into thousands of new homes, so does the use of batteries for the betterment of individuals, society and the environment, which is the ultimate purpose of a solar battery.”
In a report published by the University of Otago in New Zealand, researchers found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% for peak shaving.
The researchers said the results make a case for coordinated battery deployment at the street or building level for multiple economic benefits. These benefits include the potential reduction in energy storage cost for homeowners (who could buy a smaller unit), benefits to the grid in easing demand and load related strains, and benefits to solar developers who can add another value chain to their operations by facilitating these grid services.
As an example, if peak shaving occurred for demand above 3 kW per house, deploying batteries individually for 20 houses would require 120 kWh of storage.  By contrast, deploying batteries collectively would only require 7 kWh, the researchers said. Sharing batteries or having one battery per 20 houses would be a less expensive approach to providing these services, they said.
In existing and new Wattsmart markets, ES Solar will establish reselling channels with other regional solar contractors and replicate their smart, utility-controlled battery business model throughout the industry.
“Our team emphasizes the need for more than just rooftop solar to drive the clean energy transition and we want to do more than lead this transition, we want to empower other contractors to follow in our footsteps,” said Nic Evans, vice president of strategic partnerships at ES Solar. “Through this forward thinking approach, we hope to elevate our beloved solar industry, ‘all boats will rise.’”

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/24/ten-ohio-counties-have-banned-large-scale-wind-and-solar/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,OHIO",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 24, 2022",Ten Ohio counties have banned large scale wind and solar,"Ten Ohio counties have banned large-scale wind and solar farms, and two more are currently considering a ban. This was enabled by Ohio putting into law SB 52 in the fall of 2021.
This news was brought to the attention of pv magazine USA by local reporters at the Ohio Capital Journal. The list of counties that have officially banned wind and/or solar energy is as follows:
The Journal notes that Ottawa & Delaware Counties are discussing the topic as well.
Allen County’s ban affects essentially the entire county minus some downtown areas, according to the map provided on the county website.

The specific language in SB 52 that gives control over the local jurisdiction is:
Sec. 303.58. (A) The board of county commissioners may adopt a resolution designating all or part of the unincorporated area of a county as a restricted area prohibiting the construction of any or all of the following:
(1) An economically significant wind farm;
(2) A large wind farm;
(3) A large solar facility.
A “large solar facility,” per the definitions of SB 52, is defined in section 4906.01 of the Revised Code: (G) “Large solar facility” means an electric generating plant that consists of solar panels and associated facilities with a single interconnection to the electrical grid that is a major utility facility.
None of the state level documents reference specific size limits for solar farms. Allen County’s ban notes that landowners “have the right and ability to contract with wind and solar companies for operations under 50MW.” The county’s meeting minutes note that while many residents support wind and solar, they reject large industrial facilities.
Logan County also says that above 50 MW is banned, while also placing restrictions on projects 5 to 50 MW.
Notably, many Ohio politicians – all the way up to the Governor’s office – are embroiled in a bribery scandal implemented by coal facility owners. Tens of millions of dollars were paid to various politicians and intermediaries to implement laws that gave billions in incentives to coal and nuclear facilities.
In terms of popularity, rooftop solar is highly supported by mostly everyone. Support falls off sharply for any solar on the ground, however, some ground solar was better received than others.

Research in New York State suggests that support shifts as solar power facilities approach approximately 50 acres. Larger facilities that sell all of their electricity into the transmission market are given less support, whereas facilities defined as ‘community solar,’ and do not cross over multiple parcels, have higher levels of support.
The State of Ohio is currently developing laws for community solar, though none have yet been implemented as law.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/24/california-extends-solar-property-tax-exemption-missouri-does-not/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA,MISSOURI",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 24, 2022","California extends solar property tax exemption, Missouri does not","Property tax exemptions are an important way for states (and towns) to promote the use of clean energy, by not taxing the value added to the property through the installation of solar. The California State Legislature recently approved an extension of its property tax exemption that was already in place; the Missouri Supreme Court put an end to the exemption that had been in place for nearly a decade.
In California the property tax exclusion has been extended for two years, decreasing what some may see as a penalty for going solar. The State of California has faced many obstacles in the past year, most notably the net metering proposal and grid access charge. The Net Metering 3.0 proposal has been put on hold by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC, but if enacted, would essentially cut payments made by utility companies to rooftop solar owners for exporting their excess solar production back to the grid. The provision that drew ire from solar proponents was the grid access charge, an $8/kW solar capacity charge per month, which experts called a “tax on the sun.” The charge would apply to all solar customers, regardless of whether they have grid-supporting technology like battery energy storage. So in a time of uncertainty for California solar users, the recent exemption extension is seen as a positive.
“The Legislature’s action to extend the solar property tax exclusion is a critical step to ensure California remains at the forefront of America’s clean energy transition,” said Rick Umoff, senior director and counsel, California, at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “Since the state instituted the exclusion, California’s solar market has grown to be the largest in the nation, employing over 70,000 people and driving more than $70 billion into local economies statewide.”
The bill now goes to Governor Newsom’s desk to be signed into law.
On the flip side is Missouri. A state ranked 35th in solar installations, which is currently receiving only 0.72% of its electricity from solar (according to SEIA), has added a deterrent to the clean energy transition by ending the solar energy property tax exemption that has been a law since 2013. According to a database maintained by the Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University, 39 states and the District of Columbia offer varying degrees of property tax breaks for solar energy systems. Some states leave it up to individual towns. This ruling follows a series of discussions held last year on proposed fees for residential solar customers. The fees were introduced as part of HB 539, legislation from Rep. Jeff Knight that would require customers using solar panels to pay a grid access fee for customers who sell generated energy back to their utility.
The good news, however, is that the State of Missouri recently put two pro-solar laws into effect. One is Senate Bill 745, which makes solar purchases exempt from sales taxes and Senate Bill 820 prevents homeowners associations from banning solar.
