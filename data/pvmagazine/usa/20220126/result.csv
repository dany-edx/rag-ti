This is the first solar project application to receive this status under the state’s new Section 94-c law. Once completed, the project would be the state’s largest solar facility.
ORES was established by Section 94-c, tasked with administering expedited consolidated review and permitting for large-scale renewable energy projects in the state.
“The establishment of ORES and the 94-c permit process underpins the state’s commitment to support sustainable power, and we’re fortunate to be in position to use it to bring clean, homegrown electricity to Genesee County. We are encouraged both by the transparency brought to the permitting process by ORES and the comprehensiveness of that process,” said Harrison Luna, Cider Solar Farm project developer.
The permitting application for Cider was indeed comprehensive, comprised of 6 bound volumes and nearly 100,000 pages of data and analysis evaluating the project’s impact on the surrounding communities. A large range of surveys including environmental, cultural, land use, and socioeconomic studies were submitted with the application. The application called for reporting on expected impact to wetlands and streams, wildlife habitat, traffic patterns, cultural resources, noise and vibration, aesthetic impacts, and site security, among other studies.
The project, if approved, would be built on 3,000 acres, providing enough power to supply 120,000 average New York homes.
Hecate, headquartered in Chicago, began its business in 2021, and has over 40GW of in its development pipeline, including several projects in the Northeast US.

According to the two companies, the deal was pursued as part of an ongoing joint effort to strengthen the North American battery supply chain, from key materials to cell and pack manufacturing for electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
The move has also been painted as the natural evolution of the two companies’ existing relationship. Novonix and Kore first collaborated in 2019, when the parties entered into testing agreements to focus on validation and development of KORE Power’s battery cell technologies.
Once the deal reaches final approval, Novonix will acquire an approximately 5% stake in Kore Power and will become the exclusive supplier of graphite anode materials to KORE Power’s large-scale battery cell manufacturing facility in the US. Kore currently has an annual production capacity of 2GWh and expects to expand to a total annual capacity of 18GWh by the end of 2030.
This jump in production capacity is expected to be facilitated by Kore Power’s plans to build a 12GWh manufacturing facility in Buckeye, Arizona to support the local market need for battery cells and systems. This facility will need close to 12,000 tonnes per year of graphite anode material when fully operational, which will be supplied by Novonix.
Novonix is planning a new facility of its own, with the company announcing in July 2021 plans to purchase and retrofit a 400,000+ square foot plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee to accommodate their planned production of 8,000 tons of anode materials.
The company said this phase of growth will support the production of anode materials that can supply lithium-ion battery packs for over 100,000 EVs. The expansion plan will bring Novonix’s annual anode material production capacity to 10,000 tons annually by 2023. 
Novonix also has supply agreements underway with Sanyo Electric of Japan and Samsung of South Korea, both major international manufacturers of EVs and energy storage systems worldwide.

The storage system that will be fulfilling this agreement is REV Renewables’ Tumbleweed project, set to be a CAISO grid-connected, lithium-ion battery storage resource located near Rosamond, in Kern County, California, with an expected online date of 2026. The participating agencies for this project are CleanPowerSF, Peninsula Clean Energy, Redwood Coast Energy Authority, San Jose Clean Energy, Silicon Valley Clean Energy, Sonoma Clean Power Authority and Valley Clean Energy.
“Long-duration energy storage is a vital resource, needed to amplify the value of renewable power, and accelerate California’s shift to a clean, reliable and affordable grid,” said California Community Power Board Chair and Silicon Valley Clean Energy CEO, Girish Balachandran.
California Community Power said the Tumbleweed project will be constructed under a Project Labor Agreement, assuring prevailing wages and use of apprenticeship programs and is expected to create dozens of new jobs.
The project was procured under a Request for Offers put forth by California Community Power members seeking to procure cost effective and viable long-duration storage resources in Oct. 2020.
Rev Renewables was launched in August 2021 as the energy storage development, acquisition, and operations arm of LS Power. As part of the launch, Rev took over LS Power’s 2.4 GW portfolio of operating solar, storage, and wind projects, which is comprised of includes 25 solar power facilities across 14 states with a total capacity of 467 MWdc/365MWac); a California-based battery storage portfolio (set to be 615 MW by the end of 2022), a 1,620 MW pumped storage hydro portfolio in the mid-Atlantic region of PJM; and 132 MW of wind assets.

The Power Flex program allows SCE customers to earn incentives by exporting some of their PV-generated electricity stored in batteries back to the grid when it is experiencing a power shortage. Customers are paid for their participation while also helping the community resist power outages. 
Generac Grid Services will deploy its Concerto platform, a distributed energy resource management system (DERMS). Concerto detects spikes in demand that might otherwise require the activation of a fossil fuel plant. The software signals the batteries to automatically dispatch clean energy based on real-time grid conditions. 
“With increasing frequency, homeowners are installing solar plus battery storage systems to protect against power outages caused by factors like extreme weather or wildfires,” said Bud Vos, president of Generac Grid Services. “This program lets homeowners gain further benefit from these systems by orchestrating their collective energy flexibility into a VPP that directs power flow from where it’s available, to where it is needed, precisely when it is needed most.”

In September, Generac announced the release of two new models of microinverters with single-module and dual-module configurations. The two-module inverter is rated to 720W. 
The microinverter product release extended Generac’s move into the residential solar market. The company was already participating in the sector, offering the PWRcell battery series.  
The PWRcell battery can scale from a 3-module, 9 kWh capacity, 4.5 kW output, to a 6-module, 18 kWh, 9kW output. If more storage is needed, multiple PWRcell battery cabinets can be integrated into a single Generac PWRcell inverter for up to 36 kWh capacity and 11 kW continuous backup power. The PWRcell string inverters feature 7.6 kW and 11.4 kW models, with peak efficiencies of 97.3% and 97.7% respectively.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/26/massachusetts-to-install-solar-noise-barrier-along-highway/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,MASSACHUSETTS",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 26, 2022",Massachusetts to install solar noise barrier along highway,"The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) is launching a highway solar noise barrier project, which it says is the first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.
In 2015, Ko-Solar and its partners approached MassDOT to discuss the concept of photovoltaic noise barriers (PVNBs).  MassDOT has agreed to this pilot PVNB project along Interstate 95 in Lexington, Massachusetts. The existing noise barrier will be retrofitted into a PVNB, which will be built and financed in partnership with Solect Energy, a Massachusetts-based solar energy provider.
For procurement and contracting of the project, MassDOT will make use of its membership in PowerOptions, an energy-buying consortium in New England.  Solect Energy will finance, install, monitor, and maintain the project. MassDOT plans to use the results of the pilot, including information about noise impacts, maintenance, cost, and community perception, to determine the feasibility of PVNB applications elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Progress on the project suffered some delays in part because of changing Massachusetts Solar Development Incentive Programs; SREC to SMART.
The PVNB will be on the north side of the highway, and will measure 3,000 feet long, 20 feet tall, and is constructed of reinforced concrete. The retrofit PV system capacity is expected to be 637.5kWdc, with an estimated 802,000kWh to be generated annually, or the equivalent of supplying 120 homes per year with electricity, avoiding roughly 1.4MM tons of CO2 emissions.
In partnership with Ko-Solar and its partners, MassDOT solicited input on the project from abutters and other Lexington residents through letters to those living near the project site, a public meeting, and meetings with other stakeholders, as 100% support was required to move forward. All votes were in support of the pilot project. An outcome of the public input process was to require that noise level monitoring would be part of the pilot program. Desktop noise modeling suggests there may be a slight improvement or even a reduction in noise levels for the abutters.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/26/venture-capitalist-sees-billion-dollar-opportunities-for-solar-and-storage-innovators/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,HAWAII,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JANUARY 26, 2022",Venture capitalist sees billion-dollar opportunities for solar and storage innovators,"Rapid changes are under way for local solar and storage, as innovations drive down costs and create new markets for hardware and services, says Bill Nussey in the book Freeing Energy.
The former technology CEO and venture capitalist describes dozens of local energy opportunities, projecting that each represents a market of at least a billion dollars of annual revenue.
Nussey developed his thinking through interviews with hundreds of solar and storage industry participants. While many of the technologies he describes will be familiar to pv magazine readers, his public assessment that they represent billion-dollar opportunities is new.
Nussey says he wrote the book for the “ten thousand innovators needed” to speed the local energy transition. Even so, people already working in the industry are likely to find Nussey’s vision for the growth of local energy engaging, along with the “shop talk” throughout the book.
Nussey also presents a few innovation opportunities related to large-scale solar, arising from overbuilding of solar farms, or sizing them to power short winter days. Overbuilt solar farms will produce “cheap excess summer electricity” that will “spawn massive new industries” that operate each summer, Nussey says, such as desalination, indoor agriculture, or production of hydrogen and ammonia.
In a nod to policy, Nussey calls for “immediate attention” to slashing soft costs for local solar and storage installations—which helped Australia reach 20% residential solar uptake; instituting dynamic customer pricing to reduce electricity bills; and requiring new buildings to be ready for solar and storage installations.
Utilities in the future
Nussey says that an excess kilowatt-hour from rooftop solar is worth whatever a neighbor would otherwise pay the utility for a kilowatt-hour, “minus a small fee for transaction processing and using the grid for delivery.” Thus one of the billion-dollar opportunities Nussey foresees is transactive markets for electricity trading.
Continuing cost reductions, Nussey says, will make “local energy” the best way to provide most residential and commercial energy for the 70% of Americans who live in suburbs and rural areas.
Already cost reductions have led Hawaii to “embrace batteries” and “redefine the utility’s role as a backup provider,” Nussey says, calling Hawaii’s experience a “postcard from our future.”
In the long run, no matter how much utilities spend on lobbying, Nussey says, ultimately they will be unable to “withstand the pressure” from customers who will be “unwilling to pay two or three times more” for electricity than it costs to generate electricity themselves, or to buy electricity from a neighbor in a local market.
“The political winds will shift,” Nussey predicts, estimating that utilities have a 10-year window to “embrace local power” or else likely be “absorbed into more forward-thinking” utilities.
Stories
To support his views on electric utilities, Nussey presents examples of disruptive technologies displacing incumbents, such as ridesharing services outcompeting taxi monopolies. Throughout the book, he also recounts stories drawn from the history of technology, to help the reader grasp how the technology environment for local energy is changing.
Solar advocates may find a resource in the book’s arguments dispelling several “myths” raised by solar opponents. Nussey found only one “truth” in opponents’ claims, namely that solar power is intermittent. But that issue can be solved, he says, by reducing the cost of storage, overbuilding solar, tapping electric vehicle batteries using vehicle-to-grid technology, pairing solar with wind, and other measures.
Local solar provides 18 benefits, Nussey adds, including grid benefits. One benefit is a reduction of 1400 to 2100 pounds of carbon dioxide per month for a typical home’s rooftop solar system. If coal power is displaced, that rooftop system also prevents the creation of 185 pounds of coal ash per month.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/26/doe-announces-initiatives-and-support-to-rapidly-accelerate-community-solar-deployment/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 26, 2022",DOE announces initiatives and support to rapidly accelerate community solar deployment,"The commitment announced at the National Community Solar Partnership (NCSP) Annual Summit aligns with the DOE’s goal to enable enough community solar to power 5 million American homes by 2025, saving consumers an estimated $1 billion. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced several new initiatives to help move toward that goal.
Community solar projects enable multiple customers to benefit from the revenue produced by a solar array, which can bring affordable solar energy to more people. NCSP, a coalition of over 800 stakeholders, is working to expand access to community solar to every American household with a focus on underserved communities.
“Community solar is an essential element of expanding affordable solar energy access by allowing everyone to share in the benefits of clean energy regardless of whether their homes can support rooftop solar panels,” said Kelly Speakes-Backman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
“With the combination of DOE’s NCSP initiatives and the adoption of other critical actions by state and federal policymakers, industry can meet this goal and satisfy pent up demand, save American consumers and businesses money, create local jobs, enhance grid resilience and protect the environment and community health,” said Jeff Cramer, President and CEO of Coalition for Community Solar Access.
Nearly three-quarters of the US market for community solar is concentrated in four states: Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York, although 22 states and Washington, D.C. have state policies that support community solar deployment.
“We want solar to be affordable for every homeowner. We can’t treat community solar projects as one-off, feel-good projects if we want an equitable clean energy economy. We need to integrate it into our state energy strategies and our budgets,” said Washington Governor, Jay Inslee.
Illinois Governor JB Pritzker noted that community solar is not only good for the planet, but the new goal of reaching 5 million households by 2025 will also mean $1 billion in energy savings for consumers.
“NCSP’s work will help us get closer to our shared goals for solar,” said Ali Zaidi, Deputy National Climate Advisor, White House Climate Policy Office. “The White House, States, DOE, industry, community organizations, and more are working to deliver lower energy bills for families, create good-paying jobs, and tackle climate change.”
Over 500 supporters attended the summit to discuss NCSP’s “Pathway to Success,” a plan to address persistent barriers to equitable access. The plan has five focus areas: developing community solar ‘knowledge and know-how’, expanding state-level programs, improving access to financing, reducing customer acquisition barriers, and broadening awareness of the benefits of community solar programs.
The initiatives supporting this pathway include:
