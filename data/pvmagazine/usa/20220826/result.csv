A 25-acre solar facility will be built near campus, which will help save more than $200,000 in its first year, will decrease greenhouse gas emissions the equivalent to taking more than 1,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles off the road for one year.
“This is part of an ongoing campus strategy to be both fiscally and environmentally conscious with all of our projects including our combined heat and power plant, Energy Savings Performance Contracts, and U.S. Green Building Council certified facilities” said Scott Turley, associate vice chancellor of facilities.
The university selected Entegrity Energy Partners of Little Rock to facilitate the project. Entegrity will provide all capital costs, design, permitting, installation, utility interconnection, operations and maintenance of the solar array and provide energy as a service to the University of Arkansas campus. According to the 25-year agreement, the University will purchase at a specified rate the entire energy output of the array, which has a minimum guaranteed production of 8.6 GWh in the first year or approximately 6.3% of the campus electrical energy requirement.
“Estimates demonstrate, upon execution, it will generate savings of $3.1 million,” said Arkansas Department of Energy & Environment cabinet secretary Becky W. Keogh. “The Arkansas Energy Office, an entity of the Arkansas Department of Energy & Environment, indicates that this solar project is one of the most cost-effective endeavors to be evaluated while requiring no upfront capital.”
In 2007, the University of Arkansas became one of the first institutions to become a charter signatory of the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment and establish the goal of net carbon neutrality by 2040.
The University is working to reduce its carbon footprint with a combination of sustainable building practices, energy efficiency upgrades, and sustainable commuter transportation options. The university is pursuing additional renewable energy development opportunities as part of the ongoing effort to reduce financial risk while being an environmentally responsible campus.
“The U of A is leading by example,” said Eric Boles, director of the Office for Sustainability. “Simply put, this project saves money, reduces risk, and minimizes environmental impact. We are excited to tell this story and inspire others to look beyond business as usual.”
The estimated commercial operation date is December, 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/26/engineering-study-begins-for-500-mw-compressed-air-energy-storage-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,CALIFORNIA",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 26, 2022",Engineering study begins for 500 MW compressed air energy storage project,"Toronto-based Hydrostor announced it selected Kiewit Engineering Group to advance front-end engineering and design studies for the 500 MW / 4 GWh Willow Rock Energy Storage Center. Once completed, the project will be the largest standalone energy storage project in California.
The project will employ Hydrostor’s Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology. The company said its commercially proven equipment can provide affordable, large-scale, and emission free long-duration energy storage (LDES). The project will be capable of storing enough energy to provide power to 400,000 homes over an 8-hour duration, storing intermittent wind and solar energy.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It first pulls off-peak or surplus energy from the grid, producing heated compressed air. Then, the heat is extracted from the air stream, and stored inside a thermal store, preserving the energy for later use. The compressed air is stored in a tank that uses a process called hydrostatic compensation to maintain constant pressure during operation.  When the energy needs to be dispatched, pressure forces air to the surface, where it is then recombined with heat, and sent through a turbine, producing dispatchable electricity.
The company said its technology has a 50 + year system life, uses no toxic materials, is emissions-free, and can provide rotational inertia in support of grid stability.
“Hydrostor continues to reach important milestones at Willow Rock, and we look forward to working with the world-class engineering and construction teams at Kiewit to advance this critical clean energy project. Our global teams are paving the way towards achieving aggressive net-zero goals. Willow Rock will be capable of eliminating the equivalent of roughly 120,000 cars off the road every year over its 50+ year project life.” said Curtis VanWalleghem, Hydrostor’s chief executive officer.
“Kiewit remains committed to engaging in the clean energy transition and recognizes that LDES solutions like A-CAES are a critical component of grid modernization. We look forward to commencing work on Willow Rock, which has the potential to abate significant emissions and provide a reliable, sustainable energy source for many decades.” said Kevin Needham, president of Kiewit Power Engineers.
This January, Hydrostor announced a preferred equity financing commitment of $250 million from Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Goldman Sachs will fund its investment in tranches tied to project milestones to match Hydrostor’s capital needs and accelerate project execution. The financing will also support the company’s global development and marketing initiatives, including expansion of its project pipeline and capabilities in markets with significant near-term demand for flexibly sited long-duration energy storage.
“As the world continues transitioning to sustainable and renewable energy sources, the need for utility-scale long-duration energy storage is clear, and Hydrostor’s A-CAES solution is well positioned to become a leading player in this emerging global market,” said Charlie Gailliot, partner and head of energy transition private equity investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
In June 2021, the California Energy Commission said it would procure 1,000 MW of long duration energy storage, with duration of eight hours or longer, to be activated between 2026-2028.
LDES technologies are continuing to take stage in the climate discussion, with an international LDES council formed at the recent COP26 summit. The council projects a need for 85 to 140 TWh of global LDES by 2040 to meet decarbonization goals, which could entail an investment of $1.5 to $3 trillion.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/26/liquid-metal-long-duration-storage-to-be-demonstrated-at-solar-test-site/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,COLORADO",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 26, 2022",Liquid metal long-duration storage to be demonstrated at solar test site,"Ambri, a developer of liquid-metal long-duration energy storage systems, announced it will partner with Colorado electric utility Xcel Energy on a demonstration project. The project will demonstrate Ambri’s calcium-antimony liquid metal batteries’ ability to interact with renewable energy.
Tribally owned economic development enterprise Grey Snow Management Solutions’ Solar Technology Acceleration (SolarTAC) will be the host site for the demonstration project. The SolarTAC was established to test renewable energy technologies in a real-world, grid-connected environments.
Ambri’s chemistry is being developed to meet the demands of large industrial energy customers, such as data centers. The company’s large-scale battery unit has a 250 kW / 1000 kWh capacity, DC efficiency of over 80% under a wide set of use cases, has a response time of less than 500 milliseconds, voltages between 550 V to 1150 V, and is housed in a 10-foot shipping container.
The containerized system holds shelves of cells, thermal management systems, a weatherproof outer enclosure, and a battery management system for applications that require high energy capacity, frequent cycling, long life and high efficiency.
“We are honored to be selected by Xcel Energy as they continue to drive towards a carbon-free future,” said Adam Briggs, chief commercial officer at Ambri.
Xcel Energy became the first utility in the United States to set a long-term goal of providing its customers zero-carbon electricity. The utility aims to be net-zero across electricity, heating, and transportation by 2050. Ambri’s technology is designed to perform in a wide range of environments, potentially making it the right fit for Xcel to effectively store and dispatch power in harsh Colorado weather conditions.
“We look forward to learning what (Ambri’s) technology can accomplish in a range of extreme environmental conditions as we look to build out the long-duration energy storage that will help us reach our carbon reduction goals,” said Alice Jackson, senior vice president and chief planning officer at Xcel Energy.
The SolarTAC has been owned and operated by MRI Global since 2011. It will test Ambri’s technology for one year. In addition to solar and energy storage, the site is used to test microgrid capabilities at the edge of the electric distribution system.
Late in 2020, Ambri agreed with TerraScale, a clean infrastructure design and development firm, to deliver 250 MWh of Ambri systems to TerraScale’s Energos Reno data center project. The site’s battery will be bolstered by a reported 500 MW of on-site renewable generation. 
Last year, the MIT-spinoff announced that it achieved a $144 million funding round, led by Reliance New Energy Solar, Bill Gates-backed Paulson & Co., and Fortistar, Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates, Japan Energy Fund, and others. Ambri also entered into a long-term antimony supply agreement with Perpetua Resources.  The agreement helps secure a domestic source of antimony for its supply chain. 
Chemistry
The liquid metal battery is comprised of a liquid calcium alloy anode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a cathode comprised of solid particles of antimony, enabling the use of low-cost materials and a low number of steps in the cell assembly process.
The company said that the active materials in its cells reversibly alloy and de-alloy while charging and discharging. The electrolyte is thermodynamically stable with the electrodes, avoiding side reactions such as film-formation that can lead to performance degradation. The negative electrode is fully consumed when discharged, and reformed on every cycle, resulting in what the company said is a “highly repeatable process with no memory effect.”
Ambri said that following the funding round it now is able to scale for projects from 10 MWh to over 2 GWh around the globe, with durations ranging from 4 to 24 hours.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/26/the-growing-demand-for-automation-in-demand-response/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,GUEST POST,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",,"AUGUST 26, 2022",The growing demand for automation in demand response,"As the grid continues to add increasing capacity of renewables generation in a bid to transition the energy sector toward net zero, it has to balance those moments when interruption is inevitable. One approach is to increase levels of flexible generation and battery storage and to take action to reduce demand. Demand Response is the incentive paid by Independent System Operators (ISO’s like ERCOT, MISO, IESO, NYISO, NEISO, PJM) to electricity consumers to voluntarily drop power use during times when demand is heading precariously toward the grid’s supply limit.
As you can see in the graphic, gas generation, especially after fracking resulted in a swelling of supplies and lower prices, in 1960 gas overtook coal to become the dominant fuel in the generation mix. But the next generation transition is already underway.

In ERCOT for example, this transformation is threatening gas generation as a new build gas generation plant hasn’t made investor sense in over five years. Even after winter storm Uri where the grid came within three minutes of a complete black swan shut down that would have left most of Texas without power for tow to three months, new gas-fired generation is still not on the horizon. So the question is, what are the perils and what are the opportunities of such a transformation and what are you going to do to plan, process, and procure for what lies ahead?

Each ISO establishes a Reserve Margin (RM), which determines how much electricity can be produced at the most efficient level of resource adequacy against anticipated demand. ERCOT, for example, operates with a RM target of 14%. In 2019, however, the RM fell to about 7% leaving a narrower margin of error. When that happens, the supply line drops, as represented in the graph below. At this point, it’s everyone’s responsibility to fill in the gap as no one can afford for the demand line to breach the supply limit. In ERCOT, for example, the ISO uses a number of levers from multiple programs to curtail the demand line. But the real question is, how frequently and how often will this scenario play out?
Prior to August 2019, ERCOT had a frequency of distributed resource (DR) events where one program was dispatched about every 5 years, and another, about every 10 years. The grid at that time was highly reliable, efficient, responsive, and considered a good value. But it’s carbon emission profile was not.


Somewhere in the not-too-distant future, wind and solar will surpass gas as the largest contributor of generation capacity in many ISO’s. But let’s see what a 100% renewable generation system looks like. If we were to graph out that prospect, it would look something like an EKG.

So where do we find ourselves today? The answer is somewhere between where we were 3-5 years ago and the graph above. The challenge is to determine where and how we will make up for interruptions. The “gap” solutions are where you as an energy manager need to prepare because with every MW of solar or wind we add to the grid, we are adding more volatility and more vulnerability. What are these “gap” measures that call attention to “if you are not with us, then you’re against us” full market approach?
After winter storm Uri, Texas saw an increase in the number of back-up generator installations precisely to address power insecurity. Signs have been pointing in this direction in ERCOT for many years. While wind and solar have been growing with the help of subsidies and ever-evolving power trading arbitrage, there have been an increasing number of DR dispatches by ERCOT. While some of these dispatches have lasted little more than an hour (like on July 13th of this year) some have lasted around 100 hours (like during winter storm Uri). While they shed power, and while they were offline, a MW in some programs paid almost $1.0M per MW for just that week.
Back up generation provides a source of hard-currency monetization by exporting to the grid on a certain strike price, say $90/MWh, and run until the price drops back below that point. If the ISO calls a DR event, the site generator goes to island mode removing the demand from the grid, meeting the DR obligation, and maintaining resiliency. With the growing expansion of renewables, we can anticipate DR events happening more frequently.
Successfully navigating the future
Every consumer and every ISO finds itself somewhere between what we expected of our electricity grid three to five years ago to somewhere in the future of growing volatility that comes from expanding renewables.
Until batteries or onsite generation investments hit the ROI scale, navigating through this transformation requires an integrated AI and automation technology system designed to handle the more frequent and more severe power interruptions that lie ahead and the increasing number of DR events aimed at preventing these.
Manual-based Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSE) were an adequate service in the past when these events were considered rare. The future is at our feet and ERCOT’s experiences are an indication that renewable power adoption is creating growing power insecurity. Finding a QSE with controls and AI expertise that has experience with these looming conditions is paramount to navigating successfully toward a financially rewarding and carbon reducing future.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/08/26/nano-grid-home-runs-solely-on-dc-power/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIANA",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 26, 2022",Nano-grid home runs solely on DC power,"While most homes run on alternating current (AC) power because that’s what comes from the utility lines from the grid, researchers at Purdue University decided to switch a home over to all direct current (DC) power.
Why? Back in the late 1800s Thomas Edison had a dream of a DC-based electrical infrastructure, but that dream lost to George Westinghouse’s AC system. In recent years, however, with renewable energy sources generating DC power, it would make a home more efficient if the electricity did not have to be converted to AC.
“We wanted to take a normal house and completely retrofit it with DC appliances and DC architecture,” said Eckhard Groll, the William E. and Florence E. Perry Head of Mechanical Engineering, and member of Purdue’s Center for High Performance Buildings. “To my knowledge, no other existing project has pursued an experimental demonstration of energy consumption improvements using DC power in a residential setting as extensively as we have.”
The project to transform a 1920s-era West Lafayette, Indiana home into the DC Nanogrid House began in 2017 under Groll’s direction. The first years were spent renovating and upgrading the infrastructure, and they added insulation and new windows to increase the home’s energy efficiency.
Rectify Solar provided a full installation of solar panels on the roof, while industry partners supplied new appliances and HVAC systems.  The rooftop solar system brings the all-electric home to net zero. Rectify installed Panasonic 330 panels rated for 14.3 MWh annual production, inverters from CE+T America, and a lithium iron phosphate POM Cube 20 kwh battery system, rated at 12.5 kW continuous power.
“Large-scale distribution of DC power through a house in the 21st century is really uncharted territory,” said Jonathan Ore, a 2020 Purdue Ph.D. graduate who served as the lead researcher on the project. “You can’t just go to the hardware store and buy DC circuit breakers or other critical distribution systems. We had to create this infrastructure from scratch.”
Purdue researchers, in collaboration with Rectify Solar, developed and jointly own a patented distribution system that enables the house to integrate both DC power from solar panels, wind turbines or battery storage with AC power from the local utility.
“The creation of the 380-volt DC load center was definitely a challenging and rewarding experience,” said Phil Teague, co-founder and CEO of Rectify LLC. “We used biomimicry and the neural connections of the brain as our inspiration, and added smart technologies and control mechanisms. Transitioning to DC can simplify homes, buildings and the grid as a whole. This project helped me realize that DC is not only the future, it always was.”
“A DC-house can potentially sustain itself for short periods of time by generating its own renewable energy and detaching from the grid through the help of on-site stored energy,” said Ore. This ultimately minimizes the strain on the outside grid in emergency situations. Events like the Texas storm are perfect illustrations of how a DC-house can benefit individuals and the community.”
To monitor the DC home for its comfort and usability, graduate students are living in the home full time. They’ve installed sensors in every room to detect whether people are present so that the HVAC system only heats or cools the areas of the home that are in use.
“This gives us the opportunity to perform both cutting-edge research on energy-saving opportunities and observe its potential benefits in a truly real-world setting, rather than just relying on simulations,” Groll said.
“It’s been really amazing to see the interest in this,” Ore said. “We started this project as just a proof of concept. But as our country experiences more and more issues with the grid, companies are actively seeking to integrate our work. People are interested in it from every aspect: from the electrical side, from the thermal side, from the automation and management side. This is a perfect testbed to experiment with those technologies.”
Purdue innovators have worked with the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization to patent this technology. The researchers are seeking OEM partners to continue developing their technology and to take it to market.
As a result of this project, Phil Teague will be speaking at RE+ in Anaheim next month about this project on the topics of “DC is the Future, It Always Was”, and “DC Microgrid Design-Build Lessons Learned”.
