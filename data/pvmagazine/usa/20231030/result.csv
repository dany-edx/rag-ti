“Roadrunner Reserve will help us maintain reliability as we ambitiously but responsibly expand our community’s renewable resources,” said Susan Gray, TEP’s President and CEO. “This new system will be particularly important in helping us satisfy peak energy needs during the summer.”
Canadian Solar’s e-Storage has been awarded the supply and integration contract for 1 GWh DC of energy storage solutions for DEPCOM Power, Inc. and TEP. E-Storage is part of the Company’s majority-owned subsidiary CSI. DEPCOM Power is a Koch Engineered Solutions Company that operates solar development, EPC, O&M and energy storage and repowering services.
e-Storage will deliver its proprietary energy storage solution SolBank to the project, which has rated storage capacity of 800 MWh AC.
SolBank, which was announced at RE+ in 2022, is a proprietary, containerized energy storage system that uses high-cycle lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries with a 2.8 MWh energy capacity. LFP chemistry has been found to cut the risk of thermal runaway that can be a problem in other lithium-based battery systems.
The battery enclosure contains liquid cooling mechanisms and humidity control, and active balancing battery management systems. The company said the technology complies with the latest international safety standards and features multi-level fire safety management systems, incorporating state-of-the-art monitoring and control systems and active cell balancing.
TEP expects to charge the grid-connected battery in the morning and early afternoon, when solar resources are most productive, then deliver stored energy later in the day when customers’ energy use is typically highest. The system will be built next to a southeast-side TEP substation.
Roadrunner will be the largest energy storage system on the TEP energy grid and among the largest in Arizona, the utility reports. Once operational, the energy storage project will serve up to approximately 42,000 homes for a four-hour duration.
In August Canadian Solar announced that e-Storage will deliver 1,200 MWh (1,519 MWh dc nominal) of energy storage solutions to Recurrent Energy’s Papago Storage project in Arizona, which will be the largest standalone storage project in Arizona.
The Papago project is scheduled to be in service in late 2024 and the Road Runner Reserve System project is scheduled to begin operations in the summer of 2025.
To date, e-Storage has implemented over 3.3 GWh DC of battery energy storage solutions across the United States, Canada, the UK, and China, bringing its total installed capacity and contracted pipeline to 12.4 GWh DC.
Roadrunner Reserve aligns with TEP’s 2020 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which planned to reduce carbon emissions 80% and add up to 1,400 MW of energy storage by 2035. TEP will file its next IRP on Nov. 1, 2023.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/30/canadian-solar-to-open-5-gw-solar-cell-factory-in-indiana/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIANA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Canadian Solar to open 5 GW solar cell factory in Indiana,"Canadian Solar announced it plans to invest $800 million to develop a 5 GW solar cell manufacturing site in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Once complete, the factory is expected to produce enough cells to supply the production of about 20,000 solar modules per day.
The company said it expects to begin production at the plant in 2025. Over 1,200 jobs will be created once the facility is operational.
“Indiana’s strong advanced manufacturing sector positions the state to help lead the global energy transition, developing and powering new solutions in batteries, solar and hydrogen,” said Indiana governor Eric Holcomb. “Canadian Solar’s new U.S. location in Jeffersonville will put our skilled Hoosier workforce at the center of cultivating solar power, making energy efficient panels more accessible to consumers across the country.”
The company said the cells produced at the Indiana facility will be used at its new Mesquite, Texas module assembly plant announced in June.

A total of $12.3 million in tax credits and workforce training grants were offered to Canadian solar through the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. The funds are conditional on the company following through on investment and hiring plans.
Canadian Solar has been publicly traded on the NASDAQ since 2016, and was founded in Guelph, Canada in 2001.
In a pv magazine USA webinar, Clean Energy Associates highlighted how solar cells are a critical leg in the supply chain that needs to expand capacity to make a meaningful impact on energy independence for the U.S.
Along with raw polysilicon, ingots, and wafers, cells are under-represented in the U.S. supply chain when compared with module assembly capacity and overall PV module demand.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/30/solar-energy-technologies-office-supporting-the-buildout-of-a-secure-u-s-supply-chain/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Solar Energy Technologies Office supporting the buildout of a secure U.S. supply chain,"Achieving the White House’s goal of 80% clean energy supply by 2030 is possible but is not without some challenges.
Supporting the buildout of solar in the U.S. is the Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), which focuses on advancing technology and accelerating solar deployments by driving innovation in technologies, solar panels supply chain to inverters to soft costs. While working to scale up solar, SETO is also focused on ensuring that solar can support the reliability, resilience and the security of the grid.
Dr. Becca Jones-Albertus, Director of SETO, was the keynote speaker at the pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, where she shared her thoughts on how SETO is focused on how solar can factor into the buildout of renewable energy in the U.S. along with how solar can support job growth, equitable opportunities to benefit from an energy transition, growth of domestic solar manufacturing, as well as its role in a circular economy.
Dr. Jones-Albertus noted the great progress that the U.S. has made in solar deployment, now being the second largest market behind China. To reach the current goal of decarbonizing the power grid by 2035, however, will take another 1000 GW of solar deployment which has some challenges to face.
Geographical diversity
The first of these challenges is geographical diversity. Jones-Albertus said that SETO focuses on a secure supply chain that is geographically diverse and is made up of “financially healthy companies that can scale their production to meet increasing demand”. While the supply chain has shifted to more manufacturing in Southeast Asia, the global supply chain is still heavily concentrated in China.

The chart above shows the different silicon supply chain segments that each have more than 80% of production in China. Even though the U.S. has been able to procure cells and modules from Southeast Asian countries, ingots, wafers and other supplies such as frames, glass and even manufacturing equipment is still coming from China.
Building a U.S. supply chain
She noted that the DOE is very focused on how they can help support and build a U.S. supply chain as one of the key strategies for building resilience.

Looking at the chart above, the rising purple line shows the rapidly growing solar installation in the U.S., with the bar chart below showing manufacturing capacities. Ten years ago we had significant polysilicon production until the AD/CVD tariffs caused that production to fall substantially.
This is “all poised to change,” she said, due to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, “the most significant piece of legislation we’ve had in this country when it comes to domestic solar manufacturing”.
As a result of the manufacturing production tax credits and the domestic content adder, we’re seeing tremendous growth in U.S. solar manufacturing. She noted that the reason the numbers were so low prior to 2021 was because we have higher costs in this country for labor, electricity, land acquisition, permitting and environmental burdens, etc. “All for good reason,” she said, but the tax credits offered by the IRA offer an opportunity to use those costs and become more competitive.

As shown in the chart above there has been an incredible number of manufacturing announcements across the supply chain from silicon wafers to cells to modules to trackers, and to a lesser extent to polysilicon, inverters, and tools.
Cumulatively across the supply chain, SETO estimates that it’s over 210 GW of capacity. It’s over 20,000 jobs, nearly $12 billion in investments. This includes an announced 66 new facilities or expansions across 23 states in the US and Puerto Rico. She acknowledged that not all of these will come to fruition, but there may be additional announcements to come.
As the U.S. solar supply chain scales, SETO provides support for the very beginning of ideas all the way through to those who have developed their technology and are looking to pilot scale manufacturing. The office helps prepare new technologies to be ready to apply for loans from the DOE loan programs office to help scale into full production.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/30/hoymiles-introduces-quad-module-three-phase-solar-microinverter/,"MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,CHINA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Hoymiles introduces quad-module three-phase solar microinverter,"Hoymiles, headquartered in Hangzhou, China, announced it has released a series of microinverters for the North American commercial and industrial solar sector. The HMT-2000-4T-NA series of microinverters can be paired with up to four solar modules. 
The three-phase microinverters are designed to accommodate high-powered PV modules, and support peak power output of up to 2000 VA. The maximum DC input current is 16 A. It offers a CEC peak efficiency of 96.5%. 
The device has two maximum power point trackers (MPPT) and an MPPT voltage range between 16 V and 60 V. 
Designed for the North American grid, the microinverter is compatible with three-phase Delta network configurations. The microinverter is designed to support up to four solar modules, typically ranging from 400 W to 670 W or more each. Hoymiles said the four-module design makes the inverter a fast and cost-effective option. 
The device can be connected to the S-Miles Cloud platform, enabling module-level monitoring and remote operations and maintenance. It contains Sub-1G wireless connection, offering communication stability and real-time monitoring capabilities. 
The inverter also contains rapid shutdown devices and an isolated transformer for improved safety. The inverter’s enclosure is IP67 rated for outdoor use. It is cooled by natural conection with no fans. 
“[The microinverter] offers unmatched performance, efficiency, and safety, and we are confident it will redefine the standards for commercial and industrial solar installations in North America,” said Rocky Gao, chief executive officer, Hoymiles US. 
Hybrid inverter 
Last month, Hoymiles also introduced a new single-phase hybrid inverter for the North American market, designed for residential and small commercial solar-plus-storage projects.
The inverters come in sizes ranging from 3.8 kW to 11.5 kW output power. Hybrid inverters enable two-way conversion of electricity from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), as well as DC to AC.
The hybrid inverters sport a max efficiency of 97.6% and a CEC efficiency of 97%. Double maximum power point (MPPT) trackers support up to 32 A of MPPT current. The inverters support 120 V / 240 V backup power without requiring the installation of an external autotransformer.
Hoymiles’ new inverters enable a DC/AC ratio of up to 150%. The company said this leads to a lower system cost when compared with systems of the same capacity using other conventional inverters.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/30/solar-sales-dont-need-to-be-quick-or-accurate-they-need-to-be-both/,"BUSINESS,GUEST POST,MARKETING,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Solar sales don’t need to be quick or accurate – they need to be both,"This August, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) officially turned one year old. As you probably heard, it’s the single largest piece of U.S. climate legislation ever. In fact, the National Renewable Energy Lab expects the IRA will result in clean energy accounting for up to 90% of total U.S. power generation by 2030.
Solar is expected to be a big part of that 90%. The solar incentives in the IRA might start with the extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to 2032 at its original 30 percent, but they also extend to battery storage, community solar, commercial and industrial solar (C&I ) projects, and more.
But, while the IRA has provided a great framework for growth, it’s up to us in the solar industry to make sure this growth actually happens. Aurora’s Solar Industry Snapshot recently found that only 30% of solar professionals think that homeowners fully comprehend the legislation’s benefits for solar, like the extension of the ITC.
To ensure we fully realize the IRA’s potential to transform how we generate and consume energy as a society, improving homeowner education is key — and not just around the IRA. But how? We have to look at the most common interaction solar professionals have with potential customers: the sale.
The modern sales experience
As any teacher will tell you, there are a couple of important steps when trying to educate someone: Getting and keeping their attention, and giving them accurate information. This is true whether you’re selling a solar installation or teaching a first grader how to read. Of course, there is one key difference: A first grader can’t tell the teacher, “Now isn’t a good time” and close the door in their face.
Any of us who have sold door-to-door can confirm, though, that this happens quite often in the field. In a survey of 1,000 U.S. adults conducted by Dynata, a full 40% won’t even open the door when a door-to-door salesperson comes by, and only 24% claim that they would genuinely listen to a pitch. So how do we capture their attention quickly, and keep it?
A compelling proposal — one that’s delivered quickly and highlights the things they care about — is crucial to grabbing the homeowner’s interest before they close the door and head back inside. Now, what’s compelling to each homeowner will be different, so your proposal tool has to be highly customizable. But, there are some universal truths:
For example, presenting a realistic, 3D model of the house, complete with panels, can grab the homeowner’s attention. Then you can move on to educating them on all the incentives available, showing them their lifetime savings and financing options, and even detailing whether battery storage makes sense for them. This material should be presented in a compelling way, with no delays, and with plenty of captivating visuals.
Don’t forget accuracy
So, we’ve got the quick and compelling, but what about accuracy? After all, if you present information quickly, but the model isn’t accurate you’re setting yourself up for change orders and cancellations from frustrated customers.
Change orders can cause project delays — or worse, project cancellations — damaging the reputation of not just your company, but the solar industry as a whole. And, unfortunately, there’s still a perception that being quick and being accurate are mutually exclusive, and many solar companies inadvertently trade one for the other in their sales process — but that no longer has to be the case. A solar sales solution should enable you to generate professional proposals in minutes, giving sales reps 3D models and unique pricing configurations to improve homeowner trust and close the deal quickly.
Of course, fewer change orders and cancellations lead to happier customers, which goes a long way toward making sure your business gets more customers. According to the Solar Industry Snapshot, 67% agree that a solar company’s reputation is “very important” when deciding whether or not to work with them, ranking as the third most important factor when choosing an installer, behind only price and quality of products. In sum: Accurate proposals lead to happy customers, which leads to more customers.
The IRA presents a great opportunity for the solar industry — for installers and homeowners alike. Grabbing homeowners’ attention quickly and educating them accurately — both on the benefits of the IRA, and the benefits of solar in general — is crucial.
But, to reach the IRA’s full potential and goals, we have a lot of solar to sell and install. Solar installers that can most effectively educate customers — delivering compelling, accurate proposals, quickly — will have a leg up on the competition on fulfilling the IRA’s potential.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/10/30/ascent-solar-approved-to-apply-for-federal-funds-to-finance-agrivoltaic-project/,"MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JERUSHA KAMOJI,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Ascent Solar approved to apply for federal funds to finance agrivoltaic project ,"Solar panel manufacturer Ascent Solar Technologies received good news from the Department of Energy (DOE) in response to submitting a concept paper for their proposed new agrivoltaic system. The DOE decided to “encourage” their proposition to design more reliable and durable solar panels that produce and consume electricity on-site for domestic farmers. 
Ascent has been researching and developing flexible thin-film solar panels suited for harsh environments for 40 years. They started manufacturing solar cells fifteen years ago and recently announced a significant increase in power conversion efficiency for their copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) solar cells. This makes their technology more suitable for various applications like planes, satellites and agrivoltaic systems.
Ascent suggests its thin film solar cell technology is better for agrivoltaics because it increases land productivity and economic value. A study published in the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute indicates that combining energy and agricultural production is far more efficient than parceling out pieces of land to produce energy at the expense of agricultural activity. Other research published in ScienceDirect states that agrivoltaic systems built over shade-tolerant crops generated a 30% increase in economic value for farmers compared to conventional methods.  
“Thin-film solar is uniquely capable of being produced and incorporated into agrivoltaic applications, and we appreciate the DOE’s commitment to exploring the potential of the technology,” said Paul Warley, CEO of Ascent. 
The proposal was submitted under the DOE’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law: Silicon Solar Manufacturing and Dual-use Photovoltaics Incubator program. The scheme, developed by the DOE’s Solar EnergyTechnologies Office (SETO), is meant to incentivize the innovation of next-generation solar technologies while continuing to reduce the cost of solar and boost domestic solar manufacturing. According to the DOE, projects from this funding opportunity will help accelerate the domestic transition to a decarbonized and resilient grid by 2035. A total of $45 million will be awarded to various qualifying projects.
There are two topic areas under which applicants can submit a proposal. Ascent applied under Topic Area: Dual-use PV Incubator. Projects in this category are meant to develop products that encourage the establishment of new markets for the burgeoning solar panel industry. 
That includes agrivoltaics, building-integrated PV, floating PV and vehicle-integrated PV. The DOE suggests two to eight projects will be awarded between $1 and $1.6 million each. 
“We want to demonstrate our technology’s potential to produce solar energy on farms and provide water conservation,” said Warley. 
In a study conducted in Belgium, researchers were able to verify that the vertical PV system could reduce water demand for the irrigated main crops. 
Ascent Solar has a research and development center and a 5MW nameplate production facility in Thornton, Colo.
