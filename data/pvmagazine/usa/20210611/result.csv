Geographical information systems have the ability to combine geospatial (location-based) data with typical attribute and tabular data. 
For those willing to take some time to engage with the data hands-on, there are many excellent free resources for sourcing geographical information systems (GIS) data, analyzing and visualizing the data, and creating impactful conclusions that give developers and analysts an edge. 
First, the user must select a platform for manipulating the geospatial data available. QGIS is currently among the leading desktop GIS programs available. It is a continually-developing open-source platform with a strong community of collaboration, education, and data sharing.  
New users can reference the QGIS training manual to get started. Free online beginner GIS courses are available through the University of Toronto and the University of California, Davis through coursera.org. 
Once a level of understanding has been reached with the platform, it is time to pull in data and begin your analysis. Here are just a few free datasets at your disposal: 
NREL features many tools, maps, and datasets for GIS applications.  
PVDAQ features U.S. photovoltaic performance data contributed to NREL, while PVWatts estimates the energy production and cost of energy of grid-connected photovoltaic energy systems throughout the world. 
Solar for All visualizes rooftop solar potential by income, building type, tenure occupancy and more in the residential sector. It is a dynamic tool that has data down to the tract level, and allows for custom querying to pull data only from the area you desire. 
The EIA supplies shapefiles for distribution systems for all major fuel types. Here you can find relevant data for the locations of power plants, electric transmission lines, electric substations, climate zones, and more. 
For a more advanced user, Berkeley Lab provides scripting tools for renewable energy zoning procedures. They also have a wealth of tabular data about the solar industry. 
Often, universities and other organizations will make their datasets freely available. For example, MIT provides detailed transmission line and substation shapefiles and other relevant for all of New England. MassGIS provides highly detailed land-use codes down to the parcel level, helping a developer identify top areas for greenfield and brownfield development. With some digging you can find freely available information about most regions across the U.S.
This list is by no means exhaustive, and it should be kept in mind that the data can serve as a backdrop or building block for deeper levels of analysis. Users can join in their internal data in Excel, .csv, and other formats to create new data and visualizations, and even use Python or SQL to create interactive maps. 
If the DIY and free methods are too heavy of a lift, there are many companies on the rise providing optimized geospatial data, giving you a direct link to GIS experts and user-friendly tools. RaptorMaps, geothinQ, Galehead Development, and many others are breaking into the solar space as large-scale installations heat up and competitive advantages are increasingly sought.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/11/nanograf-develops-battery-chemistry-material-with-significant-energy-density-increases/,"BATTERY,BUSINESS,COST AND PRICES,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,PRODUCTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 11, 2021",NanoGraf develops battery chemistry material with significant energy density increases,"After more than a year of research and development, NanoGraf, an advanced battery material company, said it has hit on a chemical recipe that enables previously unattainable levels of energy density in an 18650 cylindrical lithium-ion cell.
The 18650 cell is a standardized battery form factor, used across sectors by the likes of Tesla and the U.S. Army. The energy density achievement was enabled by developing a proprietary silicon-oxide anode material that can be introduced into the same battery form factor at densities beyond what has been achieved previously, according to Kurt “Chip” Breitenkamp, vice president of Business Development.
According to Breitenkamp, this material has enabled NanoGraf to increase battery capacity in the 18650 form factor by an initial 12%. For perspective, energy density in that form factor had increased roughly 8% over the course of the last decade, prior to NanoGraf’s work.
NanoGraf’s research was aided by funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, with the goal of developing a longer-lasting and potentially lighter per-cell lithium-ion battery, designed to provide U.S. military personnel with better portable power for the equipment they rely on. The new chemistry, however, has uses beyond military portable electronics, with NanoGraf outlining that the biggest opportunities for more energy-dense batteries lies with electric vehicles EV, as the cell technology could provide an immediate boost to vehicle range.
“Range anxiety” has been a significant hurdle in mainstream EV adoption. According to NanoGraf, the new cell technology could extend the range of a Tesla Model S by up to 28% on a single charge.
According to Breitenkamp, this most recent breakthrough is just the beginning, and the company soon could see even greater density increases.
“We believe that we can put even more of this silicon material into batteries and I think we can double this,” said Breitenkamp. “I think we can get to 20% in the near future.”
The capacity achievement is not just limited to the 18650 form factor, but could be applied to other battery cells. Breitenkamp said that the 18650 form factor was chosen due to its commercial relevance and widespread usage.
In the near-term, NanoGraf’s biggest goal is to get its technology to commercial scale. Breitenkamp said that the company specifically sought out a low-cost manufacturing route with low-cost materials in order to reach cost parity with battery technologies currently dominating the market.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/11/solar-makes-a-lot-of-sense-at-ground-level-too/,"RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 11, 2021","Solar makes a lot of sense at ground level, too","As we humans scramble to address climate change with renewable energy, the real paydirt in solar might actually be dirt.
Think of it in terms of multiple scientific and economic interests converging on the soil just below your photovoltaic panels. The panels provide an opportunity to restore natural ecosystems and reduce soil erosion, all while reducing the electric power grid’s carbon footprint.
For example, Minnesota and Iowa used to be home to an estimated 25 million acres of tallgrass prairie. Due to agriculture, these ecologically diverse habitats are almost functionally extinct, as barely 1% of those tallgrass acres remain.

From an emissions-capturing standpoint, these native grassland habitats are important because they sequester almost 60% more carbon per acre than modern agricultural activities.
Seeking to understand the environmental effects solar power has on these properties, a collaboration between researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and the University of Minnesota analyzed solar power facilities that integrate natural grasses.
The study modeled and averaged solar facilities in seven states in the Upper Midwest. Their modeling suggests that native grasses planted as part of 10 GW of solar generation capacity would sequester 129.3 tons of carbon per hectare; that is 65% and 35% greater than either an agriculture or a solar-turfgrass scenario, respectively.
The researchers said that this volume of emission sequestration is equivalent to the emission savings of 5,000 GWh of fossil generation shifting to solar power, which would correspond to greater than 3 GW of solar capacity.
The paper found that in addition to carbon sequestration, native grassland habitats also produce a three-fold increase in habitat for local pollinators, like bees and butterflies, when compared to pure agricultural usage. The threat of erosion from poor management still looms for midwestern soil. Solar + native grasslands would protect this fertile asset from losses of up to 9,000 tons of sediment erosion annually, and would retain over 40,000,000 cubic meters of water from runoff annually.
Prior observational research has shown that solar panels create microclimates in semi-arid regions by significantly increasing the water retention in soil, which in turn increases sheep and cow grazing grasses by 90%.
The solar industry already is conscious of land use challenges. Deals sometimes fall apart because people push back over issues related to land use. Their concerns include perceived home value depreciation, the losses of a rural lifestyle, and the risk of agricultural capacity depletion.
Two years ago, solar developer Silicon Ranch launched a “holistic solar land management program” known as Regenerative Energy. The group’s aspirations include:
Recently, a 2.4 GW portfolio of agrivoltaic projects changed hands, while a large developer put out a call for innovative agrivoltaic ideas, and solar interests in France started an agrivoltaic association.
We are going to build the solar. We already have the sites. The question is, how will it get built?
And speaking of agriculture, did you know that all growth in corn use since 1980 went to make alcohol for fuel?
Roughly 25% of the United States’ corn acreage is used specifically to generate biofuels, which represents only around 10% of all transportation fuel. Crops to create that amount of fuel is currently using somewhere between 14 and 20 million acres of land. If that same acreage were used for solar electricity generation, we would produce an eye-popping 1.8-2.5 TWdc. Some estimates are that the U.S. could reach 100% clean electricity with roughly 1.1 TW of wind and solar combined.
And because an additional 25-40% of existing electricity generation would electrify 100% of our transportation sector, 2 TW of solar would generate roughly double what’s needed to fully electrify U.S. transportation.
That leads us to a startling conclusion. Solar fields are capable of producing roughly 16 times more transportation energy per acre than our current biofuel processes, while also providing a much needed opportunity to restore our native ecosystems.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/11/3-takeaways-from-the-pvel-2021-reliability-scorecard/,"CONSUMER PROTECTION,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PRODUCTS,RESEARCH,NORTH AMERICA",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 11, 2021",3 takeaways from the PVEL 2021 reliability scorecard,"PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) released its 2021 Reliability Scorecard. The annual publication is a collection of results from solar panel stress tests focused on specified and verified subcomponent bills of materials.
A few highlights from this year’s results:
The group’s newest product test – the Mechanical Street Sequence (MSS) – seeks to discover how larger solar panels–built from larger solar cells–which are now deployed in more complex environments, will potentially develop microcracks and degrade over the next several decades.
PVEL said that its MSS aligns with the forthcoming IEC 63209 technical specification for extended reliability testing. It said the IEC 61215 certification standard only requires static mechanical loading, and PV modules will pass if they exhibit no visible damage when evaluated by eye and have less than 5% power loss.
 
To start all testing processes, including this MSS, PVEL observes the production of each solar panel they test, from the opening of the raw materials through every step of production, until they are palletized and shipped with tamper-proof tape. The below electroluminescence imaging shows a  panel’s progression through the three main steps of MSS – static mechanical load (SML) – #2, dynamic mechanical load (DML) – #3, and environmental stress – #4.

In the SML testing phase, modules are mounted on two rails and secured at typical ground-mount clamping locations. They then undergo three rounds of one-hour downforce and one-hour upforce at 2,400 pascals.
For the DML testing, there are 1,000 cycles of alternating positive and negative loading at 1,000 pascals. As part of the simulated environmental stress, modules undergo 50 thermal cycles from +85°C to -40°C, then 10 cycles of humidity freeze, high heat, and humidity followed by a rapid drop to freezing temperatures.
The report said that, in general, solar panels from the last five years show higher levels of field degradation. This should not be too surprising as more than half of the world’s solar deployment has occurred over the same time period.
If we were to focus on one technology among the many which make up a modern solar panel, the report suggested that module encapsulation should get our attention. Variations in the encapsulant formulations were the primary factor affecting the degradation rate.
An aerial-infrared analysis that submitted with the report by Heliolytics, found that a manufacturer’s size does not correlate with field reliability. As we can see in the chart, below, large and small scale manufacturers (blue versus green, respectively) are  evenly mixed.

The list of manufacturers with a bill of materials that performed well enough to garner a spot on the PVEL Top Performers list can be found in their Twitter feed. Below, we’ve highlighted the manufacturers that made the list for the first time this year:
While the solar panel failure rates noted here are trivial for residential and small commercial customers with even 100 panels, the higher failure rates will add significant labor hours when it comes to gigawatt-scale facilities.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/11/doe-offers-5m-in-prize-money-for-american-made-solar-competition/,"FINANCE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 11, 2021",DOE offers $5M in prize money for American-made solar competition,"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has begun accepting submissions for its American-Made Solar Prize, a competition with a total of $5 million in awards available. The contest seeks both hardware and software that catalyze U.S. manufacturing and address challenges to rapid, equitable solar energy deployment.
In conjunction with this program, DOE also launched the American-Made Network Innovation Engine, a tool that it said is intended to form a bridge between creative entrepreneurs and “connectors.”
It said that connectors are organizations like incubators, universities, think tanks, industry groups, and other organizations that will recruit competitors, help them develop their project, provide tools, and raise funding. The hardware track offers $260,000 in recognition awards for connectors who support innovators, and the software track offers $85,000.
The software track is a new feature in the competition, and seeks to address non-hardware costs of solar, like customer acquisition, financing, and grid integration.
Software competitors have the opportunity for an optional Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) contest. Up to $190,000 in prizes may be awarded to approaches that empower underserved communities, overcome solar barriers, and equitably share in the benefits of solar.
The project runs in three phases: First, pitch an innovative idea that addresses a critical need in the solar industry and identify market demand for it. Second, design a hardware proof of concept or minimum viable software product. Third, contestants will develop early-stage hardware prototypes or customer-validated software products.
A July 13 informational webinar will be held and the deadline to enter is August 31.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/11/sunrise-brief-polysilicon-prices-likely-have-peaked-canadian-solar-execs-say/,"BUSINESS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,NORTH AMERICA",DAVID WAGMAN,"JUNE 11, 2021","Sunrise brief: Polysilicon prices likely have peaked, Canadian Solar execs say","Senior executives at Canadian Solar said during a webinar that they believe polysilicon prices have peaked, and that speculation that had been driving up prices is no longer having a significant impact. The executives stopped short, however, of saying when they thought poly prices might ease.
The comments were made during a June 9 webinar hosted by Roth Capital Advisors. Executives included Yan Zhuang, president of CSI Solar, Dr. Huifeng Chang, chief financial officer, Ismael Guerrero Arias, presiem ident of the company’s energy business, and Isabel Zhang, director.
Canadian Solar said its customers have accepted higher module prices “over time,” and that it does not see customers walking away from projects altogether. Yan said, however, that “room for higher pricing is limited.” The company said that the second half of 2021 will likely continue to be tough on its operating margins.
In its first quarter earnings call, Canadian Solar said the price of polysilicon has tripled over the past 12 months. The company mitigated the impact in part by raising module prices, which it said saw a “near double-digit percentage increase” compared to the fourth quarter. The company also said it prioritized margins ahead of shipment volumes.
During the June 9 webinar, Canadian Solar also said it is working to improve its power electronics capability, including inverters, but is not trying to become an inverter company. The company said it is entering the inverter market in order to offer a complete solar + storage solution for residential and small C&I applications.
The company said that high sunk costs incurred through the development process in the U.S. make project cancellation or postponement unlikely even with polysilicon price pressures. Philip Shen of Roth Capital said that his firm’s own checks suggest some project developers have walked away from projects after spending $1-2 million in development costs. In a May 16 research note, Shen warned that current price pressures could delay as much as 15% of planned 2021 utility scale solar development in the U.S.
Canadian Solar said during the webinar that the Brazilian market is the most sensitive to cost increases, while the shift to merchant power in the European Union makes that market less sensitive.
Stem Inc. will provide smart energy storage services to Altus Power America for a behind-the-meter, DC-coupled 2.9 MW solar system project with 2 MWh of energy storage to become operational at a site in Massachusetts during the second quarter.
Stem’s Athena AI smart energy storage platform will be used to enable Altus Power’s solar generation and energy storage system to provide automated demand response featuring flexible energy delivery during peak demand times, maximizing the economic and environmental benefits of its solar assets. Adding energy storage to the DC-coupled solar system is expected to lessen the energy loss within the solar inverters.
Since announcing its first project in Massachusetts in 2017, Stem has deployed an aggregate of more than 180 MWh of storage capacity, or nearly 20% of all non-residential energy storage capacity for the MA SMART solar program via behind the meter and front of meter (FTM).
According to Wood Mackenzie’s U.S. energy storage monitor 2020 report, Massachusetts was home to 30% of the 300 MWh of U.S. non-residential energy storage deployments in 2020, more than any state except California. Massachusetts is expected to deploy 21% more non-residential megawatt-hours in 2021 than it did in 2020.
Solar photovoltaic is now the leading source of global power generation investment, according to Frost & Sullivan In 2020, more dollars were invested in solar PV than coal, gas, and nuclear combined, the firm said. The decade ahead promises more growth and continued investor opportunities as the firm forecasts a total of $2 billion to be invested through 2030, with half going to utility-scale projects and the rest going to commercial, industrial, and residential PV systems. More homes and businesses will arise as prosumers, relying on self-generation for most of their needs, enabled through energy storage systems. The firm said this will drive the growth of virtual power plants to aggregate these resources and maintain the integrity of the electricity grid.
Agilitas Energy acquired Boston-based New England Battery Storage, a private energy storage developer focused on utility-scale battery storage. The acquisition includes two operational ISO-New England merchant battery energy storage systems and one front-of-the-meter battery energy storage system in Maine totaling 25 MWh.
In Maine, two projects in the Town of Madison were commissioned as the first continuous storage systems in Maine. A separate project in the Town of Rumford, a 4.99 MW / 10 MWh front-of-the-meter battery energy storage system, launched commercial operations in early June.
The acquisition marks Agilitas Energy’s expansion into battery energy storage operations, including participating in the ISO-New England day-ahead and real-time energy markets, operating reserve markets, frequency regulation market, and the forward capacity market. One of the systems is also a peak load reducer for a municipal electric company while participating in the ISO-New England’s wholesale marketplace.
NEBS will be merged with the existing Agilitas Energy organization. Jeff Perry, CEO and president of NEBS, who has over 30 years’ experience in energy system asset management and commercial operation, will become VP, Asset Management at Agilitas Energy.
