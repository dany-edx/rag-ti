The fund joins the U.S. auto manufacturer’s $35 billion by 2025 investment in EV/AV technology, and seeks project proposals that make improvements in four areas: 
GM said it will give preferential consideration to grassroots organizations working at the community level. 
The announcement was made by CEO Mary Barra at the Aspen Ideas Festival. There, she said that GM aims to have no new internal combustion engine vehicles sold by 2035.  
Barra also addressed concerns that EVs have fewer parts, which will result in fewer manufacturing jobs. Her solution: rely less on outsourced work, bring in more work internally. This may already be underway with GM having announced four U.S.-based battery cell manufacturing plants.

The project brings its overall stake in solar in Utah to 814 MW. 
The Energy Information Administration estimates that the 814 MW of solar represents 53% of the current net summer capacity of solar generation across the state. 
Facebook will use utility Rocky Mountain Power’s Schedule 34 green energy tariff, which allows large customers to buy renewable energy generated on their behalf. The company bought another 235 MW from Rocky Mountain Power last September; this new project comes after the announcement that the data center will expand from 500,000 sq ft to 900,000 sq ft.
Scheduled to reach commercial operation data by the end of 2023, the facility will be constructed by rPlus Energies. 
Facebook said this past Earth Day that it reached 100% renewable energy use for their operations in 2020. The company said it has $8 billion of contracts in place for more than 6 GW of wind and solar in 18 states and five countries. All 63 renewable energy projects are new constructions and located on the same electrical grids as the data centers they support, said Facebook.

On a quest to set themselves apart and find the optimal storage solution, companies have toyed with existing battery chemistries and invented their own. One startup, backed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), has found an approach that’s been in front of us the whole time.
That company is Urban Electric Power and its technology is alkaline batteries – think AA in a flashlight. Just saying “alkaline” doesn’t tell the full story, however, as Sanjoy Banerjee, CEO and Ann Marie Augustus, VP of operations told pv magazine.

The Urban Electric story began 12 years ago, when the company received an Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) Grant for $6 million to design something for the grid, specifically a storage solution that would be comparable in cost to pumped hydrogen, yet not as geographically exclusive. When looking at battery technologies and chemistries, zinc and manganese dioxide made the most sense, as both were already being widely used for battery cells and their supply chains were well established.
The issue then became recharging, as manganese dioxide and zinc both had high capacities, but their chemical structures would change after a discharge, disabling any hope of a recharge. As Banerjee explained it, the company was able to “freeze” the change by adding “certain doping agents like bismuth and copper,” finally achieving both high capacity and rechargeability.
UEP has since used this innovation to develop modular batteries that can provide backup electricity for personal use, may be installed in a home garage or basement, grouped as part of a commercial microgrid, or installed en masse at grid scale by an electric utility or independent power provider. Augustus also pointed to one advantage that the company believes offers a critical advantage over competing chemistries: the batteries pose no risk of thermal runaway.
The company currently has a manufacturing plant in Pearl River, NY, which you can take a virtual tour of.


This breakthrough is what Banerjee and Augustus believe got the attention of EPRI. Urban Electric Power was the only battery storage company of more than 250 applicants to be accepted into EPRI’s Incubatenergy Labs electric utility mentorship program.
Incubatenergy Labs brings startups and utilities together to crowdsource the demonstration of these innovations and speed the commercialization of promising technologies. Urban Electric will now spend 16 weeks working with utilities including Ameren, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Con Edison, and Duke Energy on demonstration projects.

Urban Electric is actively installing one large-scale demonstration project. The installation is at a San Diego State University data center, which needed a backup solution, Augustus said. The center’s previous backup provided about 15 minutes of power, but the center needed two hours. Space was limited, which meant the center couldn’t explore diesel capacity, or the number of racks that would be required with other battery chemistries.
Urban Electric’s chemistry became the solution, because it allowed the center to achieve 2 MWh of storage indoors, with no risk of fire or toxic leaks, and at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour than the center’s owners paid for their previous lead acid battery system. What’s more, the solution was compatible with the existing inverters and racking.
Following this pilot and with the support from the Incubatenergy Labs program, Banerjee and Augustus said that the company is, moving rapidly into commercialization and building out its development pipeline, with the goals of offering a battery system below $50/per kWh in the near future, and ultimately below $20/per kWh.

The effort follows the March release of the LA100 study, which was prepared by NREL and found that Los Angeles can achieve reliable, 100% renewable power as early as 2035. The study also revealed that while all communities in Los Angeles will share in the benefits of the clean energy transition, improving equity in participation and outcomes requires intentionally designed policies and programs.

That study said that reaching a 100% renewable grid by 2035 will require adding new solar, batteries, wind, and transmission, along with operational practices that make more efficient use of those assets. The study did not address specific costs, but said that economic impacts to the city would be “small relative to the overall size” of LA’s economy.
The new phase of the study, LA100 Equity Strategies, aims to apply modeling and analysis to address how Los Angeles can ensure that its transition to 100% clean energy with high levels of electrification will improve energy justice as measured by metrics that include reduced energy burdens, increased access to energy services like cooling, and improved quality of life.
The effort will bring together environmental justice communities and other stakeholders to identify community-driven, energy-just outcomes, particularly for those in disadvantaged communities.
The LADWP Board of Water and Power Commissioners authorized NREL to lead LA100 Equity Strategies in cooperation with the Luskin Center for Innovation at the University of California Los Angeles.
NREL and UCLA will model pathways to achieve community-driven, prioritized equity outcomes for disadvantaged communities, which could include the following:

Historical data measured through LADWP’s equity metrics initiative have shown disparities in low-income and underserved communities in participation in customer-focused clean energy programs such as customer rooftop solar, electric vehicle and charging station rebates, smart thermostat rebates, and other programs designed to help customers save energy and money.
The LA100 study was a three-year study to analyze pathways the community could take to achieve a 100% clean energy future. Stemming from several Los Angeles City Council motions in 2016 and 2017, the study analyzed more than 100 million ultrahigh-resolution simulations to evaluate a range of future scenarios for how LADWP’s power system could evolve to 100% renewables while maintaining its current degree of reliability.
Since the release of the LA100 study, officials have announced an accelerated goal of achieving a 100% carbon-free power grid by 2035, and interim milestones of 80% renewable energy and 97% carbon-free by 2030.
Other initiatives include launching an environmental review process for 10 new transmission projects within the Los Angeles Basin, identified through studies as critically necessary to support the increase of renewable energy, and ensure reliability as local in-basin natural gas plants are phased out. LADWP also plans to issue a request for information (RFI) to explore options for green hydrogen power technologies and best practices.

Notice 2021-41 extends the safe harbor rules under IRS Notice 2018-59 from four years to six years for projects that started construction from 2016-2019, and from four years to five years for projects that started construction during 2020.
The notice also provided a new choice to demonstrate continuous work, known as a continuity requirement, on a project, providing for the ability to use one of two standards, regardless of how an earlier decision was made on how to start construction.
The IRS said a taxpayer has two methods to demonstrate the taxpayer has begun construction of a project, the Physical Work Test and the Five Percent Safe Harbor. After a taxpayer begins construction of a project, the taxpayer must also make continuous progress toward completion to satisfy beginning of construction requirements. Under the Physical Work Test, a taxpayer uses the Continuous Construction Test to demonstrate continuous progress. Under the Five Percent Safe Harbor, a taxpayer uses the Continuous Efforts Test.
Notice 2021-41 aims to clarify hat if the Continuity Safe Harbor does not apply, then the continuity requirement is satisfied if the taxpayer demonstrates satisfaction of either the Continuous Construction or the Continuous Efforts Tests, regardless of the method that the taxpayer used to start construction.
In a statement on the action, the Solar Energy Industries Association said that many solar companies have faced disruptions to their project timelines due to COVID-19. “This new notice from the IRS will give them much-needed breathing room to complete these projects,” SEIA said.

The initiative is designed to address emerging resource adequacy risks illustrated by recent power disruptions in areas including Texas and California.
The project brings together grid operators, utilities, researchers, and other key stakeholders from across the electric power industry to accelerate the evolution of resource adequacy processes and tools for a decarbonized energy system that must serve society in the face of increasing threats.
The initiative is focused on four areas:
Nautilus Solar Energy said it acquired 21 community solar projects in New York and Maryland totaling almost 60 MW of capacity. Sixteen projects in New York and five in Maryland currently provide community solar power to 9,500 households and two school districts through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Nautilus’s Asset Management division will be responsible for project management, long-term asset management, and maintenance for the life of the projects.
LS Power completed its acquisition of 25 solar power facilities totaling 467.8 MWdc from Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated.
The solar portfolio spans 14 states and five regional transmission organizations. The assets include 12 facilities in PJM (198.7 MW); 7 facilities in CAISO/WEIM (151.6 MW); 4 facilities in SERC/SW (103.3 MW); 1 facility in NYISO (10.6 MW); and 1 facility in ISO-NE (3.6 MW).
Renewable Energy Test Center and VDE US Holdings Inc. said that VDE has acquired a 70% stake in certification and testing company RETC. The acquisition is intended to speed RETC’s growth and strengthen the VDE Group’s presence in the renewable energy sector.
VDE has been active in the solar and energy storage markets for more than 15 years. Its stake in RETC “significantly expands” its footprint in renewables, particularly in the U.S., a statement said. ” The combination is intended to provide customers worldwide with testing, inspection, certification, and data services that de-risk renewable energy projects like solar and energy storage installations in utility-scale and below.
