Certain regions, especially islands, which are limited in land area, can’t afford to trade-off prime agricultural land for solar facilities.
This issue has come to a head in Hawaii’s Oahu, an island particularly constrained in land use with declared goals to double local food production by 2030 and produce 100% of the its electricity with renewable energy by 2045.
In an attempt to create an optimal pathway for achieving both of those goals, Dr. Matthias Fripp, associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, released a white paper outlining what different land use scenarios would mean for the island in terms of land availability, total electric generation costs, and the overall design of the electric system on Oahu.
Fripp’s models are founded on an electricity system planning model called Solar and Wind Energy Integrated with Transmission and Conventional Sources (SWITCH).
The land-use assumptions modeled by SWITCH include more restrictive use of the Land Study Bureau Class B and Class C agricultural lands, and higher slope limits for potential solar PV project sites. Class B and C lands are determined based on the findings of an inventory and evaluation of the state’s land between 1965 and 1972, undertaken by the Land Study Bureau of the University of Hawai‘i. Land is graded anywhere from A to E, with A representing the highest class of productivity and E the lowest, based on a variety of factors.
The analysis revealed that the use of some agricultural lands for solar results in lower costs for Hawaiian Electric Company and its customers, with a couple of scenarios achieving the protection of O‘ahu’s most productive agricultural lands with negligible impact to customers’ electricity costs.
Potentially the most important variable outlined in the different scenarios regards the slope of land that PV can reasonably be constructed on.
When all Class B and C lands with <15% slope are made available for solar development, SWITCH estimates roughly 51% of Class B agricultural lands would likely be selected, while around 16% of Class C agricultural lands would likely be selected, though this scenario would likely face pushback from farmers and agricultural advocates.
Upping the slope to <20% while still keeping all Class B and C lands open for development would likely result in 49% of Class B agricultural selected and roughly 15% of Class C agricultural chosen.
The study found that if developers are willing to construct projects on higher-sloped lands, regardless of the agricultural land-class limit, the result is a lower-cost resource plan for both utility and consumer. This is true despite potential increases in individual solar project development costs.
The model shows these increases in development costs as manageable, with the average cost per kWh rising just 0.6 cents when the slope of lands considered rises from <15% to <20%.
The total lowest-cost energy resource plan is achieved when there is no limitation on the use of Class B and C agricultural lands, and solar developers are willing to build on sites with up to 20% slope, while restrictive limits of the use of Class B and C agricultural lands would require the island to quickly transition to other renewable resources, like offshore wind and biofuels, all of which are currently more expensive to develop than PV.

Now, the global industrial giant is entering the U.S. residential solar inverter market with technology that already has made its mark in Australia and Brazil.
The inverter’s U.S. debut came during a kickoff event at the November 18 NBA game between the Denver Nuggets and the Philadelphia 76rs. It was a good night for the Sixers, who won, and an even better one for a group who cheered the product launch at halftime. On hand were Michael Mendik, U.S. country manager for GoodWe USA Inc. LTD.; Jeff Wyatt, Varun Murugaraj, and Steve Cason from GE; and Mike Kruger, president & CEO at Colorado Solar and Storage Association. GoodWe is a GE licensed partner.
The GE inverter is compatible with high-voltage batteries (80-495V) and has a power capacity ranging from 5-9.6 kW. As Joseph Spradley, VP of sales at Krannich Solar USA said, “The new GE hybrid inverter comes loaded with industry leading features: integrated AC and DC disconnect, four MPPTs, and 9.6kW of output in backup.” Up to 15 kW of solar panels can be connected.

Other tech specs include:
· GEH US 5-9.6kW
· Hybrid inverter
· Up to 4 MPPTs and 150% DC input oversizing
· Sustainable Power Supply
· Generator connection
· 50A charging and discharging current for fast battery operations
· Integrated smart meter and SUNSPEC rapid shutdown transmitter
· Compatible with multiple HV batteries
· Design proven worldwide
These features are in line with the growing energy demands of the U.S. market, including electric vehicles.
GE said that one goal is for the solar inverter to be a major contributor toward the U.S. renewable energy transition and a major technological innovator in the ever-growing solar industry. A no less-important goal is to make homeowners more confident in their choice to go solar using the GE solar inverter as one of the key components of the system.

In a partnership with SolarFi, the university has deployed off-grid solar study “pods,” private study areas that can charge laptops as students work outdoors. 
SolarFi has a history working with sports organizations and schools in cutting carbon emissions during times of high energy use. Recently, the company received funding from the City of Los Angeles to scale its business, and as a result, it plans to deploy solar pods at Suber Bowl LVI in February. 
The company is currently scaling-up its business, and is launching a capital campaign via a crowdfunder that allows investments as little as $100. 
The pod, called Privé, is described as a socially-distanced, durable, and customizable unit. It has built-in charging ports, Hepa air filters, ventilation, and cooling systems. The pod was first conceived at an MIT poverty reduction lab. 
SolarFi also develops a larger product called Bliss, a solar powered “business in a box.” The off-grid kiosk unit is equipped with ten 440-445 W solar modules, has digital boards for advertising space, e-scooter charging ports, and integrated WiFi. The design is foldable and mobile, able to be transported on a trailer pulled by a typical consumer vehicle.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/09/u-s-trade-commission-recommends-extension-of-section-201-solar-tariffs/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 9, 2021",U.S. Trade Commission recommends extension of Section 201 solar tariffs,"The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) issued its determination on the Section 201 tariffs on solar cells and modules, recommending a four-year extension of the solar tariff, with annual declines of .25% starting in February.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) noted that the tariffs, imposed by President Trump in January 2018, have not spurred enough domestic manufacturing to meet U.S. solar demand. And it is this capacity that is needed to help meet President Biden’s climate and energy goals. SEIA also pointed out that the tariffs also failed to create jobs, instead resulting in “significant” job losses.
SEIA president and CEO, Abigail Ross Hopper, commented on the proposal, stating that, “years of tariffs have not moved the needle nearly enough to justify the USITC’s recommendation”. Noting that President Biden has set a “bold vision” of becoming a world leader on clean energy, “extending these tariffs will hold us back from realizing that vision,” Hopper said. She urged the President to enact policy to grow U.S. manufacturing, and acknowledged that Senator Ossoff’s amendment in the Build Back Better Act is what she considers “the first investment our nation has made to truly incentivize domestic solar production after years of punitive import duties on U.S. companies.”
She implored the President to not make “the same mistake” as the previous administration. “It’s time to let these ineffective tariffs end and start a new era of American clean energy leadership,” Hopper concluded.
SEIA notes that since the Section 201 tariffs were imposed in 2018, the U.S. solar industry has “missed out on” more than 62,000 jobs, $19 billion in private sector investment, and more than 10 GW of solar deployment. Hopper cautioned that extending the tariffs will “worsen the supply chain bottlenecks that are already throttling America’s clean energy sector.”
The President will make a final decision on whether to extend the tariffs or end them, thereby potentially boosting U.S. clean energy deployment.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/09/autonomous-robot-for-concentrated-solar-power-installation-and-maintenance/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 9, 2021",Autonomous robot for concentrated solar power installation and maintenance,"Heliogen, a California-based developer of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, held the first technical demonstration of its ICARUS, or Installation & Cleaning Autonomous Robot & Utility Solution.
ICARUS is a system of autonomous robots designed to clean the heliostats, which are the reflective mirrors of the CSP system. Heliostats reflect sunlight into a collection tower, where the light and heat is converted to electricity and usable thermal energy. Recently, the company partnered with Bloom Energy to produce hydrogen fuel.
(Watch: “Concentrated solar power supports hydrogen fuel production”)
Cleaning the heliostats can be expensive, labor-intensive, and due to this, historically was only done every few months, said Heliogen. Now, the ICARUS robots can continuously clean the system from soiling, keeping production levels high.
The ICARUS system uses GPS, ultrasonic rangefinders, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors to operate fully autonomously.
The system can also deliver the heliostats from an assembly or inventory location to the field, and install them with accuracy up to two centimeters, said Heliogen. It can work around the clock, day or night, requiring minimal physical labor. The robots can operate in both structured and unstructured environments and have built-in obstacle and structure avoidance.
“By taking advantage of huge boosts in processing power due to the advances of Moore’s Law, AI, computation, and computer vision, Heliogen aims to make solar energy more affordable than ever before,” said Bill Gross, founder and CEO of Heliogen.
ICARUS is expected to be deployed across Heliogen’s facilities by 2023.
