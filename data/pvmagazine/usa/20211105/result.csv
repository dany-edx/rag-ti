Our solar guy climbed on roofs to see the results,"Wind events affect solar power projects. Case in point: Here in New England, at least one solar power project felt the effects of a major wind event in late October.
On the night of October 26 and into the morning of October 27, New England experienced a Nor’easter weather event, the season’s first.
Gusts across the eastern coast of Massachusetts topped hurricane strength and hit 80 miles per hour in many places, including a peak gust of 94 miles per hour at 4:31 am.

According to utility companies, more than 500,000 electricity accounts lost power in the Bay State during the storm. Those accounts were concentrated on the Atlantic Coast, with large swaths of the region showing 50-100% of accounts without power from the Cape Cop region  to just south of Boston.
Each account represents one electric meter, which typically supplies power to several or more people. In the adjacent map, black represents 90-100% of accounts without power, red is 50-90%, and brown/orange is 20-50% without power.

While supporting one of our electrician’s operations and maintenance contracts, my team and I were asked to visit a site within a heavily impacted wind region. A segment of the project was signaling that strings of solar panels were not connected to the inverter.
Upon arrival, we found multiple, distantly located rows of solar panels were flipped, and at least one solar panel flew 100 feet from its original location.
Additionally, an edge of the thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roof, which had been securely nailed to sides and edges of the building on its north and northeast sides, had been torn away and flipped over the edges of the building back onto the roof.
And, a sinister looking 60-foot line of nails pointed up through the layers of TPO.
In total, fewer than 40 of the 4,000 solar panels were affected. The electrical and mechanical teams were able to take pictures of the affected hardware, move them back to their original positions, reattach all components, and fully repower the system. Ongoing testing will determine if any solar panels will need to be replaced.
Happily, it does seem that only minimal damage occurred.
A few miles away, this author’s team was installing around 186 kW of solar panels on a very exposed rooftop. The hardware — solar panels, racking components, and ballast blocks — all was palletized and thus very heavy. Other than a garbage can used by the electrical team, none of the hardware shifted.
Arguably, three separate events occurred on the site. The first two occurred to two different rows of solar panels located in fundamentally different wind risk areas of the project. The third event affected the roofing material, which was torn up along the corner of the building and was located away from the affected rows of panels.
This author was not the developer of the project and doesn’t know the specific wind code this project was designed for. But regional wind codes in the area have a minimum of 110 mile per hour uplift requirements. The peak winds measured in this area were in the 80 to 90 miles per hour range.
One could speculate that since the wind tore the roofing material upward from the northeast corner of the structure, and that the building itself sits among several other large industrial buildings, then perhaps a complex interaction between southwestern blowing storm winds greatly increased as they were bent upward by the immovable, 1800s-era multiple story brick structure.
The main thing to look for in a ballasted solar power installation is to understand if the proper amount of ballast has been deployed. This ballast — literally engineered bricks of a certain weight — is what holds the solar power project down against winds. The racking company will do a wind analysis based on site feedback from the solar developer and engineering teams, and specify via a professional engineer-stamped drawing the weight of the ballast that must be used.
After the Nor-easter and while walking the site where the damage occurred, I saw that every solar panel and racking piece had multiple pieces of ballast in place. My quick observation did not provide enough information, however, to know if enough ballast was there.
If it turns out there was enough ballast in place for a standard roof analysis, then it may just be that a standard roofing analysis wasn’t enough. For example, I have never seen a multi-building air flow wind analysis on any projects my company has built for commercial and industrial rooftop customers.
As we increasingly build in environments where complex winds blow, we may well need to step up our engineering and design practices.

OpenSolar said it worked with PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to test and validate the design product.
NREL compared OpenSolar’s remote 3D tool with assessments made on the same roof by SunEye, the global leader in hand-held shade assessment, and found that the OpenSolar accuracy was within a 3% margin of error.
PVEL was tasked with evaluating the tool’s assessment of pitch and scale. OpenSolar’s model was accurate to within 1.3 feet in its assessment of scale. The tool also assessed pitch to within 4 degrees of accuracy 97% of the time. 
The company’s energy modeling system, or the estimated production based on key inputs like pitch, azimuth, and shading, is based on NREL’s System Advisor Model (SAM). When compared with SAM, PVEL found that OpenSolar’s model is consistent with standard engineering practices. Its production figures were found to within 0.2% of SAM estimates, and within 2% of PVsyst model estimates.
“Our assessment of OpenSolar’s software confirms that its implementation of the SAM energy production model engine is accurate and in line with industry standards for residential and commercial projects and its 3D ray tracing calculations of beam shading are as good or better than other available products,” said Ryan Desharnais, chief technical officer of PVEL.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/05/ossoff-bill-would-address-rooftop-solars-cost-burden-on-lmi-people/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES,WASHINGTON, D.C.",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Ossoff bill would address rooftop solar’s cost burden on LMI people,"Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) introduced a bill that would make it more easier for middle- and lower-income families to afford solar rooftop and other renewable energy technologies.
The Clean Energy for All Homes Act would reduce the cost burden of installing PV and energy efficiency devices. The legislation would allow more taxpayers to receive a tax refund on qualified technologies.
A recent study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that reducing average building energy usage through efficiency measures by about 60% would be key to achieving the least-cost 100% renewable grid via building electrification.
This is the latest Ossoff-backed measure to be introduced to Congress. His Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act won a spot in the congressional budget measure, which is under consideration. If passed, that measure would boost domestic solar manufacturing, potentially create thousands of jobs, and accelerate clean energy adoption.
Other senators signed on to the latest bill, including Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), among others.

Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D-CA) introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. “Making Section 25D refundable unlocks the opportunity for more than 40 million households to realize the benefits of having solar panels at home — including 3.2 million Black households and 3 million Hispanic households,” she said.
The proposed act would encourage home-sited solar and energy efficiency, which is regarded as one of the most efficient ways to decarbonize the grid. The Environmental Protection Agency said distributed generation supports delivery of clean, reliable power, while reducing losses along transmission and distribution lines.
Distributed solar offers homeowners savings, and, when paired with energy storage, resiliency under power outages. It also unlocks a variety of grid services that make energy use more efficient and cost-effective for homeowners and the surrounding community.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/05/solential-energy-to-bring-floating-pv-to-the-midwest/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA",TIM SYLVIA,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Solential Energy to bring floating PV to the Midwest,"Solential Energy, an Indiana based renewable energy company that specializes in commercial solar energy and microgrid systems, said that it is planning the installation of floating PV, or floatovoltaics, to water and wastewater treatment plants across the Midwest.
Solential will secure the requisite floating PV racking systems from French company Ciel & Terre, which has been developing the solution for more than a decade Its hardware is used in more than 240 floatovoltaic systems around the world. Ciel & Terre will supply the racking systems and its patented Hydrelio technology, the blow-molded high-density polyethylene plastic on which the racking and panel sits.
Solential said it is in final negotiations with a major Midwestern city to install the region’s first floatovoltaic solar system. Floating PV has historically been a resource absent from the Midwest; Ciel & Terre’s existing U.S. floatovoltaic portfolio is largely installed in California and Florida.
In August, BlueWave Solar formed a joint venture with Laketricity, a unit of Ciel & Terre, to develop floating solar projects in Massachusetts, with reported intent to expand throughout the Northeast.
California is currently home to the largest claimed floating solar project in the country, the 4.8 MW Healdsburg Floating Solar Project, installed on ponds at the City of Healdsburg’s wastewater treatment plant. The project, co-developed by White Pine Renewables and Noria Energy, will cover around 8% of the city’s total energy demand, moving it toward a goal of 60% renewable energy usage before 2030.
The previous claimant to the title of largest floatovoltaic project in the U.S. was the 4.4. MW floating array in Sayreville, New Jersey, installed by Ciel & Terre USA. That project, just outside of New York City, is also sited on a pond at a water treatment facility. It offsets the power use at the facility and a handful of other government facilities.
In April, Pine Gate Renewables said it would site 9 MW of solar-plus-storage over cranberry bogs in southeast Massachusetts. Solar Carver 1 would be built on a 70-acre site and generate 5 MW of solar energy, accompanied by 30 MWh of battery storage. Solar Carver 3 would have a capacity of 2 MW and include a 12 MWh battery storage system across a 35-acre site.
Floating solar has been pegged by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL) as a “rapidly emerging technology.” A report outlined the technology’s potential to produce just under 10% of current electricity generation.
The technology can offer higher energy production due to the cooling effects of water and wind. Even so, the floating solar has not reached widespread adoption, due in part to higher installation costs than traditional PV plants.
However, according to Stetson Tchividjian, director of business development at D3Energy, a floating PV developer, this could change as floating solar approaches price parity with land-based PV. Tchividjian also points out that floating solar has lower operation and management costs, and no land costs.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/05/what-crops-pair-well-with-solar-illinois-study-aims-to-find-out/,"COMMUNITY,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Which crops pair well with solar? Illinois study aims to find out,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture awarded the University of Illinois a $10 million grant for an agrivoltaics project called Sustainably Colocating Agricultural and Photovoltaic Electricity Systems (SCAPES).
The project seeks to provide interdisciplinary scientific knowledge, along with extension and education programs, to study sustainable agrivoltaic designs in various combinations of crop species. Row crops, foraging crops (for livestock), and specialty crops all will be studied across three biophysically diverse regions of the U.S.: Illinois, Colorado, and Arizona.
SCAPES seeks to combine farm-scale economic analysis with cutting-edge field experiments. It aims to study the system-wide effects on markets and climate systems which result from various agrivoltaic configurations. The program will take a systems modeling approach to extrapolate biophysical and economic outcomes.

If the right data emerge, then professionals will likely be able to develop software tools for use in agrivoltaic project development and deployment.
The study is timely, as the rapidly falling price of solar panels has created an impetus for the construction of solar fields, which is often perceived as competing with crop production.
Potential land use conflicts have been brewing for years in the U.S., despite emerging agrivoltaics research showing that land conflicts can be solved by co-locating solar panels with crops, thereby increasing both food and electricity production.
For example, agrivoltaic research from the Fraunhofer Institute has suggested that a wheat field covered with raised solar panels would generate around 80% of the wheat that would otherwise result without panels, and roughly 80% of the electricity. However, combining food and energy production dramatically increased the net revenue output from the same piece of land.
The Illinois-led project has three objectives. The first is to engage key stakeholders — including farmers, landowners, and solar developers and their associations — to determine hypothetically optimal configurations of solar integrated with food crop production.
The second goal is to optimize design considerations based on location-specific crop productivity, resource needs, and electricity generation models. The last objective will create what are expected to be high-impact experiential educational programs integrated with research to reach students as well as farmers.
The approach will search for existing solar facilities in each region and plant C3 (for example, soybeans, spinach, and rice) and C4 crop  species between panels to learn how they respond to various levels, duration, and timing of shade. C4 plants such as corn use a CO2 respiration process which improves nitrogen, water, and photosynthetic efficiency, and would likely find benefit from the shade of solar panels in only the hottest climates. C3 plants are more common, making up 95% of green plants, and typically grow more efficiently in partial shade.
Once collected, the data will be used to set up an agrivoltaic simulation model to guide the design of the three research and demonstration sites.
Three existing solar farms — Solar Farm 2.0 at Illinois, Jack’s Solar Garden at Colorado State University, and the Agrivoltaics Learning Lab at the University of Arizona — will be used to generate the initial data. The model built from these data will have a goal of representing onsite light transmission as well as water and thermal dynamics. It will then be integrated with crop growth models to guide design.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/11/05/new-tech-recovers-pure-silicon-from-end-of-life-solar-cells/,"RESEARCH,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",New tech recovers pure silicon from end-of-life solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from India’s KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology have developed a new technique to recycle pure silicon from solar cells at the end of their lifecycle.
Unlike other conventional methods to recycle silicon from PV devices, the new technique is not based on the use of highly toxic chemical hydrofluoric acid, which is commonly utilized in the PV industry for both quartz cleaning and wafer etching. In solar module recycling, the corrosive acid is used for separating silicon from the cell by removing the anti-reflecting coating, silver, lead, and p-n junction.
The corrosive acid was replaced by the Indian group with three different chemicals: a 10 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was applied to the aluminum layer for five minutes at 63 degrees Celsius; a 6 M solution of nitric acid (HNO3) was used to remove the silver electrodes and lead; and a solution of 90% phosphoric acid was used to remove the antireflecting coating based on silicon nitride (Si3NA4) for 45 minutes at 70 degrees Celsius.
The outer parts of a solar panel such as glass, ethylene-vinyl acetate glass, copper, steel, aluminum, and plastic were previously removed through thermal degradation.
According to the scientists, the proposed technique is able to deliver recycled silicon with a purity of up to 99.9984%. The recycling cost for 1 kg solar cell with this process is estimated at $68.9 and the total profit after recycling a 1 kg solar cell is calculated to be $185.4. The recovered silicon can be used to manufacture new solar cells or electronic components such as diodes, transistors, and microchips, they explained.
The recycling technique is also said to enable the recovery of aluminum, silver, and lead as aluminum hydroxide, silver chloride, and lead oxide, respectively. It is described in the paper “Recovery of Pure Silicon and Other Materials from Disposed Solar Cells,” published in the International Journal of Photoenergy.

Lazard released its Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis version 15.0 for Energy and Version 7.0 for Energy Storage.
According to the consultancy, utility-scale solar–both thin-film and crystalline silicon–as well as wind have the lowest LCOE of all U.S. sources considered, as in last year’s report.
The LCOE of unsubsidized large-scale PV based on crystalline silicon is estimated at $0.030-$0.042/kWh and that of grid-parity thin-film solar plants at $0.028-$0.037/kWh. For comparison, in 2020 Lazard reported that crystalline silicon achieved $0.031-$0.042/kWh and thin-film $0.029-$0.038/kWh.
The LCOE for residential PV is indicated at $0.147-$0.221/kWh and that of commercial and industrial rooftop solar at $0.067-$0.180/kWh.
Wind is still the cheapest electricity source with an LCOE of $0.026-$0.050/kWh, which is slightly lower than $0.026-$0.054/kWh last year. The cost decline for utility-scale solar, however, continues to be higher than that for onshore wind, Lazard emphasized.
Combined cycle gas has anLCOE of $0.045-$0.074/kWh, the lowest among conventional sources; that of coal and nuclear is $0.065-$0.152/kWh and $0.131-$0.204/kWh, respectively.
“When U.S. government subsidies are included, the cost of onshore wind and utility-scale solar continues to be competitive with the marginal cost of coal, nuclear and combined cycle gas generation,” Lazard said. Including these values, solar reaches an LCOE of $0.027/kWh and wind of $0.025/kWh, while coal and nuclear power achieve $0.042/kWh and $0.024/kWh, respectively.
As for the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) in the U.S., Lazard reported that unsubsidized storage projects operating on the spot market and with a capacity of 100 MW/100 MWh are able to deliver a value of $0.160-$0.279/kWh. Facilities with capacities of 100 MW/200 MWh and 100 MW/400 MW can reach $0.146-$0.257/kWh and $0.131-$0.232/kWh, respectively. Solar-plus-storage with a capacity of 50 MW/200 MWh is estimated to reach $0.085-$0.158/kWh.
In the residential segment, solar-plus-storage installations are said to achieve $0.416-$0.621/kWh. For the commercial segment this value was estimated at $0.235-$0.335/kWh.
