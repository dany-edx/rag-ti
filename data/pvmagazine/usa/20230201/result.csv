The solar installer currently has VPP operations in New England, New York, California, Arizona, and Hawaii, with plans to expand into more states and territories.
“A VPP is a virtual aggregation of distributed energy resources like PV, energy storage, EV chargers and demand-responsive devices (such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances),” said Jigar Shah, director, U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office in a previous Op-Ed provided to pv magazine.
Sunrun will make use of Lunar Gridshare software, an energy management system that currently manages over 35,000 home batteries in Japan and 1,600 in Europe. The new partnership will add tens of thousands of batteries aggregated in Lunar’s network, said the company. Lunar said it is also developing its own residential battery storage product, which will be available in the coming months.
“VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large-scale and utility-grade alternative to new generation and system buildout through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives,” said Shah. “By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants.”
A case study submitted to pv magazine on the potential of homes with solar-plus-storage as VPP participants can be found here. 
Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun, celebrated Lunar Gridshare’s ability to manage multiple devices from several different manufacturers at the same time, calling it a “game changer” for the company.
“To build the grid of the future, it is so powerful to be able to flawlessly orchestrate all the various distributed energy technologies in our customers’ homes,” said Powell.
Sunrun has been a pioneer in aggregating batteries in the U.S. In 2019, the residential installer secured a 20 MW bid to participate in New England’s ISO 2022-2023 forward capacity market, one of the first contracts of this type in the United States.
As part of the bid, Sunrun said it would deploy distributed solar and battery storage to about 5,000 customers in Massachusetts. It will be required to offer the grid 20 MW of power, 24 hours a day for the one-year period.
In return, Sunrun will be paid $3.80/kW/month, representing a $912,000 total contract value. Homeowners who signed up for the program agree to allow their battery to be discharged overnight. In exchange, they receive an upfront cash incentive as either a payment or a reduction in the upfront cost of their system.
 
In November, Sunrun was selected by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to deploy a 17 MW network of solar-plus-storage virtual power plants (VPP) across the Caribbean island.  The VPP network marks the first large-scale distributed storage program on the island to date.
Prone to repeat hurricanes over the past few years, Puerto Rico’s VPP network will harden the island’s power grid by networking more than 7,000 Sunrun residential solar plus energy storage systems.
“We’re solving energy insecurity on the island by switching the model so that solar energy is generated on rooftops and stored in batteries to power each home, and then shared with neighbors, creating a clean shared energy economy,” said Mary Powell, Sunrun CEO.
More than 3 million Puerto Rico residents were without power following the Hurricane Fiona landfall on Puerto Rico on September 17, while Sunrun customers on the island were able to use power through extended outages, providing more than 350,000 hours of backup power to thousands of homes.
Grid services
In a report published by the University of Otago in New Zealand, researchers found that that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving, two important services in a stable and efficient grid.

Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% for peak shaving.
The researchers said the results make a case for coordinated battery deployment at the street or building level for multiple economic benefits. These benefits include the potential reduction in energy storage cost for homeowners (who could buy a smaller unit), benefits to the grid in easing demand and load related strains, and benefits to solar developers who can add another value chain to their operations by facilitating these grid services.
As an example, if peak shaving occurred for demand above 3 kW per house, deploying batteries individually for 20 houses would require 120 kWh of storage.  By contrast, deploying batteries collectively would only require 7 kWh, the researchers said. Sharing batteries or having one battery per 20 houses would be a less expensive approach to providing these services, they said.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/01/global-energy-industry-is-at-an-inflection-point-said-utility-representative/,"MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",BRIAN SAVAGE,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023","Global energy industry is at an inflection point, said utility representative","In a recent interview in Electric Perspectives, Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Chair Warner Baxter explored how the global “polycrisis” presents an inflection point that the global energy industry can rally around.
From the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine triggering energy and food prices to soar, and rising inflation causing a cost-of-living crisis, among many others, historians claim the world today faces a polycrisis. These effects are compounded such that their overall impact exceeds the sum of each part. As the recent World Economic Forum Global Risks Perception Survey highlights, issues of energy and the growing pressure of climate change are the primary focus.
EEI, where Baxter serves as chairman, is the trade association that represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies that are responsible for providing electricity for more than 235 million Americans.
Summing up his first six months in his role at EEI, Baxter noted the common theme is that “extensive and genuine collaboration within the industry and with key stakeholders delivers significant benefits for our customers, our communities, and our country.”
These recent collaborations include advocating for new legislation on clean energy tax credits, responding to Hurricane Ian to restore power and recent multinational discussions between energy industry CEOs about more effective collaborations in the future. Baxter argued this spirit of collaboration is increasingly important amidst an “unprecedented time” in the energy industry’s history.
Unpacking what he meant by “unprecedented time,” Baxter explained that the war in Ukraine showed how energy can be used as a weapon, in addition to causing volatility in fuel supplies and energy prices, and impacting global supply chains.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shown the need “to take strong actions to enhance the nation’s energy security,” Baxter argues, amidst a changing cyber and physical threat landscape.
At the same time, climate change is contributing to more extreme weather events, which requires a greater focus on grid reliability and resilience. Lastly, Baxter expounded on how record levels of inflation are contributing to rising cost-of-living expenses as customers struggle with higher energy costs.
When asked what EEI is doing to address these issues, Baxter highlighted how the clean energy transition can operate as an axis for an array of complementary benefits. Transitioning to clean energy and advancing energy resilience, grid reliability, and customer affordability are not new areas of focus for EEI. Just as many of these issues are linked, their solution is as well.
Baxter argues that “executing critical investments in the clean energy transition” helps address all these issues, along with future climate change-induced impacts. However, Baxter notes “the velocity and significance of these issues all hitting at the same time” have caused a shift in how the entire industry strategizes.
When asked to expand upon what the industry is doing to address the clean energy transition, Baxter mentioned how EEI has fully committed to delivering clean energy and nearly all EEI member companies have implemented plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.  Baxter argues this is not just empty promises but is backed by “substantial investments in renewable energy, battery storage, existing and new nuclear energy, natural gas, new clean energy technologies, and transmission.” Part of this effort involves EEI advocating for federal and state energy policies like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act.
When asked what EEI members are doing to address customer affordability, Baxter highlighted several of the energy efficiency and energy assistance programs that EEI member companies offer. Baxter notes that Ameren Missouri created the Clean Slate Program to help eligible customers clear past-due balances and start fresh. The program is aimed at filling the gap for those who do not qualify for existing federal and state assistance. Lastly, Baxter notes that the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federal program that assists low-income households with paying their energy bills, recently received significant funding from Congress.
Baxter said it is critical that EEI members ensure their “customers have awareness and access to these critical programs,” as cost-of-living expenses continue to rise.  For example, recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey found that 24.75% of U.S. households reduced or forwent expenses for basic household necessities in order to pay for energy.
In conclusion, Baxter argues that the industry must not shy away from today’s challenges.  “We are leaning into them because we see today as an important inflection point for the electric power industry,” Baxter said.  As the backbone behind much of the country’s energy infrastructure, EEI’s strategy will be integral to this inflection point.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/01/solar-may-cover-the-worlds-electricity-demand-with-0-3-of-its-land-area/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023",Solar may cover the world’s electricity demand with 0.3% of its land area,"From pv magazine global
Solar energy could theoretically cover the world’s electricity demand by just 0.3% of its land area. This is one of the main conclusions of new research by a group of academic institutions, led by Aarhus University in Denmark. The researchers claim that raw materials and land availability will not present real barriers to PV in its race to dominate the global energy landscape.
The scientists claim that, for an average annual generation for solar of 1,370 kWh/kW, 38 million hectares would be needed. They noted that the world has a total area of 13,003 million hectares.
“Hence, our current electricity consumption could be supplied by solar PV covering 0.3% of the available land,” researcher Marta Victoria told pv magazine.
The researchers said conventional assumptions about global PV deployment for the years to come are generally based on land cover and cost projections that chiefly consider classic, densely packed, utility-scale power plants. They claim such projections ignore the potential of vertical PV, floating installations, agrivoltaics, and building-integrated arrays, as well as other innovative PV system configurations.
“Nevertheless, these embryonic applications show that there is still room for innovation at the system level,” the academics said. “In summary, although available land can limit solar PV at local levels, it will not be a limitation at a larger scale, and therefore, we recommend that models include accurate and up-to-date constraints based on materials and land availability.”
The scientists described their findings in “Solar photovoltaics is ready to power a sustainable future,” which was recently published in Joule. They said the efficiency of solar cell technologies will improve significantly in the future, and that could help to address land-limitation issues in specific locations. They also claimed that raw material availability might only be an issue only for thin-film PV tech, and not for crystalline silicon cells, which currently account for 95% of the global market.
“Thanks to the increase in efficiency and the use of thinner contact fingers, the use of silver per watt has significantly reduced in the last years, and copper or aluminum could be used as a replacement if necessary,” the research group stressed. “The noncell materials in PV (glass, plastic, aluminum, concrete, and steel) are not expected to represent a limit either.”
The researchers also reported that solar maintained a learning rate of 23% since 1976 and that the cost of the PV technology dropped by 23% every time the capacity doubled.
“Given that the learning rate is based on module prices, it also includes the elimination of big parts of the margins in PV manufacturing due to strong competition between suppliers,” the scientists said, noting that the main factors for cost reduction are efficiency increases, economies of scale, and scientific work on silicon materials.
The study also presents some challenges PV should face in the next decade. These include the creation of regulatory frameworks that reduce soft costs, reducing capital expenditure, enabling the electrification of other energy sectors via proper tax schemes, and strengthening research on improving PV efficiency and reliability.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/01/two-groups-challenge-grid-operator-rules-that-restrict-renewable-energy/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023",Two groups challenge grid operator rules that restrict renewable energy,"Earthjustice, an environmental law organization, filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on behalf of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), challenging a rule that prohibits renewables from providing ancillary services. The rule was instituted by grid operator Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) in 2011 and never challenged.
With this rule, MISO is the only FERC jurisdictional grid operator to explicitly prohibit wind, solar, and battery hybrid resources from providing ancillary services, Earthjustice reports. Ancillary services help grid operators maintain a reliable electricity system, balance supply and demand, ensure reliability during extreme weather events, and help the system recover after a power system outage. Allowing wind, solar and battery hybrid resources, known as dispatchable intermittent resources, to be eligible to provide ancillary services could lower overall system costs, and could make the grid more reliable and resilient to extreme weather and climate disasters.
The complaint states that MISO’s practices prohibit dispatchable intermittent resources (DIR) such as solar, wind and battery resources, from participating in MISO’s ancillary services market. The complaint claims that the prohibition “excludes DIRs from the opportunity to provide certain ancillary services – including regulation services, spinning reserves, and supplemental reserves – despite the fact that DIRS have the operational capability to provide such services”.
Earthjustice states in the complaint that MISO is alone in this “explicit discriminatory prohibition,” as other FERC regional transmission organizations (RTO) or independent system operators (ISO) find that wind and solar resources are eligible to provide these services. Ultimately, these tariff provisions can result in “unnecessary and deleterious market barriers”.
The Complaint requests two primary actions:
MISO serves 45 million people in 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba, with a reported $40 billion in annual transactions. The amount of energy produced from wind and solar is expected to increase significantly in the MISO region in the coming years, all of which have proven the ability to provide ancillary services, according to Earthjustice.
“Regional transmission authorities should not restrict the services that renewables can provide,” said Aaron Stemplewicz, senior attorney of Earthjustice. “Any backsliding will be rigorously challenged with regard to the eligibility of renewable resources to provide all the services they are capable of providing,” he said.
“For the last decade, the MISO has been discriminating against renewable generators, and it’s time that FERC corrects the record and gives renewables a fair shot,” said Melissa Alfano, director of energy markets and counsel at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “The fact is the grid is changing and energy markets need to keep up. Renewable assets like solar, storage and wind have more than proven themselves as reliable, and we need to recognize the full scope of their benefits if we want to rapidly decarbonize.”
MISO also plans to file a request with FERC to remove ramp capability eligibility for renewable resources as well. Ramp capability refers to the ability of a power system to quickly increase or decrease its output to accommodate changes in electricity demand. Ramp shortages are the most common cause of short-term scarcities and price spikes.
Stemplewicz said that Earthjustice will also challenge any attempts to strip wind, solar and battery hybrid resources from providing ramp capability.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/01/50-states-of-solar-incentives-indiana/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,NET METERING,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIANA",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023",50 states of solar incentives: Indiana,"The solar market in Indiana has been restricted to large utility-scale projects in recent years, as May 2017 saw the reversal of a net metering mechanism destroy the value of rooftop solar for its 6.8 million residents.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects Indiana will add just under 7.4 GW of solar over the next five years, placing it within the top 10 states for solar development outlook. Currently there are eight projects operating in the state with 1.4 GW of power capacity.
Indiana’s Clean Energy Portfolio Standard (CPS) is significantly lower than comparable states. Known as the Comprehensive Hoosier Option to Incentivize Cleaner Energy (CHOICE) program, the utility program was enacted in May 2011 by Senate Bill 251 and sets a voluntary goal of generating 10% renewable energy off the grid by 2025.
With five investor-owned utilities operating in state, Indiana ranked third in the country in 2021 in total coal consumption and coal power generation, trailing just Texas and Missouri. Coal power represents 58% of Indiana’s electricity mix for the year, according to the Energy Information Administration.
While Indiana is the sixth largest producer of grain ethanol in the U.S., just 1.4 GW of solar and 2.3 GW of wind turbines power the state, or 2% and 8% respectively of the Hoosier State’s generation mix.
SEIA
Incentives
On January 4, the Indiana Supreme Court  ruled in favor of utility Vectren’s decision to end certain benefits for residential PV system owners. Vectren, now a CenterPoint Energy utility, argued a new subsidy scheme following a 2017 state law would short change residents who generate more energy than they consume, thwarting a net metering credit system.
The state’s Senate Bill 309, in place since May 2017, phased out retail rate net metering and replaced the former 1:1 kWh bill credit with a much smaller credit based on 125% of the utilities’ wholesale rate. That change in compensation resulted in a bill credit that is approximately 70% to 80% lower than what customers receive for retail rate net metering.
While this changed the level of compensation that solar homeowners would receive, it did not change the method by which the compensation rate would be applied. Homeowners would still be credited at that rate, multiplied by the kWh difference between the electricity that they imported from the grid and the electricity they exported to the grid.
Like most states, Indiana makes solar exempt from property taxes. Like all states and territories, residents are offered the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which covers 30% of system costs. The ITC is now available to many customers as a direct payment following new provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Community solar
The Hoosier State does not yet have an active community solar program that allows for retail subscription to solar energy. Senator Shelli Yoder (D-Bloomington) introduced community solar legislation, SB 313, into the state in early 2021 but the bill has not yet been heard. Under the proposed legislation, Indiana utilities would be required to install at least five community solar projects within their service territory.
Yoder told local public radio station WFYI that community solar projects would provide more stable energy prices for lower-income residents and revitalize their communities. “Lower-income communities can use their newly attained saving toward other expenses, personal savings, or contribute to the economy,” Yoder told the station.
Notable project
Located 18 miles from the Ohio border in Modoc, Indiana, the 200 MW Riverstart Solar Project entered commercial operations in January 2022.  With $180 million in capital contributions, Riverstart was built by EDP Renewables North America and provides enough power for 36,000 homes. Hoosier Energy, a rural electric cooperative, is the offtake customer for the project.
Following completion, EDP Renovaveis sold an 80% equity interest in Riverstart Solar to infrastructure fund Connor Clark & Lunn Infrastructure.
For now Riverstart holds the title for largest solar project in Indiana, but the title may be usurped by NextEra Energy Resources, which has a 250 MW solar plus 180 MWh energy storage project in the development stages in Pike County, Indiana. That project is on track to be built by May 2024.

Enteligent enables solar and EV users to shift daily energy consumption habits. The company’s proprietary solar optimization technology uses a rapid shutdown safety capability that optimizes the local delivery and use of solar generation and provides monitoring to maintain maximum solar production.
In the EV category, Enteligent reports that its EV charger takes DC electricity directly from solar with dramatically more usable energy, leading to significant cost savings per kW. The charger is an ideal solution for residential, commercial, and industrial customers who want to maximize renewable energy output.
Currently, EVs are primarily charged overnight using, in most cases, the fossil fuel-powered grid. The proliferation of EVs is straining the grid’s ability to handle the exponential growth in energy demand.  The company’s solar EV chargers expedite a fundamental shift from the daily peak power curve, often refered to as the ‘duck curve’ to provide daily solar-based, daytime charging, eliminating DC to AC to DC power conversions, resulting in up to 25% in energy savings.
“Our vision is to deliver technology that solves the near-term electrification challenges stemming from the EV revolution—ubiquitous daytime EV charging, everywhere you park, with efficient use of clean, on-site generated solar electricity,” said Sean Burke, founder and chief executive officer of Enteligent.

The company’s NMax product is a solar PV module-level monitoring system that has tested at 99.8% pass-through efficiency in full sun. The module is plug and play with its rapid shutdown feature, requiring no network set-up using solid-state design that requires 30% fewer components. The NMax has a 25-year manufacturer warranty. At 80V per input, the module supports 900 watts of power, or 450 W per input in the A2 model. A beefier B1 model is also tested at 100V input. The A1 module measures 4.4 inches x 4.6 inches, while the A2 measures 4.4 inches x 5.1 inches, weighing 1.54 to 1.66 pounds respectively. The module is tested to operate in -40 degrees F to 185 degrees F environments, and sells for $65 to $70 (before tax) on the company’s website.
Enteligent
EV fast charger
Enteligent’s DC fast charger is the first fast charger powered directly from the sun, the company says, making it three times faster than Level 2 AC chargers and without power components such as rectifiers, at a fraction of the cost of traditional DC chargers on the market.
The EV charger operates at 200V to 500V output for CCS Combo EV connectors, providing 15 kW of power over a 25-foot cable. Using stringed PV modules at 15 kW plus 15 kW of batteries, when combined with 9.6 kW of AC power saved from having to convert to DC, the charger providers a steady 24.6 kW of power output over a 400V system, which is 3x faster than a traditional AC charger system.
The company anticipates shipping its first EV chargers in late Q2 2023.
Enteligent
NMax RSS transmitter
The company’s rapid-shutdown system transmitter generates a ‘permission to operate’ signal for rapid shutdown of PV to EV charging systems. The transmitter is compatible with the other NMax modules as well as other SunSpec brand devices. The unit features bidirectional powerline communication using rooftop MLPE, which other inverter companies like Tigo Energy also use. The Enteligent transmitter features a coupled transformer design that is DIN rail for inverter configurable and weatherproof-rated at IP-68 for external wall-mount box set up. The transmitter is available in voltage configurations of 600V(dc) or 1,000V(dc), with each unit providing the ability to string 4 solar inputs. The transmitter box measures 10.2 inches x 6.3 inches x 3.9 inches depth, with its DIN rail box measuring at 3.8 inches x 1.8 inches x 1.6 inches depth.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/02/01/five-community-solar-projects-coming-to-disadvantaged-communities-in-california/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CALIFORNIA",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023",Five community solar projects coming to disadvantaged communities in California,"Local Green Saver, a program of Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), is designed to bring the benefits of solar energy to residents in disadvantaged communities. Renewable Properties, a developer and investor in small-scale utility and community solar projects based in San Francisco, recently signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for five projects to be built under this program with PG&E.
The projects total nearly 30 MW and are part of California’s Disadvantaged Communities (DAC) and Community Solar Green Tariff (CS-GT) programs enacted by AB327 in 2013. CS-GT, which PG&E branded “Local Green Saver”. The program is designed to promote the installation of community solar projects in disadvantaged communities, as defined by CalEnviroScreen. Eligible residents who subscribe benefit from 100% off-site solar power and receive a 20% bill credit on their PG&E bill.
“Through these Green Tariff projects, Renewable Properties is bringing solar energy to communities that have historically been left out of the clean energy transition, while being disproportionately affected by pollution and climate change,” said Brian von Moos, chief development officer of Renewable Properties. “The projects will allow low-income families to save on their electricity bills, even if they can’t put solar on their own roof.”
The five projects will fulfill the remaining capacity of PG&E’s Disadvantaged Communities Green Tariff program. They will generate enough energy to power over 5,345 homes and offset over 43,397 tons of CO2 annually. Initially the projects will not include energy storage, but it potentially could be added in the future.
The first three projects, East Cleveland Solar and Avenue 26 Solar Phase I and Phase II, will commence construction in the early Spring of 2023 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2023. The East Cleveland Solar project will be built in Merced County, Calif. and produce enough energy to power 748 homes per year and offset 5,938 tons of CO2 annually. Avenue 26 Solar Phase I and II will be built in Madera County, Calif. Together, they will offset 16,708 of CO2 annually and produce enough energy to power 2,105 homes.
The 7.0 MW Althea Avenue Solar project in the County of Fresno, Calif. will begin construction at the end of 2023, and is estimated to produce enough energy to power 1,182 homes per year and to offset 10,347 tons of CO2 annually. The project is expected to be completed by September 2024.
Renewable Properties will also build the Canyon Road Solar project in Merced County, Calif., scheduled to commence construction in March of 2024 and also be completed by the end of the year. The nearly 7 MW project will produce enough energy to power 1,310 homes per year and to offset 10,404 tons of CO2 annually.
Founded in 2017, Renewable Properties specializes in developing and investing in small-scale utility and community solar and storage energy projects throughout the United States. The company is active in 16 states and has over 650 MWs of solar under development with over 115 MWs under construction or in operation. In December 2022, for example, Renewable Properties acquired a 40 MW community solar portfolio in Maine from NextGrid.
California recently passed AB 2316, the Community Renewable Energy Act, which is currently being developed by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The new law creates a community renewable energy program, which includes community solar-plus-storage, to overcome access barriers for nearly half of Californians who rent or have low incomes as it includes a requirement that 51% of the program serves low-income customers and incentivizes incorporating energy storage with community solar projects. The law was passed just after California slashed incentives for rooftop solar,  while the federal government opens up funds via the IRA to boost cleantech over the next decade.
The Biden Administration set a goal this year to sign up 5 million community solar households, achieving $1 billion in bill savings by 2025. The community solar model only represents about 8% of the total distributed solar capacity in the nation. This target would entail a jump from 3 GW installed capacity to 20 GW by the target year.
