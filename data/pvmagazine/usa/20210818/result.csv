https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/08/18/action-urged-on-alleged-solar-pv-dumping-from-3-southeast-asian-countries/,"LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 18, 2021",Action urged on alleged solar PV dumping from 3 Southeast Asian countries,"A group of companies that decline to be named but say they are players in the U.S. solar industry have asked the U.S. Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
(Read “Solar modules are being detained by customs agents, reports suggest.”)
The group asked the Commerce Department to investigate the following companies:
Malaysia: Jinko Solar Technology Sdn. Bhd.; LONGi (Kuching) Sdn. Bhd. and its affiliate Vina Cell Technology Company Limited and Vina Solar Technology Company Limited; JA Solar (Malaysia) Co., Ltd. or JA Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.
Thailand: Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Trina Solar Science & Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Talesun Solar Technologies Thailand or Talesun Technologies (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Astroenergy Solar Thailand Co., Ltd
Vietnam: Trina Solar (Vietnam) Science & Technology Co., Ltd.; Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Vietnam) Co., Ltd.; China Sunergy Co., Ltd. in Vietnam; Boviet Solar Technology (Vietnam) Co., Ltd. or Boviet Solar Technology Co., Ltd.; GCL System Integration Technology (Vietnam) Co. Ltd.; Vina Cell Technology Company Limited and Vina Solar Technology Company Limited; LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd.; JinkoSolar (Vietnam) Co., Ltd.
The Commerce Department has 45 days to initiate an investigation based on the petitions, said Timothy Brightbill, a partner in the Wiley Rein law firm. A preliminary determination could be issued in 180 days with a final determination in around a year’s time. He said that any duties would be retroactive to the start of the investigation.
Brightbill said in an interview with pv magazine USA that the group’s requested action is similar to action taken in relation to cold-rolled and corrosion-resistant steel from China. After duties were put in place, Chinese companies were found to be sending steel to third countries for final processing before being exported to the U.S. In that case, tariffs were imposed country-wide. The scope being sought by the group he represents is more narrowly focused on a handful of companies.
He declined to name members of the antidumping organization, saying that “Given the Chinese control of the entire solar supply chain, retaliation is likely if their identities are revealed.” In such situations, the companies who make up the coalition “are allowed under U.S. law to remain confidential,” he said.
The Energy Information Administration’s 2020 Annual Solar Photovoltaic Module Shipments Report, released on July 30, said that solar PV imports totaled just under 19.3 million peak kilowatts, and exports totaled 376,483 peak kilowatts.
The EIA report listed Vietnam as the top source of PV imports to the U.S. at 8.1 million peak kilowatts. South Korea and Thailand combined were second at 4.4 million peak kilowatts, and Malaysia was third at 3.2 million peak kilowatts. The report lumped together imports from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, which totaled less than 950,000 peak kilowatts.
The original AD and CVD investigations on imports of crystalline silicon PV cells were launched in November 2011. The U.S. International Trade Commission separately determined that U.S. producers were being materially hurt by the imports, and the Commerce Department in December 2012 imposed import tariffs. In 2019, the Department extended both import tariff orders.
The current antidumping China-wide rate is 238.95%. Certain Canadian Solar companies and certain JinkoSolar companies received 95.50% AD rates in the last completed review, the petition said. Certain Trina Solar companies received a 92.52% AD rate, also in the last completed review.  The countervailing duty “all others” rate is 15.24%,  although certain Canadian Solar, Trina Solar, and Jinko Solar companies received a 11.97% CVD rate in the last completed review.
In their petition, the U.S. companies complain that after AD/CVD duties were imposed on Chinese-origin solar cells, Chinese integrated producers started building cell and module assembly plants across Southeast Asia, while continuing “to rely heavily” on Chinese labor, raw materials, and inputs.

The petition alleged that “Chinese producers have developed a circumvention scheme” that involves moving the end of the production process for CSPV products to a third country “for the express purpose of avoiding AD/CVD duties.” At the same time, the Chinese producers retained “as much of the subsidized supply chain and labor as possible in China.”
The petition also claimed that China’s share of global capital expenditures continues to grow and to “dwarf” the rest of the world. For example, in 2020, China accounted for around 80% of solar-related polysilicon production in 2020, and 95% of global production of wafers in 2019.
In turn, most of the CSPV products imported into the United States arrive from Southeast Asia post-assembly, the petition said. But around 70% of the actual value of the equipment accrues to China where key pre-assembly steps in the making of the equipment take place, including production of solar-grade silicon, ingots, wafers, and cells.

As a result, production costs from Southeast Asian nations generally account for around 27% of the value of a typical PV module exported to the U.S., the petition said. This is despite those nations most likely being the last port of call before final, assembled equipment arrives in the U.S.
The petition claimed that in 2011, the U.S. imported $336,806 of CSPV cells and modules from Thailand. Since then, imports from Thailand have increased to over $1.4 billion in 2020. Through the first five months of 2021, imports from Thailand reached $532 million of imports. In addition, Thai import value share of CSPV cells and modules went from a 0.01% share of total U.S. imports in 2010 to nearly 20% in the first five months of 2021.
Similarly, the U.S. imported $1.3 million of CSPV cells and modules from Vietnam in 2011, the petition alleged. Since then, Vietnamese imports have risen to more than $1.6 billion in 2020, and more than $681 million in the first five months of 2021. Vietnam’s import value share of CSPV cells and modules went from less than a 1% share in 2010 to nearly 25% in the first five months of 2021.
Finally, U.S. imports of CSPV cells and modules from Malaysia rose from around $576 million in 2011 to more than $2.3 billion in 2020.
The petition concluded that these import trends “are a strong indication” that Chinese producers “are circumventing” antidumping and countervailing duty orders by shipping Chinese-origin components to the three Southeast Asian countries for completion into CSPV cells or modules “to be sold at dumped and subsidized prices” in the United States.

And while many of these efforts have been successful to some degree, opponents of solar are not nearly batting 1.000. Previous entries in this series have included studies of specific campaigns that have failed to weaken rooftop solar, specifically Florida’s Amendment 1 in 2016. In our final examination of this report, pv magazine looks at the policy and regulatory actions that the authors believe can be effective tools to stop anti-solar efforts.
The first recommendation is to be iron-willed. Basically, net metering and other pro-distributed generation policies can’t come under attack if those attacks are discouraged from the start.
The report calls on decision makers to reject caps, restrictions on or elimination of net metering; rollbacks or elimination of state renewable energy standards; unfair or discriminatory charges or tariffs on solar power system owners; utility rate structures that penalize or discourage solar installation; and broader, unneeded regulatory burdens on solar energy.
These recommendations assume that the decision makers themselves support residential solar.
Outside of blocking attempts to discourage the resource, those in positions of power should further leverage their influence to promote policies that support the growth of rooftop solar, according to the authors.
Lawmakers must consider the full set of benefits distributed solar energy brings to the grid, ratepayers, and to society when making policy decisions. Additional policy recommendations include but aren’t limited to:
For the energy transition to be a successful one, distributed generation will have a major role to play, and the authors of the report said that people holding positions of power are duty-bound to drive solar-friendly policies and advocacy.
While this is where the report ends, battles still rage daily against anti-solar policies and groups that look to undermine the resource. Moreover, there have been countless fights that this report was unable to cover, as there certainly will be in the future. If you are involved in or would like to bring attention to an ongoing or upcoming attack on distributed generation, reach out, and your testimony can help to continue this series.

The grant was awarded after the company demonstrated its process for coating organic semiconducting material onto large sheets of heat-treated glass. The company said its method will allow for a smoother application into the window manufacturing process, leading to higher margins and low capital cost of equipment. 
Funding will be used to produce pilot-sized photovoltaic windows and to perform a demonstration of the entire production process over the next several months, said NEXT.
The photovoltaic coatings are applied during the window fabrication process, integrating with established manufacturers without disrupting workflows and supply chains. NEXT Energy said its approach removes costs typically associated with packaging and installation of solar.
NEXT said a typical commercial high-rise office building installed with its first-generation windows could offset as much as 10-20% of the building’s power needs. Over a 30-year period, the building could produce 20 million kWh of clean energy, saving an annual average of $170,000 on utility bills, the company said.
The funding win follows a recent pilot of NEXT’s proof-of-concept window wall, a 5 ft. x 10 ft. display in Paris.
Earlier in August, the CEC adopted the 2022 Building Energy Efficiency Standards that includes plans to expand solar PV systems and battery storage standards for all California buildings. The Energy Code will be submitted to the California Building Standards Commission and if approved, will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.

Chinese state-controlled manufacturer Luoyang Glass said the nation produced 42,000 tons of polysilicon and 14 GW of solar modules in June alone.
The glassmaker reported the numbers as it announced its first-half figures, and said China had made 238,000 tons of polysilicon in the first half of the year, as well as 105 GW of silicon wafers, 92.4 GW of solar cells and 80.2 GW of solar modules.
Luoyang said those figures were “recently released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology” and amounted to a 57% year-on-year rise in cell output, a 51% hike in module production, a 40% uplift in wafer manufacturing and 16% growth in polysilicon output.
The bumper effect of solar panel glass prices which continued to rise into the first quarter of this year was illustrated by a first-half net profit of RMB222 million ($34.2 million) from Luoyang’s new energy glass unit, a rise from RMB68.8 million in January-to-June last year. The 2021 six-month figure came from new energy operating income of RMB1.4 billion ($216 million), up from RMB822 million ($127 million) a year ago.
By contrast, Luoyang’s other main business, providing glass for information displays, posted a first-half net profit of RMB25.6 million ($3.95 million), from operating income of RMB195 million ($30 million).
The manufacturer said two new solar module glass production facilities in Hefei and Tongcheng remain on track to start operations next month and in November, respectively, and added plans are progressing for another new fab in Yixing.

Japanese PV module recycling specialist Next Energy and Resources Co Ltd, and Japan-based Japanese conglomerate Marubeni Corporation are planning to use blockchain technology in the process of identifying solar modules at the end of their lifecycle that are suitable for recycling or reuse.
The technology, which is currently being developed with the support of the Japanese Ministry of Environment and the Mitsubishi Research Institute, should be able to inspect the solar modules and provide data on traceability and components used, as well as verify that these data were not modified or tampered with.
The use of this transparent technique, according to Next Energy, will enable the identification of a larger amount of modules that can still be reused or recycled, which would result in a reduction of the amount of waste in landfills and, in the case of modules being reused, would also lower their carbon footprint.
No more technical details on the inspection technology were provided.
Next Energy has been active in the PV module recycling business with its “Reborn” set of standards since 2005. It claims to have inspected more than 140,000 used modules to date.
