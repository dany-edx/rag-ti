Right at the start of the year, the Biden administration created significant battery and EV demand through the “Made in America” executive order, signed in January. The order directs the federal government to replace its entire existing vehicle fleet with EVs.
At the beginning of February, Ford announced plans to almost double its EV investment to $22 billion through 2025. Along with the Mustang Mach-E, the company’s first electric Mustang, Ford plans to roll out its first E-Transit commercial van in late 2021 and an all-electric F-150 pickup in mid-2022.
The company also announced a $1.8 billion investment to produce fully electric vehicles at one of Ford’s Lincoln brand manufacturing plants in Canada, as well as started construction on a new factory to build the upcoming F-150 electric pickup next to an existing plant in Michigan.
Earlier this week, Toyota announced it will be unveiling two EVs for the U.S. market as 2022 models, as part of a plan to introduce 10 new EVs worldwide in the “early 2020s.”
Ultimately, Toyota plans to have 40% of all new vehicles be electrified by 2025 and 70% of all new vehicles be electrified by 2030. The automaker is also working on releasing a solid-state-battery-powered vehicle in the early 2020s.
While the federal government and leading automakers are now quickly working toward the electric transportation revolution, not all states have been as willing to embrace the change.

The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) recently released the State Transportation Electrification Scorecard, a report which analyzes and grades the comprehensive steps that some states have taken to help enable residents and businesses to use and charge EVs–and the lack of action taken by others.

Unsurprisingly, California led the way, garnering 91 out of a possible 100 points. It is the only state to set deadlines for electrifying transit buses, heavy trucks, and commercial vehicles and one of a few to offer assistance for lower-income drivers replacing older, high-polluting cars with zero- or near-zero-emissions vehicles. The state also plans to deploy chargers in economically distressed and environmental justice communities.
Following California were New York (63.5 points), Washington, D.C. (59), Maryland (56), Massachusetts (54.5), Washington (54), Vermont (54), Colorado (48), Oregon (47), and New Jersey (44). Twenty states earned 15 points or fewer.
The report also looked at the country regionally, highlighting one standout state in each region. New York led the Northeast because of incentives for individuals and fleet owners to purchase EVs, state and utility support for EV charging installations, and EV infrastructure equity programs.

Colorado led the Southwest because of the state’s adopted goal of having 940,000 EVs on its roadways by 2030, incentives for EV charging investments, and requirements for utilities to file plans for EV charging infrastructure.
Minnesota led the Midwest because state regulators issued guidelines on utilities’ investment in charging stations, bringing $23.6 million in funding, and the state has signaled its intent to adopt California’s zero-emissions vehicle program for personal vehicles.
Virginia led the Southeast due to solid incentives for electric trucks and buses, time-varying electric rates for home and workplace chargers, and steps to decarbonize the electric grid.
After combing through policies and evaluating each state individually, ACEEE found three policies that have the greatest impact for spurring adoption of EVs: zero-emissions vehicle mandates and EV deployment targets; financial incentives for EV purchases; and incentives for installing vehicle chargers.
While these have been found to be the most effective policies for spurring the transition to electric transportation, they aren’t the most commonly used. According to ACEEE, the most common policies are using federal funds to buy electric transit buses (48 states), utility programs that offer lower electric rates at preferred times for Level 2 EV charging (36 states), and incentives to buy large electric pickups and delivery trucks (27 states).

(MMWEC), the state’s joint action agency for municipal utilities, announced plans to build a 7 MW, $14.5 million solar project at its facility in Ludlow, an hour west of Boston. Six MMWEC municipal utility members are participating in the project.
The ground-mounted solar project will be built on a 30-acre section of MMWEC’s 200-acre property. After receiving responses to its request for proposals, MMWEC is working on a contract with EDF Renewables Distributed Solutions Inc. as the project developer.
Using its unique statutory financing authority as a political subdivision of the Massachusetts government, MMWEC plans to use a local financial institution to issue tax-exempt revenue bonds to finance the project.
Municipal utilities serving Boylston, Ipswich, Mansfield, Marblehead, Peabody, and Wakefield are participating in the project. The project was developed in alignment with the state’s decarbonization goals. It enables member utilities that may not have locations for projects within their own communities to add more solar to their power portfolios.
Construction is scheduled to start this summer, with the project expected to come online by late 2021. Local contractors will be favored, the sponsors said.
According to a local report, all but one of the six municipal utilities previously partnered on a 19.6 MW wind farm, which began operations in 2011 and represented a total investment in excess of $76 million.

Developed, owned, and operated by Lightsource bp, the Elk Hill 2 solar farm will help SEPTA meet its sustainability goals through a power purchase agreement. It is one of two solar projects totaling 43.8 MW that SEPTA and Lightsource bp announced on Earth Day last year.
Elk Hill 2 will generate an estimated 27,377 MWh of energy, or around 7% of SEPTA’s 380,000 MWh annual electricity demand.
Lightsource bp and project investors fully funded the project, representing an estimated $18 million investment into energy infrastructure for Pennsylvania. Elk Hill 2 includes over 43,800 bifacial solar panels on trackers.
SEPTA is among the nation’s largest transit systems, with a network of fixed-route services in and around Philadelphia.
“This project is a win-win, creating good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians while locking in low prices with a clean energy source for SEPTA,” said SEPTA Board Chairman Pasquale T. Deon Sr.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/11/sunrise-brief-good-solar-makes-good-neighbors-researchers-say/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021","Sunrise brief: Good solar makes good neighbors, researchers say","With apologies to the poet Robert Frost who wrote “good fences make good neighbors,” it seems that installing solar panels on your house is the neighborly thing to do.
A professor of electrical and computer engineering at Michigan Technological University has shown that grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) owners subsidize their non-PV neighbors. Solar homeowners also help utilities avoid making many infrastructure investments, and shave peak demand when electricity is the most expensive.
The researchers also found that grid-tied PV-owning utility customers largely are under-compensated for their neighborliness. That’s because the value of solar eclipses both the net metering and two-tiered rates that many utilities pay for solar electricity. The research is published online and will be in the March issue of Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.
The researchers argued that the overall value of solar equation has multiple components:
They said that one conclusion is that “substantial future regulatory reform” is needed to ensure that grid-tied solar PV owners are not “unjustly subsidizing U.S. electric utilities.” Solar PV, they said, is “truly an economic benefit” that is in the best interest of all utility customers.
Wyoming state legislators are considering a bill to impose an excise tax on utility-scale solar energy produced in the state.
House Bill 94 would create a tax on utility-scale solar energy production. The proposed excise tax would be at a rate of $1 per megawatt hour of electricity.
The state already taxes wind production. The legislation would tax solar at the same rate as wind. People with solar panels on their homes would not be affected as the tax would only apply to utility-scale production. Currently, there is only one such solar array in the state, the 80 MW Sweetwater Solar Energy Project.
The state could receive up to $190,000 in fiscal 2023 and 2024 based on 2019 Wyoming solar generation capacity, with $114,000 going to the county where the energy is generated and $76,000 going to the state’s general fund.
In January, Wyoming lawmakers advanced a piece of legislation that, if passed, would repeal the state’s decades-old net metering system and direct the state’s utility regulators to create a new program.
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) released an enhanced and expanded version of the Renewable Energy Data Explorer (RE Data Explorer), a publicly available geospatial analysis tool that can inform renewable energy policy, investment, and deployment decisions.
This release includes a redesigned user interface; the addition of high spatial and temporal resolution solar resource data for Southeast Asia; and wind, solar, and complementary data for many countries. Over the coming weeks, renewable energy data sets will be added for the entire world.
State regulators, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and other stakeholders cited a too-short timeline as one challenge wholesale markets face in implementing FERC Order 2222, which is intended to bring more distributed energy resources (DERs) online.
Several parties reportedly expressed concerns during a National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners session on Tuesday that the most difficult challenges of implementation still lie ahead, and said they hoped the FERC would give them more time to ensure they get the policy right.
Stakeholders said the order has the potential to create a boon for greater deployment of resources such as energy storage, rooftop solar, and electric vehicles, among others.
One challenge that was cited was ensuring that grid operators, utilities, and distributed energy resource aggregators can communicate effectively to ensure safety and reliability.
Compliance filings are due to FERC on July 19. Some RTOs and their stakeholder groups are expected to seek an extension.
