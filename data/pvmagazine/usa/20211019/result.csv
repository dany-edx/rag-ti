According to local press, the state is moving this equipment to make room for new equipment Tesla has already purchased for planned expansions of its operations at the RiverBend manufacturing facility. The state is framing the story to say that the jobs and local benefits created by the plant will outweigh any losses that come from the equipment sale.
DEVELOPING STORY (thread): New York State is in the process of selling and/or scrapping manufacturing equipment it purchased for Tesla and Panasonic, originally valued at $207 million. These purchase were originally part of the Buffalo Billion.

The equipment is being sold by NY CREATES, the state-associated non-profit overseeing the RiverBend facility. Investments in the facility and equipment were initially made by the state, under agreements that Tesla and Panasonic would lease both the facility and use the equipment.
Most of the equipment, which was reportedly purchased in 2015 and early 2016 before Tesla acquired SolarCity, was used by Panasonic prior to the company’s departure from RiverBend in 2020.
Of the $207 million in equipment being sold, roughly $125 million was used by Panasonic. Some $32 million in equipment will remain at the facility and be used by Tesla. An additional $22 million worth of equipment that had been stored in a local business park will be recycled.
It has reportedly cost the state more than $200,000 to store the equipment. It is also expected that the equipment resale will be for a lower price than the equipment’s original evaluation.
NEW: NY Creates is selling tools and equipment used by Tesla and Panasonic at Riverbend. Much of the tools were ordered prior to Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity, and well before Panasonic’s involvement, according to a spokesperson. @WKBW pic.twitter.com/7ZlebONrx9

Reports also said that NY CREATES is having difficulty selling the equipment due to its specialized nature, and that the state has hired a global financial services group to remarket it. The state has not disclosed its return on the equipment that has been sold thus far, hoping not to negatively impact negotiations.

“We are laser focused on deploying more solar power and developing more cost-effective technologies to decarbonize our electricity system,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm in announcing the awards. She said that research to develop stronger and longer-lasting solar panels is critical to addressing the climate crisis.
Awardees included:
$6 million awarded across 21 projects to test novel ideas in both PV and CSP and that can produce significant results in less than two years. These projects have a streamlined application process that is designed to encourage applications from engineering and science researchers in traditionally underrepresented groups, as well as early-career researchers.
DOE said it will seek further input on future research needs. Specifically, it requestedD information for proposed research areas for supporting U.S. solar manufacturing, and performance targets for perovskite photovoltaics.

Willow Springs is a 72 MW solar, 36 MW (144 MWh) storage project that is expected to supply enough energy to serve around 27% of VCE’s 125,000 customers. Leeward will own and operate the facility. Construction is set to begin this December. 
The facility is expected to begin delivering power by the end of 2023.  Under the agreement, Leeward will contribute to VCE’s workforce development and sustainability efforts, and support local hiring and training. 
The project is Leeward’s fourth PPA serving customers of community choice aggregators (CCA) in the Kern County area, which is north of Los Angeles. 
Also slated to begin construction in Kern County this December is Leeward’s Chaparral Solar facility, which is planned to sell its power to Peninsula Clean Energy, a CCA that serves San Mateo County. The project is a 102 MW solar, 52 MW (208 MWh) storage facility that is  expected to come online by the end of 2023.
Leeward largely has built wind energy projects in the past, but said it is now moving into the solar space and has a project development pipeline across 23 states. Leeward is a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, an investment arm of one of Canada’s largest pension plans.

Pfizer signs 15-year deal for 310 MW of Texas solar. The solar energy will be generated from Vesper’s 500 MW Hornet Solar project in west Texas.
Mississippi project joins the growing list of hydrogen ventures. The facility is expected to produce 110 million kg of green hydrogen annually and store more than 70 million kg in underground salt caverns.
REV Renewables gains backing from South Korean conglomerate. The deal will include a $300 million to $400 million investment to support REV’s portfolio of renewable power and energy storage projects.

During its first phase, the Mississippi facility is expected to produce an estimated 110 million kilograms of green hydrogen annually and store more than 70 million kg in underground salt caverns. Pending regulatory approvals and equipment availability, the hub’s first phase could enter commercial service by 2025.
The hydrogen hub will have co-located production, transmission, pipeline, rail, and other infrastructure.
Connor Clark’s investment mandate targets traditional and energy infrastructure assets and companies, including power generation, electricity transmission and distribution, and energy storage, among other projects. The firm is an investor and owner of renewable energy assets and has a current global portfolio of 1.4 GW of generating capacity.
The large-scale hydrogen project is the latest in a series of recent announcements.
In mid-October, Air Products said it planned to build a $4.5 billion blue hydrogen at a complex in Louisiana. The company said it would build, own, and operate the project, which is planned to produce over 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, south of Baton Rouge. The project is expected to create 170 permanent jobs and represents Air Products’ largest-ever investment in the U.S. The project is expected to be operational in 2026.
And in April, Koch Engineered Solutions said that two of its business units would partner with Fidelis Infrastructure to develop the Grön Fuels renewable energy complex in Louisiana. The $9.2 billion multi-year program would produce green hydrogen, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuels, and bio-plastic feedstocks. The project also includes biogenic carbon capture and sequestration.
A final investment decision on the Koch-backed project is expected in 2021, and will determine the final cost of the project’s first phase.

The solar energy will be generated from Vesper’s 500 MW Hornet Solar project in west Texas, which will be fully operational by the end of 2023. The project will use solar panels from an unnamed supplier and a single-axis tracking system. Hornet Solar will interconnect to Oncor Electric’s transmission system in ERCOT, the Texas transmission grid.
Based near Dallas, Vesper Energy is a developer, owner, and operator of utility-scale renewable energy and energy storage assets. It has commercialized more than 680 MW of solar projects in the U.S. and has a 3 GW solar and 2.5 GWh energy storage development pipeline. Vesper Energy started as Lendlease Energy Development in 2015 and rebranded as Vesper Energy in 2020 after Magnetar Capital partnered with management to acquire the business.
In November 2020 it closed a letter of credit  facility with Macquarie Group for up to $100 million. The company said it would use the facility to post securities for power purchase agreements and interconnection agreements with energy transmission networks like PJM, CAISO, and ERCOT.
In June, the company expanded the  letter of credit facility to $140 million. It added two banks to its facility, Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen Girozentrale and ICBC Standard Bank Plc.
