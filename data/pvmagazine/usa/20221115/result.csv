The company plans to deliver its first solid-state energy storage systems of up to 4 GWh or up to 400,000 homes within the next 30 months.
The company, which was founded in 2020 and based in Miami, Florida, plans to build its first U.S. manufacturing facility by 2024. The company expects to begin producing 4 GW per year in 2024 and then ramp up to 16 GW. The company is reviewing manufacturing site locations in Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona and Tennessee.
Ampricity reports that its next-generation battery technology represents 8-hour discharge, simultaneous charging and discharging, no thermal runoff, zero toxicity, 100% recyclable, fully functional in extreme cold and hot temperatures, and high energy storage efficiency with an annual retention rate of more than 96%. Its proprietary solid-state batteries include a cell capacity above 500 Ah (amp-hour) up to 3,000 Ah with an 11,000-deep discharge cycle.
The company says its home energy storage systems create greater safety and longevity, while the average residential systems use lithium-ion batteries, which pose a fire risk.  Furthermore, Amptricity’s battery lifespan is three times longer than current lithium-ion technologies, the company reports.
“Solar PV homeowners will love our solid state energy storage systems because they offer superior performance and are non-explosive, non-flammable, non-toxic, and 100% recyclable. For example, last year in Texas, homeowners suffered blackouts and fatalities from a winter storm due to the power grid’s fragility. With Amptricity’s solid state technology, homeowners can store energy for backup power—whether they have solar PVs or not,” said Damir Perge, CEO and  co-founder of Ampricity.
Residential energy storage systems of 12 kWh to 48 kWh and commercial systems from 60 kWh to 80 kWh are available for  preorder on Amptricity’s website. Commercial 1 MWh demo units are available now to select customers, with an announcement coming in the next few weeks on full commercial production.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/15/commerce-pushes-solar-antidumping-tariff-decision-to-2023/,"LEGAL,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CAMBODIA,CHINA,MALAYSIA,THAILAND,UNITED STATES,VIETNAM",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 15, 2022","Commerce pushes preliminary solar antidumping tariff decision to December 1, 2022","Over the last year, the threat of tariffs has been one of the most significant headwinds in the deployment of solar in the United States. Solar deployments ground to a near-halt as industry-wide uncertainty unfolded following the Department of Commerce’s (DOC) March 28 announcement that it would launch an investigation into alleged antidumping violations by Chinese solar manufacturers.
Goods found in violation could have tariffs as high as 50% to 250% of the cost of goods, creating an untenable amount of risk for project developers. The Energy Information Administration said about 20% of utility-scale solar projects, sized 1 MW and up, were delayed in the first half of 2022, largely due to module supply shortages related to the investigation, as well as to COVID-19 slowdowns and goods seizures from the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
The investigation was ignited by a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar requesting that the DOC review solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, announcing that it was launching an antidumping investigation into those companies. About 80% of the US supply of crystalline silicon solar modules come from the four nations. The Solar Energy Industries Association cut its forecast for solar installations in 2022 by 46% immediately following the announcement of the investigation.
In June, the Biden Administration placed a two-year moratorium tariff on solar goods, partially reopening module supply to the U.S. The executive order was celebrated by the solar industry, but damage had already been done. Even in light of the moratorium, research firm Wood Mackenzie lowered its 2022 installation projections by 6.3 GW from pre-investigation announcement forecasts.
DOC announced that the determination, originally expected to be made on November 28, 2022, has been pushed to December 1, 2022. It the final decision was also pushed back three days to May 1, 2023.
The deadline extension was requested by Auxin Solar. Auxin said Commerce needs to “fully develop and complete records of the inquiries.” The company said Southeast Asian PV suppliers have “misled lawmakers by failing to provide Commerce with all of the available information in a timely manner to quickly reach a preliminary conclusion.”
Tariffs related to AD/CVD violations have historically been high. The current AD rate for Chinese companies found in violation can reach 238.95% of the cost of goods. Dating back to 2012, solar tariffs on Chinese antidumping have ranged from less than 1% to over 100%. In 2017-18, major PV suppliers Trina Solar saw 92.5%, Risen Energy 100.79%, Canadian Solar 95.5%, JinkoSolar 95.5% tariffs imposed.
The original AD and CVD investigations on imports of crystalline silicon PV products were launched in November 2011. The US International Trade Commission determined that domestic producers were being materially hurt by the imports, and the Commerce Department in December 2012 imposed import tariffs. In 2019, the department extended both import tariff orders.
“For years, Chinese solar producers have refused to fairly price their products in the U.S. and have gone to significant lengths to continue undercutting American manufacturers and workers by establishing circumventing operations in countries not covered by those duties. Fair trade and enforcement of our trade laws are essential to rebuilding the American solar supply chain and making Solar in America again,” said Auxin Solar.
U.S. solar developers and Southeast Asian solar goods providers alike will hope the May 2023 determination will find goods not in violation. The ongoing saga highlights the fragility of global supply chains and contextualizes the U.S. push to boost domestic solar manufacturing.

https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/11/15/regulatory-approval-for-sunzia-transmission-paves-the-way-for-a-southwest-renewable-energy-corridor/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARIZONA,NEW MEXICO",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"NOVEMBER 15, 2022",Regulatory approval for SunZia Transmission paves the way for a Southwest renewable energy corridor,"Pattern Energy Group, a renewable energy developer, announced its SunZia Transmission project received the approval of the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) to build a 550-mile high voltage direct current transmission line from New Mexico to Arizona.
On Monday, the company’s Certificate of Environmental Compatibility application for the transmission project received the approval of the ACC. Separately, the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission issued two unanimous approvals of Pattern Energy’s SunZia Wind project, a 3.5 GW proposed wind project in Torrance, Lincoln and San Miguel Counties, New Mexico to provide power across the transmission line to Pinal County, Arizona.
The power transmission project is on track for construction by mid-2023 and still requires state approval from the New Mexico PRC as well as federal approval from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), expected by April 2023. It also needs approvals from local jurisdictions and stakeholder groups. According to a BLM filing, the project has involved cooperation from ten federal agencies, five state agencies and nine local authorities.
Once completed, the 525-Volt SunZia Transmission and Wind project represents the largest clean energy project in the U.S., including $8 billion in total investments, providing power from central New Mexico to more than 3 million residents of central Arizona.
“We are excited to get to work on the revolutionary SunZia Transmission line which will be the conduit for the largest wind project in U.S. history,” said Mike Garland, chief executive officer of Pattern Energy. “Once complete these projects will combine to increase the reliability of the western grid, create good jobs, and bring millions of dollars in economic benefits to Arizona and New Mexico.”
First approved in 2015, SunZia Transmission’s route was adjusted over the years as the result of planning with the Department of Defense and White Sands Missile Range. The project’s current path runs parallel to existing HVDC power line, Western Spirit Transmission line, for about 35 miles in order to minimize the environmental impact along the route for the new wind development.
The transmission line originates at a planned substation in near Corona, New Mexico, and traverses eight counties in New Mexico and Arizona before terminating at an existing substation in Casa Grande, Arizona, about 60 miles from downtown Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona.
Following publication on November 15, Pattern Energy spokesman Matt Dallas told this news publication, “SunZia will be a FERC open access transmission line so it would be available for other generators to utilize as with any other open access transmission network. Because it is an HVDC line, the costs and complexities associated with interconnecting along the route may be a challenge,” he said, while pointing to a second transmission line approved by the ACC that will run parallel to SunZia, providing an easier access point for other generation sources such as solar to interconnect with the local grid.
Southwestern Power, operated by MMR Group, is the owner of the second 500 kV high voltage-alternating current (HVAC) transmission line, El Rio Sol Transmission, a 550-mile transmission line that will run parallel to SunZia.  In July, Southwestern Power sold the SunZia transmission line to Pattern Energy in a sale transaction.
Southwest Renewable Resources
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Arizona and New Mexico rank fifth and 18th in the U.S. for solar deployments, with 5.3 GW and 4.4 GW of respective development pipelines for the next five years.
The Southwest market represents a critical area for new HVDC and AC power transmission develop to bring multiple gigawatts of clean energy into markets such as Phoenix, Tucson and Albuquerque, N.M.

Key Dates
 
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law appropriates $505 million for the development of LDES demonstrations to validate new technologies and enhance the capabilities of customers and communities to more effectively integrate grid storage.
Lower-cost LDES can increase local control of the power system, build resilience for communities, minimize power grid disruptions, and help reach President Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
The Long Duration Energy Storage Council released a report during COP27 that quantifies the impact of thermal energy storage (TES) to deliver low-cost, reliable, secure and clean net-zero heat, complemented by other LDES technologies. According to the 2022 LDES benchmark results, thermal energy storage can enable cost-efficient electrification and decarbonization of the most widely used heat applications, and the findings establish the need for thermal storage to be part of an integrated energy system that includes electrical and molecular storage in order to further accelerate a decarbonized energy system. The DOE program aims to fund demonstration projects that will move LDES forward in the United States by overcoming barriers to deployment.
